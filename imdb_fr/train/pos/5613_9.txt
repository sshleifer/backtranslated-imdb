I'm a pretty old guy, old enough to remember the taste of the Oreos and Coca-Cola, as they were 50 or 55 years ago, when all the tastes of a child were fresh. I wish I could put aside a suspended magic rack so I could taste these things today. This magic bin could have even adjusted the fabric of the food to take into account my drift, physical or otherwise, of a kind of dynamic chemistry of expectations. In the course of half a century, they should have adjusted a little, because you would have known that I would have put them aside. Eating one now would be a celebration of oneself, of the past, a story and a meaning that would almost make the reward of the middle years an expected reward. <br /> <br /> I did not have enough sense to do it with the original Coca-Cola. And I could not have invented one of those magical psychic lockers? not then. But I did something almost as good. In the seventies, I really listened to Roman Polanski. It was a strange and exotic pleasure ?? You know, films smuggled out of the Soviet bloc. Movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks. Films that make you want to live with Polish women, then decide that they would be the last to get it. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did. I took what I knew to be my favorite Polanski film and put it aside. I did not look at it I delayed until I thought I would be big enough to deserve it. Over the years, I put myself to the test, my ability to surround beauty and define it without occupying it. There are probably few Poles who have worked in this field, practicing to deserve Chopin. Work to merit the woman when I see her. Try to get the internal elements of the edges. <br /> <br /> Recently, I got something like the assurance that it was time to take that away. I already knew that the time was already over for it to work optimally because I had already seen and understood "9th Gate". <br /> <br /> If you do not know, this is an innocent man. rent a room in which the previous tenant (about whom the story is named) jumped out the window, to die later after the visit of this man (played by Polanski). What happens is that time passes and he becomes this woman. We are convinced that he is just angry. But the way we follow it is not. It simply flashes that the world is normal and the people around it are not part of a coven that distorts its reality. <br /> <br /> The story does not matter. What matters is the way in which Polanksi shapes this thing, both in the way he lives in the eye which is only edges and in the body which consists only of a confused flesh. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that could haunt me for the next 30 years. It's the idea of ​​and inside and an outside without edges ?? at all but a red wig. <br /> <br /> I do not know anyone else who can do that, this sketch which remains a sketch, this horror that remains natural. <br /> <br /> To understand the genius of this, you must know one of the greatest movies ever made; "Rear window." The genius of this film is the post-black idea that the camera shapes the world; that the viewer creates the story. What Roman does is take this film and return it. In Rear Window, the idea was that the on-screen viewer (Jimmy Stewart) is the anchor and all the rest is fiction, woven under the microscope. Here, the man on the screen is the filmmaker. We know that. We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. We know that it is true that bodies change their identity, that times change, that causality is plastic. We know that the narrator is going to kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror, on this edge that he imputes but never shows us and lets us imagine. <br /> <br /> Rating Ted - 4 of 3: Every illiterate person should experience it.
