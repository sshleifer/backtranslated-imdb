When I saw the movie, I was really shocked to see what the film of the '60s was. I know I could be wrong about some things, but it seemed like the' 60s really had an effect about the people of the time. Some people said they wanted to go back to the 60s. From what I saw, I would say yes for the excitement and not for the result. But that's my opinion.
