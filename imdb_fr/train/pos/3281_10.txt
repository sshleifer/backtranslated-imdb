Who would have thought that such an obscure film could be as captivating and touching? I'm really impressed. It's a pity that more people have not seen it. As always, I loved Hans Zimmer's score. And what beginnings director Bernard Rose! Still, I wonder if I should call it a horror movie. It could easily be argued that it is also a fantasy or a drama. Well, it does not matter, I like the interpretive potential he has. Anna's dreams (interpreted by Charlotte Burke) represent a real conflict in her life: the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lighthouse, and so on. These are the many details such as these that make the film so good for repeat visits. I hope to meet another little film as emotional and psychological as this one soon.
