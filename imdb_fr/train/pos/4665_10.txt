I first saw this film about 11 years ago, when my former university accounting professor recommended it to me. I was amazed that a 1968 film could be a coherent and hilarious representation of computer crime. Maggie Smith is beautiful and Ustinov plays the "retro hacker" perfectly. "O Nolo Mio" !!!!!
