"Against All Flags" is all that classic. It contains all the elements that the fan of the adventure could hope for and more in this one, the damsel in distress is not really in distress. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is at his best athletic, facing his opponents in defiance of the social norms of this period. Anthony Quinn completes the three best actors as ruthless captain Roc Brasiliano and turns out to be a cunning and capable enemy for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For fans of classic adventure, "Against All Flags" is a must. Although it may not be quite the same category as some of Errol Flynn's earlier work (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, for example), it's still a very fun whirlwind.
