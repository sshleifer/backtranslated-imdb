It's a very beautiful poetic story. Beautiful landscape. Beautiful partition. I went to Japan twice last year and the film gave me that typical Japanese feeling. The movement of the camera is superb, as well as that of the actors. It goes deep in your feelings without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese are very sensitive and kind and all this is very well presented on the screen here. The director plays beautifully with light colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let him enjoy a film with subtle and fine details. Once you have seen this movie, you will want to see more of the same director. It's a real movie that feels good and I can only recommend it to everyone.
