Lars von Trier's Europa is an echo worthy of the Third Man, which tells the story of an American in post-war Europe, and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, an American American who refused to join the US Army during the war arrives in Frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as that sleeper driver on the railway of the Zentropa. What he does not know is that the war continues secretly with a clandestine terrorist group called werewolves that targets American allies. Leopold is firmly opposed to the idea of ​​taking sides, but is seduced and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company. His father was a Nazi sympathizer, but he is pardoned by American colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he can help restore the German transport system. The colonel soon enlists, or forces Leopold to become a spy (without giving him the choice or the possibility to think about it) to see if the Werewolves could lead attacks on the trains. <br /> <br /> Soon, Leopold is stuck in an adventure by being mysteriously involved and black in a film noir and where everyone and everything are not what seems to be. It is incredible to see the naive Leopold take care of everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, the annoying passengers, his unhappy uncle, even the officials of the railway company who come to examine his work ethic) before he ends up falling asleep and takes it with humor and violent control. The film is unpredictable to infinity. <br /> <br /> The film was shot with elegance. It always takes place at night in winter, with a lot of snow falling. His black and white plan with color planes appearing at random. In addition, background screens display images that act contrary to the images in the front. Add to that the hypnotic narration of Max von Sydow and Europa becomes a dreamlike place out of the ordinary. <br /> <br /> It's now one of my favorite movies.
