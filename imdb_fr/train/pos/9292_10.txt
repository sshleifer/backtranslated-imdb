If you like movies, do not miss this one. If you prefer action, horror or romance, you'll wonder what's going on. Everyone here is stuck in a gangster movie. And what happens is a transcendental murder. <br /> <br /> There are few similar films. No doubt its output will be limited and hard to find. But the research will be worth it. If you want to study a medium as a potential symbol, this is a film to study. <br /> <br /> You can not watch it once. If you do, you will never see what happens. Dark City is better. Joe Vrs. The volcano is more fun. But Mad Dog Time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism. . .or at least think twice before turning again.
