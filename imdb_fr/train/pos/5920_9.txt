American icon Henry Fonda depicts the "elegant" John Howard, an aging trucker who took over his beloved big platform "Eleanor" after a long hospital stay that forced him to miss his payments. Deciding that he would like to make another perfect run, he gets out of the hospital, steals Eleanor and meets old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who needs to move her troupe of prostitutes. <BR /> <br /> Fondas' marvelous performance is a natural anchor for a film that vibrates the strings of the heart while tickling the funny bone in the most comical scenes. A superb cast including Robert Englund, a reluctant young acolyte, Susan Sarandon (who also has a co-producer credit), and Dub Taylor (a delicious ham, as always, in the most downright comical part of the photo) help tremendously. The ultimate nature of the picture and the poignant nature of the trip have an incredible weight; It's an image that, if you enter it, you'll remember it long after it's over. <br /> <br /> The promise of the open road is clearly displayed here; the countryside is beautiful. On the magnificent score of Craig Safans, it is a remarkable image in terms of aesthetics. <br /> <br /> He loses a little something in his final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than intrusions.), but he still keeps his good vibrations through the call of his central characters. <br /> <br /> Not at all the image schlock exploitation / drive-in that one could expect from the title (especially its alternative title, "The Great Smokey Roadblock"), it's a rewarding cinematic experience that I can recommend without fear. <br /> <br /> 9/10
