Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians of all time - probably the funniest. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I've ever seen and it's a must for anyone who likes to laugh !! I have watched this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it, I always have a lot of fun. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee you will have to watch it several times to hear all the jokes, because you will laugh so much - that you will miss half of it! Delirium is hilarious! <br /> <br /> Although there are a lot of funny comics, after watching this stand-up comedy, most of them will look like second-class citizens. If you've never seen it - get it, look at it - and you'll love it !! It will make you scream !!! :-)
