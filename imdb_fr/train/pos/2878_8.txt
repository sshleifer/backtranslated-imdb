For a very long time in my life, I did not like this film or this movie, but not as much as many others. I watched it recently (at a slumber party, oddly enough) and I liked it more than I had done since I was under 6 or something. I enjoy it more now, as I do with some other Disney classics I've been watching recently (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or whatever they spell). <br /> <br /> I really enjoy animation, the "Disney" sleight of hand, the humor of the mice, the emotions expressed and the story. The animation is very well done, it often seems that you are looking at the other characters. The animation also describes the background styles, including the city (which is shown twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale surprisingly well, by inserting smart plot tricks, such as the mice making the clothes and the key element (in general, I do not much like Disney movies if they do not look like the original story, but with that, I'm not too bothered, I think they've made the necessary changes to make a good Disney movie, I often do not think Disney has changed much the book in some of their films). <br /> <br /> You already know the story, Cinderella is a girl who works for her horrible mother-in-law and half-sisters. She attends a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper ... <br /> <br /> It's a movie that really deserves to be seen with other people. The immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy it, I recommend you to watch it with friends (and your immediate family, if you prefer :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who love at least a little Disney, to people who love fairy tales and to people who love mice. Enjoy! :-)
