Hey now, I can not claim to have seen all of Jesse (Jesus) Franco's movies, and there seems to be a lot of them, but it's one of the best (and stranger) of my lot. seen. I would most likely say it was in its heyday in the late sixties / early seventies and that just recently was a bit odd for me, and it takes me a long time to declare it. Anyway, it's like a big, bad dream where some parts seem to come true at different times. This woman is an actress or something like that, plays in a theater in Berlin where acts of "false" torture are performed for a grateful audience (?!) And she seems to have this problem with the dream. The capture of what is real and what is not in this film is apparently the real product that is perfectly clean and the product of the dream is not. She seems to exist in a state of déjà vu. I will not say it makes a lot of sense, but it's pretty wild, strange and fun. Photos from Berlin give this place the appearance of a solitary and terrifying place, which adds to the atmosphere. The end is extremely abrupt, the film ends and the band became black. Needless to say, everything was over by then. My copy belonged to the Anchor Bay Euro-Trash Collection and I say: give me more Euro-Trash, I can not get enough of this shit. But it's GOOD shit.
