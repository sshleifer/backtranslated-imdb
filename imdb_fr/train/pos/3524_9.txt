To Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago when I was not yet a jazz lover. An exhibition will be held until the end of June in the brand new QUAI BRANLY MUSEUM in Paris, called THE CENTURY OF THE JAZZ, not to be missed, with for special entertainment NEW extracts from jazz movies, including the famous PHANTOM LADY battery sequence. I saw Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all their appearances in the film, and I can confirm the following: 1. Elisha Cook Jr was dubbed in the film. This was a step forward, as in most of his other appearances he was killed (mostly in Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP). 2. Krupa probably nicknamed Cook in PL. I could recognize his style, since he was already out of the tam-tam used (and abused) early in his career - especially in the sequence SING, SING, SING of the 1937 Hollywood HOTEL - and finally got everything that was possible. call in French "the snare drum". 3. The sequence of PL, at least as the museum shows, is not censored. Charry carasso, Paris, France
