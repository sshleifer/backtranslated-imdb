Besides the fact that my list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) the rest ... this movie is actually better than the book (and the miniseries of television although this is a tour de force , considering the director). The stileless filming style, comedy and music (Kubrick's all-time leading skill) make it THE masterpiece of horror. A few years ago, I watched the miniseries on TV and I loved the story. I was hoping for that when I got it. THAT IT WAS WHITE !!! It's a lot better than I ever imagined. It starts slowly (trademark Kubrick) and has a lot of idle time that creates suspense. The intro scene is a classic, I watched it about 20 times, just for the shearing atmosphere it induces for the whole movie. In addition, the film does not offer much gore (it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless) a trend that I hate in the horror films of recent days. Just look!
