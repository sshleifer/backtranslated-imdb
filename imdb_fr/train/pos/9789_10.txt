The story is told in a fluid way. There are no interruptions. Flashbacks are perfectly integrated into the present. The cast was superb. The young Ya'ara looked a lot like Ya'ara at that age. His representation of a blind person was made convincingly. Director Daniel Syrkin has done a remarkable job of getting the different actors to work together in this story. Cinematography is very good. You feel like with Ya'ara and Talia walking towards the ocean to the edge of the cliff. English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very closely. It is interesting to note that even though "Out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin", both names are very relevant to the story.
