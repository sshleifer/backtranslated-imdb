In my opinion, the best movie of all time. I like when people ask me what this movie is about. I usually smile and say "life". They shrug their shoulders and probably never give them any thought The fact that everyone, from all walks of life, can identify with a part of this film makes it even more amazing. It's really a must for everyone.
