Imagine turning off the lights on your isolated farm on a cold night and then going to bed. There is no need to lock the doors. The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. Some time after midnight, an extinct car lights up a few inches from the driveway. Moments later, an intruder sends a flashlight into your dark living room. <br /> <br /> What makes this picture so scary is the scenery: an isolated farmhouse ... at night. Inspired by the best-selling Truman Capote and a lighting comparable to that of the best black movies of the 1940s, "In Cold Blood" tells a terrifying story, especially in this first law, because the plot takes place mainly at night and in a country flooded with rain roads. It's the stuff of nightmares. But it's not a dream. The events really happened in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two crooks in the head full of illusions kill a family in Kansas, looking for a reserve of money that does not exist. The director Richard Brooks used the actual places where the real events took place, even the farmhouse ... and its interior! It's a memorable and haunting film. <br /> <br /> The two main actors are very similar to the two killers of real life. Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, small and stocky, who dreams of finding the buried treasure of Cortez. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, a sweet-skinned crook with an American smile. <br /> <br /> After their killing, the duo goes to Mexico. Things go wrong there, so they come back to the United States, steal cars, hitchhike, and are generally miserable when they move from place to place. But this is the life of a fool, and the two outlaws soon regret their actions. The last twenty minutes of the film are hypnotic, as the rain falls, the rope tightens and all we hear is the beating of a beating heart. <br /> <br /> Even with his somewhat banal intermediary act, "In Cold Blood". Steps into fascinating details a real story that mesmerizes again, almost half a century later. It's this setting that does it. Do you think that people in rural Kansas always leave their doors open ... at night?
