Christopher Lloyd is funny and very credible as "Al the head angel". This film is much better than the first one, but it has great special effects that the first one did not have as much as a much better plot and writing. <br /> <br /> Okay - it was written for children, but adults have as much fun as children. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but it's not a taxi meeting. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is good and even seems to be very human in his emotions, while showing true acting skills for a change, a nice change. <br /> <br /> Look at it at least once - it's worth it.
