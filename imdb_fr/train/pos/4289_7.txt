I have to be 100% honest with you, the other IMDb users. I wanted to see this movie for a long time only because of the poster. Charlotte Gainsbourg does not she look extremely sexy and charming with such a smile? I'm in love with this woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This film should meet the expectations of those who love all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with another IMDb user who says the movie is overrated; I must admit that "Take my hand" has a lot of flaws. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the movie is the lack of chemistry on the screen between the main characters. There is not a scene before the climax that shows the main characters sharing a "romance" moment or even a hint that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only scene where the two share a moment is extremely embarrassing (when both are on the couch) and does not help the audience to understand a possible love interest. I did not buy the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> The film nonetheless presents very entertaining moments and presents solid dialogues that support such an ingenuous premise. I mean naively that it would be very difficult to execute such a joke on a 43-year-old man these days. <br /> <br /> I understand it's a movie and that's why I accept it as a fun situation. Plus, the humor is versatile. There are moments involving S & M, fun lines with Chabah's best friend, lesbian references, fun situations involving the women of the family, and more. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaionsbourg's performance is outstanding and she is by far the reason to watch the movie. She is funny, sexy, very fine and thin, and demonstrates that she is a versatile and talented actress, capable of performing a comical and dramatic performance in all its splendor. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is an excellent actor and gives a decent performance. I think secondary actors do what they can. <br /> <br /> The score, the artistic direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic aspect to the film. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be happy after the end credits. This is a good example of feeling good in the cinema.
