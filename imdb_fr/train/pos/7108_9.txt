Do you like to solve mysteries? Do you like complex storytelling? This is for you. Brilliant and intelligent film by Francis Leclerc (son of the legendary Franco-Canadian singer Felix Leclerc). Leclerc, assisted by Roy Dupuis, who is dythirambic in the lead role. <br /> <br /> The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, a veterinarian in his forties who has just woken up after a coma. be unplugged by an unknown person. Turner finds it hard to remember who hit him as he put an end to the suffering of a deer on the road. Throughout his struggle, he has a strange behavior and it seems that something has prevailed. <br /> <br /> A film not sinister, but very mysterious and well played. I have a hypothesis about the end (I think the Indian is at the origin of the accident), but this end was open to all explanations. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend 9.5 / 10
