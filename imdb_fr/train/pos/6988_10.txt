This is a movie that will take time to get out of your head once you've seen it. The dialogues are almost perfect, which could be expected as it was adapted from a play. The actors simply give the best of themselves, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure happiness! <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal is totally credible in her role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde (but not so stupid) that provides as much pleasure to the eyes as to the ears, Jean-Paul Rouve provides an excellent approximation of the total jerk (and proud to be such), and Marina Fois is the dumb friend who always blunder when we least expect it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Bernard Rapp and associates for adapting this excellent piece, and the best for future productions! <br /> <br /> I wish there were more in the current production. If you liked, you will probably also enjoy: "A family look" and "Kitchen and outbuildings". Both were written and played by the Bacri / Jaoui couple.
