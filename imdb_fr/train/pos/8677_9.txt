This film is remembered very well when Tom and Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things are idyllic for a while but, as you would expect, things are going badly. The most memorable moment was probably the endless fight between a pipe, a frying pan and a baseball bat in which the two more Butch the dog engage at the beginning and at the end of the short film. I liked one of them and you should try to catch it on Cartoon Network.
