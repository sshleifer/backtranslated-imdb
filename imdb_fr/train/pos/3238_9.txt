The Finnish version of Robert Altman's "Short Cuts", located in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, disappointment and disillusionment, despair and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to inspire the love of her colleagues: she gives off a joy overflowing with love and life. The other episode shows a dying old man in the hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. The way the elderly couple struggles against the humiliating practices of the hospital and its loneliness contrasts with the "routines" of the hospital team (despite the signs of occasional empathy) is particularly striking. Compared to Altman's classic, this film may be less professional, but it's really a great work of art.
