I've seen almost every Cynthia Rothrock film, and for me it's the funniest. It reminds me of Jackie Chan's first films. Admittedly, Mrs. Rothrock may not be the greatest actress, but she is very good at looking both as a martial artist and as a very cute young woman. This film, although probably not the best of all his films, was the most entertaining.
