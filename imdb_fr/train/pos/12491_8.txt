This movie was very good. If you like to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The acting was very good even though I thought the actress playing Julie could have had more emotion behind her lines. Allan was very good and I found incredible cinematography. I was on the edge of my seat all the time while my friends panicked and screamed. It was a complete success in my opinion and should have gone to the big screen. I give him two inches! I would certainly say that if you have not seen it before, rent it. If you've seen it and you do not like it, go watch it again, because some parts are completely unreal. I also liked the way a lot of movies were shot around and on the campus of my school.
