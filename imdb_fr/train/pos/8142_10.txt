Chances are you think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it. But if, by chance, you look at it for a second, a third, a fourth and a fifth time (I'm good in the hundreds now), you'll end up spitting a line here and there and making yourself crack! In fact, my friends and I have organized Black Hat Fear evenings to attract more friends, "as they say, with the riots".
