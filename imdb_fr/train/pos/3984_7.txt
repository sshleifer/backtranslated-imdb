As part of the celebration of the release of Casino Royale, this film was presented with the new Bond movie, presented by director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost extinguished it because I was a bit boring, but I'm glad I persevered. By and large, May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who sees almost no one and has not had a boyfriend for years. Her daughter says she might want to marry her new boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After meeting each other just days, May and Darren have a secret affair. And at his age, with a thirty and the new Bond ?! Anyway, they obviously want to keep the secret, but May has regrets and wonders if Helen will know. When she does, Darren has less hassle than May. In fact, Helen asks her for permission to hit her. Also featuring Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Oliver Ford Davies as Johnny English as Bruce. Very well!
