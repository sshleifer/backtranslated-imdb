A rather mean but courageous film by Mrs. Hawn to promote this vehicle as an executive producer and as a star vehicle. Even if she ends up justifying herself, she is ready to present herself as the stunned bimbo. How many other actresses in List A have been procrastinating since their movie? Not a lot. Does that mean that the female ass can not be funny? Goldie surpasses other actresses because she has kept a character on the screen and embarked on projects that others will not do. Sandra Bullock goes there from time to time, for example, Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman will never get away with it. A wonderful performer. Glad to see some of my favorite actors, Chris Sarandon and Cliff DeYoung, among others.
