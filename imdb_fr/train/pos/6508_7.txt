I grew up watching Scooby and I have always been a fan. This caricature is moving away from the old routine that can become boring for the viewers. The Crooks in Mask routine is getting older and this caricature is a change from that. I am not convinced that this is not intended to replace the Scooby gang. It's just a break from the same crime scene for viewers and writers. The caricature is centered on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherits a large sum of money and uses this money to thwart the plans of conquest of the world of a mad scientist and his henchmen. Small tributes from the gang and the gang themselves are presented from time to time. If you are a fan of Scooby-Doo, you can always appreciate the bond that unites a boy and his talking dog, as well as the jokes that go with it. Just enjoy the cartoon and support the creators / writers and producers so it's not the latest Scooby cartoon.
