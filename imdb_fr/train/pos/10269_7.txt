In the spirit of the classic "The Sting", this film hits where it really hurts ... to the heart! A first psychiatrist, a true psychiatrist, eager for adventure, meets the dirtiest and most rotten in the world. The vulnerable doctor falls in love with the career malefactor and asks to be involved in his operation. Although the film moves a little "slowly", its apogee and its end are sensational! You will particularly appreciate the fact that the doctor "forgives himself"!
