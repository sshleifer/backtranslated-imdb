It was the 101st film by Eddie Robinson and his latest film. He died of cancer nine days after the end of the shoot. Which makes his key scene in the film all the more poignant. <br /> <br /> Although some styles of hair and clothes are a bit dated (note also the video game presented in the film), but the subject of the film is almost timeless. Heston said he had wanted to do the film for some time because he firmly believed in the dangers of overcrowding. <br /> <br /> Several factors make this film a classic. The story is solid. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, especially the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with pretty performances also Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely perfect. The medley of Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky, associated with the pastoral visual elements, gives rise to truly moving scenes. It was the icing on the cake of the movie. <br /> <br /> And the theme (or the "point") of the film is important. Yes, it is a film about overpopulation, but on a more important note, it is an edifying account of what can go wrong with the management of the Earth by man. It is in the subtext that you find the real message of the film. Pay attention to what Sol says about the "old time" of the past (which is our present), and note how bad Thorn is able to understand what Sol says. <br /> <br /> This film is one of my top sci-fi movies of all time.
