This film received very bad reviews, but as it was offbeat and critics do not usually "receive" offbeat movies, I thought I'd try. Unfortunately, they were largely right in this case. <br /> <br /> The film simply has an awkward impression, and it is also very discouraging. The kind of feeling impossible to describe, but it's not good. To make matters worse, the script is a dull, goal-less thing that is only vaguely interesting. <br /> <br /> Thurman's immense talent drifts into this mess without creating an impact. Hurt and Bracco try in vain to add something to the film with an enthusiastic performance but there is nothing in the script. It might have been less embarrassing for them if they had simply chosen to go astray and end Thurman. <br /> <br /> The "esteemed" film critics did not mention the fact that the film is actually pretty funny. Whether it's moments of precise satire or scandalously bizarre moments, for example when the cowgirls in question hunt Blanchize their ranch with the smell of their funds ... huge ... in front of ... <br /> <br /> Because chortles are ubiquitous, even though I would not recommend this movie, there's plenty to do and watching Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is worth something different.
