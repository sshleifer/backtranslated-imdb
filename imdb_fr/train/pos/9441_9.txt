The directors of this beautiful movie did a remarkable job of getting involved in the characters, as they suffered this horrible ordeal. The horrible scene in the woods was so beautifully made that you forget that these men were only actors, playing roles. Never more immersed in a film than this one. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight have never been so good on screen, as have the excellent performances of Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox and Bill McKinney, and although he has appeared briefly, James Dickey, the man who wrote the book on which the film is based, as sheriff of Aintry. It's a little disturbing, and children, of course, should be protected, but it's a big dramatic film.
