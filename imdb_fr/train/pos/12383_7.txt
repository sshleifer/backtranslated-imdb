Christina Raines plays a pretty model in New York looking for a new apartment and starts meeting strange neighbors and revealing a secret about the building. It climbs slowly to a climax before the end of the movie. This film contains all sorts of elements of the Catholic Church's plot against the devil, the gates of hell, strange rituals, a growing conspiracy and finally a host of talented actors and actresses. that flood the film. We have Ava Gardner, Mercury Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum and who can forget John Carradine as the old priest. Many of these actors get involved, especially Burgess Meredith who plays comedy / insane as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat. Meredith is memorable, as are Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some performers have almost nothing to do, like Jose Ferrer in a thankless role, even if it's a simple cameo. The Sentinel is an excellent horror movie that contains many psychological elements and really terrifying scenes. The final scene is disgusting and yet frightening. I find something wrong with the free sex and violence in the movie, especially all over the scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was it really necessary? I do not think so. The film father / daughter was also a little heavy, but overall, the film works and has a winning rhythm. The director Michael Winner does a neat job and creates tension and scary movie moments. The scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
