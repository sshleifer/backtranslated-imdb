This is the best of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 43 films; his most successful at least. He was one of the principal directors of New Germany after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Hanna Schygulla was beautiful, while the cold calculated that Maria Bruan, who had lost her husband in the war, had found her after she took a US soldier as a lover, lost him again after he went to jail for her and found him at the end. His day and a half of marriage before his disappearance was longer than their time at the end. <br /> <br /> That's the life. Things come and go, and you do your best. You can give up or adjust your thinking to survive. Although Maria adjusted her thinking and did what she was forced to do, she never stopped loving Hermann, which makes it a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Excellent drama.
