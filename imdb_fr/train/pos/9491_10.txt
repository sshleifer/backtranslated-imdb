Henri Verneuil's film is perhaps not as famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor or JFK, but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre. The action takes place in a fictitious Western state where the fictitious president was killed. After several years of investigation, a government commission decides that the president was killed by one armed man. But one man - Volney Attorney, played by Yves Montand - thinks there is something more to explore and the film begins. This film does not deal with some exact theories, but it encompasses the entire structure of the relationship between government and society in today's world. Such a film could only be made in the 1970s but it will never lose its relevance. In addition, the accuracy of the oracles is even a little scary. 10 of 10.
