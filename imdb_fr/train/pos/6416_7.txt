Men of Honor represents Cuba Gooding Jr., the real Navy diver Carl Brashear, who challenged a man's navy and became the first diver of the African-American navy. Sometimes at his side and sometimes at his opponent, there was a man that Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Sunday in many ways pushed, aggravated and helped Carl to become the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His performance here is as liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington in The Hurricane. Through each scene, one can see his passion, his motivation and his obstinacy to realize his dream. We can see the struggle inside him as he embarks to make his father proud. I also loved the way the director created and caused a lot of tension in some of the key scuba scenes. Brashear's encounter with a submarine during a rescue mission is overwhelming and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only fault I could see should be in the cast. The characters from Cuba and DeNiro are very complex and exciting to watch. Which makes you a little sad when they have to face such support characters in two dimensions. The bad Lieutenant Cmdr. Hanks, the Sunday wife (Charlize Theron), the eccentric colonel of the diving school (Hal Holbrook) and the lover interest of Cuba are the characters I found shallow. What could have made these characters more substantial and more effective is a little more time to develop them. Why was that colonel still in his tower? How is it that Sunday's wife is so bitter and always drunk? <br /> <br /> We must ask another curious question. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean, if this film tells the story of this man, would not his marriage be an important event? Maybe it's just me. Men of Honor, however, is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit envelops. This movie will inspire and make you feel for this man's struggle. Which, I believe, is the reason why this powerful story was told. I take my hat, Carl Brashear. I really admire your strength. <br /> <br />
