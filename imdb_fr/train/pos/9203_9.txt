This is one of Dev Anand's films that has given both brilliant and distinct films to the Hindi film industries such as Jewel Thief and Guide. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), the plot is simple: a brother is looking for his lost sister. Sister joined the hippies who smoke pot and sing Hare Rama hare Krishna. Yet, the film only describes some of the world's most dramatic events of the 1970s. The hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom, escape from duty, family and everything else which is new, like the Eastern religion (new for whites). They were handled perfectly. Zeenat gave the best and Dev, as usual, was outstanding. The songs are the best used (unlike what is used to have songs) in this movie. They have not been spoiled. A perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Every word of the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic but it is not the essence of the film. Overall, Devji who believes in making different films has managed to show what he wanted to show here. A must see to discover the hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of the 70s.
