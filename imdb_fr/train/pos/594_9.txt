13 days before the glory tells the traditional story with sympathy for the Mexican point of view. The major problem in this movie was that, although cowboy actor James Arness played the role of Jim Bowie convincingly, the rest of the cast, Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston ), were too old. <Br /> <br /> Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez of Santa Anna with grace and dignity towards the professional soldier who, after all, won the battle. The scene in which he reprimands his officers for failing to mount a guard and preventing a person from being sorted is a reality that the writers did not understand. Not to watch is a major fault in the army. Santa Anna was in his prerogatives to be angry. Raul Julia beautifully wore a mediocre script across the stage. <br /> <br /> Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be recognized for her courage. However, Kathleen York could have been reminded that since the Dickinsons came from Pennsylvania, they probably did not sound very Southron.
