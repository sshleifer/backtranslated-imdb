Hitchcock was of the opinion that the public was not really interested in what put the protagonists at risk - but only because they were in danger and needed to escape. <br /> <br /> This film proves that Hitchcock was not 100% accurate. The police think that Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime, when she is clearly not guilty. Trevor Howard decides that their best course of action is to run for it. Thus, in the body of the film, our charismatic couple avoids trains, buses and coaches, jumping through the rocks at the top of a waterfall, crossing the roofs of the shipyards. <br /> <br /> but I could not get out of my mind that everything was useless. They should have stayed there. <br /> <br /> In other words, the MacGuffin was not powerful enough.
