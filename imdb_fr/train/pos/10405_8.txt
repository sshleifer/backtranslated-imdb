This film was one of my favorite films of my childhood and I must say that, unlike some other movies that I loved at that time, The Thief of Bagdad kept its quality while I was growing up. This film should not only be watched by children, it can also be watched by adults. The only drawback is that it is impossible to see beyond "bad" effects (compared to current effects) as one could do when one was a child. I did not remember anything of these effects; of course, it had been about ten years since I had seen this movie when I was about eleven. Who looks after the effects? We are only looking for good stories and entertainment and that's exactly what this movie is about. In my mind, this film is one of the first great adventure movies of the twentieth century. As I think about it, I think Indiana Jones's movies are very similar to this movie. There is comedy, romance and adventure at the same time, creating a wonderful mix that will captivate you from start to finish. Although the film is old and the music and style of the movies are clearly not modern, they do not get dusty and old. All this is mainly due to the great story, the good staging and the good actor performances of the actors. In this department, Sabu (as Abou) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) stand out, providing mostly comic and scary elements of the film. Great movie and although an "old", certainly a "goldie". I hope someone has the brains and the courage to publish this one on DVD someday. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
