It's a wonderful movie that gives the 1950s a beautiful look. Kim Novak is intriguing and captivating as a witch of modern times, with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All performances are fantastic, from Jack Lemmon to Nicky to Ernie Kovacs as a Magic in Mexico writer who works on Magic in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as Aunt and Aunt Queenie. And then there is the cat - I do not know how many witches (besides me) have named a Pyewacket cat but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart does not seem out of place, but as much as his character is out of reach in this strange underworld of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And there is an ideal happy end in romantic, which we believe because the films of this vintage have a happy ending. Gillian and Shep are certainly as likely to be happy as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen (another great movie)
