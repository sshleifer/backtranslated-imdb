Cypher is a film that deserves a visit because it's not a trivial sci-fi movie. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro vision of what is happening. The closeup camera view is the way the director keeps the illusory plot. The science fiction aspect of the film is secondary to the plot of the film. The technology used in the film is not very impressive, however, the director makes good use of it. <br /> <br /> The development of the character is intentionally superficial. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself in the world of espionage. It is up to the public to understand their enigmatic character and it is the enigma that keeps the public interest to the end.
