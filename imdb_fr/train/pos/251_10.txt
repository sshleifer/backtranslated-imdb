"If Ned Kelly was born later, he would probably have won a Victoria Cross at Gallipolli." Such was Ned's bravery. <br /> <br /> In Australia, especially in Victoria, the name of Ned Kelly can be said and immediately recognized. In Greta, he is still a hero, the life of the city of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield, they still have not forgotten that the three policemen he "murdered" were from there -low. <br /> Many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. From the old Melbourne prison where he was hanged, to the post office he held at Jerilderie. A cell in which he was previously detained in Greta is exposed in Benella. The site of the Ann Jones Hotel, the train station and even the newspapers where he was captured at Glenrowan can be visited. <br /> <br /> Testimony of all the events of the film (with the exception of his love interest) are found everywhere in Victoria, in police records and even in the Sash, that Ned was rewarded for having rescued Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is wrong, and what is left out would further justify Neds' actions. The horse that 'Ned' flew 'was stolen by Wild Wright (the man with whom Ned boxing after being released from prison). Ned was already in jail when the horse was reported stolen so he could not have stolen it. <br /> <br /> The Jerilderie letter is more than what was said before. It's not a self-justification, it's Ned's biography, a glimpse of what he represents and what he protects. Go ahead, read it, watch the movie, and then decide what Ned was defending.
