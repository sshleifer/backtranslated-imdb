I found this movie a lot of fun for little kids that is more adult oriented with lots of jokes and humor that they would not understand. A few things are inappropriate for children, but just a few. In other words, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) has made so many jokes that it's impossible to follow all of them, ranging from sexual to cultural, to Hollywood insiders or racial. <br /> The film is very colorful and is superb on DVD. The little girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairstyles of the little people here are fun to watch. The voice of Anthony Hopkins is nice too, so having his story elevates the film. Her nursery rhymes are fun to hear. <br /> <br /> I saw that in the theater, even if it was "right", but on DVD it was a lot better. I saw three times and it improved every time.
