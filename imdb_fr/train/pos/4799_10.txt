Perhaps more than many movies, this one is not for everyone. For some, the idea of ​​slowing down, thinking and allowing things to happen at their own pace is a good description of their personal hell. For others, an approach like this speaks to a deep part of themselves that they know to exist, to a part with which they aspire to contact. <br /> <br /> I guess it depends on where I am in my current life, but I count myself in the latter group's camp. I found the meditative rhythm of this almost hypnotic film, gently guiding me into an almost mythological realm. It is indeed a travel story, a rich representation of the distance that many of us have to travel if we want to close the loop at the end of our days. <br /> <br /> A bit like that was written from the presentation of Alvin by Mr. Farnsworth Straight, even though I'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of the perplexed sadness and the wise innocence he conjured us. Knowing now that he was actually dealing with his own mortality while sitting on the seat of this tractor, I would have liked to have the opportunity to spend time with him before he left. I hope he had a glimpse of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people, not only to "act" but to have shared his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty. <br /> <br /> Given the realities of production In economics, I'm not sure that Mr. Lynch was fully rewarded for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly . Apart from film production, however, I understand that there are few areas of modern life where the phrase "time is money" is also descriptive. Going to the bottom of our hearts is not an adventure that can be precipitated, and to his credit, Mr. Lynch seems to have understood that he was not just telling a story, he was inviting his viewers to spend time with their own mortality . No simple task, that. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the power of the film to present a precious part of yourself, you could do worse than spend a few hours with The Straight Story. And then, give yourself time for the next moment while listening to her echoes in the wee hours of the night.
