Showcasing some of Hammer's stars, this highly effective piece of British horror revolves around a house and the fate of its previous tenants, whose stories are all told to a Scottish yard inspector search for a missing actor. <br /> <br /> The story number one, which is probably the least impressive of the four, deals with a writer and his wife who have just moved into the house and plan to stay there for a few moments. can write one of his horror novels. He creates a demented character named Dominic, who is a strange strangler, and soon finds himself angry when he begins to see this monstrous man wherever he goes. After his wife convinced him to seek psychiatric help, a sub-plot is introduced which, frankly, did not really work for me. I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The next story (the best in my opinion) features the wonderful Peter Cushing in the role of Philip Grayson, a man who moved into his home for retirement and goes to a museum of wax nearby (which deals with the macabre) where he is very surprised to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past. Soon thereafter, an old friend (who also has a story with this woman) is in town for business and visits him. The two men are about to wake up abruptly and quickly discover that this woman had much more to offer than what comes before her eyes. <br /> <br /> The three-star story is one of my favorites ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After moving into the house with her special daughter, Jane, the nanny he hires becomes terribly suspicious of how Reid represses her daughter. Well, come find out ... if she knew what Lee had done, she would certainly have understood. <br /> <br /> The last story is a rather light vampire tale that stars John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After buying a cape from a mysterious merchant, actor Paul Henderson is becoming the very creature he has described repeatedly in his career. <br /> <br /> Overall, the pace and direction were very good, as was the performance. There were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complete the mood. This one is a guardian, and is highly recommended.
