This film and its sequel, Barry Mckenzie, has his own. These are the two greatest comedies ever produced. A beautiful story that a young Australian goes to England to claim his inheritance and meet his companions, who are just as adorable and innocent as him. <br /> <br /> It's a block full of beautiful words, Where could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that it's as dry as a dead donger? great characters, leading actors, and there are beautiful sheilas and more consumption, then three other films together. Top notch. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you've ever heard, and that are full of celebrities. My two favorite movies of all time, I watch them at least once a fortnight.
