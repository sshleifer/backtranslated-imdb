Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as a television host for late-night horror movies, and when the character proved incredibly popular, she suddenly found herself doing everything from commercials to for beer at The Tonight Show spots with Johnny Carson. It reached the peak of its popularity in the late 1980s and the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK is the result. <br /> <br /> The plot is fly. Elvira, horror movie hostess for television, dreams of success in Las Vegas. On the death of her great aunt, she goes to New England in the hope that the estate will provide enough money to support a show; she is disappointed that she inherited a ruined house, a poodle and an old book. It turns out that the city is puritanical beyond description, and it provokes righteous indignation everywhere. It also happens that his great-uncle is secretly a devilish warlock and very determined to get his hands on "the old book". Add a few teenagers, a stud muffin and a hateful woman with fakes and that's it. Nobody would accuse him of being a cinematographic masterpiece, and that drags from time to time. But Cassandra Peterson shows an extraordinary flair from start to finish: agitated, sexy and mixing discrete humor and bursts of acerbic comedy, she dances through the film as a ringmaster in a circus of cheeky and often mocking jokes. From a FLASHDANCE disaster to the madness of witchcraft, she is never less than madly entertaining. It's very funny, and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense. Will Elvira defeat her uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to give anything, so let's just say that you will have a lot of fun discovering. <br /> <br /> The quality of DVDs is acceptable and there are not many bonuses, but if you're in the mood for something stupid, this one will respond to the urge. And if you have never seen a tassle turn, you will be filled. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon review
