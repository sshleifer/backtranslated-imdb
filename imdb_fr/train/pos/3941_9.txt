Young Mr. Lincoln is the first film of the collaboration director / star of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember that years ago, Fonda said that as a young actor, he was naturally nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and was afraid he would not take up the challenge. <br /> <br /> John Ford before the shoot started to make him comfortable by saying he was not going to play the big emancipator, but simply a Jack-Leg advocate on the Prairies. That being settled, Fonda directs the casting that John Ford realizes in a classic film. <br /> <br /> This is not a biographical film of Lincoln. This had already been the case at the time of the sound with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey was playing the award-winning coin of the Pulitzer Prize of Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey is still the definitive Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda did not play the role of the Grand Emancipator, just a lawyer from a small town in Illinois. The film covers about 10 years of Lincoln's debut. He is seen working in a general store, getting legal books from a family of immigrant pioneers, and finding his way back in history. And his romantic relationship with Ann Rutledge and his untimely death leaving Lincoln a melancholy being. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to about 10 years and Lincoln is now a practicing lawyer who is starting to be warned. He has spent a few terms in the legislature, but he is back in the private sector, not really sure that politics is good for him. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the action takes place. The two sons of this family, he had received the law books from a long distance while being accused of murder. He proposes to defend them. And not an ordinary murder but that of a deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> The trial itself is a fiction, but the tactics used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, who embodied the two sons, is based on a real case that Lincoln defended. I will not say more. <br /> <br /> In addition to the performances, Young M. Lincoln's strength lies in the way John Ford captures the ambience, atmosphere and setting of a small Illinois prairie town. July party. It's almost like watching a news movie. And it was the atmosphere of the country itself, young, dynamic and growing. <br /> <br /> John Ford film fans will recognize two musical themes repeated in the following films. During the early romantic interlude with Fonda and Pauline Moore who played Ann Rutledge, the music in the background is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And during a dance, Fonda and Marjorie Weaver's Lovely Susan Brown melody playing Mary Todd is identical to the one Fonda danced with Cathy Downs in My Darling Clementine during the dance for the construction of a church in Tombstone . Lincoln will forever remain a favorite subject for biographers and playwrights for two reasons, I believe. The first is that he is the living incarnation of our own American mythology of people passing from the lowest to the highest of power through their own efforts. In fact, Young Mr. Lincoln very graphically shows the origin of Lincoln. And secondly, the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made the singularly good and moral decision to free slaves during the civil war, although for political reasons required. His assassination ensured his place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition to Fonda and others, I mentioned that praise should also be given to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the two thugs in the city, Kohler being the victim of the murder and Bond the chief accuser. Also Donald Meek as attorney and Alice Brady in what turned out to be his last film as a pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very nice performance of Spencer Charters, specialist of rustic characters as a judge. <br /> <br /> For a film that recounts the drama and romance of his time, you can not do better than Young Mr Lincoln.
