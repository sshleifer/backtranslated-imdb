Like his first masterpiece, "The Elephant Man," Lynch proves to his critics that he can tell a straight story without losing his artistic touch. This is the true story of a retired senior man (expertly interpreted by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to drive a tractor in several states to make a final visit to his ex-brother who is now on the threshold of death. A beautiful score from Badalamenti, an exquisite photograph of rural life (I love these aerial shots of cornfields) and a devious director's hand that reveals the basic humanity of man, here is a beautiful film from the slice of life. Its extremely slow pace can put some viewers to sleep, but those who stay along the way will be well rewarded in the end.
