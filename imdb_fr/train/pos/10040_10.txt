For me personally, this movie is part of my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proven time and again that he is a great storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and the two Terminators, it is clear that he was a brilliant and confident director of action and science fiction. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the movie. But Titanic is so different from his other shots. The film is exceptionally moving and gives way to surprises, intrigue development and interesting character developments in a story everyone knows. The story of the famous traveler sinking on her maiden voyage is a legend; the challenge was for Cameron to make a true, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful: Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet and Rose became superstars overnight after the release of this film. In most movies, I'm bored when the secondary characters do not give much to do, but in this film more resolute because an older Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells his story, it is quickly obvious that it is the story of Rose and Jack alone, no one else. On the emotional level, it is quite satisfying and leaves no dry eye in a theater or at home. The music has become iconic and legendary. This is the best soundtrack of the composer James Horner and evokes so much of the film and the audience. The song after so much time has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon that it is and this film. The only problem, the usual problem of James Cameron, is the dialogue, which is memorable, but in a deplorable way, as it's how old it is, but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that will take you on an unforgettable journey. My heart is wrong with this one.
