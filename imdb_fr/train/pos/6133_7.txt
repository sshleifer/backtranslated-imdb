Easily the biggest low budget horror movie of all time. I saw this movie for the first time around the age of nine and I must say that it scared me a lot. Now that I'm all grown up, I see this movie for what it really is ... a job of genius. Everyone, or at least all tastes, dreamed of seeing a snowman kill people, even if they do not admit it. I've always found something really scary about snowmen, so naturally, for a horror fanatic like me, this movie was a dream come true. Some people say that this movie is silly, or otherwise devoid of any intelligence ... it's a movie about a serial killer snowman, what did you expect? Anyone who has given this movie a low score is obviously too stuck to sit down and have a good laugh at the stupid one-liners and cheap gore line. I love this film for what it is, a comedy and as long as the film industry will not wake up and only make a serious horror movie about a killer snowman (which seems impossible, unfortunately), I will always keep this big piece of independent horror near my heart. .
