One of the little-known jewels of the 1980s, Scenes ... presents an extremely sharp satire and remarkable performances by Arnetia Walker (how did she not have a ton of roles after that?) And Wallace Shawn. It is a delightful preparation for the class war and the people who participate in it. The writing is hilarious and the characters, even if they are not subtle, are nuanced. And, sorry, but Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese "gang" a guy extorting one of the other characters) have not been labeled "sociological value," as another article suggests. The value here lies in what the movie makes fun of and in the bubbly and nasty way it has. I found it creative, fun and idiosyncratic.
