Larry Fessenden has been beaten by most comments on this forum. Obviously, the worst mistake is the marketing of the film and the way the DVD could have been targeted. Obviously, this is not a real horror movie, at least not for people who expect everything to be bloody and immediately satisfying. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is essentially a film that seems to be told by the spirit of the young Miles. Things that are not easily understood by children tend to stay in their minds and dominate their fears and the threatening world they can not understand. It's obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no idea what's going on in her son's mind. It's also a story of alienation. It is clear that the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to live in a different world. <br /> <br /> Miles' fears are reaching a crisis point over the weekend in the country. . This part of the state of New York, with its winter landscape, its bare trees, ravages the imagination of the little boy. It does not help that he meets a strange character in the city, it creates even more doubts in his young mind. In the end, Miles's world collapses on him and he can do nothing, even evoking the Wendigo spirit. <br /> <br /> The film is well paced and played. Patricia Clarkson is great, no matter what movie she's in. Jake Weber is perfect as a distant father who has the opportunity to get close to a son he does not understand. Erik Per Sullivan, as Miles, transmits the inner turmoil in him. I thought it was extremely effective since the whole movie belongs to Miles and what's going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as a threat to Otis, a man who wants the world for what he did. <br /> <br /> Instead of belittling this film, future viewers should approach it with an open mind.
