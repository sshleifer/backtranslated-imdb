Mildo Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold is portrayed by Ben Richards, a man wrongly convicted who is forced to play "The Running Man", a deadly televised game show where people have to keep moving forward to try to escape brutally dead at the hands of the 'Stalkers'. Of course, people are expected to die one day, and it is up to Arnold to prove that the system is wrong. <br /> <br /> I did not read Stephen King's book, but it's an excellent film, one of Arnold's best. He does what he does best as a man of action, delivering death to an unforgettable interlocutor. The classics are probably "He really hurt his neck" after strangling a guy with barbed wire, and "He had to crack!", Referring to where he had just saw someone vertically. Dawson is absolutely irritating as a TV presenter and all 'Stalkers' camp properly. The action is violent, but it's an action movie. That's the point. The film strides forward and after 90 minutes, its welcome is not exceeded. <br /> <br /> With Paul Michael Glaser of Starsky and Hutch at the helm and after the success of The Terminator, this film was previously considered as a simple action vehicle insane for Arnold, and very pushed. But today, anyone who watches a lot of television can see how close the film is to reality. I would not be surprised if I turned on the television in a "near future" and saw a show not so far from it. <br /> <br /> On this depressing note, however, I must recommend "The Running Man". to anyone who loves the 80s, Arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
