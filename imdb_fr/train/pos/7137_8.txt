The plot of GOODNIGHT MR TOM on paper suggests that we are expected for a large dose of maudlin and sickly feeling. But the talented director Jack Gold is an expert on touching the emotions in the right way and he appears rather like an irresistible force, dramatic Drama of the time of the war, with an excellent production and main performances. One of the best, if not the best television movies of the 1990s, which would probably have been even more successful if it had been shown in cinemas. <br /> <br /> Evacuation of children to rural towns and villages during the Second World War was common practice, but in the case of the young boy, it is doubly important because of the miserable life of his home in the capital of the United Kingdom. However, the construction of the film until it ends sore throat leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before. It's almost (but not quite) worthy of comparison with the finale to THIS WONDERFUL LIFE (1946). All in all, a modern classic.
