Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in 1944, "Laura is teaming up again for this great 1950s noir movie." An embittered policeman, Andrews like Mark, can not ignore that his father was a thug who died in a police shootout while trying to get out of prison.Because of his bitterness, Mark does not know when to stop using his hands.It is this incapacity that causes death accidental of a hood (Craig Stevens) <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, Gene Tierney's father, was accidentally heated by an innocent cab driver from Stevens. <br /> <br /> It's a well thought-out movie about the consciousness of a fundamentally decent human being. <br /> <br /> The end is not really optimistic, and Mark will have to deal with the music, at least he finally admits what he did.
