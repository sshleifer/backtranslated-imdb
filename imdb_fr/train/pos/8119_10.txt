I think the first 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting films, with the brilliant score trying to create a tension that reaches a climax. What moviegoers did in the 1930s, I can only imagine. The "Times" said at the time: "A miracle happened on the screen". Watch him and marvel.
