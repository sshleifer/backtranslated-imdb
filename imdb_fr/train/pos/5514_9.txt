I watched the first part two days ago and today I saw the second part. Of course, both sides are worlds apart, so I'm a little shaken by everything I've seen. I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of Che's death; for me, it clouded the whole movie. I guess that's exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel, the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. The second part was so disappointing compared to one more time, it was inevitable, but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative. The politics of the movement in Bolivia have only been mentioned but rarely confronted in a didactic way. For me, the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film: the confrontation with the jailer and the sweeter conversation with the Bolivian leader during which this leader questions Che on the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. I did not consider that national differences played a role as important as in the conflict between Argentina and Bolivia. I thought that Soderbergh had admirably treated the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; how to get food without upsetting the peasants who do not have enough themselves. I was struck by the difficulty of trying something like Che tried it. I guess everything is in the timing; is anger against the government enough to start the movement? in Bolivia there was none. In his letter to Fidel, Che realized the terrible corundum of the revolutionaries in which he read at the beginning of the film: If not now, when, in 50 years. A very provocative and well done movie; make every effort to see it.
