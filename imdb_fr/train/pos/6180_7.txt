During the opening night of the Vanties, a woman is found dead on the podium above the stage. As the show continued, the police tried to reconstruct who had killed who and why before the last curtain. <br /> <br /> Having always heard that it was a great mystery of classic comedy, I was delighted to find a copy. Unfortunately, no one told me about the musical numbers that were going on again and again. While the figures are certainly the ones that Hollywood did in its hour of glory, they become intrusive because they almost stop the film, despite the attempts of association. It would not be so bad if the music was half decent, but that's not the case. There is only one good song. Worse, it's as if the studio knew they had a song, Cocktails for Two, and we're undergoing four versions: a duet, a big production number, like the final of Vanities and in the background, an accessory music. I do not think Spike Jones and His City Slickers played that much. The rest of the film is pretty good as Victor McLaglen gets on well with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny in his actor scenes filled by the mistress of the wardrobe. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it, but I highly recommend it if you think you can understand the music numbers or if you want to scan. through them. It's a funny movie of the kind they do not do anymore.
