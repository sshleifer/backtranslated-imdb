I just do not get tired of watching FREEBIRD. My husband was an extra and I got involved from the start. We stayed in touch with Jon and helped promote the movie in the theaters and at the DVD release. Even as it distributes promotional postcards on cross-border ferries and in various places of France. FREEBIRD has been expertly written and realized with the perfect combination of serious and fun moments and casting of choice. Only Phil Daniels could play Grouch. Great privilege to meet Jon and the actors at the party that followed the prime minister in January. Whatever you want to do, Jon just asks, by email or phone, you know how to find me. Sue xx
