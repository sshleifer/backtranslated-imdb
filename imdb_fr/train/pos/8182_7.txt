Director Brian Yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre, creating masterpieces such as "The Return of the Living Dead 3" or "The Fiancee of Re-Animator". for the damned "or the mediocre" offspring. "It's obviously better at Producer's headquarters where his work as producer of Stuart Gordon's films has been superb. <br /> <br />" The Dentist "is one of his most minor work as a director, but his low profile benefits the film and his lack of pretensions make it a very enjoyable experience.He tells the story of Dr. Alan Feinstone (played superbly by Corbin Bernsen), a veteran dentist who discovers one day that his perfect life is not as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) has a love affair with the boy of the swimming pool.This event disturbs him and puts him in a murderous madness as it takes revenge on the world for its "filth". <br /> <br /> The principle is very well treated by Yuzna, who takes us on a tour following the day of revenge of Feinstone. differentiates this movie from most slashers is that we are not in the perspective of the victim, we follow Feinstone because he is the main character. We are witnessing the passage of a respected professional to a psychopathic murder in one day. Yuzna manages to give the film the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the film. <br /> <br /> The success of the premise lies mainly in the performance of Bernsen in Feinstone. He can make you feel sympathy and hate for him at the same time, and the subtle humor of his character is another aspect that helps the film. The rest of the cast is not as good and I think their sub-game is damaging the movie more than it should. Ken Foree is a notable exception as a detective trying to capture Feinstone. While his role is small enough, he does a great job with it. <br /> <br /> With a dentist as a killer, bloody scenes are expected, and Brian Yuzna delivers an excellent SFX effect in the right amount. It's good to see that it does not go too far with this film as it usually does, and I dare to say that this is one of the highlights of the film. He has exactly the amount of blood expected, nothing less, nothing more. Yuzna refrains from her common excesses and the result is excellent. <br /> <br /> Although it's not one of Yuzna's best-known films, I'd say it's one of his best. Of course, this is not a classic material like his masterpieces, but it is a film that entertains and never becomes boring or boring. It's a simple, low-budget film, but for what it is, I think it has rocked. 7/10
