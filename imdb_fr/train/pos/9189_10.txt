Let me start by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 o'clock in the afternoon. One night, I could not fall asleep until 3am. <br /> <br /> This brief review may contain inaccurate comments. <br /> <br /> I'm a long time fan of Sopranos and I can safely say it's the best episode I've seen. I'm not saying that everyone should feel that, but that's what I do. This episode is identical to the weekend that I spent with my family to look after my own father, comatose in intensive care before his death. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with Tony in an alternative reality: he is a salesman who has Identity has been confused with that of a man named Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes, I knew Tony was dreaming or watching another show. It was not like normal sopranos and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks up at the sky under a "helicopter spotlight" and we see him fast forward, a doctor with a flashlight. We only see this for a moment and the sequence continues until we come back to reality in a situation similar to the one I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Tony came out of a coma for a moment. Her boys take A.J. home and Carmella, overwhelmed by stress, disintegrate in the hallway: a highlight of the episode. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the episode, we enter the real world: the family manages its potential. negative result of this coma and Tony's alternative reality, which corresponds to what is happening in his mind and in the real world around him. <br /> <br /> Then comes the highlight of the episode: after AJ ends up saying to his mother that he is out of school, she goes to see Meadow sitting next to Anthony. <br /> <br /> She approaches Tony and pronounces the best sentence of the episode: "Anthony, do you hear us?" In Tony's world, he enters a dark hotel room and lights a light. He takes off his shoes and goes on the phone. He tries to dial the number, but he can not - as if he were trying to say something to Carmella, but could not physically resolve to do it. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits and looks out the window. A glittering light that has reappeared throughout the episode now seems the call on the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When it's cold, I'd like to die" Moby blends perfectly with these latest images and helps create the emotional ups and downs of an episode. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: watch the next episode. You discover what light is. That's wonderful.
