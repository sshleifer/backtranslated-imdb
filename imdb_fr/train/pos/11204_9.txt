The symbolic use of objects, the editing of forms, the position of the characters in the scene, all this has been used with so much joy by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had. The way the woman moves from one corner to the other as the fight progresses, the retouching when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... although it may seem a bit obvious according to the current norms, they spoke in the silent era of volumes on history without saying a word. Even the title has at least four meanings that I can see; the ring, the alliance, the bracelet that the lover buys and the love triangle in the heart of the story.
