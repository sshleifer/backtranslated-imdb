At the end of the 1980s, Warren Beatty created and played in the red and literary epic on the founding of the Soviet Union through the eyes of the radical iconoclast John Reed. It was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by a cast of stars. At the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy that does not pretend to be anything but entertainment with a host of better actors around the good old days and putting on makeup under tons of makeup. That Red and Dick Tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about this man's reach as a player. In this film, Beatty managed to gather all the famous cartoon characters from the movie and put them in an original script. <br /> <br /> The best gangster in town, Big Boy Caprice, is trying to really eliminate competition. The film begins with him erasing men Lips Manlis in the style of a shooting session on Valentine's Day then Lips himself being equipped for a cement coat. But Caprice's actions make him a target for Tracy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a third mysterious and faceless individual seeks to overthrow Caprice himself. Will our hero solve this problem? <br /> <br /> The fun of this movie is really infectious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, and William Forsythe, RG Armstrong make up in a scandalous way to look like the comic book's creator, Chester Gould, and then perform a sculpture exercise of the most big piece of ham. You must love this movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, but none of these guys would have been, only that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice spends the most time on screen. Only Beatty plays completely straight, the others all seem to play with him. Dick Tracy won the Oscars for the Best Artistic and Scenic Creation Project, best song written by Stephen Sondheim and presented by Madonna, Sooner Or Later. The fact that he even managed to write a score like Sondheim for this film shows that Sondheim really wanted to have fun. As for Madonna, the Material Girl is doing more than just dealing with all of these acting heavyweights like the Breathless Mahoney club's flamboyant singer. <br /> <br /> Before this movie, Dick Tracy's movies were recorded in B-pictures and worse Saturday. serials of the afternoon. The only thing that rivals this all-star extravagance is a radio program made for the armed forces radio station during the Second World War and switched to vinyl. Can you believe a cast like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and the Andrews Sisters? Try to find a record of this gem. <br /> <br /> Until then, Warren Beatty's classic comic strip on the big screen will do the trick.
