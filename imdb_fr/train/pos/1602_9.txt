I bought the video quite late in my collection and I probably would have saved a lot of money if I had bought it earlier. It invariably replaces anything else during these "Cosmo Moon" nights. Cher and Olympia certainly deserve their rewards, but it's truly an uncompromising overall performance of a great script. What? You do not know what a "Cosmo moon" is?
