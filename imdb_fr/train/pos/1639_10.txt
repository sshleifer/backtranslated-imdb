Fabulous actors, beautiful landscapes, raw reality. I will not develop all comments from other commentators because you get the picture! However, the film is not for the delicate ones. The reality is to slaughter hogs and other livestock to survive. I also have Elinore Randall Stewart's farm book. I read it many years ago. I have to read it again, because I just watched the remastered DVD of the movie, which has just been released. <br /> <br /> I tried to buy the video for several years, then I bought it used. from a video store that has ceased operations. But Yippee! The DVD is now on sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but it's worth it. It's a movie I'll watch for the rest of my life!
