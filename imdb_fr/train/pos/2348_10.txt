This show is lively, colorful, dark but fun, trendy and always clean. The cast, including an impressive rotation of special guests (Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Of-Office-Space) is electric. There are murders, love stories, family and zombies without ever becoming cartoonistic ... In a way. You really connect with these characters. All the production is an improbable magical act that left me, a little skeptical if I say it myself, totally absorbed and returning every Wednesday night to ask for more. I just re-read this and it looks a bit like someone who paid me to write it. It is really good. I just heard a rumor that it was canceled, so I thought I'd send a flurry of goodwill. This is one of those shows that goes unnoticed because people in the network do not know how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Do yourself a huge favor, if you have not already done so, and enjoy this gem as long as it lasts. OK, one more thing. This show is smart. What this means is that every critic / "writer" in Hollywood will insert a stick before sitting down to watch it, defending himself with a speech of the type "I could have written this" to anyone in their solitude. renovated hotel room in Hollywood. In other words: Internet. This is a site of general interest / anonymous. Before giving your Wednesday television time to Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model or anything else, these "critics" of the Internet do not comment, give to my favorite show. It's funny. Good fun without pretension.
