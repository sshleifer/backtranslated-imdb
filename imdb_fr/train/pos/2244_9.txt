The only explanation I can give for why this movie is not widely distributed is that it strikes too close to you for some. This film was a real happy surprise, the satire is a genius. This film lights the light in the dark which is an organized religion and big media, and cockroaches hide to cover themselves. Rent the DVD and watch it yourself if you have not done it yet. This film succeeds where many have not succeeded (Dogma comes to mind) to break the nose in the tent, using both humor and very intelligent analogies, associated with sets and places revealing . . You can not comment in depth without revealing important spoilers, there are some surprises in this film that will even surprise the seasoned movie buff.
