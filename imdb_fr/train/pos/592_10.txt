In Arlington Heights, IL, we had never had a cafeteria in elementary schools (1961), so I took my bike home to ride a bicycle and I was still watching this game. Yes, I was 11, but I thought it was the best thing to do! I drew pictures hidden on my board and saw if my family or my friends could find it. I also remember winning some great cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the competitor got the last hidden picture game. I even had the home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasted so little time. I loved the music and the hidden pictures - the only one I could get was the lemon hidden under a bridge over a garden stream. <br /> <br /> Very good memories are related to camouflage.
