This film probably never made noise on the radar screen, but it has a lot of quality. It's pretty realistic, and yet you think "It's just a movie". Duvall and Close describe ordinary people and you would never even realize that they are now leading actors. It seems like the asshole in this story is a bit too old to chase Eugene's girlfriend, but I guess it's possible. It seems unlikely that the kid is coming alone from Montana to Nevada, but I guess it's possible. You may think that the family problems of this movie would never happen in your own family, but I suppose it's possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like, "You think the work you do is the hardest part of your life, but it's not the case."
