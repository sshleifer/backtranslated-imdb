Disney (and the great people of PIXAR of course) offer a great, fun story combined with the best of computer animation. I admit that the "faces" of the insects were perhaps a little more static than in "Antz" and that they had only four legs (in "Antz" six ...). But the scenery was superb and the animation breathtaking. But let it be a lesson: it was not the computer that made it such a success: it was the man behind the machine who added the nice little twists, which I missed in 'Antz'. Some highlights were of course the "bloopers" at the end (so stay alert at the end, it's worth it!), Which were very fun and original. The line 'Filmed entirely on site' was intended for the more attentive viewer.
