This is a small film, few characters, theatrical. And yet, he says something about Ireland that you will not find elsewhere. This film is in Ireland. In any case, it is sadness, sadness. The boys, Master Doyle, SP O'Donell, The Cannon, the daughter of Senator Doogan, Gar and especially Madge.I know them.I'm at the pub with them or kneeling to pray with them. They are our sad story and they are our present.
