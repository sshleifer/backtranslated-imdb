This movie has big fight scenes. Now, it's true that the acting game is a little rough. But if I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills, I would watch a Cheesy movie like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with real martial arts and amazing stunts WITHOUT using wires and flying, throw the air like so many movies around you that kill the womb. So look at this. Now, it is true that the two main stars of the series are in which the kids show the Power Rangers and another member of the cast of this series has a role to play in this film. But hey, the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li his pants. And the stunts are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit, toss and admire.
