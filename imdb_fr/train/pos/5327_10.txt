As an informed fan, I recommend this film true to the facts and played well. I am 11 years old and I live in Istanbul. I heard friends talking about a new musical sensation that pushed girls to scream. I thought that if girls liked them, they must be crap. Until then, my only records were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Shortly after, while I was on vacation with the family in a military cafeteria in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later learned: "Love Me Do"). I was impressed by the difference between this song and all the songs I had ever heard before. When I heard my older brother's 'Meet The Beatles' album, I became addicted to life. After reading the definitive book of their beginnings (by Davis), I was surprised to find that this film was very well done, with the exception of the abandonment of most of the sex and a part of drug use (it concerned the use of methadrine / dexadrine). >
