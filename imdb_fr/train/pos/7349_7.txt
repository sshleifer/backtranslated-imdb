Of course, if you read my review, you have already seen this movie. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I love the concept of a spoiled kid with a 24 * 7 servant on his bike. Watch movies and emulate characters, etc. I love the scene when a stone cracks in Kader Khan's mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor tells a cruel story of Raja Babu's business on a dinner table and Govinda wearing the 'dharam-veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks. That's my favorite scene from the movie. The scene "Achcha Pitaji To Chalta Hoon Main" is a chemistry between two major Indian actors who perform a comic scene without dialogues. It's brilliant. It's a cat mouse movie. Just watch these actors help each other while eliminating the scene. His total entertainment. If you like the chemistry of Govinda and Kader Khan, then it's a must. I think RB is 6th on my list by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie No. 1 'precede this film gem. 7/10.
