The talented detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his trip abroad to investigate a seemingly isolated and elevated suicide case that he has reason to believe is really something else, a murder rather Deliciously complex! <br /> <br /> As for murder movies, there is no better than this one. Filled with suspicious characters, all related to a dog show and all having very good reasons to murder Archer Coe, alleged victim of suicide, it is really difficult to understand it or to wrap it, but it is fascinating to see unfold. before us. Even the cops, the coroner and the prosecutor are colorful and detailed characters that add an unexpected and realistic realism to the procedure of the latter and amplify the factor "fun". I especially enjoyed the comic scenes featuring the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), which always seems to be abruptly and unexpectedly interrupted by the discovery of corpses or wounded during his race. Also Detective Sergeant Eugene Palette. Heath welcomes, often later, deliciously humorous at his expense, a critical commentary in Vance's investigation. I can not think of any valid criticism to give this film in fact, except maybe it does not date particularly well. This does not prevent the film from being just nice to watch. Look and see if you can understand the mystery of it. Highly recommended to try!
