"Victor does not have much, but that does not stop him from trying to go out with Judy, the prettiest girl in the neighborhood ... All he has is hope and a flat of a room he shares with his family, his grandmother does not trust him, his brother venerates him and his half-sister has just declared war, but Victor thinks that love can really conquer everything in this romantic comedy warm, authentic and touching about the life of the city, which most people never see ". the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> Peter Sollett '' Raising Victor Vargas '' creates captivating 'beginnings' of lead actor Victor Rasuk (as Victor Vargas) and casting. Mr. Rasuk and Judy Marte (Judy Gonzalez), juicy, are sexy and endearing in the role of "Lower East Side Kids", discovering the joy of sexual attraction. Given their appeal in this photo, it is not difficult to predict that they are joining in on their own. Although you may wonder how "innocent" they really are, their description seems accurate. <br /> <br /> Victor's brother, "Nino" Victor's brother, Silvestre Rasuk, plays the role of his older brother. Sometimes it's nice to see movie brothers who are really alike; and, hopefully, they will work together again. "Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs", sister Krystal Rodriguez (as Vicki) and the old world Altagracia Guzman (as grandmother) complete the Dominican immigrant family hungry for sex. So, are the arrival movies with a portable camera all the rage, or what? <br /> <br /> ******* Raising Victor Vargas (16/05/02) Peter Sollett ~ Victor Rasuk, Marte July, Silvestre Rasuk
