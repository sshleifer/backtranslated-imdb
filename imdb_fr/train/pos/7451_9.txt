Here is one that will please the whole family ... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. Shelley Duvall has surpassed herself with this unique and imaginative interpretation of almost every childhood folk tale. The scripts offer new twists on the secular fables we grew up on and have a handful of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to Duvall's standard and, in my opinion, one of the best five in the series, put forward by Jennifer Beals (remember "Flashdance" - and she's always Hollywood today to make a film here and there) the lead role, Jean Stapleton as a fairy godmother with a southern accent and Eve Arden as the personification of the mother-in-law. Edie McClurg ("The Feast of Ferris Bueller") and Jane Alden form a hilarious duo as half-sisters. Matthew Broderick is an affable prince Henry. You will continue to come back for this one!
