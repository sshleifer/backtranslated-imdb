While watching the movie, I was in a very light mood and this film is light, but the end of the film is quite unexpected, which leaves an unforgettable memory. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Abhay and his job of witnessing during the registrar wedding. Soha comes for the wedding and her boyfriend does not leave him, leaving Soha alone in the street, she can not go home and she has nothing left to live here in this situation. Abahy turns out to be a help to her, it's the basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest is watching and the end of the story is very sweet that Abhay has to face, which keeps you on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> The dialogues and the music are good The songs are acceptable The direction is good and the scenario lets you think that the film is slow but that you take account of the demand of the history, that everything is in order. I enjoyed that at home with coca and peanuts. my rating for this is 8/10
