It's a movie I can watch over and over and never get tired of it, it has a lot of laughs, guns, action, crime, good dudes and a decent plot with Donald Sutherland in a rather comical role as an assassin. Tia Carerra looks as hot as ever and can play too. Thomas Ian Griffin is awesome in this role: the main character "Max", agent of the DEA, Diane is the FBI agent, played by Carerra, and John Lithgow of Frazier on television, plays the villain, "Livingston". The plot revolves around Max and Diane trying to capture Livingston as they argue and argue over who gets the money from the respective agencies. Add to that Assassain Sutherland, who possesses just about all the good duplicates. Perfect crime crime, there is the usual love story, but played very differently than one would think of Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian Mafia, the Italian mafia and the Chinese mafia here, the film is shot in Boston, where you have great shots, and locals, great pictures and music in this movie, this movie is just the quintessence of a police comedy, it has everything you could dream of. Check out Sutherland's restroom in a special, very unusual scene. This movie is a riot and will make you laugh a lot more for me.
