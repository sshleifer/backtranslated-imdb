I really enjoyed this movie because there was real sincerity in the acting. The writing was top. James Arness is a great actor and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and can we really play against Davy except Fess Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this adventure was Raul Julia, who gave depth to Santa Anna, a vain and complex person who drove Mexico through a turbulent period. <br /> <br /> While some might think the movie was idling, he captured the fight as it unfolded, a lot of trouble followed by a few hours of dreadful terror. <br /> <br /> What impressed me the most in this film is that it made you think of a cause and the will of some people to die for what they believe in. At a time when no one defends anything, I found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter what you think of politics at the time.
