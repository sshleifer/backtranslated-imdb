This film is much better than the original The Jerk. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes quirky humor. We have incorporated in our speech of the day almost as many replicas of this film as Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The card game with the hobos, then with Mr. Suicide. The scene at the table and his aversion to turtle soup. The original The Jerk was too choreographed and staged. Although I like Steve Martin, he seemed to be trying hard. Jerk Too is a parody and will be appreciated by all. Jerk Too is family-friendly, unlike the original Jerk.
