I bought this movie a few days ago and I thought it would be a pretty crappy movie. But when I inserted it in the DVD player, it surprised me very well. James Belushi plays very well as Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good role as sheriff. The scene in the end, in Bill's house, is excellent, good camera work, beautiful dialogue and very good acting. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie stole $ 12 million from the mafia. With his wife, he lives in South Carolina as part of a witness protection program. But the mafia is chasing him and wants the $ 12 million. Bill can trust only the person he knows, himself.
