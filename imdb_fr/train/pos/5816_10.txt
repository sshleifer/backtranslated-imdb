The first time I saw this "movie", I loved it. When I was 11, I was more interested in music and dance. As I get older, I have also become more interested in acting. While the first half is only a retrospective of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was always fun to watch. The sequence "Badder" could have been left out, even if the children were pretty good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were fun, especially when the policeman told Michael, "I need your autograph here," after arresting him for dancing in a non-play area. dance. But it's "Smooth Criminal" which is the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did a great job as a hardie (and his hair was wild). The dance is perfect, as are the special effects. The only thing I could do without was the spiders. Any fan of Michael should see it, if it is not already done. I give him a 10+!
