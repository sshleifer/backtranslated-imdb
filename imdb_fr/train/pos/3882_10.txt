I watched this tape, immediately rewind it, watch it again and laugh twice as loudly. I highly recommend this band for those who are not hateful, but uncomfortable with transvestites. This shows you that disguise is a characteristic rather than the totality of being. Comedy is not a unique problem. This man is brilliant. All comics must aspire to his degree of openness, intelligence and talent.
