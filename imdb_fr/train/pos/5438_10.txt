George Stevens (before turning to more serious dishes like I REMEMBER MAMA (1948) and GIANT (1956)) set the standard for all future action movies to follow. Inspired by Rudyard Kipling's poem, GUNGA DIN follows the path of three military officers in India in the nineteenth century. The noble trio faces a series of battles and other dangers, including a rogue cult and a temple filled with gold. Their screen adventures remain exciting, even after more than six decades, and have inspired almost everything from the cliffhanger-inspired STAR WARS (1977) to similar scenes from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (1981). <br /> <However, the main reason for the success of this image lies in the flawless performance of its trio of extremely charismatic actors. Victor McLaglen has rarely been better as a sturdy, Cary Grant is the ultimate comedy film, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr is a hero as sublime as the imaginable - perhaps even more than his rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved, and such a warm and credible friendship is precisely what is missing from the most modern action images - and they receive tremendous support from the wonderful Sam Jaffe, who overcomes the misunderstanding obvious physicality and makes the title character a beacon of human gentleness and quiet strength. A huge success in its time (the movie would have been the second largest money maker of 1939 behind the scandalous success GONE WITH THE WIND), and it is undoubtedly the best film of its kind.
