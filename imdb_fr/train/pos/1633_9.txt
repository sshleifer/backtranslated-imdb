I loved this movie when it came out in the 80s and it still is! I still quote classic lines like "repeat it" and "you said you would rip my balls out, sir". Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although underestimated and disavowed by MAD, I must say that this little gem will always be a treasure and a film that I would take with me if it were sent to a desert island! I only want someone to let go of the DVD because my VHS tape is pretty much worn! If you like comedy, this is for you and should be considered a cult classic! It's military humor at its best and at its worst! Praise him if you can not own him!
