Recently, a friend and I were discussing educational and ethical influences as we grew up in the 1950s compared to today. She mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge who, in 1798, wrote The Rime of The Ancient Mariner. We had both been forced to recite excerpts from the epic poem in high school and English literature classes at the university. My friend said, "His messages could even be called metaphysical in the current context." <br /> <br /> We tried to recite it and we only remembered pieces. (I'm having trouble remembering Dr. Seuss.) I said I'd have two copies of the poem so everyone could read it. It was easy enough, but I was extremely surprised to find that the film was turned into a movie. We were looking forward to seeing the film to see how it had been interpreted. After all, the old sailor's Rhyme does not read very well. After everyone read the poem, we watched the movie together. <br /> <br /> We viewed the film as a remarkable achievement, especially since it was shot in the 1970s, before computers, before the so-called "Ken Burns effect". , "and before the special effects have too often begun to compensate for a lack of substance.It should be noted in particular the illustrations of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, chosen by" lesser known artists ", such as Willy Pogany, the first Hollywood designer The film is told by Sir Michael Redgrave, who taught the poem when he was a teacher, adding a tone of authority and credibility to stay true to the poem. <br /> <br /> His mastery lies in subtle layers of messages conveyed without "instruction", or in becoming an oppressive and obvious moral tale, which we found to be a refreshing change from today's mentality. The most moral messages of today in the movies are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder and chaos mark the evil.The bad ones are really, really bad and good are super heroes It's as if the human character lacked nuance. The Rime of The Ancient Mariner is a celebration of the individual, character, appreciation of celebrating all the richness that life can offer, in the broader context of humanity, ie the man's ability to give to others. <br /> <br /> Proud to have found this "unknown" gem, we learned that he won first prize in his category five out of six times at the international film festivals "name". Another surprise was that the director of the film, Raul daSilva, is a recognized authority in the field of animation and is the author of six award-winning books on the film. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is just as relevant today, if not more so, than when Coleridge wrote the original epic poem and Raul daSilva translated it into a film. If I were still teaching in high school, what I had been doing for five years, I would take this one and show it to all my students. There is a level of richness here that leads naturally to a discussion of the big and important issues we all face, whether in 1798, in 1978 or today - in fact, as long as humanity has a spiritual component . <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
