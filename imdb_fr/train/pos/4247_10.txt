THE MISSOURI GIRL arrives in New York knowing exactly what she wants: to get something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. With her beautiful appearance, she quickly catches the eye of the son of the playboy magnate, but if she remains faithful to her virtue, she will also discover true love? <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy. With her platinum hair and her gorgeous accessories, she is a dazzling one. But her beauty should not overshadow the fact that she is also a very good actress. She has legitimately earned her place at the top of the Hollywood Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast offers Harlow excellent support: Lionel Barrymore, the cunning old tycoon, wise to Harlow's habits; handsome Franchot Tone as his son, loving love; Ratsous Patsy Kelly, stealing her scenes as Harlow's escort; the debonair Alan Mowbray, as a well-bred English Lord; old Clara Blandick as Barrymore's intrepid secretary; the hearty Hale Hamilton as a rich man, attentive to ladies; muscled Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard who catches Kelly's flirtatious gaze; and Lewis Stone, unforgettable in a small role of bankrupt businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this film was produced shortly after the establishment of the Hollywood production code. A comparison with RED-HEADED WOMAN, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - the character of Harlow pursues the same goals, but uses very different means.
