Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in Paris from the 1900s. She is pursued by the most popular and glamorous general in France - in addition to being engaged to a shoe mogul. Such is the infallible premise that leads to one of the most delusional plots in the history of cinema. There are behind-the-scenes political machinations from the commanders of the general, a hot air balloon and an ecstatic crowd of Bastille Day, but the heart of this superbly photographed film is frenzied intrigue on the upstairs / downstairs involving angry servants and aristocrats a little more restricted. Yes, it's redux rules of the game. Before everything is over, even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper of Rules, made his appearance - as a gypsy capo, nothing less! Things go a little too fast and too fast towards the end, which creates confusion for this non-French speaker, but damn it - Elena and her men is another profoundly human masterpiece of Renoir.
