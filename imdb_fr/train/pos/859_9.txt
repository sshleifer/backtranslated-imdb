It is so rare to find a movie that has an intrigue impossible to understand at any time. Surprises throughout the delights. <br /> <br /> I do not really understand why you have here the main character who plays "the good girl, who works hard" and ends up being an antisocial risk taker. It was not enough to make me feel uncomfortable, but it made me pause. <br /> <br /> The other thing I could not get was the old man who was taken away by the police at the very end of the day. the film. I never understood who he was or what his problems were. If anyone has any ideas, I would like to know what they might be. <br /> <br /> The movie was exciting and entertaining all through me and always let me guess. Well worth a visit.
