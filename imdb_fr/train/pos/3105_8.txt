The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final exit of super spy Jason Bourne, a man who seeks to kill those who turned him into an assassin. The Bourne series is one of the most critically watched trilogies (Ultimatum records an 85/100 on metacritic.com, which means its "universal eulogy" status) and for good reason, the fights are very well choreographed and the deep story can be very <br /> <br /> First, I urge you to watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fanciful films at Ultimatum. There may be three different films, but in reality they are all a continuation of one another: miss leaves you confused, just like me. You will always be on the point of enjoying the action and fight scenes of the Ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will certainly lead to some confusion. <br /> <br /> If you had the chance to see the preliminary versions of this movie, you surely had the pleasure of watching Bourne shoot down his enemies and find the man who deceived him from Supremacy Jason Bourne is he played very well by Matt? Damon Damon deserves nothing for an Oscar His work here is good enough to hold his own The adventures of Bourne take place in many different cities, cities are all varied enough to prevent the film from becoming bland at times. search agency Bourne takes advantage of all the technological tools known to humanity to locate it. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the details of the characters because they are part of the continuity of the first two films That said, the film does not have a hard time explaining the audience - not all viewers are hard-nosed observers who can learn more about every element of story development. everything was hurt if the story was a bit frank ahead. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people agree that Ultimatum was a hit for a movie: the movie opened for $ 69 million and - Total box office revenue now stands at $ 216 million. A film that has been coming to the cinema since August 3rd is still very popular. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard. <br /> <br /> Good) Damon is solid but not spectacular, the film is very smart Bad) History is like many others
