Let's start this review on a positive note - I'm very happy they did not decide to pretend to be Tony and do a retrospective, as some have said. In reality, the creator and writer of this episode, David Chase, did just the opposite. We do not really know if Tony will live or die. He is in a coma and his chances of recovery are very slim. This episode seemed to be moving very slowly, and the coma-dream that Tony was involved implied a mistaken identity and emptying the Asian monks to slap him was really, totally strange. After 45 minutes, I'm a little sick of everyone's grief, but that should not be a reason to criticize this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was always well written and intense. Edie Falco gave a breathtaking show that defined her career in this episode, while the woman in conflict was facing the possible death of her husband. I also found it interesting. AJ left school and swore a vendetta against Junior. He probably does not have the means to shoot. Silvio is now acting leader, which opens many doors to the problems of later episodes. There were a lot of good jokes in this episode, too, and I think that Spadafore's Vito 'Pole-Smoker' might well end his turn if he remained a greedy SOB <br /> <br /> This was not a great episode and disappointed only because even though Tony kills people, we, as an audience, love him and think he is our hero of the series. It was a necessary episode for the series, even if it was a small snoring leading to the conclusion. Congratulations to the performance of Edie Falco, as well as David Chase and the writers for creating this completely original and unpredictable scenario. This is the only season of 'The Sopranos' where I have no idea what this will give. I can not wait to see the episode next week. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Best sentence from episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
