Yes, commitment. Let's say that "Fever Pitch" could lead you to believe that it's a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you do not have to be a baseball fan to truly appreciate this image of the Farrelly Brothers. But of course, if you are one, you will benefit even more; with all the references (quite precise, I would say) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet story; the curse of the bambino and all that is attributed to him, including those two words you CAN NOT say in front of a Boston fan: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon describe two people who would usually have a second idea of ​​forming a relationship: the successful workaholic, who is also easy to meet a teacher? The character of Fallon wins the heart of Barrymore by being funny, attentive, sweet and perfectly perfect. But his friends ask him a logical question: if he is such a guardian, why is he still on the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. He has been so attached to his team since his uncle gave him his season ticket Sox. he has never missed a Red Sox home game at Fenway Park for a long time. <br /> <br /> And this delicate balance, how much the workaholic is ready to give up the obsession of his type; and how much this mad baseball teacher is willing to compromise to keep the OTHER LOVE of his life, is the subject of this film. <br /> <br /> At first, you might think that the sport obsession with the pieces of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief. Well, I'm sad to admit, they are not. Myself, as an unconditional fan of the Houston Astros, I can say they are all true. I tried in every possible way to see all the games of Stros; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the Internet. I read the sports section of the Chronicle every day. And yes, my room looks like The Shed, the Minute Maid Park gift shop; with a cabinet full of Astros material, including 5 jerseys, 20 t-shirts and you know the rest. The character of Fallon even has the MBNA MasterCard from the Red Sox. <br /> <br /> Fallon was quite believable as a Red Sox fanatic, even though he could do it without becoming a cartoon (thank God, Adam Sandler was not there) and the plot turned around how this couple has been trying to manage everyone's passions. <br /> <br /> I would say it will be a classic romantic comedy. Not enough to be among the best movies in history; but certainly breaks a mold in the genre and is quite attractive to both men and women.
