Who would not want to go on a trip with Peter Falk? The right eye of this type has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of funny and touching movie that we all seek to counterbalance all the crazy bored special effects. The women will love him for all the men's revival tips, and the men will love him for his study of the father / son character - a stunning little scene after another. And he has just enough advantage to be a real independent find. Obviously, it's a work of love for Paul Reiser, who understands what it means to be both father and son, as well as to laugh and cry over the course of his life. The most fun part, though, was to watch Reiser watch Falk. You can see that it's both his character who discovers a new appreciation of his father and another actor who really enjoys the particular talent of Peter Falk. Really delicious. Let's hope this movie will be released soon in the country's movie theaters so that everyone has the chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and his friends.
