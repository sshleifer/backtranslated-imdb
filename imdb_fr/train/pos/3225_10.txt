When I rented this movie for viewing, I knew it would not be a mindbender movie. Instead, I thought of it as an incredulity of reality, that someone would be seriously beaten. And you know what it worked. Kurt Russel did what I thought was a remarkable role in showing the unemotional soldier he was. I recommend this movie if you go out with the boys and want to watch a good action movie.
