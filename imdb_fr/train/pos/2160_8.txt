This film is about a man too committed to the convention of success, trying to be more mobile, to work hard to be proud of owning his own home. He assumes that's all there is to live on until he dances by chance, all because he wanted to take a closer look at a beautiful girl he saw every day in the dance studio while taking the subway to go home. <br /> <br /> He was infatuated with her first. He went to the dance class to idolize, but he finally let go and start dancing. He ends up realizing that life is not just about death. Many strange characters also learn in the studio, which gives the film a lot of laughter and a feeling of closeness between the discouraged. <br /> <br /> There are also revelations from various characters, including the girl he initially admired, giving them depth by showing their stained past and their struggle to overcome it. <br /> <br /> The dance was also engaging, with the big competition at the end, but this is not the usual story where our underdogs come out on top winning them. Instead, there are falls, revelations, and redemption. <br /> <br /> All this makes it a moving film and fun to watch.
