Man's Castle is a wonderful example of a pre-code movie. This involves realistic events with really nice and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a penny in his pocket. He lives odd jobs and goes to a new city when he misses his environment. One evening, he meets Trina, a beauty full of cold and lonely. She refused to resort to prostitution and therefore has not eaten for several days, but the two are doing very well and form a relationship. His free spirit drives him to leave her, so life is hectic, but there is a real spark between the two, even if they live in a cabin by the river. <br /> <br /> Tracy is one of the biggest actors on the big screen. His characters are incredible and relatable. We can see his thoughts on his face, making him easy to identify, even if we think he behaves badly. Young is excellent in pre-coded movies. Her character is very nice but far from perfect, which makes her even more sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Precoding elements include skinny dipping, pre-marital pregnancy and crime.
