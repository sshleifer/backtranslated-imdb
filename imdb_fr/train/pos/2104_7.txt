Who does not know Largo Winch in the Franco-Belgian-Luxembourg trio (the three countries where are massively published the "BD" or "Comics" French)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic strip, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, it had to be adapted on screens. After a first attempt - and a failure - with a television show, the real thing begins. <br /> <br /> First of all, and this is what most fans did not get, the purpose of this movie is not strictly adapt the comic series. Some parts, characters and essential actions of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a fan of 1st class comics, I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. The actors are good, the scenario too, although it may seem too fast. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in financial / political thrillers, but it's clearly not an alternative to the James Bond or Jason Bourne series, as I would have read on the Internet.
