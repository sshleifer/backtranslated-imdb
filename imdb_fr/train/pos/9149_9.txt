I had never seen Richard Thomas play a bad guy. I was not sure of loving him that way. And I was not sure he could get away with it. But that surprised me. He sent shivers down my spine and made me take a closer look at the people in the street. The film is captivating and fast. Bruce Davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The end was a little awkward, but maybe that's the way real people would fight ... If you're a fan of Thomas, you MUST see it here in all its splendor!
