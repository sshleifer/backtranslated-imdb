We are tempted to define the genre of Gert de Graaff's film as an "event of thought" like Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal scenario is the tortuous quest of a certain Bart Klever for this ephemeral substance that constitutes the essence of the personality. The storyline of his new film takes shape both on his computer and in his imagination. This film-monologue is a response to the "8 Â½" of Fellini and has cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Playing enthusiastically with real and fictional characters as well as the public, he reveals the fantastic interconnection of the real and the imaginary, the paradoxical coexistence of two different galaxies: that of Guttenberg and that of MacLhuen. For a while, we tend to side with the screenwriter, who believes that the cause of all misfortunes lies in the damn stereotypes of the mass mentality ("man", "catholic", "window cleaner") . And with him, we fall into a trap when the author-creator is finally confronted with the insoluble dilemma: how to eliminate the future film. Bart Klever? Just five minutes before the final, thanks to the usual reproaches of the creator's wife, deeply immersed in the work, we realize that with the main character, we were again "framed". Really, what is the price of art for which it is acceptable to give up one's own name and the daily care of the girl? <br /> <br /> So who is he, this Bart? Klever? Is it a brilliant prophet or a possessed like Frenhoffer of Balzac's masterpiece (just like the latter, the screenwriter finally erases from the computer's memory all that has been written)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves. <br /> <br />
