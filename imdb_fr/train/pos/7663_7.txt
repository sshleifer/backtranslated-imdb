As a rule, a full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a movie. But as I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other movies, I tried it. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. Not great, but it's something else. The film involves a struggle with a mystical (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds and the main character. Dr. Mordrid must also deal with people and authorities of the ordinary world, what he does. <br /> <br /> Other damages are possible. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can travel between "dimensions" and does so to find a companion who keeps a fortress; however, the guard was blinded. His eyes are ruined pits. Then the wizard passes his hands over the eyes of the other, and presto, hop! His eyes have been restored! This kind of healing apparently only works with the eyes. <br /> <br /> Later, Mordred and his "brother" animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum. Guess which one wins. <br /> <br /> However, apart from that, the photo is not bad, although it looks like a comic. Dr. Mordred's more "human" adventures are going well, and Combs plays this role convincingly. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot worse.
