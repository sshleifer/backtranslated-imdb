I found that Gray Garden was a gripping film, an incredibly intimate look <br /> about eccentrics who basically have the right idea: forget society and live in a dilapidated house without heating and a huge <br /> <br /> generation of cats and raccoons, persuading rather their own interests <br /> <br /> mundane, while chatting in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Grand Edie and Little Edie are both crazy as the Mazles Bros. have chosen to document. They look like characters in a movie Fellini, only foreign, if it makes sense. The old Edie is <br /> <br /> almost bedridden, a pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishes <br /> <br /> pushing around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She walks around the house still wearing a Baboushka-like headdress around her head and completely covering her hair. <br /> <br /> We never see her hair throughout the movie and we never understand <br /> <br /> that she still has a lot to do. At fifty-eight however, she is still <br /> beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> At Gray Gardens, we feel like these two women <br /> <Lives have become much less than they were. The little <br /> <br /> Edie is probably the saddest of the two. While her mother, in her previous <br /> <br /> years, married, started a family, lived luxuriously and <br /> <br /> even made some recordings (the scene where, at 77, she sings <with the recording of "Tea for Two" that she did several decades ago <br /> (one of the best movie scenes), Edie left her promising career as <br /> <model to take care of her sick mother.At age 58, she still wanted to find her prince charming.If anything, Little Edie is still a little girl, <br /> <br /> full of dreams of glamor and glory, and of domestic and romantic happiness <br /> <br />, which have yet to be realized. <Br /> <br /> highlights of the film include the first moments, where Little <br /> <br /> Edie explains her outfit to the camera, the sequence "Tea for two", <br /> <br /> the birthday party, decisive argument, grocery deliver the l a scene <br /> and the scene in the attic. Everything is incredibly straightforward and unpretentious. And this is all the more remarkable <br /> <br /> that everything is real. <br /> <br /> I suggest seeing Gray Gardens immediately with the Kenneth <br /> <br /> Anger Short Moment Chip. The Criterion DVD costs $ 35.00, but it's worth every penny.
