Although the story is mostly routine and the ending "surprise" is just a bad joke for the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors in the project: it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine, and shine they do. The film is immaculately made - for its time. It was redone in 2000 under the title "Under Suspicion" and if you want to see only one version of the story (it's all it deserves, really), I recommend the last, with the direction updated Hopkins and the most explicit. references to plot points that the original could only allude to. The end, however, continues to blow. (** 1/2)
