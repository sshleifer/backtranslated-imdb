If I remember correctly, George's lyricist and brother, Ira Gershwin, offered the Gershwin catalog for this film, which was bought by the producers. In many ways, it was a typical 1950s musical comedy performed by MGM's Freed unit and performed by Vincente Minelli with the help of Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> The Gershwins were of course one of the biggest Broadway musical teams but, in my opinion, George himself was one of the greatest American composers, simply !!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest male dancers in the movie's musical (we guess on the other?) And I can not imagine that his cast was ever in doubt. But, I think the rest of the cast needs explanation: Oscar Levant was a remarkable personality of his time and, as a true friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this movie. He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer, as well as a famous neurotic and hypochondriac. Here, as always, he plays himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was a stranger at the time and she was part of the French type "kid". A talented dancer, she has never been a real beauty. George Guétary who plays the role of Maurice Chavalier, oops, I mean Henri Baurel, was Greek and not French, but he is certainly more than correct as a French boulevardier even if he is a little too young for the role. <br /> <br /> Gene's hoof voice can be used here, but Guétary has the best vocal equipment. Although Gene has been better screened elsewhere, as in "Singin 'in the Rain" where his character is much more calculating, even here, he sometimes shows himself as a heel (he was, not for nothing, considered the Heel original Joey in Pal Joey, the Broadway musical.) I was not delighted by his "I Got Rhythm" scene with children, which does not appear as spontaneous as I thought. <br /> <br /> I also found Nina Foch's character, Milo, rather irritating. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of the film is obviously the long ballet at the end of the film, based on the title music with sets and costumes in the great French impressionist painter styles. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time believing Gene and Oscar as artists in trouble, and I do not think music numbers are as well established as they could be, but Together, Gershwin's music is very well served in this film. <br /> <br /> The DVD is well done with fine graphics (when they are supposed to be ed to be) and the mono sound is good but a bit superficial.
