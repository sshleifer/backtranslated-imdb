Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, intrigue less but significant, "Before Sunrise" (1995), the third film by Richard Linklater, is dedicated to all those who have already been in love, is in love, or never loved, but dream again of it and hope to find it. This is one of the very few films that is / should / will be equally interesting for teens, their parents and even their grandparents. It seems to be a very simple little film, without spectacular visual effects, nor car chases, nor long and hot sex scenes. Two young people in their twenties, two students (the American tourist Ethan Hawke who returns home after the summer in Europe and the French Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend classes at the Sorbonne) meet in a train. They are immediately drawn to each other, before even starting to speak, they get off the train in Vienna where they walk all night to explore the city. They talk and fall in love. That's it, it's the movie. It could have been boring and silly, but instead it's a charming, credible, intelligent and moving romance that only gets better every time you watch (at least for this viewer). My praise and sincere thanks go to the director and the scriptwriters for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, interesting and witty dialogues, two amazing performances and the magic atmosphere that makes love. Julie Delpy, who looks like an angel of Botticelli, describes a smart, independent and incredibly attractive young woman.
