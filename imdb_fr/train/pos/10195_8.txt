Joe Don Baker is one of the few actors who is often better than his material and almost always underestimated. He has been in a ton of hero or hero movies, and has the kind of strong and solid presence that Wallace Beery has made half a century before him. Baker can deliver materials that would seem ridiculous at the exit of another actor, and that's what makes him so great. He really seems to mean what he says, no matter the clich√©, obvious or silly, which places him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. That's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. It was an important success in theaters and video in the 80s, and it has aged much better than many action movies perhaps better known at the time. By moving the action of Texas to Europe, you will get a timeless quality that will not move away from the action on the screen. To be honest, I've always loved the films of Greydon Clark, a flawless director in the same vein as Clint Eastwood of the 1970s, and he's one of his best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost jewels of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its strength and violence. I guess if they do it again with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to like it as much as me.
