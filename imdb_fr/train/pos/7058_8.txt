Right after watching the movie, the true magical feeling of Walt Disney movies appeared in me and I realized that I have seen the "real" magic in a movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> The combination of good music, lyrics and magic effects brings the Disney feeling back to life in your body. Very special things I saw where the ignorant effects of the film started with the transformation of Disney's logo into Cinderella's castle and ended like a fairy tale to tell with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> The magic has come back to me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.
