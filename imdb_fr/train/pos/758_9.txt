I knew this program as a similar program to Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and it's the same thing, but more extreme still. Basically, three Welsh and a foolish Brit have been reunited for skateboarding love and a totally indifferent / masochistic pleasure to harm themselves, their health and their safety. They had vomiting, eating pubic pizzas, jumping in nettles, naked paintballs, jokes about the smaller guy as they slept / snored a lot, stunts at a workplace, for example the army, the cowboys and many other insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomiting, perhaps not just for themselves. With Matthew Pritchard doing pretty much anything, Lee Dainton for almost everything, Dan Joyce (the British) who barely does anything physical and laughs at the throat, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who actually a lot, but more popular to be short, fat and lazy. It was the number something about The 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very well!
