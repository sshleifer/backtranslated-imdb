This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel that I know. The representation of the Chancery Court as a "character" in the drama is magnificent. The acting is wonderful, from the sinister Tulkinghorn to the Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and the two young lovers. But it is the web of chancery of the spider that holds everything and the cinematography is superb. What mistake did the BBC make about copyright, meaning that this version could not be seen in the UK on video or DVD for many years? I tried to find out, but facing a stone wall. In the end, I received a DVD copy of Canada.
