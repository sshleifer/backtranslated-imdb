Of course, this may not be a classic, but it's a classic style. One of the few movies my friends and I quote all the time and it's back fifteen years later (maybe it was too often with Cinemax!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie - he does not seem to be able to understand how to play it - but he's surrounded by a fantastic cast that knows exactly how to play this parody. Looking for a movie to cheer you up? That's it, but praise it with friends - it will make it even better.
