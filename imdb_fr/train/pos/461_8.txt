Given that this movie has a lot of entertainment qualities, I think it should deserve more credit than the one that was awarded to imdb. <br /> <br /> It's your base "who did that?" Thriller with sex and murder, but it lets you guess until the end. I like this kind of movies and I certainly think that this one conforms to the norm. <br /> <br /> For me, it was worth watching more than once, so I'll give him an 8 on imdb.
