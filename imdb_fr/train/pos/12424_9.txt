I had always wanted David Duchovney to get into film and finally, he did it and he made me proud. This film was up to my expectations. Duchovney played his character very well, managing to stay consistent with something new instead of playing the Agent Molder we are used to. Therefore, I give him additional credit for his role, also because I could not see anyone else playing that particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that we do not tire of throughout the film, because it never fails to surprise you. He has weaknesses and strengths that make the story more believable. I also enjoyed the narration, she added to the story a good deal and very memorable quotes that I still use all the time. This film also had a hurtful score. I recommend this to anyone who loves drama and does not care about blood.
