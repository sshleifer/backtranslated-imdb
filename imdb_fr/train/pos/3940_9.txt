This film was not only one of John Ford's personal favorites, but also numbered directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his high-level admirers. Ironically, I came to understand it myself with Criterion's recent 2-Disc Set after missing some original Italian language screenings on Italian television many years ago and a few times on Hollywood TV! <br /> <br /> The film marks the first of Ford's nine collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also a prime example of Ford's American folk vein. A work beautifully done and quite poetic, the sequences of the courtroom (and the possible revelation) of the second half of the second half are still very impressive, apart from the fact that actor Donald Meek has a memorable role in the matter of the prosecutor. <br /> <br /> Fonda is, of course, perfectly presented as a shy, inexperienced but rigorous and humanist lawyer and destined to become president; Fonda would continue to portray other fictional politicians on the film - notably in Franklin J. Schaffner's THE BEST MAN (1964) and Sidney Lumet's FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and it is astonishing to learn now that he was reluctant to accept Lincoln's role since, in his opinion, it was like "playing God"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note here that Ford had already approached Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) in THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND (1936), a beautiful but perhaps unknown jewel which, by chance, comes to appear in the form of a DVD of the special edition of the real British actor Criterion, the label "Masters Of Cinema" of Eureka. In addition, my DVD collection contains two other Abraham Lincoln movies that I have not seen yet. They were both directed by DW Griffith - THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and had not just received a series of films I had never watched before, I would have liked to give them an idea of ​​their very satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
