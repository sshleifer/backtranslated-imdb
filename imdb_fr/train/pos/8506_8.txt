. . but it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy. I would really like to own the film because I first saw it because I'm a bus driver and when I saw this film, I drove this model bus. It was only (at his murder trial some 15 years later) that I vaguely remember that JO was one of the stars on it. I only remember he was the driver and the bus was shot down and driven wildly. I looked for this film in vain, since I had seen it in the mid 80's. I liked the movie, I do not usually watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide and in to have seen the beginning (although vague), I remained during all the film.
