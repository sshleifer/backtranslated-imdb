Admittedly, the idea for this television series is perhaps the result of the huge success of Ally McBeal, who enjoys world renown, even here in Germany. That said, Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> The two main characters work wonderfully together. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played by the famous German actor Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, included ???), performed by the charming Rebecca Immanuel, quickly exchanged romantic spreads and continues to to spy on each other as they engaged in criminal sitcom-style crime in and around Berlin. In addition, they are helped by a magnificent cast of co-stars, including their secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, a rare jewel with exceptional cartoon potential. In addition, Otto, the wheel-seller, and Felix's childhood friend, Frank, work very well, not to mention Sandra's best friend and roommate, Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> In total, the joy of watching Mondays: no wonder that the series and its stars have received several awards. Will Felix have Sandra? <br /> <br /> I hope we'll have to wait for many more episodes to find out ......
