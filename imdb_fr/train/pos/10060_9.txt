Wang Bianlian is an old street artist known as a "king of masks" for mastering the art of change in Sichuan. Liang is a famous opera artist of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang fears that a precious art does not die with Wang. He sows the seed of an heir in Wang's mind. The film deals with prejudices, male domination, state of the art, values ​​and especially heat. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it too much. The whole movie is in loop. Everything has a meaning. It's a long story that has been so well set up that the movie is only 91 minutes long. Total satisfaction For five minutes, it's an artistic film, the next five minutes, a sad film, the next five minutes, a thriller. He keeps changing mood as his protagonist changes his face. The last scene on the rope is phenomenal. The story and the script are flawless. The actors are brilliant. The two protagonists are artists, you can tell the way they played. Very impressive. He has not even been nominated for the Oscars. That year, "English Patient" received the best Oscar film and, in the category of foreign films, "Kolya". "Kolya" was just correct and about "English patient", the smallest says it best. Look at it 9/10.
