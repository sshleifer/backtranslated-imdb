One of my favorite films, this film tells the story of two conflicting "characters" in New York, Steve Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery), both of whom strive to be the "main character" "Bowery at the end of the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, although it is a highly fictitious account of their antics (based on a play). Brrodie's legendary legend (did he?) - the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which he became famous, appears here to be about at the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). The director Walsh clearly had great affection for the period, so beautifully recreated here, and that includes a wild ragtime number of the salon singer Trixie Odbray (a young Pert Kelton) .Raft is at its best as Brodie, and Beery again shows what intelligent actor he was, Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the loving interest that both boys are looking for. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy. "The Bowery" moves at a fast pace (unlike a lot of early "talkies.") It's not an easy movie to find, but well worth watching.
