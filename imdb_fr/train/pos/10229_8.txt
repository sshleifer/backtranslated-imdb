YETI deserves the 8 stars rating because it is one of the worst films ever made. I saw it during the midnight screening in Los Angeles and people were roaring and applauding madness - this film is one of those film shipwrecks where you think it's impossible to get a stranger and THEN THAT THE FACT! The millionaire who funds the Yeti thawing project looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both put themselves in an ill-fitting suit - the guy who plays the scientist is one of the worst actors to have been on screen - and yes, there's a dumb boy (who looks a bit like a girl) and he's dumb since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents (hmmm - maybe a kid's therapy ??). Then this Italian hottie is seen by Yeti (once he thaws - which takes forever) - and he is immediately in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the film is that this giant Yeti makes "bedroom eyes" at home, it's like a big Barry White trying to seduce a groupie.In fact, once the big Yeti raised the hottie and pressed against her chest, she accidentally touched the nipple of the Yeti and yes, the film takes the time to show her big gray nipple GET HARD !!!! Yikes of all YIKES! In addition, there is a dog collie in because the Italian producer surely heard that the American public was like dogs and that it was somehow trying to have a Lassie - there is also this senseless scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the big fish and uses it to comb the Italian girl's hair "Thank you, Yeti - now my hair is li sses and smell the dead trout. You're the best. "This movie is stranger than Ed Wood could have imagined, if you're a fan of classic shit, look for that baby.
