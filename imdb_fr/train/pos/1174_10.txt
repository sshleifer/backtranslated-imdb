Some people said that starting in the 11th season, South Park had begun to give up their bitter political satire for shallow parodies; but that could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Although this episode paralyzes the Living Dead series, there is more. It's a satire of the way people treat the homeless. The characters say things like "they claim to be like us" or "they want to be human". This episode attacks a culture of people who are ignorant of the lower classes and who often have trouble succeeding. <br /> <br /> So, yes, it's still a satire and a wonderful parody. What more could you want?
