There are times in the movie that are so terrible that you have a toothache. But knowing that there were only a few weeks left before the Code made the films harmless and bland, Paramount rushed into production before the insinuations and delusional glances were in fashion. Vanities is so horribly anti-feminine that it's delicious. As Kitty Carlisle sings, women carry price tags that would insult a Bronx prostitute. They emerge from clams (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) in postures of absolute submission. Minions of the law, so stupid that they can not find the door, have to look at their skirts and sneer. The girls in the choir bare-breasted sit in giant cacti (could they be a source of hallucinogens?) While we listen to "Sweet Marijuana" and watch the blood flow on the chest of a chorine. <br /> <br /> Of course, Carl Brisson learned his lines phonetically and does not seem to have a clue what he's saying. But all this is worth it because Norma steals the show while nobody looks at it. <br /> <br /> To take a moment of this fragile fluff is to miss the essentials of the exercise. Observe this with a founding member of NOW and get ready to justify all of Hollywood's machismo between body blows. <br /> <br /> Toby Wing, by the way, is the icing on the cake. And Duke Ellington does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> You have to stroll through Memory Lane.
