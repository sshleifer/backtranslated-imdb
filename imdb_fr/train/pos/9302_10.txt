Most of the comments were positive, but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on the series. The decorator used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments as well as beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture, etc. It is worth paying attention to. The film is animated by a very rich characterization and symbolism. All the gangster actors were chosen - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat. The dialogue was fun sometimes but sometimes difficult and I guess it was supposed to be like that. It's a film of a film buff. It was made by people, for people who like the medium. Do not miss this one.
