Many Zorro films have been filmed over the decades, but it is unfortunate that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. <br /> <br /> Zorro's Fighting Legion is a little different from Zorro's other films. First, it's a Republic soap opera in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not performed by a studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but by worker-type actor Reed Hadley. Although Hadley does not have as strong a presence on the procedure as the others, he does an adequate job, aided by the fact that he is not the only hero here. as the title indicates, it must appeal to a fighting legion. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the chosen setting is not California. The story takes place here in central Mexico in 1824, when a man who pretends to be a living god incites the indigenous Indian population and a gang of outlaws to help him in his plan to overthrow the new Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro and a handful of followers are planning to do everything in their power to stop. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, there's at least one incredibly old-fashioned episode, from a nerdy arc twang sound effects to ridiculous gaming. But overall, this is one of the best soap operas of the Republic ever, and probably the best of Zorro. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than most soap operas and never becomes incomprehensible or sinuous., action - fans of Indiana Jones movies will notice LOTS of excerpts borrowed from this soap opera.
