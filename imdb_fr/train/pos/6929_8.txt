Saw this movie on ENCW last night for the third or fourth time. I liked the DVD so much that I ordered. This is really a standout and of course the first of the Mann-Stewart couples. More here than usual, although not quite as powerful as The Searchers. There is a lot of obvious symbolism about adulthood, but it is mainly Stewart's acting, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and Waco Johnny Dean - Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not the Joker) is interesting because a beautiful hero would be a hero interested in Lola but too yellow. Like Stewart in The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance, he is practically reduced to putting on an apron and serving coffee to his enemies. Decaffeinated, no doubt. Tony Curtis of the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson behaving like no Indian I saw on the screen have interesting cameos. <br /> <br /> Special performances by John McIntire as a lucky card dealer / gun trafficker who drags the low-lying Western version of Rick's American Cafe. Nobody wants to spend the night. Jay C. Flippens kiss after a kiss of Lola (Winters) and has some beautiful scenes with Stewart before he reaches Bend of the River and Far Country. Will Geer in the role of Wyatt Earp and the Indian chief who removes Walter Brennan's teeth at Red River are pleasant observations. It's the kind of western that only Stewart, not Wayne or Scott, could have done. It's worth it, I repeat. :-)
