I remember seeing it in the '70s when it aired on television late at night. I was scared of myself. But I was then a teenager at the time, not as jaded as I am about movies. <br /> <br /> CASTLE OF BLOOD (or MACABRE DANCE) is a fine example of the Italian horror genre as well as BLACK SUNDAY (1960) by Mario Bava, CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and NIGHTMARE CASTLE by Mario Caiano (1965). If you want a phantasmagorical atmosphere and good writing, consult them too. I also evaluate them with the first Poe films made by Roger Corman at the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw the new Synapse DVD that was taken from a French copy and that's a big improvement over this old one - and scan the print that was going around television over the years. He adds a few minutes of dialogue (in French) that do not add much to the film as a whole, but it is nice to see it full, without cuts. Unfortunately, the DVD does not offer additional extras beyond the still images of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the flops I noticed is in the opening scene, seeing the smoke-effect man next to the camera reflect on the front door of the hostel. I guess the editors did not understand it at the time, or maybe they did not care, but it was something I did not notice the first time. It's the wonders of DVD. You can see all the errors, errors and details that were not obvious the first time. But whatever. <br /> <br /> But no matter, he still gets a 7 on the imdb counter <br /> <br />
