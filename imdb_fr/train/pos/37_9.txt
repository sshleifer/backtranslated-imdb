Among the elements that make it the best at this stage, I must say that # 1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene is poisoned and his reaction is really beautiful. I imagine that, as suggested by a poster, Christine was trying to restrain laughter during this scene, but in reality it made her look even more deliciously perverse, smiling at Shemp's possible death. <br /> <br /> Another character who helps to stand out is the Goon. His gaze was a great mixture of horrible and comical stupidity. It's hardly a character I would choose to meet in a dark alley or elsewhere. I would have preferred a little real mystery whodunit, but hey, when a court is good, who will complain. Not me
