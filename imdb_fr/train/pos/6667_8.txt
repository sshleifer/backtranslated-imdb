OKAY. There are people who should not see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Do not see it if you do not like satire or black humor. 2) Do not like this if you are offended by The Watchmen. 3) Do not see it if you want a serious superhero movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of you, run, do not walk, to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's weird, it's a delicious send of all the bad clich√©s of superheroes known to man. Occasional incursions into junior humor do not detract from the ridiculous pleasures of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as some more fun pieces by Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (It's good to see Louise Lasser working too.) I laughed all the time. Absolutely not serious, a little weird, but good.
