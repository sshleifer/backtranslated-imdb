I really liked this version of Emma's best. Kate Beckinsale was great, Emma and Mark Strong was a very good knight. The only complaint I had was about Mr. Woodhouse..I can not believe that a man could complain so much or be so selfish with his daughter's life..He was a smart girl in the end though. As always, I love the places where these Jane Austin movies were shot. the settings are so spectacular. it makes me want to visit England, as well as Ireland and Scotland). I think that the actors chosen for this film were also a good choice and that all the other scenarios interwoven with Emma were excellent! I'm happy to have seen this one too.
