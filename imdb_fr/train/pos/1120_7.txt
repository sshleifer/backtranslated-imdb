Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name published in 1994. But this shallow grave is a useful addition to the Backwoods slasher of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The plot goes = 4 girls from the sisterhood of a The convent plans the break week of his life in Florida, but these plans are put on hold when one of these sees a man murdering a local woman and when he realizes he has been seen, well, let's say it becomes deadly. game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when it turns out to be the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shallow Grave is, in my opinion, one of the most enjoyable slashers of the 80s, especially at the end of the month. 80's, when the slashers went downhill, it was one of the few who did not and this film should be better known, a pity that it is not the case. it's a film that really confuses stereotypes (just guess who will be the last girl - I'm totally wrong). The main actors are nice and it's one of those movies that you hope to disappear a bit, which of course they do not do. This, coupled with the stuffed of the first jars of the film (in the good sense of the word) with a few flashes of real malice (the second murder gives a real shock) and an unexpected slyness (even if it is not a big budget thriller I did not expect the bare-breaststruck scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra (accompanied by a hysterical religious radio show), in a film from the late '80s. <br /> <br /> There are one or two bad things about this movie, and not so bad that minor, like the secondary plot with the two teenagers that goes nowhere and the end that was stupid and the inability of the member to follow the logic. SHALLOW GRAVE does not contain any sharp tools, but, in my opinion at least, it's a thunderclap. The scenes where the evil Sheriff chases girls through the woods are tense and exciting. <br /> <br /> In summary, a slasher very nice and worth living, with great performances of the four main girls and sheriff.
