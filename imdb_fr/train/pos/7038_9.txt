"The first war to be 100% outsourced." Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. It's a difficult film to describe; comedy, satire, action, ball screw. This once or twice reminded Dr. Strangelove, especially in the scenes starring Ben Kingsley (who did a remarkable job, I think). I did not have any particular expectations of this film, although I'm a big fan of John Cusack, so I let the film take over. And as a result, I had a lot of fun. Political satire is painfully exact and overwhelming for the military-American complex. The subplots were somewhat predictable, but their final interweaving was worth it. I can understand why this movie was not terribly popular in the US, but for the rest of the world, it's a timely tale.
