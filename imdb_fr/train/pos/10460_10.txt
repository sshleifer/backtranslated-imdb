It was a good movie with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the brother's transformation and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family. Well done and well directed. If there were any flaws, I must say that the story once again showed the typical suburban family and its difficulties. What about all people of all cultural backgrounds? I would like to see a movie where all these cultures are shown - as in real life. Nevertheless, the film has skyrocketed in terms of values ​​and understanding of how a disease can bring a person closer to its creator. I loved the movie and the tears in my eyes
