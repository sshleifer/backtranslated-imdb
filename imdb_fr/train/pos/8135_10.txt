I'm shocked. Shocked and dismayed by the fact that the 428 BDIM users who voted before me did not give this film a score above 7.7 ?! ?? - it's a C! If I could give FOBH 20, I'd do it with pleasure. This film ranks at the top of the modern comedy pantheon, with Half Baked and Mallrats, among the hilarious films of all time. If you know everything about rap, you have to see it! If you do not know anything about rap music, learn something! Comparisons with 'Spinal Tap' do not appreciate the genius inspired by this unique film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll love it. Watch it and vote 10!
