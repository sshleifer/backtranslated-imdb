I finally saw this movie tonight after renting it to Blockbuster (VHS). I must admit that it is wildly original. Yes, maybe the characters have not been fully realized, but it's not one of those movies. We are rather treated with the eyes of the director, his vision of history. And it does not stop. And to be honest, I did not want it. I think Sabu had to influence the directors of "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Cannons" and "Run, Lola, Run". But I really loved how the three of them lead SEE the beautiful woman from the street to distract them momentarily. I really need to see the other work of this director because this film really intrigued me. If you want insight, culture, stability, go somewhere else. If you want to laugh, move the camera and criminal hilarity, look here.
