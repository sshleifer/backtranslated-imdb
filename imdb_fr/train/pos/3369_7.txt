Despite what the title may imply, "Pigs Is Pigs" does not play the lead role in Porky Pig. It is more of a young pig with a more insatiable appetite than the character of John Belushi in "Animal House". His mother reprimands him several times, but it is useless. So much so that he goes to another house where a disturbed scientist feeds him by force more than any other mortal can endure (but there is a surprise at the end). <br /> <br /> I would say especially that this caricature seemed like a substitute between the superb cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months after its release). But make no mistake, they are doing interesting things here. The whole sequence of force-feeding seems more relevant today, given the epidemic of obesity that has hit our country. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's not the biggest cartoon, but it's worth seeing.
