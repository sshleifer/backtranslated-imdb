I really enjoyed watching this movie about the Delany sisters. I knew them, but that was all. This film opened my eyes to their bravado and courage. Which pair What sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms. It's not just a movie for African Americans, but for all Americans. This is a history lesson and a documentary in an entertaining film biography. The acting game was superior, and we really have a glimpse of the difficulties that these two sisters went through for many years. The two sisters are very different from each other. They came from a very loving and strict family with high, if not impossible, standards of perfection. It is sad to see how Sadie's father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend because of a possible misunderstanding. I highly recommend this movie and I'm happy to have seen it on TV the other day.
