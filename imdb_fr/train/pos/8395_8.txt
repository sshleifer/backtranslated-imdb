*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is undoubtedly the best film by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and even with the wonderful script, the film is enhanced by a superb performance by Hanna Schygulla. The film begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) who have just been married as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is dispatched in the final days of the war and Maria, her mother and sister are to survive . Maria decides to find a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club for Americans. She meets a black soldier in the army, Bill (Greg Eagles), who starts to see each other regularly. Maria learns that her husband, Hermann, died during the war, so she becomes very serious with Bill. But one day, while they are intimate with Bill, they see Hermann at the door. He is not dead and when he enters the room, a fight occurs and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill's head and he dies. Hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long prison sentence, so Maria tells him that she will succeed and will get him out. The war is over and Germany has to rebuild and one day in a train, Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny), a prosperous textile businessman and uses her charms to find a job. Maria is determined to do well. She climbs the ladder of the company and becomes the mistress of Karl. She tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her. Hermann is released from prison but goes to Canada to try to overcome all that Maria has done since her confinement. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day, Karl dies and leaves pretty much everything in his will. Maria buys her own house. Then Hermann finally goes home with his wife and they are both ready to start their marriage, even if they have been married for some time. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with the two still in it. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this film that it's one of those films that can be studied and discussed at great lengths. As in all Fassbinder films, the use of color is used in a very interesting way. At the beginning of the film, the tones are brown and gray to represent war-torn Germany, but as Maria begins to be successful, they turn into bright, rich colors like red and white. The reconstruction of Germany with all the sounds of construction is only used as a backdrop and the film remains focused on the exploits of Maria. Fassbinder wanted the sounds of the reconstruction to remind us of what was happening in Germany at that time. Hanna Schygulla has never been better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a smaller actress, that would have been just another interesting film, but Schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and intelligent, but at the same time, she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not embarrassed or embarrassed about it and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who sells her soul almost to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Academy Award, but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother, Lilo Pempeit, plays the role of Frau Ehmke. I heard a lot about the end of the film and it's about whether Maria voluntarily left the gas running. Later in the bathroom, she runs water on her wrist and she seems to be sad. These are just speculations and if you think I'm wrong, send me an e-mail. I think she was too excited by the fact that Hermann was at home and left her by accident (remember she put on a dress for no reason?). Then, when she reads the will, it is at that moment that she learns that Hermann and Karl have become friends without her knowledge and I think she felt that all she had done was to nothing. This is the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes it's by accident. But I think the reason Fassbinder has such an end is to show that anyone who wants to sell his soul has no vital activity. Fassbinder was fascinated by the survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. In her opinion, Maria can not have both. A fascinating film.
