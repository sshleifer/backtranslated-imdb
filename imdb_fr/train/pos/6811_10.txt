Although I usually do not like remakes, they think remakes are a waste of time. this film is an exception. Until reading the previous comment, I did not know yet that it was a remake. My opinion therefore concerns only the film itself and not a comparison. <br /> <br /> The story and the way it is written are not question: it's Capote. No more words. <br /> <br /> Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts play beautifully. I saw movies with them, each in one or the other. I was sure they were good actors and in Eric's case, I always wondered why his sister was the number one star and not his brother. This time, this certainty is high, no doubt. His play, like Mr. Edwards', is clearly the top of their job. <br /> <br /> I recommend that this movie be one of your top 50 movies to see and keep on your DVD shelves.
