In short, this film is a cinematic masterpiece. The film is brilliantly animated by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children seeks revenge for another child. In fact, they reproduce in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. Later, we find three of these children as adults in a sanatorium. Here we see what life has created for each of them. One is a sexually repressed and lonely patient. Another man is a hustler who has become ill. The third child, a girl, became a nun and serves in the sanatorium. This film is an allegory of the effect of violence on the psyche. <br /> <br /> This film has a climax that is certainly not for the disgusting audience of the audience, but it is both logical and deeply moving. The acting is excellent and the script is pretty well written. There is a musical score that provides a stream of terror throughout the film. This is not a movie for thrill seekers, but a film for an attentive audience.
