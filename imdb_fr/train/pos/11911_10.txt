The Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations. Barry Jones and Kenneth More are both great in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what goes through their heads. Jean Simmons is very good and Trevor Howard is a fascinatingly offbeat suspense hero.
