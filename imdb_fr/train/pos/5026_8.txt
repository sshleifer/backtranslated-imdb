This is a great movie that everyone should see. It looks like a Dean Koontz book. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance has been excellent because he really seems to believe in what he says and does. <br /> <br /> I do not know why viewers should read in the movie a kind of advocacy for religious murder. It's fiction. The end is surprising, but fictitious. So what? I think that's what makes this movie so good. SPOILER DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU SEEN THE MOVIE. Throughout the film, the viewer is continually shocked by Paxton's character's disease, its impact on children, and the way children handle this outrageous behavior. And then in the end, it turns out to be true. God entrusted it with the mission of ridding the world of demons. Paxton is not clairvoyant as suggested by other viewers. Of course, we give him information that he could not have known otherwise, but the film goes further to show how God "protects" Adam by the problem of quality of the video and the total lack of memory of the second agent of the FBI. The film does not advocate Christian assassination, it simply takes the viewer on a very unexpected adventure.
