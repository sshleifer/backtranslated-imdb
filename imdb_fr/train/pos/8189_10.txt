It was an excellent episode in two parts, although I have never seen the older ones, I never thought that the doctor would oppose anything that is paranormal, alien of course, but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> This episode brings the things we fear the most and how humans, in a futuristic time, would fight and defeat the real evil when most of the chances would tell us that it would be impossible. <br /> <br /> Be a family film I am surprised that they brought things like fear and faith, especially if it will also entertain the American public. But who cares what the Yanks say, we rock! Since episode 1 of the new series in 2005, Doctor Who has shown its full potential. At first it is so harmless to the frightening, from the most amusing to the most serious, from the lightest to the darkest. I hope many old fans will say soon: "The old Doctor Who is back". <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
