The hit of John Van Druten Broadway is presented on the screen with maximum power in this romantic fantasy about a witch of modern times that seduces a successful publisher of Manhattan. James Stewart may be at the top, but Kim Novak is one of the most seductive witches to have cast a spell on the screen of the movie. The main couple is actually one of the few weaknesses of the film: Gray-haired Stewart looks a little old for the role, and though it's easy to see why he falls in love with Novak, it's a bit harder to understand is attractive in him because they seem incompatible in temperament and outlook. (One of the amusing fantasies of the story is that witches and wizards are portrayed as Greenwich Village beatniks and bohemians.) Curiously, the Stewart-Novak couple would generate much more heat in "Vertigo", released the same year as this movie, but then "Vertigo" had a compelling suspense story and the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. <br /> <br /> The comic moments of the film are mainly provided by the leading cast, including a young Jack Lemmon (Kim Warlock's brother), Elsa Lanchester (their aunt ditzy) and Ernie Kovacs (!) As a confused writer. Hermione Gingold even appears in a hilarious cameo as a kind of great witch. There are many things to love in this film - wit, romance and excellent distribution - that is, if you can possibly look away from the charming Miss Novak. I saw the movie half a dozen times and I can not.
