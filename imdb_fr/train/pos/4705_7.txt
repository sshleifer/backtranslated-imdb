All those who voted less than 5 are obviously not fans of pure and ironic humor. Keaton is brilliant in this respect - as in most of his works. It's not a blockbuster affair, bigger than life. It's a silly and gloomy humor played by some of Hollywood's best (and most versatile) actors. Piscopo was also on the mark as the best dog Wannabee once. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the funniest attempt to never really film, you have to see Dimitri doing his piece like Morone. <Br /> <br /> I gave him a 7.
