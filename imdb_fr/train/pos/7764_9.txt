Another classic study of the effects of wealth on a Southern family is described brilliantly in Written on the Wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has it all. Wealth, an airplane, you name it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, has always pulled him out of trouble. Mitch finished school, Kyle was thrown. Mitch does not come from a wealthy home. Kyle's family, along with Hadley Oil, controls almost everything in the city. <br /> <br /> During her stay in New York, Kyle meets the girl of her dreams, played brilliantly by Lauren Bacall. After a flash romance, he marries her and brings her home. She meets her father-in-law, who tells her how difficult Kyle can be. Kyle sleeps with a gun under his pillow. Bacall's character meets Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a tramp, if any, played by Dorothy Malone, best actress in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays Mitch, the faithful friend. <br /> <br /> A year of marital happiness for Kyle and her fianc√©e comes to an end when the doctor tells Kyle that he can not have children. It's when his wife reveals to her that she's really pregnant, Kyle, thinking that the child is Mitch's, sneaks into a drunken frenzy and is accidentally shot in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who has always loved Mitch, tries but fails to blame Mitch for Kyle's death. In a memorable scene in the courtroom, Malone did everything to admit that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. His Oscar was well deserved. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and was defeated by Anthony Quinn as Paul Gauguin in Lust for Life. Douglas Sirk was the master of the soap operas of the 1950s. Written on the Wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
