The flock is unjustly decried as a lesser "Se7en" scam. There is really no reason to compare the two, except maybe for the same scenario in the final showdown. <br /> <br /> Now that's settled, I'll explain why The Flock is very interesting in some ways. Generally, it is a play rather than a full thriller about a very vigilant social worker who monitors sex offenders. At the very beginning, you can clearly see that his work got the better of him. Obvious in two scenes where he first interrogates an offender and slaps him, then a woman who tries to take him and he can only think of the questions he normally asks in his questionnaire. <br /> <br /> Gere is very good like Errol Babbage, the aforementioned social worker. His way of doing his job does not differ from that of a police officer, he carries a firearm, constantly checks newspapers and provides information to law enforcement officials if some of his "herds" are responsible for a sexual crime. It is also a person who has lost all happiness to live and his only relief seems to come from the fact that his own vigilante is justified towards his flock. You see him smile twice, once when he apologizes for treating his partner harshly and the other after beating a member of his flock. <br /> <br /> The flock is not as successful. A bit confusing and with some annoying scenario intrigues, but it has a number of striking plays. <br /> <br /> Overall, the Flock is a solid drama about a man doing dehumanizing work who must work hard not to be engulfed by the abyss in which he has surrounded himself . The world we live in is a very sick place and the more we can get away from the worst, the happier this man is. The flock understands this point.
