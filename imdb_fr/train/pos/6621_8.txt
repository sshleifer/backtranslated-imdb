I just got back from a movie preview of this great science fiction movie. His style is definitely unique and very well done. It is filmed with real actors but turned into a black and white cartoon style that you have never seen before. It goes a little further than Sin City and does it well. It is a successful combination of comic book cultures and French films. The story and atmosphere are reminiscent of Blade Runner's, and if you liked this one, you'll probably love it too. The scenario is intelligent, never boring and has some small twists. This film is a must for all movie buffs, except perhaps those who do not like science fiction or b & w.
