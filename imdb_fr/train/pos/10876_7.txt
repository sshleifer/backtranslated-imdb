I was really excited to see this movie. I thought finally that Australia had made a good movie .. but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It was the most pathetic attempt ever made for a slasher movie. I'm sorry for Molly Ringwald who has to come to Australia to make a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The acting game was terrible (especially this Australian who was trying to speak with an American accent), and the plot was also very bad. <br /> <br /> When I heard about the release of this movie, I thought the title was pathetic (because it looks like the corny movie "Stab" in Scream 2), but I was ready to let slip if it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION !!! MAIN SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing about the movie was the end. I was expecting a big surprise about the identity of the killer ... but he was not even human ... which made this realistic slasher movie a horrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. You will probably be disappointed!
