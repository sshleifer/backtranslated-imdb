I never thought an old cartoon would make me cry! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I wanted so much to see Casper's first cartoon entitled The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, there was broke me down! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was to see Casper's fox killed! I've never seen anything like it in other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest of all! It was so depressing that I could not look at him anymore. It's like seeing Lassie die at the end of a movie. I know it's a classic, but it's too much for us, old cartoon fans, to manage like me! If I wanted to watch something old and classic, I'd rather watch something happy and funny! But when I think of this cartoon Casper, I think of my cats!
