First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take the majority of his films, you will see that the characters have those moments when they are identical. His character in this film is far beyond all others to date ... and counts. The story begins in the future (not so far) where a man is sent in the past to find the source of a virus that has swept away most of humanity from the face of the earth. The story seems to go to SF but I think it's more of a drama because of the slow pace of the story. About that. Movies tend to be faster and slower at times and develop more towards the end than the beginning, but when you see this movie, you'll be aware of this constant pace of story and revelation of facts that are not do not accelerate. It's the one and the same speed that flows smoothly and very well. But that does not mean that the end will not get on your nerves, because it's pretty good. Regarding the direction, it is prefect. The films themselves are easily destroyed by a bad realization but it has become much better. So, if you're about to watch a Sci-Fi movie or action, you'll miss it. B There should be more movies like this one.
