I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies, but I heard it was good. I was stunned. The most romantic thing I have ever seen in my life. Stunning. Bright, sweet, funny and full of heart. Chemistry is perfect, as is writing and staging. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and so sweet that you really think they are a couple. <br /> <br /> The film grabs you right away and does not let you go. You can not look away or stop listening. Even the small moments melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This is part of the ranks of one of my favorites. A masterpiece.
