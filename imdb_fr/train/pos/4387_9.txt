It is a film from a historical and epic point of view. Although the story is simple, it is pure and straightforward. In truth, it is the classic story of a simple and honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of this period. <br /> <br /> Poor against the rich, honorable or dishonorable, a classic but well-told story without much ostentation of hollywood that stinks the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you can almost feel the people on the screen. :)
