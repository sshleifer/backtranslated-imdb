Warning! Spoilers to come! <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I saw a film in German, so I may miss information. <br /> <br /> Despite some weaknesses in the plot, it's a movie that went through me. I particularly liked the role of Lexa Doig. Sometimes I feel she is Camille. But I can not help but wonder what happened in the end with Bob, Cassie and baby. I think that after being placed on Bob, she ended up loving him and regretted what happened to his brother and was forced to lie to him. Otherwise, it's a little strange that she is wearing her baby and loves it. It's up to the viewer to decide - and I do not like these purposes. Dean Cain was as good as ever, Eric Roberts .. well, I saw him better but also worse. <br /> <br /> I think the film is more of an analysis of human relations and a reaction to unexpected situations. a crime story. <br /> <br /> In summary, I loved it.
