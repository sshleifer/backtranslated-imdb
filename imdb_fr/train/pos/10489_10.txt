This light comedy should be appreciated as entertainment value. It sometimes becomes hysterically funny, but if you have not spent all your time on "that side" of the song, you will miss the comedy when it breaks. <br /> <br /> The characters mix well and are quite credible in their roles. How Grace handles her meeting with her deceased husband's girlfriend was well played. She is a real woman. And my favorite is Grace's white pimp suit she wears. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, applaud the outsiders or just want to look at something different.
