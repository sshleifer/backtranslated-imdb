But on the contrary, sorry, I totally understand how you can be dragged into a movie because you relate to the subject (and you have it). This film is terrible, the main character would give any charlie brown captioner a definite advantage, he mumbles constantly, which is always a laugh. it's your line now, so I'll react. Best British comedy? Please, buddy, talk loudly with your bad guy at the end of the day ... the sun goes down ... and this movie is awful. I mean congratulations to the people involved ... they made a movie ... and maybe motorcycle enthusiasts like it but people who still live on earth with a real sense of humor will have more than difficulties to do it The Christmas present they bought ... was it too hard? I apologize...
