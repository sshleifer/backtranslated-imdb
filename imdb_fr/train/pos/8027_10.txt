When I saw it for the first time, I was really impressed. The director has created such a mysterious atmosphere, especially at the end. Throughout the story, the audience can expect that Richard really kills Thomas or that he does it first.But..the main interest was not the conflict, but..AMITIS ! It's incredible. I enjoy every time I look at it! Of course, it's pretty violent, like all action movies, but I think it's okay. Thank you very much Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Amazing movie! I advise everyone to see it. I am sure that people will not regret it and will really have a good time.
