Directed by Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto, "Meatball Machine" is apparently a remake of the 1999 Yamamoto film of the same name. I doubt that I will ever have the opportunity to see the original, so I'll just comment on it. First of all, what is "Meatball Machine"? A simple and pretentious film for low-budget industrial splashing, filled with stunning makeup and gore effects. It's not something you'll end up writing books about, but it's nonetheless entertaining if you like that kind of cinema. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" follows the well-known plot. The boy likes the girl but is too scared to ask him for an appointment. The boy finally meets the girl. The girl is infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a deadly cyborg. Boy, in turn, also turns into a so-called thing and pursues a quest to save his love. Will he succeed? Who makes fun, as long as there is carnage and death, I am satisfied. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, relatively clich√© but it does its job well enough to steer the film in a bloody confrontation between the two main characters. There is a secondary plot that focuses on how the parasite that infected the girl entered their lives. And yes, fortunately, it shows more violence. I am happy. Playing is what you expect from a film without a budget. It's not really painful for the ears, but it's not a good thing either. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film, besides violence and composure (as I have not already said enough,) are the cyborg drawings. Made by Keita Amemiya, who works to create extravagant creatures and costumes for movies and video games, is well known. The nobroborges, as they are called in "Meatball Machine", are incredibly detailed. Without the use of CGI, Amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal, terribly impressive in appearance. Able to turn different parts of the body into sophisticated weapons such as saws, rocket launchers, shotguns, etc. Although you can easily recognize the low cost of the movie, the stunts are a class of movies A. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixed with "Alien", all in one reduced budget and extra fashion ketchup. It is an extremely entertaining film that ignores modern special effects and proves that the splashing genre is still alive.
