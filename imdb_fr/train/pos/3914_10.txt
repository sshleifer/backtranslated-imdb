Personally, I think the film was done in a very professional way, I loved the choreography and the acting. The plot is also striking and mysterious. The film itself is very moving and what I liked the most is that it makes you think then. Antonio Gades has absolutely lived his role until the end, and I must say that this is one of my favorite photos and Saura is a great director.
