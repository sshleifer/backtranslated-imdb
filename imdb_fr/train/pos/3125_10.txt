The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After an exciting series of two, we get the last installment. Here's what I think: <br /> <br /> The Ultimatum Bourne has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) among those who know everything. He has been running for too long. This time, it ends. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has great intrigue, brilliant writing, fantastic direction, suspense and one of the best actions of the summer. Matt Damon probably delivers his best performance so far. He has the conviction and the growing desire of the troubled assassin. <br /> <br /> There is here a certain intelligent humor and a good suspense. The reactions to certain events will make you either laugh (in a good way) or encourage. (or both) I heard a lot of intelligent laughs at the theater and a lot of applause. The audience was delighted. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum delivers everything in a well packaged package. All the goods and then some. This is, in my opinion, the best movie of this summer. <br /> <br /> The last word: Excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. This is how thrillers of summer movies should be made. I like the Bourne trilogy.
