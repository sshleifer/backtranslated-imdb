I have not seen this movie for years, so my knowledge is a little rusty. I remember thinking that this movie was twice Braveheart's movie. It is simply more realistic and has more credible characters. Ridb Roy looks like Rob Roy's imagination: hair in battle and beard with simple clothes. Liam Nesson also has a Celtic air, he looks like a Scotsman and, more importantly, Rob Roy. It's a comparison that annoys some people, but compares it to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson is supposed to play a man whose legend has been described as a giant 6 feet 7 inches, while Gibson is almost a foot less. The story contains a bit of romance, conspiracy and an underdog story. It sounds like Braveheart? But instead of a film that calls "freedom", freedom and nationalism, we get a film about honor, love and justice. This makes it a more interesting movie. Just like Gladiator. The distribution is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this business. The story is great with the way she treats heroism and humanity. The scene where Mary is raped and she comes out of the house in flames with an air of true Scottish strength is followed by the fact that she washes the sperm from her crotch in extreme panic. It's something that a heroine in Braveheart would never do. Overall, it's a breathtaking and almost flawless watch. Go see him!
