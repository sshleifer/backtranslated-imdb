It's the only movie I saw Prince in, but it does not matter. And I thought he was only good for singing boy if I was wrong. This is probably his best performance. The music is great. That's why he won the Oscar in 1984 for the best music for a movie (or something like that). Now he has an Oscar and Grammy to his credit. Although the curse hinders the flow of the film (just make sure there are no little children in the room). There is not much to say without revealing the plot. You should really go out and get this movie your collection is not complete unless you get this movie in. What else could I say except to see this movie now!
