I watched this movie three times. Last time, I continued to jump through disturbing scenes to find the resolution of the plot. Maybe the plot is not meant to stay logical between them. Or maybe these difficult points are in the plot, because Ann's reminder of distant events is rather wrong. <br /> <br /> Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who attended an anonymous university with the roots of a wealthy family. She had to have help to pay for this very expensive education, but never seems to have a family connection. She never seems to have a family to turn to when the consequences of one of her catastrophic decisions come into effect. <br /> <br /> Ann shares an evening of passion with her great love, Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Then, when Harris comforts Lila after the tragic death of her brother Buddy, Ann finds him suddenly repulsive and disgusted with his own behavior. I had to miss something important here. Ann's behavior seems totally inexplicable. Ann abandons her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of Lila's wedding boys. Despite Ann's rejection of Harris, she continues to feel deep feelings for him on her deathbed. <br /> <br /> It was obvious from his behavior that Harris was deeply in love with Ann and would have happily married her. A scene showing their chance encounter years after Lila's wedding showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> The film showed a typical pattern of Ann's romantic relationships. She always had a fight with her men and she rejected them. This model held with Harris and two husbands. On the other hand, Lila married a man she did not like and she stayed with her husband until his death. Maybe Lila was able to bond because she refused to let her marriage fail. <br /> <br /> Then came the too convenient reappearance of Lila Ross at Ann's bedside. Apparently, Ann's nurse was able to extract enough information from Ann's last lucid moments to identify and contact Lila. None of these communications appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> I kept asking myself about the house where Ann lived during her last days. How could she buy such a house with the meager earnings of her singing career? Ann has always seemed to be one step ahead of the financial disaster while raising her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I really enjoyed the setting and the music of the film. The seaside mansion was so beautiful. Claire Danes was bright like the young Ann Grant. She is really a talented singer. I much prefer her natural brunette to the look of blonde bottle she had in the extras of the film. If only these creepy fireflies of CGI were to disappear, I could raise the film throughout my vote!
