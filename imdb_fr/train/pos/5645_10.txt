I bought the DVD game on an Amazon.com recommendation based on my other interests. They put their finger on the nail with this one. I remember watching the show on television, but I always wondered what had happened to him. Ten years later, it's like we're seeing everything for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as sheriff Lucas Buck are good together, although they are somewhat rivals. Almost representing good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood exactly what Lucas was supposed to be, but suffice it to say that he has special powers that I do not think have been granted by anything Saint. It can make phones ring, write, or even change a person's emotions. Nevertheless, there are some episodes where he actually becomes the good guy anyway. All in all, it's an excellent series that, like many others, is quite imaginable (IE Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV, to name a few) has been canceled well before their time. The dead zone of Steven King (Sunday American Network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to do it. There is nothing good to watch on TV. Indeed, everything about Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be immediately removed from the television. In the meantime, I will continue to buy DVDs and watch programs that should stay on television but have been ejected from TV by religious fanatics so we can watch "quality" shows like Family Guy, American Dad and The Simpsons a bunch of shit that is).
