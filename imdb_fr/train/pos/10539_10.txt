It's a good movie, but it's not recommended if you do not like smart movies. These are two types that want the world to go away, and that's exactly what they have. The acting is awesome, the end was not predictable and there was a good story unlike most movies nowadays. People complain about the film too simple or too boring. I think they should just stick to movies like The Toxic Avenger (I actually like B movies) or The Grim Adventures by Billy and Mandy. One note: if you notice this, it has exactly the same Cube players except for four actors. Make two notes: wait after the credits (Believe me on this one). Enjoy the movie.
