I thought the original of this movie was quaint and charming, as well as sitting on the edge of my seat trying to understand it. <br /> <br /> Since I already saw the original, when I saw this Sci Fi Channel - I do not know if this remake was deliberately designed for Sci Fi - I knew what it was was in the very first minutes. Since I like Richard Burgi as a character actor, I wanted to see how he would cope. <br /> <br /> The writers / producers, etc., have modernized the film a little while trying to explain the fate of the "aliens" "(They could no longer reproduce their own species and needed help) using the same pseudo-science that stuffed our ears in the '90s. Maybe that improved the movie a bit, or not. <br /> <br /> This film. This production takes a more sinister aspect than the original one.The original resulted in a confrontation between the young woman and the stranger and a kind of understanding had taken place, although no resolution of the problem of the Alien no was found. <br /> <br /> I remember somehow that in this remake, the woman became rather hostile to the Burgi / Alien - I think it could have ended better. is that the end, and the thread is an inflated yarn, part of the stock of science fiction pulp stock of 1958. Many great stories of Fiction-fiction were written in the 50s and some of them even managed to be filmed. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic thing to watch like a rainy day or something like that. I really appreciate it because all the Sci Fi remakes of the 50's are very successful. It's a pleasure for me. <br /> <br /> But if anyone really wants this story to be told, I suggest the original 1958 version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
