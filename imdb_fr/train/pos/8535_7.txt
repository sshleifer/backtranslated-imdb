This work is a daring look at the mentality of men who find themselves in a wheelchair. This film never seeks to calm him, cotton candy or soap mild to the anguish, confusion and pain of the lives of these men. That's his strength, I think. <br /> <br /> But even more, the performances are fantastic, with well-crafted and well-delivered dialogues that draw you in and make you feel part of the experience. The characters never try to prevent the audience from knowing what's bothering them, what's in their hearts. <br /> <br /> I found it painful, but nice. <br /> <br /> He gives a rating of 6.6 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the demon :.
