Much richer in texture and character than even the classics of the '30s and' 50s. George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge, just as he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott will be recognized as one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century. The character of Scrooge played by Mr. Scott seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought to the screen a richer Scrooge, more robust and even more moving than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man of the 18th century in London. Mr. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal level, understandable but extremely confrontational; his role was played with the great authority that Scott always brings to the screen: yet his usual bellicose voice was sometimes interpreted as a whisper, almost like a soliloquy, as he described the Christmas holidays in one breath, while revealing his own human frailty. in his next line. It could represent the sour and crisp Scrooge, and a misunderstood and sympathetic Scrooge in the same scene. <br /> <br /> Really a remarkable performance from a giant of his generation.
