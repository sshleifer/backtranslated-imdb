Peter Sollett has created an engaging portrait of real people living in poverty on the Lower East Side of New York, or Loisaida, as the locals call it. <br /> <br /> Mr. Sollett's heart is in the right place to examine this dysfunctional family typical of the country's various "city centers". Mr. Sollett emphasizes the positive in the story he presents. They are basically good children, the children of parents who left them and whose grandmother took him under his wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting his characters as losers, Mr. Sollett shows a positive side they all have. These children do not take drugs or steal because they are poor. If this story had been made by Hollywood, we would have seen stereotypes march instead of children in trouble, but in the end, they would not be defeated. <br /> <br /> Victor Rasuk, like Victor Vargas, was a revelation. It is a natural. So, July Marte. Her character shows us a sensible girl who will not be fooled or pushed to do anything she does not want to do. Altagracia Guzman, as the grandmother is excellent. She expresses her frustration at not being able to lead her grandchildren in the areas she believes in and which are so important to her. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was an excellent photo thanks to Peter Sollett.
