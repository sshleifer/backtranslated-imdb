/ * Light spoilers * / <br /> <br /> Long ago, before Evangelion, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and a name well known to many fans of cartoons, and before Gainax reached Fanfavorite status, Gunbuster was created. With only Wings of Honneamise manufactured by Gainax at this time and the famous Otakon shorts or well-being, Gunbuster was hard to follow. It did not help him by choosing a genre that had been practiced many times before, the space opera. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Gainax decided to publish it as an OAV in six parts video) series. This allows the series to have a larger range than would have been possible if it had been transformed into a movie. This also prevents it from becoming too boring and excessively long, with lots of unnecessary battles and loads along the way. In addition, they made efforts to stay away from the tested space opera mechanisms used in Macross or Gundam, as well as many other popular space operas. <br /> <br /> For one, the shows begin in a rather clear light, with Noriko in Okinawa High School for the mechapilote. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle while still a small child. This makes her life at the academy very difficult, as some of her classmates begin to suspect that Noriko is favored by the teachers. The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and the decor of the school. Things change quickly when the threat of an extraterrestrial invasion is announced and Noriko and Kazumi (best girl in the class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet come out. <br /> <br /> Most of Gunbuster leaves our female lead gap, focusing on personal drama and action. Some other characters are introduced and parts of Noriko's past are again dragged. On top of that, the extraterrestrial threat is becoming more and more imminent and the Gunbuster, the last hope of humanity, is presented. Like the writer Okada, he incorporated the principles of time dilation to spice things up a bit. In short, time passes more slowly for those traveling at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that lasts almost a century. The dramatic aspect is also accentuated when Noriko revisits her friends on her return to the base, who have considerably older her. The science may not be perfect, but it is presented in a rather credible way, with even a few scientific theater short films between episodes, where Noriko, Kazumi and their coach give a brief description of the scientific principles used in the science. series. <Br /> <br /> The animation, for a series made in the 80's, is definitely good. The drawings are retro 80, of course, but it has charm. The animation is fluid enough and the character design is nice, although the costumes betray some of the fascination of the service fans that Gainax will later exploit to the fullest. The mechas throughout the concerts are also pretty cool, with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, powerful and vast. The last episode was entirely made in black and white. Although it is generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budgetary reasons, it gives the series a totally different atmosphere, which is perfectly fine for the last part. <br /> <br /> Music is a very typical space. opera fair. Too ambitious in places, very generic, and certainly not worth buying. Most of the time, this is the series, but sometimes it can get pretty boring. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series he's worked on is Dragon Half. If you think 80's cartoon music will let you know what to expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, the focus moves slowly from drama to space opera to epic battles, but the viewer will barely notice this. Step by step, the drama fades and battles take the lead. However, neither aspect is completely left out. With the latest episode in sight, Noriko and her team are fighting for the continued existence of the human race, and with the last fight in sight, some questions are presented to the public, regarding the position of the human race in the galaxy and the distance that separates them. he can go to guarantee self-preservation. Although they never receive an answer later, they still offer some interesting lines of thought. The last episode is very epic, with a nice end, but quite predictable, although all endings should not contain many strange twists of course. Once again, this corresponds to the series. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster may seem to be your middle-space opera anime, with alien invasions, gigantic battles, and some personal dramas, and for the most part, it's. But this is exceptionally good for a change. Instead of looking for a regular mix of six-episode old elements, Gunbuster presents a shift from small-scale drama to large-scale epic heroism. Along the way, we meet various interesting and well-developed characters, whose mutual relations change considerably due to the phenomenon of temporal dilation. The show is very tight, although it tends to slip at times. Too dramatic events and cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided. Overall, the trip that Gunbuster makes you live is very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic. It might not have broken the boundaries and boundaries of the space opera genre, but at least it has bent them a bit. Classic anime very nice, but not without flaws. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
