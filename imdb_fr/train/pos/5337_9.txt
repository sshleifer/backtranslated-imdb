It could be the remake of the tale of autumn 1987 after eleven years, as the director Mabel Cheung has claimed. Mabel uses rock music as a means of expression in this film to express her personal attitude to life, in which love, desire and frustration play a crucial role. Rock music may not be the best way to convey a deep feeling, but it's not too inappropriate to use it, because the lives of underground rock musicians are much more intense than ordinary ones. The director focuses on depicting the subtle affection and ultimate vanity of life rather than rock music. The love between father and son, lovers and friends is delicately and touchingly delivered through the beautiful performance. Mabel does not try to embellish rock musicians as artists, but rather to reproduce real life on screen, making enormous efforts of years of work on this project and gathering information in underground pubs from Beijing. <br /> <br /> Daniel probably got the best performance in all his films made so far. His innate discouragement and reticence fit in perfectly with the blue atmosphere of the film.
