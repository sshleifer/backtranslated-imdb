Two great comedians in a great film by Neil Simon based on his hit piece. <br /> <br /> Beautiful combination, especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and Burns. It's no wonder Burns won an Oscar for this. he is always so lively and funny. And Matthau is quite his match, if a little more crotchety. <br /> <br /> This is the territory of Simon familiar: two old partners of vaudeville find themselves for a TV special but can not support themselves after all these years. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to watch these two choices one above the other, their scenes together make this movie a real delight. Myself, I particularly appreciated the "knock, knock, knock / entry!" scene. And if you're a fan of Burns or Matthau, you'll love it too. <br /> <br /> In fact, you will enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put a little "sun" in your life.
