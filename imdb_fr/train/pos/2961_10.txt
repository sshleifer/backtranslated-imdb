This is the only film by David Zucker that does not distort anything very first. The funniest movie of 98 with Night at the Roxbury just behind But I did not think anything about Mary was funny, so it does not matter, except for the frank thing and beans he, he. Do not listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert, he does not know the solid entertainment, just look at his critics. In any case, you will not be disappointed.
