Erroll works for the Department of Public Safety and his job is to control sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes the boundaries of his job and strikes sex offenders. I do not blame him but his boss is ready for retirement so Allison arrives. Erroll is training him to do his job and it's like an observation job. Allison is a bit naive about this work at first, but she does not realize how much she is really in danger and that's all Erroll's fault. He begins to go too far with his obsession with finding a missing girl when his job is not to be a police officer. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent film about a crazy guy who pushes the limits and works outside his "field of practice". Erroll did a good job but in the interests of Allison's safety. It's also a good mystery and just when I realized it was more than that.
