Julia's Dream was the title of the original script and was shot in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the photo, they change the original name in Cuba Libre. The director's cup lasted three and a half hours. He went out at the Bangkok festival in Thailand. It was Gael Garc√≠a Bernal's second film (the first was Amores Perros) <br /> <br /> and Juan Gerard's first as director. In the poster, the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares do not appear. Diana plays grandmother and Cecilia the child's mother. They are great actresses and they recall the story especially Diana. Check it in other things you would be surprised.
