question: how to steal a scene from the expert stage thieves expert Walther Mathau in full, furious and brilliant mode of Grumpy Old Man? answer: quietly, impassive, and with perfect timing like George Burns does here. <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about the Vaudeville but it's still a favorite movie, the two main movies are hilarious, the story is funny, the direction and the stimulation very good. Richard Benjamin is very funny as a heterosexual man - he tries to get burns out the window, etc. Even the small parts are great. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny scenes, Mathau spoiling the ad, Burns repeating his answers like senile ... <br /> <br /> A delight. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
