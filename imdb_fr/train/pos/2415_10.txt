I am totally addicted to this show. I can not wait for the week to see the next show. it's a beautiful story and she has the best actors and actresses in the series. I'll tune in every week to watch it, even though I'm not at home, I still have my VCR set to tape monarch cove. Simon Rex is the best actor in the series. it's suspensful and exciting. I think this show should stay on the air and I think everyone should listen to it. I saw the very first episode and in fact I was not going to watch it but I was watching for one day and I decided to watch it because it was on and I absolutely love it and it's now My favorite tv show. I am really mean.
