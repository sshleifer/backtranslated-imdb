A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodling pad. A superb cast that mixes with an intriguing plot under the influence of Twin Peaks in director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows very well a man in a stalemate who is looking for the right thing to do. J.T. Walsh (RIP for a great actor) is still a wonderful villain, as is Dennis Hopper. It's such a shame that he has never distinguished himself in business. I'm sure he has his supporters, though. In summary, it's an excellent movie that shows you that you do not need a big-bang or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining movie.
