when you add up all the aspects of the film - dance, singing, acting - the only one that stands out as the best in the cast is Vanessa Williams ... her dedication, energy and timeless beauty make her Rosie the perfect role for her. I have never seen anyone portray Rose with such dynamism! Vanessa's talent in singing is beautiful with all the songs she plays as Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! Her dance is so amazing, even though, as some say, the choreography was bad - her dancing skills have been displayed better than ever! I would recommend this version to the 196 version simply because I find that, although long, the game of actors by Vanessa is superb ----- without mentioning the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are also very impressive ( with the exception of Chynna Philips ... what did they think of when they threw it?) <br /> <br /> In the end, I would say that this version is beautiful and I recommend everyone to see this version!
