I watched this movie a few times and found it very good. This film is also called "Castle of Terror", "Coffin of Terror" and "Dance of Death". Barbara Steele, is her usual beautiful beautiful / scary. George Rivi√®re, the male leader, is doing a good job with his role. The whole film is dripping with atmosphere and there is a lot of tension. The camera angles are good and the acting is usually not bad. This film is perfect for rainy days or evenings. I have the uncut DVD version, which is far superior to the TV mounted version. Take some popcorn, turn off the lights, sit back and enjoy. John R. Tracy
