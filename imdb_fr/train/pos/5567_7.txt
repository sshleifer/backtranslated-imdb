And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this film to make it suitable for television was very ill-advised. ALL THAT CONCERN DRUGS IS CUT AND COVERED !!! How do they do, you could ask? Well, they do not do it very well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of marijuana that Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession, they would have diamonds! Yet the characters are walking in a cloud of marijuana smoke that stones other people along their way, without any explanation!
