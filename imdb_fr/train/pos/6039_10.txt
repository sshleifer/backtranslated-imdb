Had the chance to be an extra in this great movie and loved every minute of the shoot. I went to the Prime Minister in London and had a great conversation with Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon, just like my wife. A fantastic after-party too. A few weeks later, we went to the cinema with members of our cycling club. What a brilliant film he deserves to be among the best biker movies. Now we have the DVD Sue, my wife can not have enough children. Get a club shot that seems to think I'm a movie star now. We can only dream. I think they are just jealous. The only drawback of the first part of the shoot was the weather, the rain, the rain and more rain, but hey, we were in Wales. I hope there will be a follow-up, so keep me informed, Jon. Danny Beck
