This review comes with nearly 30 years late. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that I came across a copy of this movie in early 2008 and have watched it repeatedly for 4 consecutive months! I just had to write about it! I fell in love with it and forgot all that existed once I saw this film. How ironic it is to see the ugliest male protagonist in literature portrayed by the most handsome man! yet, what a welcome irony! It suited me perfectly, especially since Timothy Dalton has done justice to his role. He delivered an amazing and triumphant performance! I have never seen anything like it! All the other actors are very good too. The entire movie has been beautifully set up. I do not care what anyone says about this movie. I love it and I love it! It made me happy and satisfied. It hurts me a bit to say that, but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to A & E's P & J, which I think is the ultimate mini-series. <br /> <br /> Excerpts from Jane Eyre scared me a little at school. I never had the time to read the book seriously, knowing the story so well. Seeing this production in particular, the story came to life for me and led me to a frenzy almost. The scenes and the voice of Mr. Dalton haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously, which, of course, is a masterpiece. Congratulations to all the team and especially Mr.Dalton !! This film is now part of me. <br /> <br /> I give it a score of 10/10.
