All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... if you're even "PC" at a distance or if you do not have a seriously messy sense of humor, you will not get it probably not. As sick and disgusting as this film is, it's really a comedy and not at all a "horror" movie. If you can appreciate someone who pushes the limits of good taste and political correctness to the point where it gets so out of control that it's comical, then you have to see it to believe it. This film is so out of control that a big movie studio could not touch it with a 10-foot stick (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, however, the best and most extreme works of art come from the underground. If you do not stick to the old formula that people are used to seeing, they reject it. <br /> <br /> I saw piles of terrible, boring, quality z movies, Indy type, which was just a waste of a perfectly good VHS or DVD-R tape. I also saw piles of stink bombs from the big name studios that were a total waste of millions of dollars. When a NO BUDGET film like these two films by Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro releases all the other "shock" films, you really have to take a second look at Indy's entire film scene. After seeing this, you can really see how much freedom an Indy filmmaker can have when working on his own. <br /> <br /> What's funny is that even the other people who saw this movie and "hated" him admit they laughed all the time. I do not think it's possible for anyone to be bored looking at one or the other. So, if you do not take everything you've seen in the mainstream media too seriously and you're able to laugh at a misanthropic psychopath and manipulate puppets that eventually cracked, YOU MUST SEE THIS. You may be able to simply see it for the classic cult classic that it is. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites of my collection of more than 1000 DVDs.
