This film is a small ray of sunshine in a dark season. He celebrates a quality described as a simple conviviality. Morgan Freeman plays a character very similar to Freeman himself - a successful actor pushing 70 years. He went to a rather dirty grocery store to find out what role he could play as the manager of such a place. He soon seduces staff and guests, especially the beautiful young woman (Paz Vega) who chairs the "10 items or less" hallway. <br /> <br /> 10 articles or less does not make it have a big statement to make and does not pretend to do it. He follows Freeman and Vega as they become friends, and as the old man offers him his advice, in return for a return home - the gofer of the movie company who is supposed to look for him never presents and Freeman has forgotten his number he can not call for help. I had a little case of blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York and this movie healed what makes me sick.
