I saw him at the cinema MK2 Hautefeuille just one night after his first public screening in Paris. A very nice film about three teenagers of 15 years, all about at the same psychological stage. Many scenes allowed us to return to our teenage years and our first feelings about sex. one can imagine that the director would like to reduce the first sensations of girls to lesbianism, but even in this case, it does not corrupts the probability of the story. You can sometimes find the film a little slow but that's what creates this intimate atmosphere. I finance young talented actresses, special mention with Floriane and Marie, very convincing. There are a lot of small details but this film also allowed me to discover what synchro is: impressive!
