I recently saw I.Q. and although I'm not a romantic comic girl, I think it was just a nice movie to watch. In my opinion, many films lack honesty. Do you know that feeling when you're watching a movie and you just feel stolen because it draws something from the story and it feels like the director has thrown it away as if it's a junk? The story between scientists is sweet and fun. How they stayed together and they tried to help the character of Tim Robbins to become intelligent. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and I raised a good point about love, "nothing is what it seems." I recommend it for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
