Known for the first time with Drunken Master, Jackie Chan was once again honored with Project A 1983, an extremely enjoyable pirate film that restored her as a major star. By the time Police Story was released two years later, the extraordinary hype surrounding Jackie was reaching its peak, and the crowd was hurrying to see this frantic mix of impressive stunts, brutal fight scenes and dubious comedy. He broke many box office records and inspired a 50% increase in the number of police recruits, but, 20 years later, is he good? <br /> <br /> As an action movie, Police Story stands out without a doubt. There are several fantastic fight scenes, some stunts reminiscent of the best of Chan's hero, Buster Keaton, and a decisive but overly violent battle. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and while the frequent incursions into the laborious comedy somewhat lessen the impact of the film, her charisma carries it. In addition, by presenting our hero as a limit psychopath whose carelessness puts others in danger, Jackie has made a gigantic bet ... although in the case where no one seems to have noticed! In praising Police Story as a simple "Good Against Evil" fight, critics have downplayed the film's ambiguity in tone. Although it was not the Karamazov brothers, the film nevertheless represented a noticeable and commendable change from conventional ideas. <BR/> <br /> In short, it's still a quality "popcorn" movie * (even if you can empty your stomach as many bad guys are pushed or dropped into glass showcases in the final scene of the movie ) - a powerful and entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its time.
