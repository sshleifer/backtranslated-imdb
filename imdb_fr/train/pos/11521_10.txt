The wizards are a wonderful hike from beginning to end, largely thanks to the magic generated by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades. Like any good film, it is a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of the dream. I can not believe that this movie is so hard to find - I would buy it on DVD without delay, but I have not found a point of sale yet.
