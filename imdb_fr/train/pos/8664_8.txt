Steely, the mighty Supreme Gangster Frankie Diomede (the always formidable Lee Van Cleef in a rugged and rude form) has himself been arrested and sent to jail to be able to eliminate a treacherous partner without being detected. Tony Breda (a kind portrait of Tony Lo Bianco) is also trapped. Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank out of the joint and assists him in his quest to take revenge on a group of rival gangsters led by the ruthless Louis Annunziata (played unhindered by Jean Rochefort). The director Michele Lupo, from a captivating screenplay by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, tells the story at a steady pace, maintains a jerky, but sometimes light, tone and stages the catchy action with a a considerable number of scenes. (A shower fight in the prison and a prolonged pursuit rate of the race around the world as thrilling highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco present attractive and attractive screen chemistry; the relationship between their characters is both funny and touching. The lovely Edwige Fenech does not have much to do as Tony's sneaky girlfriend, but at least manages to unveil her incredibly gorgeous and voluptuous body in a popular free nude shower scene. Synchronous, rhythmic, rhythmic and rhythmic funk / jazz music by Riz Ortolani hits the spot. The neat cinematography of Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is also impressive. A small winner really cool and entertaining.
