It's not an easy-to-watch movie - it lasts more than three and a half hours and is entirely composed of conversations. Yet, it is so incredibly captivating and ruthless to observe the human character that it is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest movies of all time. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something edifying, see Jacques Rivette's fantastic Céline and Julie Go Boating, which were made around the same time). This shows that the idealism of the late 1960s is no different from the society it was trying to change. <br /> <br /> This is a household of three supposedly freed between Alexander (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud). , Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Françoise Lebrun). Yet Alexander is as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. Women are exposed as voluntarily submissive and defining their femininity through the male gaze. <br /> <br /> The film is an extremely icy end to the revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in the history of cinema and had a profound effect on the cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key players in the Nouvelle Vague, having notably played François Truffaut's influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) as a rebellious teenager. Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as the other directors of the New Wave, but he should be. <br /> <br /> There is no improvisation (unlike similar John Cassavetes films shot in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. The film resonates with Eustache's personal experiences. For example, Françoise Lebrun was an old lover of Eustache. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981, and the real-life person on whom the character of Mary was based also did. Anger and bitterness culminate in Veronika's heartbreaking monologue, presented directly to the public, dispelling the cold and objective character of the rest of the film. This fascinating, personal and honest film statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature.
