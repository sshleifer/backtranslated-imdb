I read in most of the comments posted here and all I can say is that most of these posters have major issues in life. This show, unlike most game shows, was fun. Mr. Shatner, whose talent in EVERYTHING he does, was again the hit of the series. His bubbly personality shines like a lighthouse wherever he goes. It's fun and makes you smile & that's exactly what the show does too. The dancers and the questions, the round fashion they are presented only add to the attraction of the shows. And even if there is a lot of money involved, it's fun. The pressure (stress) that exists in most game shows does not exist here. Several people who posted messages complained about the time available to the dancers and the choice of questions, etc., as Millionaire does not waste his time in the same way. All I can say is that most of you have missed the whole concept. The idea here is to have fun and have fun. There is something for every taste. Questions to test your knowledge, eye-candy, suspense, the wonderful fun personality of Mr. Shatner ... Well, if it does not raise guys, I feel bad for you; and if that's not enough, you can get rich! I really miss the show. Of all the game shows that have been broadcast, and to be quite frank, I hate game shows, it's the one I really liked and I really miss. The only other game show I ever liked was Match Game.
