That's why I like this site so much! I saw this film in the 1980s on British television. Over the years, I would have liked to know more, because it is one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen in my life. With just a few key words to remember, I've traced the film here, along with plenty of information, including the fact that it's about to become an off-Broadway musical! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike the previous commentator, I do not remember finding this movie sad or exploitative. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter has remained engraved in the spirit as a testimony of great strength, honor and dignity. Ironic, you can think, given the misery of their lives. It may be because I live in Britain, where vanished grandeur occupies a preponderant place in the life of an old money, where misery is often tolerated as proof of the quality of reproduction. I saw it as a rare and unique representation of an enormous spirit, a deep and deep humor, whose extremely fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it balance and respect. In a way, I was sorry to see him being discussed as a "cult". Over the years, as it faded into my head, it shone like an exceptional and exceptional television experience. It was a presentation so deeply private, it seems strange to think that it becomes so public that it's a New York musical. But maybe somewhere, the girl will be amused by such a result. She's the one with the last laugh, maybe ... (They did a musical in front of her, Jackie O ')
