In fact, some campers were accidentally sent into space by a robot. And the oxygen in the ship was missing. They had to send someone to a space station to get the fuel tanks, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot of this movie is not possible in real life. But it gives a warm impression of all that is possible if you commit. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to see these young actors who always look the same after so many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in 2000, it was shot in 1986) There are quite a few people in this movie still working in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The view was superb from Cosmos. It does not seem unreal. It lasts about 2 hours, it runs so fast that you will not even notice it. You know it's not real, but you end up there until the end. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good family film. <br /> <br />
