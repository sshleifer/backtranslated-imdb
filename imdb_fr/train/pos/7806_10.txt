"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical narrative, a heroic story and an overview of the cultural context of a major event in history. Denzel Washington does not only do a great job imitating a motivated and determined hero, Steve Biko, but he also delivers a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader and his main "influence", Donald Woods, is heartbreaking. But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of an apparently disturbing conspiracy. It's thanks to great films like this that the public can be sensitized to the terrible events of history, to the great leaders who have tried to put an end to it, and to the way we can never let them reproduce. Because of this importance, "Cry Freedom" is an amazing movie that should be seen by all.
