Gerard Philipe's superb star, who died much too young, comes out of the screen in this witty, witty and witty comedy, which is teeming with sword scams and antics. Charming loop in his story, impossible to resist. A sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as love. A film that will be remembered with great affection.
