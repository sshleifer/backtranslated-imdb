The Last Hunt is one of the few westerns ever created to deal with buffalo hunting, both as a sport and economic activity and as a way to win the plains Indian wars. Before the white man set foot on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains had herds of American bison the size of some of our larger cities. At the time of the production of The Last Hunt, the buffalo had been virtually eliminated. Thanks to the efforts of environmentalists, the 20th century saw a rebirth of the population, but not as before. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger play together in a second film. and this one is far superior to all the brothers were Valiant. Here, Stewart Granger is the good guy, a tired buffalo hunter all over the world, who has to find work he hates for financial reasons. <br /> <br /> The partner he chose to partner with is Robert Taylor. Forgetting Taylor for the moment, I doubt there has ever been a more wicked and meaner soul than Charlie Gilsen, which Taylor represents. In Devil's Doorway, he was a Native American fighting the prejudices aroused by a racist played by Louis Calhern. In The Last Hunt, he's the racist here. He kills buffaloes and Indians for pure pleasure. He kills an Indian family when they steal his mules and take away the widow of a prisoner. As a barbaric conqueror, he expects the pleasure of sexual favors from Debra Paget. He's really crazy when Paget does not see him that way. <br /> <br /> No matter how often they refer to Russ Tamblyn as a half-breed, I've never really been convinced he's Indian. This is the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> However, Lloyd Nolan, the old gray skinner, Taylor and Granger, is just awesome. Nolan steals every scene where he is. <br /> <br /> For those who love the western, who want to see a side of Robert Taylor never seen on screen and do not like cheap heroes, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.
