The production of good old spooky movies I really miss. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory had been commissioned to produce such a film, it was perhaps this one, with the exception of the absence of a leading international cast. It's one of those movies that you watch alone on a dark night with pizza and popcorn, and you do not even bother doing the dishes until the morning, you just want to hide under the covers. Congratulations to director Herbert Wise, screenwriters Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, Jon Bunker's best set design, John Ralph's artistic direction, and an excellent cast to make me shudder and feel so isolated even though I live in one of the most populous cities in the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave him a "9" on "10" because, with the production and budget constraints of the television, they really shot an excellent show.
