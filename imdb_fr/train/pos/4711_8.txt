Oh, what a pleasure there is here! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has the flair for comedy making (Fast Times at High Ridgemont, Look Who's Talking), but here it looks like she told actors to have fun. Micheal Keaton plays Johnny, easily his best on-screen performance. Joe Piscopo is great as Danny Vermin, who is aptly named. What a pity the administrators did not notice. And I even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the unique vocabulary of the character. I do not think it's a coincidence that the bulk of the character's name is spelled MORON. <br /> <br /> Good lines are scattered throughout the film, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner. Even actors with minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get on well. <br /> <br /> recommend it to a friend.
