When I saw commercials for that, I thought "NO WHAT A NICK AT NITE DONE!" because he was taking slot machines "new prince". Well, I still love the cool prince. but George Lopez is a surprisingly good show. I like how benny is not stereotyped. carmen is a very good character, it's really funny to see how stupid and emotional she is. I feel bad for the guy who plays the max, he looks much younger than he really is! but Max is a funny character, and has done well. And yes, Angie is a bit stereotyped, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george has a big head! no, but it can be really good too. funny show! it should definitely be more often than home improvement.
