Since I'm so interested in the monsters of the lake, I really dug this movie. This film is worth the detour. If you like such terrible movies, these are good types of movies. The effects are really good, just think of the "Land of the Lost". In the early '90s, I watched this film perhaps more like 89/90 in a local chain monster show called "Morgus Presents". I was not scared but I was 8 years old and all B felt more like an A. Years later, I saw it on a DVD on a Circuit City and bought it right away so I could give him a 9 because he has a personal place in my heart with The Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good movie B fun for all ages.
