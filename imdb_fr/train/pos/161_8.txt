This silly movie is really fun for the young audience. His heroes are a pair of dishonest detectives whose sophisticated attitude leads them on very stupid roads. In pursuing the big murder case, you will see these detectives doing everything they can to solve the crime. No nudity, but a lot of sexual implication, stupid stupidity ... all that teenagers are looking for. Small budget, but very entertaining. Classic cult definite potential.
