As a big fan of the original, I avoided this movie as the scourge when bad reviews began to appear eight years ago, but I just finished watching this movie and I found it it was a very pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Okay, if you are looking for a retreading of the original, you will be disappointed, but if you are looking for something very different, a little edgy and political, the film is for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty-four years old and works as a teacher in her former high school. He is pursued by a fellow teacher and sexually dreams of one of his students. When the student insists on meeting Gregory, it follows a series of mishaps such as torture, break-ins, and all sorts of unexpected twists that left me with a sense of joy and emotion. <br /> <br /> If you look for something original, then I highly recommend this movie. I only hope that more people went to see this when it was released and saw it as it is.
