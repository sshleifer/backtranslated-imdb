Yes, this is an anthology horror movie and it was very entertaining! Indeed, even though the film was clearly horrible, some stories were light-hearted - and there were even a few laughs. This is not a bad thing at all, because sometimes horror movies are a bit stifling and too serious. For this reason and because the four stories were pretty good, this is one of the best movies of this style I've seen. <br /> <br /> The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself. Four different stories involve people renting the house or investigating what happened to the tenants. <br /> <br /> The first segment featured Denholm Elliott as a horror writer who has the writer's block. So, to change the setting, they rent this house. Almost immediately, Elliott's block disappears and he is constantly working on a story about a serial killer. Surprisingly, shortly after the disappearance of his block, he begins to see his fictional character! Again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears, giving the impression that he is losing his mind. It may just be the best story, because the beautiful end of the film brings the story to life. <br /> <br /> The second, although not bad at all, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who is mourning a friend who passed away some time ago (although his photo was surprisingly contemporary). When he enters a wax museum in the chamber of horrors in town, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and is both fascinated and frightened. Later, a friend (Joss Ackland) visits him and he also sees the figure and is delighted. All of this leads to an end which, frankly, was a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee plays the role of an extremely hard and severe father for a pathetic little girl. For most of this segment, Lee seemed like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his behavior. Although slow, this one ended very well. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was the most silly and aimed to parody the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third "Doctor" of the television series DR. WHO) is a very capricious actor, known for his performances of Dracula. However, according to him, nothing is true and in an impetus of dive, it moves away from the plate to find better accessories for this vampire film. It's actually quite interesting that he played this role, as it seemed natural to Christopher Lee who played Dracula or other vampires a bazillion of times (give or take a few). I appreciated Pertwee's sentence when he basically said that Lee and other recent incarnations of Dracula were all bullshit compared to Bela Lugosi! Maybe that's why Lee did not take this share! Despite some very stupid moments, it was a lot of fun and fun - maybe as good or better than the first segment. <br /> <br /> Considering that the film started and ends so well, had excellent performers and writers, it's hard not to like this movie.
