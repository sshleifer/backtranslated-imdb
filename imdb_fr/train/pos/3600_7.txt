At first glance, I was expecting this film to be nil because I thought the plot was excessively feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in previous comments, I agree that the feminist part of this film does not bother. I never had the idea that the main character exaggerates his position as a woman. It's as if Guzman was portrayed as a person with a spine, unlike his classmates. So I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was pretty good except for the foreseeable end. It might have been a better idea to give a radical twist to the plot so that the viewer is a little more surprised. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez gained his respect by the she has ranged her character. I can not really explain why, but especially in love scenes, she convinced me. I think it sounded real. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 7 out of 10, just because of the painful last hour.
