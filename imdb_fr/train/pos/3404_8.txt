The spectators of 1936 must have been amazed at what they were watching: a beautiful Technicolor film in its own right. I can not say for sure, but it could have been the first (3 bands). Anyway, more than 70 years later, it is still beautiful on DVD. In fact, the quality of the appearance is incredible. <br /> <br /> We must congratulate Richard Boleslowski, Director of Photography, Virgil Miller, Director of Photography, Selznick International Pictures and, for the DVD - MGM Home Entertainment. All these elements combined to give us one of the most beautiful films of the classical era. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was mediocre: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. This finally gave a good message, even though it did not please many people. I can not say more without messing things up. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich has never been so beautiful, I do not think so, and certainly has never played such a soft character ("Domini Enfilden"). The beating heart Charles Boyer was the male star and the object of affection of Domini, but some of the minor characters were the most interesting for me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as "Batouch"; John Carradine as "The Sand Diviner"; The most memorable, at least for me, was the dancer "Irena", performed by Tilly Losch. Wow, there is a face and a dance that you will not forget anytime soon! I have never seen anything like it in the thousands of movies I've watched. Just seeing her doing her thing was worth the price of the DVD. Looking at her IMDb curriculum vitae, she only appeared in four films, but they were all well-known films. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, the actor who has become truly famous for his role in "Sherlock Holmes" is also here. just like C. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his time. Schildkraut, by the way, will be recognized by classic moviegoers as the man who has played the arrogant salesman in the hit "The Shop Around The Corner" with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> The beautiful direction, the photography and the colors, as well as Tilly's dance, are the things that I will remember most about this movie that includes a lot of good and bad things. If the last half hour had been better - even if I admire the end - I would have rated it even better. It is clear that movie collectors want to add to their collection.
