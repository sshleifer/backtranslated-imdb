The first of Jim Thompson's two adaptations published in 1990 (the other being the best-known of the GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all the characteristics of Thompson: dangerous women, the game of trust and characters who are not so weak that others suspect them. to be, or not, so harmless. <br /> <br /> Jason Patric is superb as a former boxer who has been banned from the sport for life because of an incident in the ring (director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire footage to flesh out the story of delay) and the unrecognized Rachel Ward also delivers a superb performance. But Bruce Dern is the secret weapon of the film: his uncle Bud, his sweet wig, subtly controls each of his scenes. <br /> <br /> there is almost no comic relief in this movie, so watch it ready to be sucked into the void.
