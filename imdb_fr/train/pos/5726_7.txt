"The Grudge" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of popular Japanese horror movies. Shimizu knows he's not doing anything new. So he does what a smart person would do in his place: he forgets the logic and focuses to offer viewers a fun ride. He uses known clich√©s associated with ghost stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative way. The nonlinear story is not a simple gadget but an interesting way to present sequences from different angles. In the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience (in the same way that a comedy is to make people laugh), then film was successful. I watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see the audience go wild on this one. It probably does not play as well in your living room.
