At first, I did not like it much, even though I loved it. They did not include the third generation Trueba, the love between Blanca and Pedro was not well explained and some actors were too different from what I had imagined. <br /> <br /> Later, I realized that the film had been more faithful to the book, it would have lasted about five hours and would have been tedious. Now, I like it a lot, because my favorite characters are there as I have worn them. Clara really looks like a live angel and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the film was fantastic, faithful and concise. Glenn Close is Ferula. I described it like that, but not in mourning during the whole process. Esteban is quite found. I never really liked his character and, even though I was interested in him, I hated him a lot, especially when he was hitting Clara. As in the book, the last part is the most exciting, and it also has a real story. <br /> <br /> The film is really good, especially since it was a gringo film based on a Latin American. book. It's amazing how many famous stars you do not think?
