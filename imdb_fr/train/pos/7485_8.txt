I had heard about not very good things about this movie and I had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today, they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and I had nothing better to do ... and it turned out that I would have had a hard time finding something better to do. Vanilla Sky is a scary movie, sad and touching, in fact one of the best I've seen in all time. I was surprised by the way I was assigned to watch it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie, your feelings about the characters and your perception of what's happening are changing and the journey is quite moving. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a very rare way for a movie or any other medium. <br /> <br /> I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.
