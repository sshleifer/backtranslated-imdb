To anyone who might think this show is not for them, try it out. Network television has degenerated into programs that are clone clones or reality shows featuring often unreal people. This show is a return to family television where the focus is on learning life lessons, on what are real friends and family and maybe even more on our national hobby. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most attractive young performers in the field of performance, and he plays the role of the young batboy a bit naive for the fictional New York Empires (a great name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the main cast. They are all exceptional. This show deserves a chance to seize and be seen. Hopefully this will last a few seasons and we can watch Pete Young (the character of Sumpter) learn and grow.
