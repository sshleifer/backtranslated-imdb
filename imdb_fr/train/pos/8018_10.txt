In this movie Muppet, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot are university graduates who have decided to bring their musical to college , Manhattan Melodies, Broadway. Unfortunately, no producer will even meet the Muppets. After being rejected by too many producers, Scooter suggests that the Muppets decide to move on. However, Kermit still thinks he can get his show on Broadway, but after finally doing it and everyone knows that he has sold the show, Kermit is taking amnesia and the others do not know where he is going find. <br /> <br /> This film features many unique scenes, including a live action sequence featuring the Muppet Babies, a Muppet-filled wedding sequence, including the Sesame Street cast and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle). Rock), Scooter as a movie theater usher and a scene where Rizzo and the other rats are preparing breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that more characters have not been included anymore. Of course, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should have been some important roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums, and Lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem in this film as in The Last Season of The Muppet Show. and The Great Muppet Caper, and Mademoiselle Piggys' dog Foo Foo should have been with her too (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also played by Steve Whitmire, played an important role in this film and was not well known at the time).
