This film is another anthology of horror. It's pretty good, but he could have used a little more. I compare it to "The House of Horrors of Dr. Terror", although the title corresponds to this one. He has four stories all connected by a house. The first story is about a writer and his wife moving in. He creates a killer for his latest novel, and then begins to see him roaming around his house. This one is somehow predictable, but it brings some twists in the end. The next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really do not know where he is going. This one features Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the group. This guy buys the house, but this is not the house that takes center stage, but a strange museum of wax. The third story starts pretty well and stars Christopher Lee. This one has him as a rather weird father who seems terribly protective of his daughter. The problem is that once you know what's going on, the story does not end soon enough. It trails a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion. Then the last story is about an actor who buys a coat in a strange little shop. The actor really has what he paid for. Then there's a little story about an officer who is seen throughout the story trying to find out what happened to this actor, then an explanation of why these things happened. Although I'm not very happy with the explanation, I do not think it really explains the story of Cushing. I think they needed a little more history for that one. Overall, it was a series of interesting stories.
