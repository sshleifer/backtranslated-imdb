Michel Serrault, best known for his comic roles in the early part of his acting career, is remarkably successful, even disturbing, in imitating Dr Petiot, a legendary French serial killer. <br /> <br /> It is so credible at any moment of the film that the actor disappears completely behind the character. Only the best perform this feat, and when they do, they are only in a handful of games. <Br/> <br /> The whole story (a true story lived in the twentieth century in France) is so powerful, so sinister: it is a very strong film that we remember for a long time.
