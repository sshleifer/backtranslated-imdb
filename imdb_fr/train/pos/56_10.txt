This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this film was directed by Larry Clark, then this story about a shootout in a school would probably have been shown through the eyes of the murderer and everything that would have led this person to go crazy at first. <Instead, the plot focuses mainly on the consequences of a shootout in a school and the consequences for survivors. <br /> <br /> I had already seen Busy Phillips in other films, but her performance in this film is by far her best. The only other film I saw with Erika Christensen is "Swim Fan", which made me almost want to not watch this movie, but she herself performed very well. <br /> <br /> the few movies I saw were able to make me cry. Believe me when I tell you that it does not happen very often. <br /> <br /> Home Room is a beautiful movie, and that's all there is ...
