If you like wildlife movies, this movie will please you. My wife loves animals and animal films, she particularly likes the parrot in this film. It is for children, but I especially laughed at the humor. The character of the French fashion made me laugh and adds balance to the scenario. It's a Disney movie, with its air of sap, happiness, family, but I like to leave the theater with a positive feeling.
