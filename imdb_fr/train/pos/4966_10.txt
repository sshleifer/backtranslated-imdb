Diego Armando Maradona was sixteen in 1978 when Argentina won the World Cup at home. He was already the biggest star and the greatest player in a country obsessed with football. Everyone had begged Cesar Luis Menotti to play the boy's genie, but the manager thought he was not ready yet. <br /> <br /> History of winning the 1978 World Cup in a convincing way - they did not really need Maradona. This was not the case in 1982. Spain was a catalog of disasters for Argentina. Menotti - who was still smoking - was playing against Diego this time, but the opportunity was too good for such a capricious boy. Maradona signed for Barcelona on June 4, 1982 for an amount of approximately $ 7 million. Nine days later, he played his first game at Camp Nou and Belgium beat Argentina to nothing. It was not a promising start, and although he had scored twice against Hungary in the next match, Maradona will remember the World Cup as the site of his nadir - a gross and petulant foul on the Brazilian Batista at the second round which abruptly ended his tournament. Argentina is world champion. <br /> <br /> But it was all behind him. Maradona had gone through a crazy time in Barca and left in 1984 to join Napoli. It was like he was finally home. The Neapolitan tifosi had done everything to attract Maradona to poor Napoli. Old women's gifts and young boys' pocket money mixed poorly with the Camorra's millions as part of the transfer fee, and the city was determined to make her feel at home. So, at least for the moment, Maradona was El Rey - he brought his Argentine team to Mexico among the favorites and his new manager, Carlos Bilardo, replaced Menotti. <br /> <br /> Maradona is the hero of this story, a winning World Cup machine to a man. In 1982, hundreds of young men had died in a useless battle for the Falkland Islands; The British press now aspired to a rematch (with the same result) in Mexico City. Maradona was still considered with distinction in England, best known for a great performance in Britain during a tour in 1980 that for Spain. But he was still an Argie: the enemy. <br /> <br /> England started well, and Lineker could have scored after just twelve minutes. A key event happened in 8 minutes. Fenwick, the tall and limited English defenseman, had a yellow card - he was now terrified of throwing a challenge around the penalty area. <br /> <br /> After the first 45 minutes of play, the second half started with a bang. Maradona danced forward after 50 minutes but could not find a way to pass. Similarly, Valdano's attempt only touched white shirts. Then the moment of infamy that serves as an epitaph to Diego. Hodge strangely hooked the ball into his own penalty area, Shilton jumped up to claim - but there was Maradona, getting up somehow over the English goalkeeper to put the ball into the goal . How did he do it? Simple: handball. <br /> <br /> The most famous foul in the history of football has been adopted in slow motion. All the spectators waited for Mr. Al-Sharif of Syria to blow for the fault (he had not done it). Shilton looked up and called on the line judge - he returned to the central circle. Unless he kills the pope or becomes the first man to march on Mars, when the great man dies, that moment will be shown first - in a long, slow, slow movement, followed by the joyful look on his face. The next picture will be his next present to the world - the best goal of the World Cup. <br /> <br /> Burruchaga stroked the ball towards Maradona who was dragging on the right side of her half. He races and walks away from Beardsley and Reid. It was the real Diego - he burst through Butcher and attacked Fenwick. Fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack. Normally, he would have aimed his boot somewhere near the thigh of Maradona - of course, he would have received a red card, but who cares? Then Fenwick had a wave of brains - he hesitated and decided to run to Maradona waving his arms - maybe he was trying to put him off? Diego pulled into the box as Fenwick fell. Butcher had rubbed shoulders with the genius as if he were encouraging. Shilton panicked and Maradona turned around and prepared to score. Now Butcher remembered his role and tried to paralyze the Argentinian. He had instead given an extra boost to the shot, which had crashed into the goal. England was coming home. <br /> <br /> During this magical Mexican summer, the world had found a successor in Pele. In fact, the best footballer of all time had been exceeded - Pel√© had been superb in 1958 and 1970, but he had great players all around him. Maradona does not have. 1986 was his World Cup.
