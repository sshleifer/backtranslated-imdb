When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends meet up for the movie night, a movie is put forward: the movie K-911, the third installment of the highly successful K-9 franchise with everyone My favorite father of the television, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> My friends, I knew it was possible to wear a VHS tape, but a DVD ?! This has been played so often that it starts to jump; No kidding! But of course, you will have that when you own a film so charming, so brilliant. <br /> <br /> Of course, we must thank the one and only Tom Hanks for introducing us to the much-loved Cop-Dog genre with Turner and Hooch; However, even this film does not live up to the excellence presented in the three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> According to some accounts, Belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series. Poppy, I say. Although you suspect that a third installment - direct to the video - might not seem interesting to watch, you would be wrong to prove that you are wrong after viewing this quality film. <br /> <br /> I will not do it. give the plot, but I will say that Belushi and his panting partner give their best performance so far - a performance that will make you scream with laughter! It is unfortunate that John Belushi does not see the remarkable progress his brother has made in the theater world. <br /> <br /> I urge your teenage daughter to present this film to her best friend at her next pajama party. Do not forget the chow chow!
