This series could very well be the best Britcom to date, which says a lot about the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbors, to name just two). <br /> <br /> What made Butterflies so superior, even at best, is that it not only illustrates a great classical, classic and intelligent comedy, but also broad horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, with sweetness and in the smallest detail - the great social change that was occurring in Britain over time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this show as a teenager and marveling at everything. The way of life described was remarkable in itself. It was the first time I saw real people using wireless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the sumptuous outfit of the 70's still in North America at the time. Then there were the sets, the storefronts, the cars. These people - even the naive sons, with their philosophical approach to life and their epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated. These were examples of "new Europeans" who would influence life and style around the world in the next decade (1980s). <br /> <br /> Of course, the principle was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone who lived the dream of a suburb could be so unhappy and agitated was revolutionary, especially for North Americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (of course, the situation was described in American films and television, but not with the intensity of the butterflies or the film Montenegro). And if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which she spoke pushed her to the extreme. A potential case that did not really concern sex, or even romance? The butterflies dazzled many people, but some people had to rub their foreheads of disbelief ... at the time anyway. <br /> <br /> Butterflies have proved to be - in many ways - prophetic. He has documented, in advance of his time - post-modern boredom, an omnipresent lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity, generational disconnection and male discontent (perfectly described by the strained father-son relationships). It is unfortunate that this series has not been significantly rediscovered, and it has been recognized that everyone involved has been able to create a meaningful snapshot of a given time and place and to anticipate all the panic and the anxiety to come.
