This film is the one I highly recommend. This is a boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf), wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake, a detention center for boys. There, he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diameter. There, he meets the other boys from the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray and ZigZag). All are digging, not to "build a character," but to find the treasure of Kate Barlow's outlaws. Throughout the film (and the book), Stanley learns more about the past, about himself, and about digging holes. I give a score of 9.5 to this film, because I am very difficult with regard to books, (I want the film to follow the book EXACTLY). But it still worked really well.
