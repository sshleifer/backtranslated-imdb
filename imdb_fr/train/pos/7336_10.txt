This is another fantasy favorite of Ralph Bakshi; after watching it on YouTube, that is. Located in the distant past after the Ice Age, this prehistoric quest is a quest for witchcraft between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the Ice Kingdom and his mother, Queen Juliana, aim to conquer the known world. When their glaciers destroy the village of a man named Larn, he swears to avenge his people and kill the ice lord. Meanwhile, the subhuman henchmen of Nekron and Juliana capture the sensual girl of the firemen king, Jarol, Princess Teegra; but she manages to escape and finally meets Larn, who promises to escort her to Firekeep. if the subhumans do not find them first. <br /> <br /> This film has very little advertising revenue (like most of Ralph Bakshi's films), but it has become a cult classic, partly for the quality of art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantastic artist Frank Frazetta. In addition, I heard that the script was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who wrote Conan's comic stories. The painters included James Gurney, the illustrator of novels Dinotopia; but certainly I had never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also the painter Thomas Kinkade, known for his figurative works, his music boxes for the Bradford Exchange Company in addition to his paintings. And like Bakshi's films The Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this film was rotoscoped, but the process works better in this film than in the previous one. <br /> <br /> So overall, I think it's one of the hottest fantasy movies ever made and a great collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With a lot of fantasy, sexual insinuations and a thrilling adventure.
