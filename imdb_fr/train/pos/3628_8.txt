The film had many basic family and love values. He expressed a human emotion and was an inspiring story. The text was clear (very easy to understand, perfect for kids) and was fun and fun at the same time. There were some symbols loaded to search. Cinematography was acceptable. Many filmmakers have not experienced the meaning of experimentation (which, frankly, becomes a little more cautious). It was clearly filmed but there was a nice soft quality. Although editing could have been better, I thought it was a good movie for a family. And the organization of the information has just been launched, which I did not like either, but overall, it was a good movie.
