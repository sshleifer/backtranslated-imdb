In fact, a particular person / character is not "right there", but my summary line refers to the power of the movie. And all this is achieved without any sophisticated camera movement and / or without a large production platter, but with a very credible story and good actors who transmit the story (arc). <br /> <br /> We could call this a piece of great Japanese movies / movies (such as Tokyo Story, etc.), not so much at the level of history, of course, but at the level of 'mood! Good acting, nuances in the performances that are really jewels If you want to live a touching story and want to see a film that touches you emotionally, this is the film for you. As you have noticed (as in many of my reviews), I will not go down in history. There are places here at IMDb where you can watch them, I'm not one to spoil the story in any way!
