Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen an unpublicized documentary on globalization before seeing MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has no storytelling and combines authentic images with sensitive interviews of four Chinese teenage workers living in a factory. They play with toys, jump rope and dance. Yet the majority of their days and nights consist of work, work and work - but the sequences of their work are bright and mesmerizing to watch. The owner of the factory in China is incredibly open, to the point where he is defeating the effects of globalization while "punishing" the workers. Cleverly succeeding the pearls of China from carnival to Mardi Gras, the film reveals how local is connected to the world through its humor and its fascinating and fascinating images of both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the intercultural introduction of factory workers and Mardi Gras revelers through photos. Here, the film goes around in circles and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never preached, is not motivated by guilt and allows everyone's point of view to be present. In the end, we - the viewers - draw our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and about globalization.
