What a beautiful TV movie that warms the heart. The story tells the story of a five-year-old girl who lost her dad and finds herself unable to cope. His mother is also very anxious. Only a miracle can soothe their misery. What all viewers hope to see materialize. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the mother of the little girl, as she was as a nanny in "Jack and Sarah", to watch if you love both Samantha Mathis and happy; year tears jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as always, a beautiful grandmother in this tender and beautifully played movie. Jodelle Ferland (the five-year-old girl) is charming and a convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it so touching. "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human goodness that is clearly illustrated and is always all around us in this difficult world in which we live. "Mermaid" all hope, realizing that there are many beautiful people in the world with a lot of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
