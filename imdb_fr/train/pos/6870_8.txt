From beginning to end, I laughed a lot throughout the movie. Surprisingly, "The Groove Tube" is perhaps the oldest of the comedy skits, but the most hip. That's how I like to watch TV without getting bored to change channels before suffering from insomnia! For 73 minutes, the strange and strange humor never stops! Just think of how all these jokes can help you enjoy life more easily! It's much better than Comedy Central or any other prime time program! Do yourself a favor and throw all those soft, lame romantic comedy films into the wastebasket! Better yet, tell your ticket manager that you want "The Groove Tube" back on the big screen!
