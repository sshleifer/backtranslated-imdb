I can admit that the scenario is not very good and it has slow elements, but all of you, critics of this film, must learn to have fun. First of all, the performances are excellent (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, Michael Douglas proves that he still has, and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as a misleading wife.) Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, playing the dynamic duo, both of them adding their incredible talent to the pot, and secondly, this movie is the most fun I've had in a Th√©odore for years, it's clear and simple, if you want go to the movies and have a lot of fun to see, The Sentinel.
