Having lived all my life in Ontario, in the same city where Marlene Moore grew up, I heard about it from my parents, grandparents and family members. So, when I learned that they would film a film about her and that the beginning would be shot in my street, her house close to mine excited me. <br /> <br /> If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby, which talks about Marlene Moore, you get a totally different picture of her as a person, she was considered clumsily beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her except her own family who often abused her as a child, except for one of her brothers. Also, if you live in my area and you are smart enough to listen to those around you know it at school, you will find out that she was really hurt before she even set foot in an institution. . She was still on the defensive and what would seem like she was not willing to learn in a school environment, it was really embarrassing to not be able to do it. <br /> <br /> Marlene did not deserve the life she was given, with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive. It was the government and the people around it that contributed to her death by not trying to understand her needs and why she did what she did. I still find myself furious that she was put in prison for self-defense by a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said, "They did not know what to do with her so they locked her up and that killed her." I believe in that with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Rest in peace Marlene, you deserve it so much.
