The first time I saw this episode was like a shock to me, it was actually the first time I saw "24". The speed at which things are happening is incredible, and it's so surprising, exciting and even interesting, it's almost like reading a book; once you have started it is very difficult to stop. As soon as Richard Walsh spoke privately to Jack about the possibility of them having a mole inside the CAT, I was sitting at 6:40, which represents 10 episodes !!! (It sounds funny and crazy, but I'm the kind of guy who, when he's interested, just can not stop) This series is one of the best of its kind. And it's built to have several different stories that are connected together. Recommended in every way!
