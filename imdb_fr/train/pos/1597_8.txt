This is the kind of film for a snowy Sunday afternoon, while the rest of the world can get into their own business as you sit in a big chair and soften for a few hours. The superb performances of Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently rank the plot. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and spiritual stroll through New York life at its best. A family film in every sense and deserves the praise he has received.
