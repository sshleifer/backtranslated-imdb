Listen, if a Nancy Drew book interested me, I'd take it and read it. I'm not. Since I remember, I read people screwing up movies because it was not like the book. I'm sorry - in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books, but I'm sure you can still find some short silent movies in book form. When The Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third won an Oscar - "The book was better." When I looked at To Kill a Mocking Bird, "the book was better". Now, a group of people are angry, again, because Nancy Drew was not like the book. I'm not saying that Nancy Drew will win Oscars - it will be one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or those awards. I say give a break to the movie. It's a film, not paper. As a film, I found Nancy Drew quite nice - featuring cameos from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and supporting roles starring Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on the American continent) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That). This is the first time I see Emma Roberts in a movie and, frankly, I appreciate her work more than most of Julia and Eric; his character remains consistent throughout the film and responds well to conflict. A light film in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is good from time to time. <br /> <br /> I give him ten stars because I loved the movie, I'd like to see it again, and I'll probably buy it on DVD Lib√©ration.
