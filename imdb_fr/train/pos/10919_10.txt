Five Deadly Venoms is not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but contains some of the best hand-to-hand combat sequences in Hong Kong's film history. Director Chang Cheh creates what many see as his masterpiece. This film launched the career of the five men who play venoms. Meng Lo still plays another bad ass. He would continue to be in Super Ninjas. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Kwok, would go to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. Any socky chop fan can understand it. But I still think it's not as good as Super Ninjas (also made by Chang Cheh). But socky chop is good and it's one of the best.
