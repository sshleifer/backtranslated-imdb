Only seen this show a few times, but will live in my memory. <br /> <br /> It is very frustrating to find that it is so difficult to find where to buy and yet there seems to be an endless repetition of things like Friends! Especially even harder to get to England, I guess ..? <br /> <br /> They say it was a bad note or was it a complaint from the Bakersfield PD? Maybe it was too smart for some people? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the comedy I want to see is almost impossible to find. I hear that it is or has been repeated on another network? But unfortunately not here !! <br /> <br /> Summary: Ingenious.
