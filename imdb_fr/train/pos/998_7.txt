It's a really interesting movie. It's an action movie mixing comedy. Foxx teams up with comedian Epps in this film to give him a comical twist. This will make you wonder what will happen to Foxx next. It was a well-shot film, the director used the right colors in this film (dark blue colors) to give him the right kind of sensation. Kimberly Elise also played in this film and it's always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing, you have not seen. It's really worth it if you're a fan of Jamie Foxx. He deserves more credit than what is actually given.
