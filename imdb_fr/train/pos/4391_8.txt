You wait to see if the remake is better or worse. I rated the movie Audie Murphy at 3 (I'm a hard grader), the second lowest I ever gave to Audie (the worst being "Battle at Bloody Beach" if you're curious). I give this film a score of "8" (and I'm a hard-leveler) This is the story of the Civil War renegades "soldiers", if you want to call them that, against the north. People like Quantrell and the men who went up with these outlaws. <br /> <br /> The original was an aqueous version, very sharp cut, while describing the horror of what these men were doing. In reality, movies like the old version are better viewed by an adult audience, who can discern the story. I would be more likely to notice the original "R" and this one, with its rough nature, a GP, because the new movie gives a very honest version, a message more easily deciphered by a minor than the previous version. <Br/> <br /> Since the early 1960s, filmmakers have boasted of "realism", but few of them keep their promises. Instead, they only give the decor, costumes and dull events, but with stereotypical cartoon cardboard characters, the weakness of the spaghetti era. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers understand this mistake. This is evident in a higher Western style that we usually see today. This film is an example. This gives the realistic settings, but also gives us the characters that we can believe exist at this time. <br /> <br /> There are a few lulls, making the whole session difficult, and there are unexplained situations. But the unexplained situations are acceptable as long as the entire film holds and the characters intrigue enough. <br /> <br /> It starts a little campy, but really improves. The main character is a character we can identify and who has at least some sympathy. Audie Murphy's character from the first film does not really evoke sympathy and is too self-righteous for himself. <br /> <br /> The character of this film follows the lines of a true anti-hero. There is a motivation and a method for his madness. We never think that it is really "right", but we can understand where it comes from. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action in the movie. There is also a little humor. A good scene is when the heroine tells the hero that she is not lying to him, and he thinks about it. <br /> <br /> This film succeeds in doing what filmmakers have been trying to do for decades. This director and his team of writers were right. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Complete success.
