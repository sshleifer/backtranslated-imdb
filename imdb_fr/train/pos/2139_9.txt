I approached this film with low expectations, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and it beats the ballroom movies of recent years, particularly "Strictly Ballroom". Although the music is nice and the dance is colorful, for me the film does not talk about dance. It is the very Japanese institution that offers office workers long trips to work and free time after work to entertain themselves without involving their families. Here we have the man with the complete family, with a big mortgage and a decreasing joie de vivre. He is attracted by the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio where he passes during his journey, which leads him to try ballroom dancing. Moreover, the Japanese fact is that the lustful motivations that aroused his new passion are clearly stated, but accepted in one way or another by the family and the public, at least in the future. Attitudes to ballroom dancing, as portrayed in the film, are by no means Western, although discipline and music are clearly cultural imports into Japan. The cultural contrasts are therefore intriguing. Even without the cultural knowledge, colors, dance and enthusiasm of the players make this movie a fun movie to watch.
