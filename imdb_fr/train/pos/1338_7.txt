The year 2000 had been a bad year for Indian films because of the lack of quality and imagination of the directors. Apart from Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, nothing stands out. CCCC had a lot of contradictions because of the financing of the film and the fact of not really knowing what the film speaks has generated good publicity and advance ticket sales for the film in India and abroad. The only information provided was that it was a thriller thriller. The film is now released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly good. The main plot concerns surrogacy and is well managed. Salman and Preiti give a good performance where Salman does not really take his shirt at all..are special effects !! Rani plays Salmans' wife, but it is a slightly less demanding role than Preiti, who interprets the role of Prostitute, who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three main tracks confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, that they have a solid screen and chemistry off-screen (apparently). Salman Khan, who is excellent, plays a serious role in the film as a successful businessman and it is unfortunate that he is exploited as an aspiring comedian in his other films because he is quite underrated in the film industry in Mumbai partly because of the films he chose. The character of Rani does not know that Preiti is a prostitute until the end ... this has not been reserved for her or the rest of the family ... you should know, because it would spoil the film if I tell you said. The songs are all well described, especially dekhne walon and the title song. The other actors make a small but remarkable effort as a loving family of Salmans. Abbas Mastan produced a hit and treated the subject of the film with tact .. I say go watch it or rent it at will!
