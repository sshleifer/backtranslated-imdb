Paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film I have ever seen. Often considered a "horror film", I think it's a big mistake. One newspaper described it as a "nightmare of the person thinking about Elm Street" and, although I accept the logic of its conclusion, I can not help thinking that it is a badly deserved and misleading tag. Those who can only see the horror are really missing here and only serve to show that they really do not think at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, trying to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea. Paperhouse is simply perfect in every detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone wiser than me once said, "the film strikes you in a totally emotional way," which perhaps partly explains why my comments are so heady. To be honest, I do not apologize, so if you think my words are too saccharinal to your taste, stop reading now, because there will be more to come. <br /> <br /> It is so rare to find a film that has its heart the pain and sorrow of childhood and the struggle to overcome the terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us in this fragile period of our lives. It is even more unusual to find child actors capable of playing their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence needed to make everything work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers, we had an inspired cast and Paperhouse's lasting impact owes a lot to its ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood (often neglected) in a transparent and compelling way. <br /> <br /> And yet, these two bright young stars seem to have escaped the understanding of the studios and have faded somewhat. <br /> <br /> Add to this an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), an imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you'll ever hear and you may begin to understand why I have such an affection and such an affinity for this film that no amount of words can express. <br /> <br />
