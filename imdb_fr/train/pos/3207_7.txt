Of course, regardless of the standard level of cinematic criticism, Soldier is really a very poor movie. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier, raised since his birth to kill, but who has become obsolete after being improved by a group of super-soldiers during a ruck hoop that looks a bit like a gladiatorial competition without the carpet of protection. <br /> <br /> Abandoned on a junk food planet, he is sympathetic to a community of naff space hippies who teach him gardening, family life and, uh, breasts. Kurt does not speak much. Finally, the super soldiers get up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they flee. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet is totalized. The end. <br /> <br /> Unless the Academy creates a new category for "Best Blast", Soldier will not win any awards. However, ridiculous as it may be, it remains a pleasant experience. The military equipment is the coolest since Aliens (APC in particular) and, after 90 minutes, it does not surpass his home. Please note that the mark below is only a guide. If you intend to take it seriously, delete five and offer a discount if you do not like miniguns. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
