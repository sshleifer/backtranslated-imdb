For people of a certain age, W.W. II was the turning point in their lives and what followed could never be compared. At the beginning of the film, a woman who is still alive but still alive (Judi Dench) hears a street musician trying to play the classic "Stardust" song. <br /> <br /> It's reminiscent of when she played in a movie. almost exclusively female group consisting of two bomb attacks during the war. The drummer, Patrick (Ian Holm), luckily avoided the repechage and enjoyed the ladies. <br /> <br /> The characters of Patrick and Dench meet and decide to join the group, which takes them in a series of mini-adventures. Despite highs and lows, the group meets and makes a successful reappearance. <br /> <br /> The film is written and minimized exquisitely, with superb performances by everyone involved. The characters are well developed and all the people who have not stopped living, despite their years. And there is all this glorious old swing music! <br /> <br /> This is not the pontification of Steven Spielberg, but a serious film anyway. The war has touched everyone and this lesson is not forgotten in a movie that is not afraid to entertain as it teaches.
