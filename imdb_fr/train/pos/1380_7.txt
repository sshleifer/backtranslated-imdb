These types of movies about teenage teens struggling with their own sexuality were something unique, bold and daring a few years ago, but more and more movies like this were shot during in recent years, which has made it difficult for the films to really stand out. <br /> <br /> This film has also been the subject of little publicity, apart from the usual small film festivals where this little French film appeared, as well as the big festivals that always love this type of small films on are not treated too often in the movies. The film was screened at Cannes in 2007 and even won some awards. <br /> <br /> The film does not really stand out from other films, because it contains few new features once you've seen similar movies before. like this one, but that does not mean that "Birth of the octopus" is a bad one to watch. The film is certainly a good watch, which manages its subject well and tells its story consistently and therefore also effectively, at a typical French cinematic pace, a little slow. <br /> <br /> This is an adult film that focuses on the lives of mainly 3 totally different teenagers. Sexuality is a major theme of the film, which is treated with delicacy and subtlety. This makes the film and its story overall quite realistic, although perhaps a bit predictable, as the film does not offer enough original footage of its kind. <br /> <br /> This type of French film will probably scare you. many people because of the reason why they probably expect it to be very artistic, with deep layers and deep meanings. "Birth of Octopus" is however a very accessible film for everyone and it is not necessary to be in the Euro-teen movies to enjoy this film. It's a kind of soft film and a little sensual, because of its subject and its visual approach. <br /> <br /> The film is also made realistic by its actors, who do not have and have a lot of experience in cinema, but are authentic and feel in their roles. The strong characters give the film beautiful themes and good moments. <br /> <br /> A good movie on the subject. <br /> <br /> 7/10
