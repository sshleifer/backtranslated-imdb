Chase has created a real phenomenon with The Sopranos. Unshakable performances, rock-solid writing and good music are what have probably become the best show of all time. <br /> <br /> All players are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini have won every inch of Emmy's. Anyone who doubts should only sample a few episodes; especially of the first seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce, absolutely terrifying and you continue to love him - hypnotized by him. <br /> <br /> Many people I talked to about Sopranos (who have not seen it yet) will say "I'm just not a fan of movies / mafia broadcasts". It does not matter. Run - do not walk - and take it. These same people usually like "E.R.", but I bet they do not care about hospitals ... It's not a matter of context.
