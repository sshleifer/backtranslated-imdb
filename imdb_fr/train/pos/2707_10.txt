Blimey horn. This film really surprised me because it is a masterpiece of comedy. Billy Zane is superb as a central character and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is really good and the staged sequences are a pleasure to see. I recommend you watch this movie with a group of friends, a few bottles of your choice of alcohol, and prepare to be amazed and entertained. <br /> <br /> This continues so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9 From Outer Space, this is the true tradition of movie "B". But what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I always find my laughing self on the stage where Zane climbs steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style. All a little crazy, and all the better for that.
