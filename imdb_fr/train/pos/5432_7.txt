.... Rather well done, actually - attack the naughty villains in their lair, stop an ambush at the Little Big Horn, save the day by chatting with the waterboys, works for me. Stiff Upper British lip and all that. <br /> <br /> So, how's it going on a DVD 66 years later? I was struck as a Westerner, subtle Apaches or Sioux for thugs and an American cavalry for the British imperial army. It's very colonial in its outlook, you know? The burden of the white man and all that? Kipling would certainly have approved. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaglen play it as widely as possible, putting a little friend buddy in the mix between shootings and fights for good measure. (I did not know it was Joan Fontaine as a wife of the symbolic army, did they leave some of her scenes on the floor of the editing room?) Very short None of them was aimed at Oscar here. In fact, Grant was not in the place. his best in a few scenes - but hey, it still works. And where else would Ben Casey eventually become an Indian bugle? Only in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Def. take a look at it if you like adventure and pseudo-western antics. This was done by a group of professionals, and I could add. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
