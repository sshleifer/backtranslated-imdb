This film is beautiful. It's real and has heart, but at the same time totally crazy. It's easy to fall in love with the characters because they have a very different mind, but each of us could refer to it at least. In Canada, we do not have many Eastern European films, and for the few I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It's very funny and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, go see Loners.
