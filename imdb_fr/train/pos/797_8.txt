To those who have not followed the case of the murder of Anne Marie Fahey. You miss one of the saddest but most complicated murders of all. The murderer is Delaware's popular attorney, Tom Capano, and the victim is the Delaware Governor's schedule secretary, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until his disappearance and his murder. She wanted to leave him but he would not let her go so easily. On the other hand, he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters. Where did he find time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life? In addition, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four-hour mini-series. Although the actress who plays Ms. Fahey does a good job, she does not have her long black hair. Her other mistress is certainly more attractive than the real woman. Mark Harmon is more handsome and makes an award-winning performance at the Emmy Awards with Tom Capano. It would be better with the current locations of Delaware and Philadelphia. With the executive production of Ann Rule, she adds precision to Anne Marie's organizational characteristic and her personal fight against an eating disorder. This information may be ignored by any other executive producer or director. If you have not read the book, it is worth it. Ann Rule is a fascinating storyteller of real crime. It's ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He also played the former friend and subject of Ann Rule, Ted Bundy, in another book adaptation many years ago. He was brilliant then and now. He does an above average job with an amazing story. Even President CLinton has offered his help in the case of Anne Marie Fahey. And now, former Governor Tom Carper is now the US Senator from Delaware, who defeated Senator Richard Roth, former incumbent president of the country, in the November 2000 elections. IF you do not think the film is interesting, read the Rule book.
