Three sergeants of the British army stationed in India are sent to put an end to the insurrection of a tribe of assassins known under the name of Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Cutter, moves away from the camp in search of a gold temple and is captured by the Thuggees led by the sinister Guru. Gunga Din, the water boy of the regiment, returns to the camp to ask for help. The other two sergeants pursue him, but are also captured. Now the major sends a complete detail after the three, but do not realize they fall into a trap set by the Thugees. Yet it is Gunga Din who saves the day. Excellent movie boyfriend, even if it is politically incorrect today. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks give very humorous and exciting performances with Jaffe very well in the main role and Cianelli very sinister as a Guru. Rating - 10 out of 10
