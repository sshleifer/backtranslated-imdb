I think myself that this film is a rare treasure. This is not only the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but also a rare glimpse into the evolution of our society. You must understand that some things that we now consider as sexual would be considered innocent at the time. For example, the parents of the children in the film, as well as the many parents who took their children to see this film, saw it as simply children imitating adults. Most people did not think that anyone considered children to be sexually attractive, with the exception of adolescents who covet teenage girls. For them, it was not sexual. Mind you, it was before we had Internet, television, etc. Most sexual crimes were not openly mentioned. From time to time, there was a murmur about the kid with the "funny uncle". But it was often all that came out. Yes very sad. But it's a little sad today, because even I too can see this film as something other than what it was meant for, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dancing like that and the boys looked at her, yes, I felt disturbed. I have to remember the time when it happened! These children did not know what sex was. The parents knew it, both the children of the film and those who watched it. The thought may not even have entered their minds. In the eyes of the average adult at the time, it was no more sexual than if Shirley were playing at home. Even today, children will participate in the beauty contest, many dressed extremely ripe for a three years. However, the child simply pretends. I do not blame the child for wanting to act like an adult. Or old movies that display that. In all honesty, our media has given the impression that many things seemed sick and bad. This can sometimes be for the better. But I really think this movie is not part of it. This gives a rare appearance of innocent mentality, which we have long since lost.
