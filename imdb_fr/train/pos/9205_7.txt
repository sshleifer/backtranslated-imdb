This one grew on me. I love the music of R. D. Burman and despite the most raw elements of history, I find that there are many things that move me constantly reviewing the film. The brother-sister plot is powerful, I thought; there are also probably things that are mandatory, such as fights in a bar, a crazy crime story, and so on. which only distract. (Although this is not strange from a certain point of view.) Moreover, the English translation is certainly made by someone for whom it was a bit exaggerated and as wacky as it is, I am grateful . <br /> <Like many Bollywood films I've seen, this one is melodramatic and lyrical, including a song first sung by a little boy to cheer up his abused and abused sister, then the same song sung 12 A few years later, the man who went to Kathmandu tried to reconnect with this girl, who grew up and is troubled (she was told that her brother and mother were dead), and who put his pain to sleep with drugs. <br /> <br /> A great thing about this 1971 film is that it's the hippie movement, which has brought hordes of researchers to India, from an Indian point of view, who sees them as people pushed into India by a spiritual hunger caused by the failures of their own societies, but nevertheless, in India, live only for the pleasures of the moment. The hippie chant-dance-drugstore scenes are really marvelous and accurate (I'm old enough to remember), and I'm sure the masses of zoned young white kids are real hippie extras, if I remember correctly. hear about children from the east-facing caravan getting that kind of job in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (This is not the Hare Krishna movement, although the film's hippies sing a Krishna / Rama song, as do Indian worshipers, with no connection to the hippies, in the opening scene of the film.) <br /> <br /> ~ Virginia
