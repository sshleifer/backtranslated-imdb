Paulie is a little girl fantasy or perhaps her memory of her youth. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub performs a flawless performance as a Russian scientist (PhD) who can not find a decent job in America. He befriended an isolated parrot while performing the average duties of a janitor in a behavioral science lab. <br /> <br /> The chief physician is a bitter man, like Paulie, who can speak and understand language well and learn, puts the doctor in embarrassment. , who then banished him to the lower floors of the building, where Mikail (Tony S.) found him. <br /> <br /> Paulie recounts her life with Mary and how they got lost. The quest begins to reunite Paulie and Mary, only over 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> The film ends, some say, as expected, while Mikail meets Paulie and Marie. The story ends with the entry of the three at Marie, where you can make your own choice. <br /> <br /> Excellent family film!
