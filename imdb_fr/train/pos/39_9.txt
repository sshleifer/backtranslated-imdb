It's apparently one of Shemp's first short films with the Stooges. (This excludes his much older vaudeville years with the team). But the comic moment of the trio is at its best here. In addition to the intense slapstick scenes, there are other more subtle, but just as funny. Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot. Or observe the real object that causes Moe's exclamation, "Oh ... a very polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is at his worst. And the moron can seem scary, but he's kind of funny. He seems as frustrated and puzzled by the Stooges as the regulars of the other short films. <br /> <br /> For fans of Shemp, this is an episode not to be missed. It will not disappoint.
