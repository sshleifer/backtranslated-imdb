The absolute pinnacle of the work of this cunning Dane Douglas Sirk (born Detlef Sierck), Written on the Wind, imposes our fierce attention in all contexts. Since its opening sequence quite famous, with the sheets inserted in the baronial hall of a Texas mansion and the wind tipping the pages of the calendar in a flashback, the film sums up in 99 minutes the whole plot family that was to feed these, imitations of small screens like Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest during their races of several years. <br /> <br /> The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme that Americans find irresistible in our dollar-based society. Brother and sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled and troubled heirs of Hadly's oil fortune; Rock Hudson and his new wife, Lauren Bacall, are healthy aliens trying to keep the cauldron in turmoil. (It is said that the story was based on the marriage of Libby Holmann with Reynolds' tobacco money.) As always, the unsuitable ones make all the decor chewing - and the best replicas to tell (Malone, in his performance at Nymphomaniac Oscars boozing with a jones for Hudson, gets to explode a whole fireworks from them.) Hudson, though good, can not compete with all those excessive emotions; Bacall starts strong but becomes recessive, a simple plot. It does not matter; Sirk offers a series of lessons on how to transform an overworked melodrama into America's lush consumer paradise of the late 1950s. No one has ever done better.
