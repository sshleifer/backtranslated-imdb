It's a shame that this film is so difficult to get hold of in the United States. I found it at a dealer of rare videos, and it was certainly worth it. This is undoubtedly the best film made during the pre-encoding era and the best film of the 1930s. The great director Frank Borzage has made some great films about depression. With MAN'S CASTLE, he created a fairy tale in the midst of the difficulties of the time. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy share a wonderful chemistry that helps them Make this film a wonderful romance. Young's Trina is sweet and hopeful, while Tracy's Bill is gruff and shut up. The dynamic between the characters creates one of the most difficult but ultimately rewarding relationships on film. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the most fuzzy pre-code movie I've ever seen. Borzage uses the foggy and dreamy technique to transform the squatter village where Bill and Trina live in a palace. The difficulties of depression are never ignored, they are an integral part of the film. But while Borzage conceives the film as a fuzzy fairy tale, the love between the characters makes the situation less severe. This makes the film warm and affectionate. <br /> <br /> The man's castle is the culmination of the era of precoding. If only more people could see it.
