Dick Tracy is easily the best cartoon movie ever made. The film has the same feel as the comic, while remaining true to the color scheme. The Batman series climbed, fell, went back up and fell again. Dick Tracy has the power to remain true as something that adults and children can appreciate. Good people triumph over evil, without blood or blood to get the message across. Al Pacino does a magnificent job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless. But the best work is by far Warren Beatty, who plays Dick Tracy as he did with Clyde Barrows. I can not wait for the DVD to be available on April 2, 2002, my tape is thin.
