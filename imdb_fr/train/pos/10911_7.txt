We enjoyed this 1936 film with many seasoned classical actors and in particular William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts", who played the role of doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford has already been married to Jean Arthur (Paula Bradford), "Shane", and divorced. They still managed to live with each other and fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything in his power to convince him that he was very important. Jean Arthur plays a rather crazy guy and there's a lot of comedy from 1936 and the murder method is something you'll never believe, especially with a jockey on a California race track. Robert Armstrong (Nick Martel) "King Kong" played a leading role as a bookmaker with James Gleason, a detective who needs the help of Dr. Bradford to solve this mysterious murder. If you see this film, remember that it was produced and directed in 1936 and that the audience of the time thought that this entertainment was great and that it was really in Those DAYS!
