If you "get it", it's beautiful. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's ok. <br /> <br /> Please, understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean that you have gone through a shooting school. There is so much more to this film than, sometimes, shooting in school becomes insignificant. <br /> <br /> This is above all a film about the acceptance, both superficial - of a traumatic event, but also of are different for some reason. <br /> <br /> It's also a film about the unbearable pain and how different people experience it. In this case, the contrast between Alicia's rage and Deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of anxiety so palpable that in the middle of the film, we wonder how the director could possibly draw a happy ending from his hat. Fortunately, the public has the merit of being a human being; our intelligence is not insulted by a Sapphic end, improbably moralizing. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, I try to keep my head clear that movies are fiction and everything else. Yet, I must admit, I cried like a little baby lost during this movie. There were some things about it that hit very close to the house and opened up old wounds that never healed completely. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.
