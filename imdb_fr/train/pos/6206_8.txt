I am an admirer of Hal Hartley's films, including "Henry Fool" from 1997. "Fay Grim" is a continuation of this film, with a similar style and sense of humor. The plot, however, is completely different. Fay Grim (brilliantly interpreted by the iconic Parker Posey) tries to find the notebooks of her missing husband and finds herself in the midst of conspiracy and espionage. The base cast (most of the people in the first film as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows and a much appreciated return of Elina Lowensohn, an independent darling of the '90s) is excellent and the film has many surprises. The director claims that this is part of a trilogy of the type "Star Wars", which serves as "Empire Strikes Back" of the series. If that's true, I can not wait to see the third installment! I just hope I will not have to wait another 10 years for that.
