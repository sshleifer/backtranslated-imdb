Mr. Blandings builds his dream house is perhaps the best film of Frank Capra / Preston Sturges that no man has ever done! If you love Bringing Your Baby, Philadelpia's story, The Skinny Man, I was a War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies shot with spirit, taste and a sometimes panting tongue, Take a look there. Life after the Second World War is described in a simple and idyllic way. <br /> <br /> Grant is at its peak and embodies the city mouse that ventures into the life of a country squire. Loy is adorable as his wife before NOW. The distribution of support characters is similar to You can not take it with you and contains a preview of the future Tarzan Lex Barker. Artistic direction and editing are well above average. <br /> <br /> The film is never slaughtered by the venomous slapstick rent of the latest adaptation, The Money Pit.
