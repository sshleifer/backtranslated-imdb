"Amazing Grace" has a feeling of languor in that it tells a contemporary story of different lives in an apartment building. The spoken language is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. He observes family values, relationships, and age group characteristics equally. He does not judge the characters, but merely introduces them, to the extent that they strive to solve their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of the game is very good and the observations made on the characters are clever and sharp. I really appreciate this fluid movie.
