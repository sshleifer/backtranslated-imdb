This film has been on my wish list for ten years and I only recently found it on DVD when my partner's grandson received it. He watched the video and was delighted to hear that it was about my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939, he wanted to know more about it - and me. Fortunately, I borrowed it from him and looked at myself and cried all the way. Not only did he capture the emotions, the class distinction, the difficulties and the warmth of human relationships of those years (as well as the cruelties (spoken and unspoken), but that was true! I'm also a little anorak comes to the uniforms of the PRA, ambulances (LCC) of the correct color (white) and all the obstacles to the management of the bombing sites and the work of the heavy rescue brigades.The Anderson shelter and the WVS canteens have all reported. difference between the relatively untouched life in the village and war-torn London was also clearly presented.The work of Gold, of course, and one expects nothing more from him than this minute detail, but he goes well beyond Beyond the exact representation of the facts and deeply touching the human reactions and the only half-hearted value judgments of these years, it was certainly one of the best moments of the acting career John Thaw and the Direc Gold has deserved to be better known. It is a beautiful film and I have already ordered some copies to send to friends.
