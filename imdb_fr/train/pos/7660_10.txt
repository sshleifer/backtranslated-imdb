This film is nothing short of a dark and slender masterpiece. I may be biased because the apartheid era is an area I have always thought about. But I would say it ranks just like Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country. Unfortunately, until a few days ago, I had not even heard of this movie. Inside is one of the most underrated movies of all time, probably because it was a small film company, I had never heard of it before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors, is credible and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays well his ignoble role. Do not look for humor in this movie, there is none. It's real, wild and gritty to the end, and to sensitive people, I would bring a box of tissues. But movies as big as that make you wonder, why are not the greatest movies ever heard?
