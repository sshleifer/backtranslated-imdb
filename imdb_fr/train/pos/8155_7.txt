I'm too old to know (or worry about) the difference between rap and hip-hop. And, being Canadian, I probably never saw MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I found this movie very funny when I saw it, a little glossy satire. Hip-hop culture is so ubiquitous nowadays that it's hard not to hear about it again and again. (If only we could say the same thing about bagpipe music.) I had most jokes (at least, I think I did). Of course, it is derived from Spinal Tap, but many targets could support Tap treatment. Not the carpenters, they are sacred.
