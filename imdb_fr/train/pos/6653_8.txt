"Gandhi, my father" by Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor is a good film that cleverly explores the confused-back-family side of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and the fight of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi with the company, his larger-than-life father , and especially demons in his head. We draw parallels with Gandhi, the father of the nation, and we fight all the sons with his father <br /> <br /> The action is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna - strictly in this order - add color and a pathos to this heartbreaking story of Harilal who cries to be kissed once and who also runs away at the slightest touch of the finger. <br /> <br /> The direction of Feroz Khan and the production canvas are sumptuous and attractive, however, the scenario could have been tighter. I had seen the piece a few years ago on a pirated video-type DVD (it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi, I think) and it was certainly more captivating. However, the background score of the film and the father-son and mother-son moments are just wonderful wonders. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been great. That's the limit of that. He has such huge potential to have just been a story difference between a father and his son or just Gandhi or even both. somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect an absolute concentrate of emotions, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> It compares decently with that of other Gandhi. Certainly not a film of synthesis like Gandhi of Kingsley, nor an abstract film like Hey Ram of Kamal Hassan. The film barely manages to find his foot; However, one wonders "and if ..." Worth the detour. 7.5 / 10
