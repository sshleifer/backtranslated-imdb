The silly movie is really, really funny. Yes, it has its dead moments, it can be a little too obvious, it declines a little in the second half and the story is an incoherent disorder, but it laughs hard all the time. And it's worth being seen just for Ed McMahon as a right-wing fan. This film is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly funny and underrated movie.
