Simply well written, directed and played ... Woody is the best of 2000, if not its best since the 80s! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his role. Scarlett Johansson's joke with Woody proves how much she has become a complete actress. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing not to be in a romance on the screen with the main woman. He plays the perfect hump magician. <br /> <br /> Some critics tarnish this film. Do not let them stop you from seeing the film beautifully made. People in the crowd with whom I saw that were laughing so hard at some lines that I missed the next line. If you like 70's Woody Allen movies, you'll regret missing this one. <br /> <br /> I suggest you go see this movie with an open mind, if you wish, you could go out smiling.
