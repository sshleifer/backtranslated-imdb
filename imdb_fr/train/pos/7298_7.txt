This is a crazy scientist who creates a half-shark creature - half man on an unknown island, then calls all his old business and academic friends to come see his creation (evil laugh) but in reality he wants his shark man kills them! Then come a lot of bad GCI, crazy plot elements and sweaty girls pierced in tight t-shirts. <br /> <br /> These monster movies all follow a similar formula, but this one gives spice to the people who did that had the tongue rooted in the cheek), not to mention the sexy girls. But let's mention these sexy girls - several hot girls, dressed in tight t-shirts, who sweat profusely. One is in his underwear at the beginning, the other at the end. Thank you, thank you, makers of bad movies! The plot is full of wacky things, a guy arrives in a jeep, bangs him right in a tree, then proposes to fly everyone out of the island by helicopter. Yeah, uh, well, what do we think for a moment? we will come back to you. The shark is hilarious - either an awful CGI or an equally comical guy wearing a rubber jumpsuit. The mad scientist gives a pretty good performance; he is diabolical, it is his motivation, he does not excuse. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a stupid B-movie FUN, this one should do the trick.
