This program will succeed because it will appeal to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship. As a married man for 26 years, I feel empathy for the character Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but he supposes that she knows it. I also appreciate its monotonous delivery; never get too excited or weak. A beautiful set of characters. It will be a nice addition to Monday night programming. <br /> <br /> I do not know how David Spade will be in his role. It is best enjoyed in small doses. He also seems a little old to continue tracking down women. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot and I can not wait to see how the series will evolve.
