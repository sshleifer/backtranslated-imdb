**** Includes Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I am a fan of horror movies for several decades. Just when I think I saw all the excellent, another comes up to surprise me. I had never seen this movie before. It was a treat, off the beaten track too ... not just the way to the marsh ferry. Here is a horror movie made in the 1940s that dared to try something VERY different. The pretty girl is not afraid of anything and saves men, including the man she loves, the monster! How is it for a twist? This girl was the opposite of most women in movies of that time, she would not shout to her own shadow, she did not lose consciousness of fear, she did not stumble when she ran. This girl was not afraid to live alone in an isolated hut far from other villagers. Not only that, but the place was on a misty marsh that would have been haunted. Heck she even makes naps on the marsh grass outside ... like a regular version of Ripley from the 1940s. No snake, gator or ghostly strangler would dare disturb this girl. Books on early feminist films should include this neglected work. <br /> <br /> See this if you're a fan, like me, of these super-atmospheric and atmospheric classic horror movies that they shot in the '30s and up. 40 years old And be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection.
