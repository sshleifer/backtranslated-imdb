This film would generally be ranked as the worst film production ever made. Already. But in my opinion, this is perhaps the funniest. The horrible direction and scenario make this film invaluable. I bought the movie by flipping through the bargain DVDs in my book shop. Friends and I then watched, certainly quite drunk. It soon turned out that it was not a normal movie. Instead, an inestimable relic of what will probably be James Cahill's latest film. At first, we were confused and screaming for the DVD player to be off, but fortunately, in our abnormal state, no one could be bothered. Instead, we watched the movie to the end. In the end, we quickly realized that we had found the dream of wasters, which we can normally laugh for hours, while laughing for all the wrong reasons. We quickly showed all our friends and they also agreed, it was not a catastrophic movie job. It was a movie you can really get wet with laughter. It was a movie that everyone can enjoy. He was a genius.
