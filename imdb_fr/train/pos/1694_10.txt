If the creators of this film had tried to introduce reality into the plot, it would have been a waste of extra time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, by throwing all pretense of reality to the winds, they created a comic wonder. Who could miss a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film playing the role of Jack Nicholson, with the Lakers t-shirt. Do not dismiss this movie as a trash.
