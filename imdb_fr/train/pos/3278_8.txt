It is a psychological drama wonderfully written and well played. It's not really a horror movie, so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me in this film is the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot, as well as the efforts to stay consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism. Rather than pushing an agenda forward, the filmmakers simply told the story, told it well and let the viewer think about it. The sparse dreamscapes evoked Wyeth's paintings and were incredibly effective. <br /> <br /> A good example of making a good movie on a budget, without big studios, star actors, renowned directors (it was way better than a lot of Hitchcock movies), effects special or "astute" twists.
