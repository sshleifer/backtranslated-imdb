David and Bathsheba is a sumptuous Hollywood Biblical image produced by Henry King's 20th Century Fox by Darryl F. Zanuck starring Gregory Peck {King David}, Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan) and Kieron Moore ( Uriah). ) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is based on the second Samuel Book of the Bible on the Old Testament. He follows King David who, in his childhood, killed the giant Goliath. We are now back to adulthood as the second king of Israel. A tough and confident king, however, David has heart problems that cause big problems. For once he spies on Bathsheba taking a shower, it's the beginning of a journey involving adultery and betrayal; a journey that will end with the judgment of God being called. <br /> <br /> Typically for the genre, David & Bathsheba is a great grand production. From his excellent scenery to his superb technicolor photography (Leon Shamroy), he has enough quality to guarantee the best of its kind in terms of production values. Unusually, the film unfolds in a sober rhythm and is based on 99% of its value, which is based on dialogue. It's not one for action fans or anyone who needs swash to go with their loop. It is a very humanistic image, in fact, avoid turning around the burning bush, it is a story of biblical love strewn with sins of the heart. But this is not a bad thing at all, because by breaking it down, we find that it is very well played {Peck has a stoic but vulnerable thing that works really well & Hayward pushes it to the maximum}, and it will be a Beautiful story directed with skill knowledge by the often forgotten Henry King. And, while some of the dialogue is undesirable, the flow of characters is never interrupted, because the Oscar-nominated Phillip Dunne (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) is getting all the attention. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a forgotten image of the Biblical / Swords & Sandals genres (probably because it's a talkative piece whose heart is the main selling point), but really worth the time of those who are interested in the most sumptuous genres. 7/10
