I know it's fashionable now to hate this movie. I've seen hundreds of spooky movies, including 1963 Haunting, as well as most of Hammer's films. This film is neither accepted nor accepted, which probably explains why so many modern television viewers did not seem to like it. Still, many viewers can accept uncontrollable movies such as Scream, as knife killers are easier for most people to believe than demons or ghosts. In fact, this movie had a lot of great scenes and the staging and the special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times now and it improves every time. The director of this film made several interesting and elegant films and did not seek the realism of the 6th sense. The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Maybe this movie might be more appealing to John Carpenter fans, but rather to a traditional conspiracy structure. Old Haunting was also a good movie from 1963. It was even scary. See both and The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
