Stupid, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A group of people in distress are associated with a "crooked" crook to get out of their poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the screw factor. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see George Clooney do something really funny to change. The casting is perfect and the standards of actor very high. Although it can be said that the topic of the motley crew is not new, I think this film deals with it in an interesting and unique way. Enough to make it stand out from what had happened before. <br /> <br /> Very good guys.
