This film was produced by Roger Corman. So you know that filmmakers did not have a lot of money to work. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers may miss the subtleties of this film because of the "killer" approach, there are unique differences about this film. <br /> <br /> AMANDA, as played by the talented Justine Priestley, is a complex character. Some people like these movies precisely because the violence may seem random, but here are the ramifications of the abuses of the past (treated in a realistic but tasteful way) that determine the psychosis of AMANDA. Surprisingly, Amanda redeems herself in the end with an act of love, where most of these films turn into a typical fight, a total fight to the death and the evil character dies just as badly in the end as at the beginning. <br /> Some contours in this image, but I must give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its thoughtfulness and originality compared to the usual - especially on a budget.
