Yes indeed. Sammo Hung has already starred in "Zu Warrios from The Magic Mountain" in 1983. Now, 2001, he still does it with "Zu Warriors". But this time, he finally does it well. You rarely see it in Wuxia, more often in oriental or criminal slapstick. But this role fits him simply! The ancient Chinese legend on Mount Zu is not often represented in the films (as far as I know about the films translated for the West). Although, the legend contains a multitude of interesting stories and possibilities. Straight said: you have not seen a story in a modern movie yet! And that makes it so great! And wow: all the colors, plus the deeply deep story that is important to you, make you fall for this film in an instant. The first time I watched it, I had to watch it again instantly, and that's what I did. Okay, I did not understand everything the first time. But it's only better! You know, you did not understand everything, because there is so much spice! That's why it's a pleasure for us to watch it again and again. And yes, it's growing in your heart, the more you look at it often. <br /> <br /> Summary: A story to love, characters with whom you cry and really: a movie you will never forget! - Editor's Note: Well, I think I have to look at it right away: D
