I can not tell you how much I love this movie. I have read reviews that say this move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in concrete drying". I say that these critics have no imagination! For all those who love Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you've ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you (especially if you participate in Oriental Adventures). I'm just sorry I could not see this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentive to get my own big screen TV :-)
