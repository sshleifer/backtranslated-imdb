I know I should like this movie, which I do most of the time, but as others have mentioned, it's a bit long. I also found that the unleashed hormones of all men were a little annoying. It's amazing that they did not start panting and screaming after moons. I must also say that overall, the film leaves me cold. It is a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. On the side of the benefits, the effects are excellent (except the cartoon monster), as well as effects, props, costumes and of course Robbie. If the robot was not in this movie, I do not think it would have been as popular as it was. The second half of the movie is gaining momentum as we begin to investigate the forgotten gadgets of "Krell". So many times I've seen this movie, the Krell always lets me scratch my head to know exactly who or what they were. Based on what was produced at that time, besides "This Island Earth", Forbidden Planet far exceeds the average science fiction movies of the time. Being filmed in color also adds to his pleasure. Certainly a classic in its own right, with its flaws and all, and rightly so.
