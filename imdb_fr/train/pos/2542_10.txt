With a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully proved that a few years ago a meteorite had landed in Africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) forms an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers the "Radium X", even more powerful than radium and very radioactive. Karloff is contaminated and can kill anyone by touching him. The sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science-fiction film after the Second World War. Director Hillyer used a few standing sets from the "FLASH GORDON" series filmed at the same time and also inserted images of Frankenstein's electric machines. Universal has kept the public unaware of the special effects used in this great classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi were at their best. They both enjoyed working together and will be appreciated by future generations.
