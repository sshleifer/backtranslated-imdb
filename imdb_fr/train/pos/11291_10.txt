Has anyone been able to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real pilot (not a reel) who was seen throwing his wings in the air, then grabbing them with his fist when he received his pilot's wings. <br /> <br /> There are only a few seconds left on the screen, but my family would love to see the movie. He was killed in an air fight in Italy, he was only 24 years old at the time. Do we know the movie studio that made it? <br /> <br /> Or did someone see him in a video store, like Blockbuster? I wish they made available whole catalogs of these old movies because it's so cheap to make DVDs these days. <br /> <br /> Please send me an email at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you.
