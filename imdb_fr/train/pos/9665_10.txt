Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives him everything whenever she is on stage. Whether we were laughing at her jokes and antics or burying our eyes in front of one of her huge ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can not see it live (which is the best way to see Bette), then it's the best thing to do. An interesting thing to watch is the incredible way his voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost his power. His more "vocally correct" version of "Stay With Me" never loses the spirit of THE ROSE or the DIVINE MADNESS, it is as pure and as sincere as ever. I will cherish this concert very long.
