I found it to be a novel / so-so-so that has a nice ending and a generally pleasant feel. It's not a family film like Hallmark Fame with pre-wedding sleep considered "normal" behavior, but since it's performed by Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I was expecting a much harder film at least from the linguistic point of view. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is the description of the difficulty of learning to read and write when you are already an adult. This is the main theme of the film and some scenes are touching, but to be honest, the film is not memorable. <br /> <br /> It's always a pretty sweet and pleasant story that I would be happy to recommend. .
