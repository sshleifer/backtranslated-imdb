In spite of all the hype, the respect and the recognition that this film draws from the historians of the Kung Fu, it is still blatantly lacking in some critical domains: the scenes of action and fight. But I must say that the plot is probably the best and most original I've ever seen in a martial arts movie. Five Deadly Venoms is definitely a must, not just that, a movie you can watch over and over again; but I must also say that after looking at it, you think it could have been even better. In a way, it leaves you wanting something, you want more. Producer Chang Cheh prepares the plot beautifully as a potential masterpiece, but does not give more action than we want. The fighting styles in the film really capture the viewer (Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, Toad) and they are shown, but the battles are visibly short. The Toad and Snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been presented much more. In fact, the toad is killed in the middle of the film. It is interesting to note that, in this film, the lack of action or constant fighting leads to the development of a great plot, this is one of the few kung fu movies in which you are really interested in the scenario and concerned about the result. This film has a dark and vicious tone and you are drawn to the atmosphere. Sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the film and add to the feel of the film. To begin the film and introduce the producer of the poison clan, Chang Cheh takes us to a dirty dungeon. The final fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more. Nevertheless, this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best movies and is very enjoyable. My general impression of the film ended in this way: the styles used by the fighters are not shown in detail, but the director had the assets for something extraordinary at hand and did not develop it. I still wonder what could have been with this film, which remains one of the best. 8 out of 10 on the scale.
