A few years ago, I visited the digital subscriber channels one night and thought I would spend half an hour watching "Girlfight" while waiting for "Hart's War" to begin. With a headline like that, I thought it was a kind of shabby operation about girl gangs in inner-city neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised not to talk about it at all. Instead, it is a well-interpreted and well-scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally enters female boxing. She is responsible for bringing her younger brother to her training sessions and taking an interest in watching her fits. Since he does not really want to be a boxer (he only respects the wishes of their father), she convinces her coach to take her in his place. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in an intelligent and credible way as she goes through various challenges in her quest. For starters, his brother's coach does not want to hire a boxer. After doing it reluctantly, there is the problem of queuing for her. Then the confrontation with his father when he discovers what is happening. Yes, a love interest develops, but it serves to improve the plot, by meeting more an interesting interhuman reaction with its own consequences related to the fight. <br /> <br /> In short, it's an excellent little sleep movie that few seem to have heard of. Some time later, when I saw the so-announced and acclaimed "Million Dollar Baby," I thought, "wait a minute, it seems a little familiar." Needless to say, I did not watch "Hart's War" that night.
