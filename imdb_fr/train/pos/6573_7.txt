From the beginning, the film is very much like a play. I think it would be a better piece than a movie, because the set and the dramatization make a version of the film a bit too artificial. But, all the same, it's going pretty well and the history and especially the dialogue are interesting. They took the dialogue almost exactly as it is from the real game. This may be a good introduction to Shaw's plays. <br /> <br /> The main character Raina has her head in the clouds and a talent for drama, and the role of Helena Bonham Carter does a good job here. His fianc√©, Serges, is a little too caricatural when he is supposed to be a very pretty, frisky figure. His parents are quite funny.
