Unqualified "10" The level of writing and interpretation in this Australian film recalls the best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are doing very well together. Neill matches line by line, and take - it's one of the best showcases of his prodigious talent as an actor and he's at his best sexy and gorgeous, despite the intensity of his role. This captivating film is a treat for all moviegoers who love a dramatic drama in court, portrayed in the most human way but without the least feeling. The film - which has won several major awards in Australia - has not only an exceptional cast and director, but also wonderful and authentic Australian venues. It proves that people are the same all over the world. And, after all these years, people are always delighted to repeat the famous Streep line, his accent and all: "A dingo ate average baby!" Including this elf "Elaine Benis" on "Seinfeld".
