This film captures the absurd essence of a domineering American patriot actor - a man who believes his work (and politics) is as crucial to the American people as the opinions of the president himself. Alan Bates sums up this state of mind perfectly as Michael Baytes and I will remember Bates immortally as a character. It's a movie for Canadians and Americans. It is a valuable piece of cinema, able to guide its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal how easy it is for the producer and the director to lose total control over the will of the actors and innumerable external forces. Wonderfully, "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the subject he describes: Peter O'Brian directs with precision and total control, and commands both the serious part of the film "behind the scenes" and the film in the play. the movie "Flight to Bogota" with clarity and insight. If you're interested in the spirit and strength of Canadian cinema, Hollywood North is a great place to start.
