Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside an imaginary world seeking to find a little fallen star to discover that it is alive, young and beautiful. . A kingdom whose king is on the verge of death said that the king was launching a competition on his various sons to know who could get a ruby ​​before becoming king, while a trio of witches wants the star to carve and use it to stay young. These three threads of intrigue mingle in a very complex way throughout the film, mixed with a good acting, dazzling special effects, as well as a solid feeling and humor. Stardust is a fun movie that features some fun performances of Claire Danes featured (I could watch her for a long time) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I could watch her magically for even longer) playing the horrible witch Robert Deniro plays a nancy-boy hijacker to perfection. Charlie Cox as star Tristan is affable and credible and we get a great job from a group of guys who play sons like kings and who are constantly looking to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett play their role well in both life and death (they also loved all that thread). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer dad and watches Ricky Gervais, a funny man, who made me laugh more than anything else in the film in his five-minute (beautiful feet) short film. But the real power in the film is Neil Gaiman's novel and the script made from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates his own mythology and his own world and it works.
