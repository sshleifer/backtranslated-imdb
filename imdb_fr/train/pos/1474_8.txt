I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. This three-part documentary (each episode lasts 50 minutes) features Slavoj Zizek, Slovene superstar philosopher and psychoanalyst. Zizek takes us into many classic films, exploring the themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. It was directed by Sophie Fiennes, clan of the many talents of Fiennes (she is the sister of actors Ralph and Joseph). <br /> <br /> I really liked that, although I think it will be even better on DVD, because there is such a stew of ideas to digest. The Freudian and Lacanian analyzes can be quite cumbersome and see the entire series in one fell swoop became a little disoriented after two and a half hours. It did not help me that a misguided coffee and the possession of a bladder lead me to some discomfort for about an hour. <br /> <br /> My only real problem with this is that Zizek chose movies that were pretty obviously filled with Freudian themes. He spends a bit of time on the movies of Hitchcock and David Lynch, not really masters of subtlety. I would have liked to see him try to support his theories using a wider range of films, although it's really just me who says I'd like to see the fourth, fifth and sixth parts. <br /> <br /> Zizek is a lot of fun, and some of the humor was watching him present what a lecture was all about, and he was part of the scenes of some of the movies he was talking about. So, for example, we see him in a motorboat as he headed for Bodega Bay (from The Birds of Hitchcock) or sitting in the basement of Bates Motel (of Psycho). Which does not mean that his theories are not provocative. Even when I disagreed with him, it definitely made me think a little deeper about movies. Which is exactly what he is trying to accomplish.
