It's great how this movie takes you. I had honest laughs. Do not worry it's a small budget because it works for me. To be honest, my wife did not really choose the same thing, but she prefers a different kind of movie. She admitted, however, that it was very creative and well assembled and probably on a string. These characters whose life is strange and troubled give me something to tell in my own world. Continue and be who you are. Dreams are what you make of them. Watching this movie a second and third time, I realized that there were hidden moments that went through me the first time. What can I say, I like my pleasure with some complexity. Anyway, liked that. I hope to see more.
