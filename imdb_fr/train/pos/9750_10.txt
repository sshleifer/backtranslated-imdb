Yes, Giorgio, it's a good movie. A little romance, good music, beautiful landscapes, comedy (a good fight for food) and a bittersweet taste are the ingredients of Yes, Giorgio. Any movie buff would appreciate this movie. Those who need massive special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us need a little escape from time to time, and how to do it better than with a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? A must see!
