Nine out of ten might seem like a good score for a sci-fi video vilified at the US box office and criticized as the poorest film of Kurt Russell's career. <br /> <br /> I have my reasons. <br /> <br /> First of all, when you read negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell's rendition of Todd, the eponymous soldier. I will start here too, with my surprising statement, that it may be the best play I have ever seen. Todd is crippled emotionally and suffers from intense PTSD. This film was written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is today. <br /> <br /> The representation is perfect. Todd is retired, non-communicative and lonely. He suffers from irrational anxiety, driven by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of treason and danger. His hyper-focus brings an inability to understand the larger continuum of tasks entrusted to him - there is a scene in which he cuts carrots and continues to work without being disturbed, without cleaning neither the skin nor the blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical strength and focus on the work to be done, but it is also a sign that he is only doing the task himself by heart - not understanding the relationship between vegetables that he prepares and the food that will be for him. ate later. <br /> <br /> Todd's dialogue is at least spartan - the two great scenes of conversation he receives are at the heart of the film's plot and both underscore the sad nature of his existence. Fear and discipline we are told. Always. The fear of keeping him in a state of hyper alert where the smallest details do not escape him, the now ready to react to the knife. Discipline to control him by his fear, to overcome it and for a tactical performance. The conclusion is that he does not have the time to think and can not afford feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of her reaction to Sandra's hug from Nielsen - but I think you have to interpret it from the point of view of a human whose only experience of an embrace is in combat - the quake represents him by repressing his fighting / fleeing instincts to the fear of struggling, his restricted movement and vision - Fear and Discipline indeed. <br /> <br /> Then comes the subtext of his abandonment (twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to dispose of foot soldiers on the garbage of society when they have served their sentence. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in OUR world, it can only get worse. Russell quickly takes over Mace's responsibility to his wife and child - he desperately needs a mission, even with such a high probability of death. <br /> <br /> There is also the military subtext - the conflict between Busey Church and the HQ thunderclap, Mekum. Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more precise and more aggressive. Anyone can hit Todd in the ground - but it's not about the tools you have, but the way you use them. Todd, motivated, has the freedom to exercise his initiative and act without the agonizing effect of perceived superiority, resorts to ambush tactics and sneaky maneuvers to clear his way through the new unit - sent without support, coverage or recognition. This reminds us that the military power can not compensate for a failure of management. <br /> <br /> There are many other subtle themes. When a film is shot and scripted so minimal, it leaves a lot of white space for your own interpretations to take root. Watch Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you.
