After losing the Emmy for her performance as Mama Rose in the television version of GYPSY, Bette wins an Emmy the following year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a special live concert filmed for HBO in Las Vegas. Midler, who has been performing on stage since the 1970s, proves she is still one of the most electrifying people on the market. From her opening act, her classic "Friends", where she sails down to the top of a beautiful prop cloud, Bette commands the scene with style and charisma of a rap style number called "I Look Good", she then proves that she has with a joke like few other artists in this business as she blows her way through a variety of musical selections. The section of the series where she greets the burlesque lasts a little too long, but she manages to incorporate here her old jokes Sophie Tucker (even if she forgets a joke actually telling it, but his ad-libbing until she remembers it's hysterical). Bette also treats us to GYPSY's "Rose's Turn" and the title song of her sensational movie THE ROSE, as well as a shameless plug for her hit THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. She arrives at home towards the end with THE ROSE's "Stay with Me, Baby" and her only # 1 hit record, "Wind Beneath My Wings" by BEACHES. It's a dazzling evening of musical entertainment and for fans of Midler, it's a must.
