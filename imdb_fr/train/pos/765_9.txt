I guess when "Beat Street" made a national appearance, "Flashdance" arrived at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one break dance scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. This is one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only film that can compete with "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose", because both films explain how people used dance to express their deepest feelings. <br /> <br /> Break-dance scenes in "Beat Street" arrive just before the middle and at the end of the film. And I loved them all. Almost all the tricks were present in the jam scenes: the jackhammer, the flares, the spinning head, the seated suicide, the crazy legs, the mortal, the overturning forward, the number four - almost everything. <BR /> <br /> Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" has gang violence in the hip hop world ... but much less violent than the previous one. The only major fight scene in "Beat Street" was when the graffiti artist Ramon (who in the movie was abbreviated as "Ramo") was being chased by a rival gang member on the NYC subway tracks, fighting for against each other. the third rail and both die by electrocution on this rail. Although this hunting scene ends tragically, it is better for them to die that way than to have the blood explode pulled by a gang hit. <br /> <br /> Most of the gang elements of the film were graffiti related to hip-hop culture and rap music. A lot of rap music appeared in the film, as hip-hop members used this rap to distract from the negative aspects of gang life. Even the film's theme song, which closed the curtain on the film, was not only a tribute to hip-hop culture, it was also a tribute to Ramon's death. <br /> <br /> By the way, during the dance scene called "Tango, Tango", I suppose that the stand orchestra thresher directed by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. making an appearance in cameo.
