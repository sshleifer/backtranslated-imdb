In my opinion, it's a lot better than either version of 1990, but it's still not so good. It seems dated, probably because it is, but it resists well compared to other works of the BBC dating from the 1980s such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this adaptation allows a much better adaptation of the book than any of the versions of the 2 90s, and St John Rivers is at least covered, but not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good like Rochester, but the actress playing Jane is way too old. It is quite possible to adapt this television to television with more than one budget spent.
