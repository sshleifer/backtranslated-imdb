It's a good movie, although people who do not know the comics and books of Modesty Blaise can find it a bit slow and lacking in action. For the fan of Modesty, the film will be very nice, especially because he is very faithful in his presentation of the "story" of Modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell appears in the credits under the name of "Creative Consultant" and the filmmakers have had to pay attention to him because the plot closely follows the details presented in the comics over the years {although the events have been redesigned in modern times). The only thing the real fan may find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story. This lack of Willie is once again faithful to the timeline of Modesty Blaise since the film takes place at the very beginning of the career of Modesty. Alexandra Staden is a very credible young woman who looks a lot like Modesty. A welcome change from the parody of Modesty's performance by Monica Vitti.
