After playing a nymphomaniac role in WIND WRITING, Dorothy Malone finally bade farewell to her sweet sister / wife and demonstrated her ability to play mantraps with the best of them. She and Gloria Grahame played the same kind of tramps - and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role, Malone won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. <br /> <br /> The movie she's in is not up to par, but it's a pretty powerful melodrama under the able hands of Douglas Sirk. The explosive opening scene is almost black and sets the tone for the rest of the fireworks in a story starring ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE. <br /> <br /> Domestic quarrels between wealthy oil-rich families are the main focus of the drama, with a focus on powerful support players Stack and Malone. Both take the opportunity with both hands and Stack should also have been rewarded for his excellent work as a weak and alcoholic brother driven to despair by his own wild motivations. <br /> <br /> Nominal stars have less impressive work to do, but do it with their usual skill and conviction - Hudson and Bacall. They play their most sympathetic roles with discreet and comprehensive authority. <br /> <br /> The use of color is particularly striking (as is usually the case in a film Sirk) and yet it does not prevent me from thinking about the film. like a Technicolor black film in the vein of LEAVING TO HEAVEN. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast.
