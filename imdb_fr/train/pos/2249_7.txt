I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found it to be a positive and largely true representation of the SDJ religion. I think a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial, as many people today are unaware of the trials and persecutions facing the first Mormon church. This is the incredible story of a strong and dedicated people. <br /> <br /> As a member of the church, the most disturbing aspect of the film (most historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrait. of Brigham Young who had "knowingly deceived" church members into believing that he had been called to be Joseph's successor as a prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot, it gives the impression that his doubts in this regard are a historical fact, when in reality Brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and firmly believed that had been called to lead the movement. church. Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; he rather conducted them with confidence by inspiration. The point is important to Mormons because it follows from an important aspect of our faith that God is truly speaking to the prophets of today and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was a prophet inspired by God. <br /> <br /> or you do not believe this statement or not, just know that the movie does not describe exactly what Brigham himself believed.
