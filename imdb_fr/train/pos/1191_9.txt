Robert Taylor, the crazy buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson, is the main character of this film. At first, I thought Charlie would eventually redeem himself as John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the movie progresses, Gilson continues to do more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffaloes will soon be gone and that he is disgusted by the act of killing. Gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals and humans. Debra Paget as an Indian girl is a surprising character given the self-imposed censorship of that time. She lies with Gilson, totally resigned, even if she hates him. The last scene of a frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
