Well, it's probably one of the best movies I've seen and I love it so much that I've memorized most of the storyline (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee has cut off the wind) and even with the scenario of my head I always like to watch this for Jerry Lee, this German Shepherd is hysterical and really put to the test to see who is smarter. The slogan is also true. Not to mention that the acting is great, although Christine Tucci has a different sound in a whisper (check the filmography under CSI if you do not know what I mean). It's a shame that this movie contains only the one number that Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work with. It would have been pretty cool to see the stuff that Zeus and Welles had in mind.
