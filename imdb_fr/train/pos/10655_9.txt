It seems like a perfect day to swim. A normal family wants to enjoy it and goes to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is stuck under a jetty and that neither his wife nor the little son can help him out of this situation, as the tide rises. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and seeks help. <br /> <br /> The John Sturges short film (69 minutes) is powerful because of the unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but she has a price to pay for it. The film asks a double question. How far would you go to help the man you love and, on the other hand, by observing Stanwyck's behavior towards the stranger, does she really love her husband? Like a good short story, this film leaves the viewer to himself with questions that he can only answer.
