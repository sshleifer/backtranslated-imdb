Fay Grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with Henry Fool of Hartley. I have not seen the previous movie and I do not know if it's a good thing or not. I can only consider the current film on its own merits. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hartley's style of film production is something you like or do not like. His combination of action, drama, nonsense and dry, ironic humor touches me a lot, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has an air of smart parody that has made the crowd laugh at the Melbourne International Film Festival and many others. For the first half of the film, he was relentless and delivered with a clear impassibility. It's a style of humor that is sorely lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief for blind teenage comedies that Hollywood projects like pancakes. <br /> <br /> During the second half of the film, the humor begins to fade as the film changes. in an international spy / conspiracy thriller. It's not clear if it was Hartley's intention or if he was running out of ideas, but I think that a bit of editing or rewriting to cut the film for fifteen minutes would have kept it going. initial momentum of the film. <br /> <br /> The performances were generally good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who spent the most time on the screen. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn all played good supportive roles. The graphics of the film were pleasing (taking place in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also from Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film is well written and I liked it a lot. If you like Hartley's previous works, you will probably like this.
