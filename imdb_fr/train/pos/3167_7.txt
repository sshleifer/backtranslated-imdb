It is one of those films that explore the clash of cultures between peoples of Eastern origin and Westernized cultures. <br /> <br /> Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of the opposites to attract due to major cultural differences. Ken, a fan of rock n'roll, marries Kyoto, a Japanese, to stay in the United States at the end of his visa. The marriage should only be temporary, that is, until Kyoto regains legal status. But, Ken, who seems to be lost in all relationships, loves the Kyoto protocol and strives to make things go smoothly. This despite the fact that his friend insists that the dumping of Kyoto and the elimination of all commitments to girls are harmful to rock'n'roll, except to inspire a song about broken hearts and all that. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes a strict traditional Japanese education, and does not expect to be married to Ken for so long. Not only that, she is homesick and wants to return to Japan. It's sad that finally, Ken thinks he can love and be with and all that, except the only time he thinks he's found someone who has such feelings, the girl does not expect to stay that long. It's not that she does not like Ken, it's just that she's used to a whole new way of life. She says, "I can not tell him how I feel in English and Ken can not tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a rather sad love story with an 80s techno-nintendo soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I picked up Loving on Tokyo Time because it made me think of one of my Favorite movies of the 80s, Tokyo Pop. And for those of you who loved Loving on Tokyo Time, take a look at Tokyo Pop (a New York singer travels to Japan and joins a group of Japanese covers), except that it's a movie with an end happy. <br /> <br />
