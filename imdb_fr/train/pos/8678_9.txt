Butch the peacemaker? Obviously. After the violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry swaying each other, Butch stops and wants to know why. It's a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can get along with dogs, can not they?" he asks Tom, who nods. "Mice can get along with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no" and realizes it's not the right answer. <br /> <br /> They come in and Butch establishes a "peace treaty" (with professional illustrations!). Most of the rest, and the bulk of the cartoon, are extremely enjoyable with each other. What a refreshing change of pace. I found it fun to watch. I can have a million of these designs jostling their heads. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, you knew that peace would not last. A big piece of steak meant the death of the "peace treaty", but on the way it was a nice change and there was a bit of Tom & Jerry's clever humor.
