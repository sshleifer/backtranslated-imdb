Star Wars: Episode 4. <br /> <br /> The best Star Wars of all time. This is the first movie in which Sean wins the bad guys and it's a very good ending. it really made me wait for the next Star Wars, because in this film, there were a lot of things to do in the last film. With a lot of movies, I always feel that it could be done, but not with this one. and I will never forget the part where waders like Luke were, he is his father. I also love Bob's character and his background. if you have never seen a movie star wars you will see this one. She is the best. <br /> <br /> thanks Lucas
