I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This film is more than a documentary (which offers no more than cold facts) with long mono / duduologists and many graphics ... The complete "power" of this film comes from the impressive images filmed under the water In watching this movie, you can learn more about our planet that if you read a book, it shows that WE are integrated into the circular flow of life. This film is not only for "environmental fanatics", even if those who want to watch a good movie with a message should watch it. This film taught me that we do not live only on the earth ... we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
