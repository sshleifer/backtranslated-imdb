I love these "Diaper Baby" movies! You can not make a film like this today and it is rich in cinematic history. It's crazy and the film was made to make you laugh, which is the case. How could they get these kids to "act" I'll never know. I think they are precious and the children make me laugh, but the other authors of this film too, which shows the naivety that existed in the early 30s. We must not forget that the film industry was very young , that the stock market had collapsed, that the global depression was beginning and that these films were designed to give someone a break from the real world. The fact that you can see movies at five cents is beyond my comprehension, but a dinner at 25 cents too. It was a different moment with a totally different state of mind.
