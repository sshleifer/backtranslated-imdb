The film begins with a group of children from the reform school and focuses on a child named "Gabe", who apparently worked hard to get his parole. Gabe and her sister move into a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon, Gabe meets the Dead End Kids. The children in this film are little punks, but they are much less antisocial than those of other previous films and, deep down, they are well-intentioned punks. However, there are also criminals in this neighborhood who commit insurance fraud by arson and who consider Gabe a convenient scapegoat. After all, he had been reformed at school and nobody could believe he was innocent once he was arrested. So, when Gabe is about to return to "The Big House", it's up to the rest of the gang to rescue him and reveal the real crooks. <br /> <br /> The "Dead End Kids" appeared in several Warner Brothers movies in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good (especially ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES). However, after the expiry of the boys' contracts, they went to Monogram Studios and the films, to put it in a charitable way, were very weak and formulated - Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey being pretty much all the show and the band being renamed " The Bowery Boys ". Because ANGELS WASH THE FACES LEADERS had excellent writing and production values ​​AND Hall and Gorcey did not always fight against the camera, it's a great movie - and almost wins a score of 7 (it's VERY close). In fact, although it is not a very good movie aesthetically, it's very fun to watch, so I'll give it a 7! Of course, it was a little hokey - especially towards the end when the kids are doing justice and Reagan ignores the Charter of Rights - but it was also very entertaining. The Dead End Kids are doing their best and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan have provided excellent support. Of course, this part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but it was still funny and rather charming - so if you can suspend disbelief, it will work well.
