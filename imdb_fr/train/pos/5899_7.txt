Pretty idea ... The saleswoman Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a tiny little county of Lampidorra. This country, which was not even in North America, became the 49th state ... (of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since it was created in 1952 ...) Linda goes to the country where she is. inherited, and we follow her as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even stranger people. At one point, she's singing a song that, she says, comes from her people, the Navajo, and she's getting foolish from there ... though Yolande's lipstick and omni-present smile Donlan are never ruffled or crumpled. There are other songs scattered throughout the songs that the citizens are singing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in a glorious British version of Technicolor, or an equivalent, the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as British subject Tony Craig, cheese salesman. Bogarde caused a sensation in the British film industry after serving in the war and was even knighted by QE II. Craig and the "new princess" keep bumping into each other and their adventures are all the more mingling as the financial problems of Lampidorra get worse ... A little funny joke ... in the style of the movie Marx Brothers. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our small project, and remained married for 50 years! Guest was best known for writing and directing his sci-fi films in the United Kingdom and the United States.
