The film begins with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) telling how his best friend - making this client - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are packed tightly in a small New York apartment, with no storage space and far too much few bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, the advertising executive Jim falls in love (or cracks!) With an advertisement for a house. Once he has bought the house, bills and frustration pile up all the time, just as anything that goes wrong with the construction of Jim's "dream house" is also happening. <br /> <br /> One of the three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a charming little comedy - not very tiring, with no real message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. The bursts of laughter are there from the beginning, when the alarm rings and Jim tries to extinguish it, to be thwarted at each turn by Muriel. The timing and delivery of lines and comic situations can only be given by two seasoned pros, and that's exactly what Grant and Loy give us: refined performance, simple chemistry and lots of fun. Myrna Loy plays a rather ungrateful role (it is obvious that the character of Grant, Jim, gets the lion's share in the roles and the play of the actors, and Grant, as always, draws both with remarkable aplomb), but she gives Muriel a color, a life and a bite. that only Myrna Loy can give a character. Melvyn Douglas also plays to perfection with fun and fun, never hitting a wrong note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes must be where Bill gets locked up in the store, and Jim leaves. to "save" it ... just so everyone is stuck inside! Every little problem that arises in the Blanding Renovation Project - including a little jealousy and a "Wham" advertising campaign - seems to bring together everything that could * be spoiled with the construction of a new home but makes it credible and enjoyable to watch. . 8/10
