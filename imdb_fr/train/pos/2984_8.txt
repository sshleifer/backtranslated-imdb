David Zucker directed one of the most entertaining comedies of the year with this awkward joke. Yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends on a profusion of sophomore gags, but it's still funny all along, contrary to some recent comic efforts. The film is loaded with all kinds of jokes, ranging from the most blatant to the most subtle: you must pay attention to everything in the frame, otherwise they will miss you. Like his previous efforts, which include "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun", the humor flies away almost every second. There are so many moments that work that it's easy to forget those who fall flat. This film differs from other pale imitations of the parodic genre is that it has a real story. While others have been counting on mocking too many famous scenes in almost random movies (take "Mafia!", Please), this movie tells a new story with friendly characters. It tackles sports movies in general as well as satirizing the sports industry instead of missing out on a particular movie. Even for people who do not care about "South Park", its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make up a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos from athletes, sports advertisers and other celebrities, particularly a hilarious twist with Robert Stack of Unsolved Mysteries. By the way, stay in the credits for one last joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. Overall, Zucker was successful, with words that may apply to the sports mix in the movie, a dunk at home.
