Make the world go away. Take me off my shoulder. Say what you used to say and make the world disappear. <br /> <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in trouble, one for embezzlement and the other to fuck a child. Neither was guilty, but in the face of accusations and their house about to be demolished, they found themselves without anything. The whole world, with the exception of their house, is gone. <br /> <br /> It's a little weird, but fun too. What would you do if you were alone in the world? The two friends just enjoy each other's company and do what they want. But it seems to age quickly. <br /> <br /> Then they begin to improve their lives by hating their memories. The sound effects were excellent. <br /> <br /> In the end, things have become strange. This film is the product of a great imagination, written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, with the help of both stars. You just have to see it.
