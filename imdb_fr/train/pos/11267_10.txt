Robert Wuhl teaches a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> It covers the sophisms of history and truths that are no longer known to all. I would like to see a lot more of this show. This is very fun. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "shows and tells" to convey his arguments. He explained that the person who really participated in Paul Revere's midnight hike was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used the name Revere because it sounded better. <br /> <br /> It's been many years since I watched Robert Wuhl, since he's been playing stand-up comedy and all over "Arli $$" HBO. He is a good actor and a good comedian, but he is an excellent teacher! I highly recommend watching an episode of this show. It's well worth your time.
