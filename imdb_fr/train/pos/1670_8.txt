Channel 4 is a channel that allows more bad stuff than any other channel, this show was certainly nasty. The presenter of this sometimes disgusting adult chat show, Graham Norton, winner of four BAFTA Awards and a British Comedy Award (also twice nominated), was simply the perfect homosexual organizer for a good show like this . There was one or more celebrities in the middle. They basically had an idea of ​​an adult who devalued, humiliated or humored the guest, but some are not for sensitive souls. There were women playing the recorder with voices, men playing dylle to play the xylophone, women getting into the bath, men with or without pants, and many other crude ideas but hilarious. This is just for adults, but enjoy! He has twice won the BAFTA for best entertainment (show or series), the British Comedy Awards for best comedy entertainment program (also nominated), the best humorous show, he won an Emmy for episode # 18 (? ) And the national television awards twice for the most popular talk show. It was number 52 on the 100 greatest funny moments. Very well!
