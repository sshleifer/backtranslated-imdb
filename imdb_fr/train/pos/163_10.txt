For the first time, director Tom Kiesche is shooting in an award-winning film in the spirit of black and sharp comedy. Shot on a tight budget, he still had the flavor of his brother Coen's movie, Blood Simple ... and added some flavors of Monty Python! Need to see more than once to appreciate all the elements that go from one scene to another. Expect more good things from this author, director and actor.
