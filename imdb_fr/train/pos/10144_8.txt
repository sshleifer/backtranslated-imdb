But the pleasure is in the trip. <br /> <br /> I found this film extremely enjoyable. Not only are the two movies extremely easy to watch, but the actors' humor and jokes made me laugh. strong several times. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a romantic comedy based on the clich√©. But the fact is that it is a beautiful story, the message about the discovery of your one and only love also sounds in many ways. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is flawless and the acting is well played, and on top for the comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth its weight in gold, the actress deserves an honorable mention here! For those who have everything planned to be predictable - If you want a movie with twists that make you guess ... then you want a thriller. It's a romantic comedy ... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky to find my true love in life and that it was worth all the effort along the way. <br /> <br /> A big date. movie, excellent movie for a happy cry ...
