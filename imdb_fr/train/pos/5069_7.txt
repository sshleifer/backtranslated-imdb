The film speaks more of Pony than Gray Owl. This also applies to aboriginals, Canada, the English, Gray Owl's aunts and North Bay Nugget. Excellent story. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film, more like a book, that asks interesting questions about identity and cultural values. The key scene is Gray Owl who recognizes his shambles and his reaction to Pony. <br /> <br /> Some observations on user evaluations. Note that user ratings are 5 and 7 bipolar groups; It's not for everyone, but has a strong customer base. This film is underrated and overlooked, but will be noticed for years to come. In addition, few women have watched the film, but they judge it better than men. Has it been marketed properly? <br /> <br />
