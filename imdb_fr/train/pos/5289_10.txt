John Waters has produced the most personal, sincere, boiling, darkest and most personal film I've ever seen (maybe Fast Food Fast Women comes second). The director's vision is intact ... the story is whimsical, the characters are personal and strange reflections of the family and her own inner life ... the tone has never been forced or stylistically hunched. <br /> <br /> There is no pretense of plan, boredom or magazine rankings .... Martha Plimpton is amazing as a sister..Eddie furlong is inspired by the cast. A grandmother with a talking Mary, tea bags, recycled clothes, yesterday's garbage become the art of today - and the lesson from the movie is that the most important thing we can to value is the family ... and a humble life.
