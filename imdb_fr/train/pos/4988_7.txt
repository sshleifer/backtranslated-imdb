Man's Castle is located in one of those settlements built by jerry on vacant land and parks that were called "Hoovervilles" at the time, named after our unfortunate 31st president who was stuck in the Great Depression of his government. The proposition of this film is that a man's house is still his castle, even if it is only a hut in a Hooverville. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy has such a cabin and we'll tell him that even in good times, it's a lot of work. But in a very typical role of Tracy before becoming a priest in San Francisco, at the origin of a lot of classic roles, he plays a big hard cup that takes Loretta Young. <br /> <br /> One One of the aspects of Man's Castle is that it shows the effects of depression on women and men. Women were under additional pressure, and if men had difficulty finding work, they were twice as strong. And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a meal prepared on a plate. Spence takes Loretta Young, who is confronted with these kinds of problems and does not ask her in her castle. Soon, they are in love, although Tracy is not the type to settle. <br /> <br /> The love scenes are spicy, as Tracy and Young had a torrid adventure while filming Man's Castle. And both were Catholic and married and at that time it was an insurmountable barrier to marriage. Tracy and Young both took the Catholic religion very seriously. <br /> <br /> Walter Connolly is also in the cast, a sort of father figure for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau who went through all the traps that Young could meet and try to guide her and Arthur Hohl, a character really disgusting who is also watching Young. Hohl brings the intrigue of the man's castle to its peak thanks to his intrigues. <br /> <br /> The Castle of Man is a dark look at the Great Depression, not the usual escape movie fare for those who try to avoid this kind of reality in their entertainment.
