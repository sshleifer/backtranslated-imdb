Scott Henderson, the engineer who employs Carol Richman as an assistant, calls him "Kansas" every time he talks to him. This shows us that Carol, actually played by Ella Raines, is supposed to be a baby in the woods, as far as the Manhattan of the '40s is concerned. Only a woman from outside the city would follow the bartender in the shade. in an isolated and elevated metro. Even then, only a naive girl could embark on such an adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Siodmak did this film noir very well. He shows a talent for impregnating the story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising for those days. How could we otherwise justify the way the drummer of the musical band, where Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat, makes such a move to a lady at an appointment? The drummer played at high voltage by Elisha Cook Jr. does not hide his desires for the ladies who sat in the front row of the hit musical where he plays. It was an explicit invitation, first to the "ghost woman" of the story, Fay Helm; Cliff, the drummer, then insinuates himself very openly to Ella Raines who goes to the theater under the mask of the mystery that her boss had taken originally. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make all viewers dream from the beginning. There are things that are not explained, but that's all the interest. The killer is not revealed until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was an underrated actress. She defends herself against much more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York theater actor working in Hollywood, never found in this media the glory he deserved. He is effective as the accused's best friend. For his part, Alan Curtis presents himself as a man who, when framed, accepts his destiny and is saved only by the tenacity of the woman who secretly loved him. Thomas Gomez, as a Burgess inspector, is an asset to the film as a detective who has doubts about the police who surprised the man who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> This film will not disappoint.
