I really enjoyed this movie and it was a bit difficult to do when your brother made stupid comments in this movie for 30 seconds. But I liked this movie, mainly because I'm used to the usual action movies of HK. Most movies like this do not look at it for the story, but rather for the insane action. And the thoughtless action is right. You get to see Jet Li Sauter, turn, kick, hit, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge innumerable balls. It is true that this film was broadcast to a wider audience after Li played in Lethal Weapon 4. This is one of the reasons why the audiences of this film were dropped. Most people probably expected to see a film as polished as a North American film. But you must remember that most of HK's movie budgets are not as high as those of a North American film, and the style of an HK action movie is usually very different, usually requiring work in wire in many of them. If you want to see a good action movie, you should see it. Just try to ignore dubbing. <br /> <br /> My rating was 8.
