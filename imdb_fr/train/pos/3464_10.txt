* WARNING * Spoilers to come ... The authors of this story knew these men very well. In the same way, the actors represented them very well. The result is that at the end of the movie you have the impression of watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The expected tensions are there, especially in the first difficult moments. But as the two men begin to relax, the old camaraderie that made the Beatles work so well begins to manifest. Bitterness is still present and sometimes stops, but when John had the idea to accept Lorne Michaels his offer to pay the Beatles the amount of $ 3,000 intended to appear on "Saturday Night Live", both could be the same juvenile jokers who terrorized Liverpool together as a teenager and who survived in the noisy nightclubs of Hamburg to become superstars. But in the end, this fantastic fantasy brings us nicely. We were reminded why a meeting of the Beatles was probably never possible before Lennon's assassination: the two driving forces of the group went astray.
