This movie is just very funny. I have seen it many times, but there is always something funny that I remember. The car scene "ducks and rabbits" is one of my favorites and I always quote Morone versions of some words! <br /> <br /> There are so many jokes about the races that it's amazing. But I love Michael Keaton anyway!
