This film adopted Jerry Springer's approach to superhuman power. "Wilder Napalm" is the kind of thematic movie I like very much, addressing the idea that the wonders in America are defined either by their gifts or by their attempts to hide them. At the same time, the film emphasizes that every prodigy is only human and that there is nothing more to fear or adore than any other human being. It was a great comedy, funny and human with this slight satirical advantage.
