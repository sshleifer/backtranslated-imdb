I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of the bad reviews of everyone else. I thought: Even if I do not read the books, it does not look like the Nancy Drew I heard about. But I was wrong. Of course, it was not a true copy of books, but when you make a film out of something, you have to change it to become a big screen entertainment. The plot was nice and exciting with a lot of dread and I thought Emma Roberts was really believable in her own way of representing this classic character. There have been many fun moments and contrary to many statements, Nancy never presents herself as a ditz. She was smart, conservative, polite and genuine. This film has also been successful in balancing it with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I loved this film. What movie, what movie! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see that, get ready for some awful SCARY moments, because I was panicked! Go see him or be a fool and just let others decide what you think of this movie for you ... an error I almost made. I like it, I want to own this movie! I also like Emma Roberts now. She's like a DH mini Bree Van De Kamp. Love him, love him.
