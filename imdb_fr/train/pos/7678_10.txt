I just watched Holly with another movie on the trafficking and sexual exploitation of children called International Film Festival Trade at Film by the Sea. I must say that Holly blew up the water business. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing film on many levels. From a purely artistic and cinematographic point of view, it's incredible. Sound mixing, camera angles, direction and action are waiting for you. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way he treats the subject is refined and non-exploitative. It presents the issue of the sexual exploitation of children in a way that is both educational and precise. Filmmakers paid close attention to detail, truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of sexual exploitation and child trafficking. Too often, when a subject of this kind is treated, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to achieve all this without falling into the typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, one in the United States and the other in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen an audience so moved. After listening to the conversations after the screening, people ask what they can do personally to combat the sexual exploitation of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to everyone, both for its cinematic value and its subject.
