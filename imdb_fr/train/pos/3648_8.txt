"Pandora's Clock" is a suspense / thriller seizing between a movie about the virus and a movie about a disaster. The film, which aired in two parts on NBC during its first appearance in 1996, speaks of a virus-infected flight when one of the passengers carries the disease. The US government wonders whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to find a solution to avoid a disaster. I'm not a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I liked "Pandora's Clock". It's a sensational trip. Jane Leeves ("Frasier"), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as president) are also on the bill. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
