I saw this movie after watching the version of Paltrow. I found it very good and thought it would not be so good ... but I was wrong: the British version was much better and nice! I found Jeremy Northam more "nice" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong captures Austen's Knightley much better. Either way, both versions are good, but anyone who loves Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davies changed a few things, but still stays true to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
