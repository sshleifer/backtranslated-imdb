Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain, who has been charged and tried for allegedly killing her baby Azaria Chamberlain and for using his voracious dingo alibi as a defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and entitled in its Australian version, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. This presents a scenario that is all too real for us in America: the witch hunt against a person deemed to be an easy target. <br /> <br /> Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. As someone who expressed his opinion, someone who did not play the sympathy card, and someone who was just hard enough to continue with his life despite his horrible ordeal, she was described as suspicious and hated beyond comprehension, although it was clear that she did not kill her own child. The media began to stick together and gradually invade privacy, which quickly made the whole nation stick to its scenery as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And all the while, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband, Michael, was falling apart. <br /> <br /> This position is, of course, the power of force, as unpleasant as it may seem, and people react strongly to that. They want to see a mother in distress crying and crying and sometimes fainting at every turn, not staying there and staring blankly. People do not understand that everyone does not complain the same way and when someone decides to stay strong, he starts to speculate. Meryl Streep perfectly embodies this woman and thus creates a woman cold but not insensitive, true to his beliefs even if they cost him freedom. Thanks to her, Sam Neill is allowed to see his character dissolve slowly in despair - someone has to do it, otherwise the Chamberlains would be too loose and no one would want to see him. Except the monster who, at the time of writing this article, has become the news media. They always eat shipwrecks and feed the mutilated manure to the ill-informed public.
