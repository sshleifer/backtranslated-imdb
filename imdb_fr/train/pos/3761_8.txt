Bogus's trip to Bill and Ted is a continuation of Bill and Ted's great adventure. Their phony follower almost immediately after the first movie, and does just as well a job if not better to entertain the viewer. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bad person of the future who tries to kill Bill and Ted uses evil robots that look exactly like Bill and Ted. Once the robots have killed Bill and Ted, they must compete with the mower (death) and return to a normal life. <br /> <br /> The role in the movie is excellent, and although it's a bit weird at times, especially Bill and Ted's conversations, it's a great movie. The budding rockers made another great movie. Pick it up next time you're at blockbuster!
