The first installment of this notorious horror series features a woman kidnapped by a group of men dressed in black who tortured her for several days before finally killing her. She is beaten savagely, returned to the endless chair, has her nails pulled, throws her guts, throws boiling water and finally, her eye is pierced with a needle (scene really sick and nasty ). The authors of this unforgettable torture show have tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff movie you can get without committing a murder on tape. Of course, some of the special effects are rather mediocre, but the idea of ​​making a snuff is pretty horrible.I also saw "flesh and blood flowers" which is bloodier and sadistic, but less disturbing. Anyway, this one is a must for horror fans!
