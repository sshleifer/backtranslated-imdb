It's one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. If you've never seen it, try your luck. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together and although the film amuses me a lot, it reminds me of the premature disappearance of Julia. This is a good opportunity to sit and laugh at the international intrigue that touches us too much in this time of terror and fear.
