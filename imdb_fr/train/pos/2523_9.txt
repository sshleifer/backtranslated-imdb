When I heard about Moon Child for the first time, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I thought it was for real. The few criticisms I read that WERE NOT doing shouting fangirls were not very promising. <br /> <br /> When I had the opportunity to look at it, I was quite ready to moan, grimace and otherwise close my eyes to avoid foolishness. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has her cheese moments, camp, and general dorkiness - I think it's a bit impossible to avoid when it involves Gackt Camui, a man not known for his sanity - but overall, it was quite nice. <br /> <br /> No, it's not a film genius job, but it's very very sincere, fun, with a fun choreography, a touching score and a fun cast. I do not know much about Japanese cinema, so I can not really judge the acting, but because the actors spoke an extreme language or dialect that was foreign to them at one time or another and some one of them had almost no experience as an actor, was rather impressed. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, see this movie. At least rent it since coming to area 1. <br /> <br /> By the way, there is no homosexual / homoerotic content in this movie. I did not even see much of a subtext. Do not let people who read too much in things spoil this for you.
