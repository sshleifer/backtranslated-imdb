It is a very good Spanish film but I fear that many will feel lost because many in the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was or the date of its war. As a history teacher, I had a big advantage, but I could easily understand how confusing the film was until you put all the pieces together. I doubt that this is a major concern in Spain, where this film was shot, but it may seem confusing to another audience later in the film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Carol, 12 years old. and his mother returning to her mother's hometown. The years have passed and you presume that they arrive in Spain from New York. Despite the strangeness, Carol speaks Spanish quite well and the film largely explains her adaptation. As for why she and her mother are alone, I'll talk now about those who do not understand the fact that Carol's father is participating in the war alongside the Republicans (who ended up losing in this very conflict). bloody). <br /> <br /> The film receives exceptional marks for its photographic work and its music. The rather slow and disjointed pace is not bad provided you are someone who accepts movies this way. I have seen several other Spanish films about this war and it compares pretty well - no better or worse - just a decent film of life on those who are left behind as well as a beautiful film of the new generation. <BR /> <br /> PS - If you do not know which side is the Republicans were mostly Socialists and supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico, as well as volunteers from many countries (including including the United States). The nationalists were led by Franco and helped by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
