I grew up watching this series. I was about seven / eight when it was lit. I still remember the first episode called "The New House". It scared me! I can almost always hear this statue laughing wildly. And the end, oh my God! The spirit of hooror enters the room of the child: yuck! It was a classic TV and it was a unique series. I found a DVD collection for sale on the Internet: 2 currently. My question to all readers: Has anyone bought this set? It's a bootleg. Both sellers claim to have a very good copy. I have a basic and mediocre DVD of the episode "The New House", and some other episodes that are a little better, however, if anyone knows if they are much clearer, it would be worthwhile to buy them and share them with me. kids. A great series, intelligent, scary and daringly supernatural. Thanks in advance to all the fans who have the slightest doubt about all this. In fact, I would like to discuss it. Chris Walker
