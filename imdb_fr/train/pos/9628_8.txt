Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy movies have very, very little intrigue. Instead, they give them a rather mundane situation and just leave them hilarious! Movies such as HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are some of the funniest because you see boys working or cleaning the house. Here in DIRTY WORK, the film looks a lot like these two other movies - Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the movie trying (unsuccessfully) to clean the chimney of a mad professor. Seeing Ollie falling in the fireplace, the boys turning the house into total mess and Stanley's insane behaviors all work together to make a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> However, in a strange twist, there is also a really strange secondary plot that begins and ends the film. It seems like the professor is really a mad scientist and is working on a formula to make things look younger. Late in the film, you see him turning a duck into a duck and even a duck into an egg! Since he then leaves the boys alone in the room, is it a surprise what happens next? This sub-plot was useless, but it worked well. What has worked exceptionally well is the central part. Do not give the boys anything exciting and you'll be surprised at the hilarious results. One of the best movies of the team and he wins almost a 9.
