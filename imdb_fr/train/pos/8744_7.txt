It is a low budget film with a distribution of strangers and a minimum of outdoor shootings. The Philippines is replacing Thailand and nobody is going to Hong Kong. The stock pickup of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport eases the transition. This film proves that you do not need a mega-budget or a star to produce an excellent movie. It contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses in which young filmmakers often fall. Solid work from people who know all aspects of making a film and understand the tradeoffs between art and box office. Great work!
