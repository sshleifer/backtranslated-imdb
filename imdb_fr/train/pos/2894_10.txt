When I was a young boy, I always hated "Cinderella" since my two sisters had made me vote against it when my parents were considering buying a Disney movie. I wanted "Dumbo", but my sisters won and we had "Cinderella". They really enjoyed the movie as I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures. <br /> <br /> Many things have changed since then. My love of Disney theme parks earned me an internship at Walt Disney World and I now have two young nieces. I like to introduce them to Disney as much as I can, and we recently watched "Cinderella" together. With my new appreciation for all that is Disney, I watched "Cinderella" with a new perspective and was impressed by what I saw. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film, I did not understand very well. why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible situation. Why was she so enslaved to her in-laws and why could not she just run away? I was not too friendly to Cinderella, but over the course of history, I found myself immersed in history. Maybe the attractive animation or the playful characters attracted me, or maybe it was timeless songs. Listening to songs such as "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A dream is a dream your heart makes" somehow brought me back to the amusement parks. I can see myself in this carefree and fun atmosphere while watching the impressive castle of Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Something in this film evokes the magic of Disney. It can make a lot of people laugh, but go to the magic realm and see all the little girls dressed like Cinderella who are excited to be in this fantastic world and you'll know what I'm talking about. The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper, as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell, embody why Disney is one of the most valued companies in the world. <br /> <br /> While "Cinderella" may not be the strongest story, it's a kind of icon in the history of Disney and cinema. It represents the amusing, idealistic and fantastical wonder we had when we were children. I imagine this movie makes a lot of sense for many, many people. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it represents everything I love and admire about the company. <br /> <br /> Note from my IMDb: 10/10. My yahoo! Grade: A (Exceptional)
