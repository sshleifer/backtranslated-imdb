This film was a fantastic comedy. There were many comedians like Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> Rimi Sen played well with Akshay Kumars' wife and all the flight attendants. Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who love the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham cheats on his job, he becomes Akshay Kumars senior and Akshay Kumar becomes really jealous because his apartment has to be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia begins to love John more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham so he finds an apartment and he goes out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
