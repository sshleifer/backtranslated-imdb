With a modern sensibility, it is sometimes difficult to watch older films. It's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical clich√©d librarian of the Wallflower take off his glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man. Especially a shallow and fickle man. He is obviously a player (I would not trust him to stay true to her) who does not want to settle down, who only looks at seductive and stupid women and always calls them "baby" (ick!). Even after she completely changed her appearance and life for him, he only joined her after being (supposedly) rejected by another woman and learning that Connie had spent all her money renovating a boat. for him. I wanted her to rise up against him, not to chase him pathetically! His sudden conversion in minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Apart from this secondary plot, I liked the movie. How can you not love sailors dancing with each other ?! (You can tell they came from San Francisco ...;) D) The "rehearsal" dance was great, watching Ginger Rogers go in and out deliberately from the "good walk" was great. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with beautiful costumes and art deco decor was beautiful. And I really enjoyed "We Saw the Sea" (although they used it a little too often, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot was a little weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were acceptable, but the dance was worth watching. I wish they could show some San Francisco shots since the movie was supposed to have been shot. <br /> <br /> It is also strange to see such a light naval film that knows what Hitler was doing at that time. time. I must try to suspend all knowledge to immerse myself in an imaginary imaginary country.
