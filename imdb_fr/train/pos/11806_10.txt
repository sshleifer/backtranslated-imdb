Everything was better in the past days. Even the children's television. And Fraggle Rock proves my point pretty easily. At the time of writing this review, I'm fourteen, but even in my teens, I can not resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who actually live under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is a horde of playful and crazy creatures called Fraggles who live amazingly in a rock. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by many other species like Doozers and countless living plants. Doc, the scientific inventor and his dog Sprocket (who later binds with Gobo Fraggle) live on the outside of the rock, on the other side, a family of presumed rulers of the Universe, the Gorgs. The five main Fraggles Gobo (intrepid leader), Mokey (arty and peaceful), Wembley (undecided and friend of Gobo), Boober (a pessimistic domestic god) and Red (who loves everything about sport and general feyndity) ) in some strange situations, each episode while singing and dancing away from their worries. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is without a doubt a family show. Intrigues may include complex details that infants may not follow well, but the song The Dance Routines will hold their attention. The characters are strong and friendly, their credible conflicts and thrilling adventures. The Gorgs are scary, Doc and Sprocket brightening, Uncle Traveling Matt hilarious (the postcard segments are very 80!) And the last episode, Change of Address, is truly touching. Let's go down to Fraggle Rock again!
