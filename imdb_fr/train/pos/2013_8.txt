In the first three films of Frank Sinatra, it was purely a specialty: playing himself, he was content to show a song during the sequence of a nightclub in the film of someone else. In his fourth film, the highly entertaining 'Higher and Higher', Young Blue Eyes turns into an acting career playing a real role ... a facilitated task as he plays himself in a fictional story that gives him the opportunity to cro a few figures. <br /> <br /> The entrance to Sinatra is quite fun. Michele Morgan hears a knock on the door and asks who's there. From the outside, a Hoboken voice answers to Frank Sinatra. Of course ... <br /> <br /> The opening credits of "Higher and Higher" may confuse some viewers, as the names of songwriters Rodgers and Hart are well in evidence. In fact, they contributed only one song to this musical: "Disgustingly Rich", which this cast manages to launch as an introduction to a totally different song, "I'm a Debutante". Interestingly, this song by Rodgers & Hart - one of their weakest - is perhaps the least pleasant song of the score of this film; several others are catchy numbers, including "It's a very important business", "When it comes to love, it's up to you" and "I saw you first". <br /> <br /> Good Sinatra in this film, but he would do better (and sing better) elsewhere The true merits of "Higher and Higher" are the delicious turns of some performers who rarely make movies Paul and Grace Hartman were a an extremely popular husband-and-wife dance team that has played in several Broadway magazines: truly graceful ballroom dancers, they have put a lot of physical comedy into their dance material. (Here it's a kick Paul Hart, who died of cancer at age 48, has hardly worked on a film, so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see his close-up, to hear his beautiful singing voice and to notice at how sexy she is in her maid's uniform. After the death of Grace Hartman, her husband had a long career as a character actor, occasionally dancing solo. (Or alongside Ken Berry in a memorable episode of "Mayberry RFD.") <br /> <br /> Living teen singer Marcy McGuire is also very attractive in her daughter's uniform here in "Higher and Higher" . Why did not this talented girl make more movies? Maybe she was just a bit too similar to Betty Hutton's personality. I appreciate Hutton's performances but I like Marcy McGuire even better. Towards the end of 'Higher and Higher', there is a fun physical activity featuring McGuire and Mary Wickes as waitresses, taking turns moving from one table to another in a nightclub. The alternate steps of McGuire and Wickes are hilarious! Unfortunately, although Leon Errol plays an important role in "Higher and Higher", he has almost no activity in the field of comedy: not once does his famous dance gum. Jack Haley, despite his reputation, is also lost. <br /> <br /> Dooley Wilson, very well represented here, is inevitably known to Sam as "Casablanca". In this film, Wilson sang himself but simulated his keyboard performance of "As Time Goes By". (In real life, Wilson could not play the piano.) Here, in "Higher and Higher", he sings pleasantly and gives funny reactions to other players. Mel Odious is less pleasant, I mean Mel Torme. Victor Borge gives here a rare cinematographic performance, handling his dialogue with skill but never playing the keyboard comedy that he then interpreted successfully in his shows. <br /> <br /> The plot? Forget it. "Higher and Higher" is not the idea of ​​a "big" musical, but it's a nice treat, and I'll rate it 8 out of 10. Director Tim Whelan, who worked in both Great Britain and Hollywood, deserves to be much better known.
