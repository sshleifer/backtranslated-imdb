My observations: the hilarity of the post-war period. Tom Drake and his grandfather of "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year of my birth). Donna Reed charming and pretty. Margaret Hamilton good as always; part smaller than in "Wizard of Oz". Spring Byington is much prettier, with the missing little nose missing in Hamilton. The scene of the tent in the end with the old boy next door was hilarious. As a veteran of the army tents for two years, he looked pretty young and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes. <br /> <br /> I worked in a department store, and it was as elegant as this one. Unfortunately, he disappeared and fainted in the darkness. We were famous for these beautiful showcases used to attract passersby to the store, to get them to buy all these wonderful products. <br /> <br /> 10/10
