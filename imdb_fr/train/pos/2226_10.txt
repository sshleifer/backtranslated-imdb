I'm surprised the low rating of this movie by IMDb. With all due respect, his low score is representative of the IQ level of those who deemed him so poor. They would prefer to see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget and more gore. <br /> <br /> The first misconception that many people think is that it's a horror movie. It's not, and the film does not mislead you into believing it's one. It's a psychological thriller. It's for people who really want an intellectual experience watching a movie. Reel.com's review is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All other negative reviews do not make much sense. It's almost as if trying to make an original movie to change - very rare nowadays - is something bad and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I'm going to reveal some troublemakers for the morons who said it was boring it does not make sense. Martha was brainwashing and experimenting with herself as a caring mother when she was actually a diabolical Nazi who would kill without warning. All the proofs are in the pudding and the fact that, during the first viewing, we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster throughout the duration of the film testifies to the direction and writing of the film. <br /> <br /> I really feel that this film should at least be classified in the range of 6 by originality alone. I recommend this film to people at the other end of the scale of IQ, in other words intelligent people, because this film is obviously slaughtered by those who prefer to watch Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the acting game as well as. For a low-budget movie, you're surprised to find that this movie did not hit your local cinema with the right direction, written and played. Please do not be fooled by the rating by IMDb. This film is worth it. I actually recommend buying the movie since a first view of rent will not do justice to this decision.
