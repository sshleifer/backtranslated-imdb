If this film was shot a few years later, I would have given a point or two to the score because the sound quality was rather mediocre. Sometimes, the film seemed to be a silent movie during the in-between scenes (it lacks normal ambient sounds). But, since it was 1931 and a French film, it's quite forgivable. Especially since this also occurs in subsequent French films - at that time, the sonic difficulties should have been completely solved (as in L'Atalante of 1934). <br /> <br /> Okay, apart from a few minor sound problems. It's a nice little movie about a missing lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And, during the search, there are many small insignificant songs that you can not help but love. A beautiful and charming film.
