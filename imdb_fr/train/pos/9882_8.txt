Currently on the new METOO schedule at 4 pm on weekdays, just after "Maverick" and just before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I do not know if I'll ever see one episode originally, but I'm really excited about that. Staggered, unusual and surrealistic stories in a mythical West. A bit like the "naked city" of westerns. <br /> <br /> And the guests are here: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (a treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (as a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("War of the Worlds"), Gloria Talbott ("I married a monster from outer space") <br /> <br /> It took place during EIGHT SEASONS, in 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as the boss of the track, Gil Favor, the the most stoical man who ever lived, with the samurai's code of honor and the right balance of toughness and openness. I would vote for him as president any day. (PS He had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And a young Clint Eastwood is quite striking because his impulsive right hand, "Rowdy" Yates . In addition, the veteran actor and western country music actor (the immortal "a mauve, one-eyed, fluttering ox eater") Sheb Wooley is present as a seasoned scout, Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar is the most scathing character of the cook you can ask for as "Wishbone". <br /> <br /> And then there is this beautiful theme song performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the "Maverick" theme, Western songs are going through my mind all day long.) <br /> <br /> I look forward to every episode; I collect the whole game. A good time (not to mention a moo-ving experience) is always guaranteed, as we wait to see if the boys have solved their problems before the commercial. <br /> <br /> "Rollin ', rollin', Rollin '..."
