Adolf Hitler's manic desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second series of films produced by the US Department of War as a pedagogical tool for new soldiers entering the United States. armed forces during the Second World War. Hitler's plan was methodical and well-designed, beginning with the conquest of Eastern Europe, extending to the heart of Europe, then passing to the island of the world, namely the Europe, Asia and Africa. His last move would be to cross the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the Americas and the world. <br /> <br /> In 1935, Hitler ordered national conscription, the rest of the country falling under his bad spell. The schoolchildren sang his praises and the young German boys were trained and indoctrinated in military camps. In 1938, Hitler entered Austria unopposed and annexed a strip of border land between Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler took all of Czechoslovakia. Later in the year, the whole world was stunned to learn that Germany had signed a non-aggression pact with Russia, its deadly enemy, a ploy to delay Hitler's military involvement in too much of fronts. Immediately after, Germany invaded Poland, bringing the conquest of Hitler on the threshold of Russia. He will deal with her later. <br /> <br /> It was during this period that Britain still refused to oppose Hitler's push across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said he had won a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany, his infamous declaration proclaiming "Peace in our time". That's not what happened. <br /> <br /> The most fascinating information to learn in this article, at least for me, was provided by a small excerpt from the footage of a pro-German rally, Hitler, in the mid 30's. It was led by a German American taking his tail directly from the homeland. The place - Madison Square Garden!
