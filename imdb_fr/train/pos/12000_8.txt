I think the film is educational. However, it does not address the issue that has generated so much controversy: plural marriage. In addition, the film does not reveal what the LDS church is marrying. We missed a good opportunity to tell the world what they really believe. I could not have a clear idea of ​​what LDS views are on central issues of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many LDS friends and they are nice people. It would have been nice to have a clearer idea of ​​how they perceive the more controversial statements of their prophet. These statements may be too controversial to be treated as a film, but it would have been great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith's really interesting life. After all, it gives a glimpse of American thinking about religion in the 18th century. I hope they will make documentaries on this fascinating topic, allowing historians to comment on Smith's life. We may have a Mormon president someday. After all, Smith ran for president.
