This one has a lot to offer - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a little less slag - Iturbi, Grayson - and a little buzz - Kelly. It was Sinatra's first real movie where the producer was spending a lot of money and could be seen on the screen (he had previously appeared in two small budgets, Higher And Higher and Step Lively), but they relied only on Sinatra pipes and A much tighter film and a better showcase for Sinatra would have left us with a much tighter film and a better showcase for Grayson and Iturbi's piano. As he is very much in all his songs of the two duets with Kelly - We hate to leave, I begged her - to his own solos, What makes the sunset, The charm of you and Me too, I fall in love too easily. Despite this, Stephanie Lively remains the best musical Sinatra of the forties on a tenth budget.
