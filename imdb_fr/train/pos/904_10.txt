Suraj Barjatya is the best in the movies about marriage. And here it is. back to its bases on Vivaah. The story tells that this is a story of commitment to marriage. A movie that you can watch with all your family around you. A movie you hate to watch alone. The story is simple, but the music is good, the cinematography is excellent, the direction is the best, everything in the film has its own class. There are a lot of scenes that will make you cry and I'm sure if you watch the movie with your lover, you will certainly hold each other's hand until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita jodi has already given us blockbuster movies like Ishq Vishq, & Shikhar. Although Shikhar is a good movie, it has not been well accepted by the public. A real movie of Shahid & Amrita.
