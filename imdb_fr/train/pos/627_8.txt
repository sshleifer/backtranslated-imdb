Except for a disturbing scene, this refreshing fairytale fantasy has a fun and delicious background of cynical adult spirit that seduces the audience, as well as a soundtrack that powerfully accompanies this magical epic. Apart from one of Robert DeNiro's scenes that does not look smooth and does not match the rest of the film, this lush romantic fairy tale exudes a fantastical storytelling feel, as well as the strong magic and balance between scenes of adventure and spiritual humor lighter is done well. In the updated tradition of THE Princess Princess, this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight stars out of ten.
