German private television is poorly known for copying Dutch and ?? naturally ?? US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxage went only to the essential: Screwball. <br /> <br /> You can not stand comedy? Do not look at Edel and Starck. Seriously. If you're still waiting for a Law & Order-like lawyer drama or something, then go somewhere else. (Or look at Law & Order, because it's pretty brilliant, but I'm moving away from the subject.) E & S is funny, often talks about sobering themes, is funny, romantic, funny, funny and witty too . <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm dismayed that the writers did not get better deals after the series finale. And my cynical nature needs to readjust to German private television productions. German residents will understand what I am talking about. <br /> <br /> In short: look at it. I do not have a clue what English sync is, but hey, it's worth learning German just to watch them all four seasons. Pseudo-happy end included.
