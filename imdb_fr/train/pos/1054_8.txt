If you want a thoughtless action, sexy girls and a post-apocalyptic view of Seattle, then this is the show for you! <br /> <br /> The concept of Dark Angel is not new (in fact, there is controversy about whether James Cameron stole the idea in a book), but I spend the whole hour to watch it every Tuesday from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba smokes and Max's friends (the original Cindy, Kendra) are just a shot. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes are improving, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max have to be a bit better (the slang seems forced and it looks like someone from the suburbs wrote it) . <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan can ask for, but if you're looking for a hard-hitting, award-winning drama, check out "The West Wing" or something.
