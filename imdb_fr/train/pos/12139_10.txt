This film, even if it is more than 70 years old, remains a very moving and powerful film. Bette Davis, like Mildred, the vicious waitress and naughty cockney, is absolutely credible. Watching his performance is always mesmerizing. It forces the viewer to despise and pity her at the same time. Leslie Howard's performance as weak, obsessed with Phillip Carey is not as strong, but I do not see how an actor could stand up to Ms. Davis' performance. She nibbles the landscape in every scene she's in, totally stealing the show. It was the film that sealed her fame and she deserved to win the Oscar, but lost. It was shocking for her day with the themes of unmarried pregnancy, multiple sexual partners and Mildred's vicious language, so it's a bit dated, but it's still a great movie. Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what she really thinks of him ("you, you're dirty swine ....") is still one of the greatest actors I've ever seen in a movie .
