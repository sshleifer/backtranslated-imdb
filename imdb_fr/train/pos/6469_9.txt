It's a very good short film by Hal Roach. This is for two main reasons: the youngest children of the short film are among the cutest of all time and the plot contains so many fun and well written elements. <br /> <br /> As for the youngest of the little rascals, I honestly can not think of a cuter kid than Spanky at age four. Despite being a rather chubby and unattractive child in later years, he was just precious here. And placing the little boy in charge of keeping the kids even younger was not only fun, but again high for the cute postman. <br /> <br /> After the blackmail of older children, Spanky entrusted him with this terrible job of childcare, all kinds of funny chaos are unleashed. The gags are quite effective and well done at the moment - with an accidental kick involving a murder and a final scene where Spanky FINALLY takes control of the smaller ones being the most memorable. I have not seen these shorts for decades and I am happy to have given this one a chance.
