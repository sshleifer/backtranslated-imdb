The film is very complete in that it is, it remains interested in the flashbacks of childhood and grows up with such a weird father, and dotted with tails of serial murders, we simply can not go wrong. The plot in itself, the story and the essence of the film are entertaining. This is the kind of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do with so many things, and in this case, he really did a lot. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, you continue to anticipate more. and more about what's going on and where the movie is going, and the creativity behind that story is first class. I felt as if this film was exquisitely done from beginning to end, and one of those rare gems that seemed not to be besieged - the action unfolding neatly, quickly and tightly from a scene to the other. <br /> <br /> This shows how far people can go so far as to do such horrible things to their loved ones and do such evil acts, in the name of "God" when they are disillusioned as in this case . It is also sometimes interesting in its modifications and adopts the concept of morality as a whole. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the kind of film that we easily forget, but I would recommend you do not do the same. and to watch this movie, it's really worth it.
