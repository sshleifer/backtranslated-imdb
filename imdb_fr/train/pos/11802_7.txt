This is not the best Bigfoot ever created, but according to the recent standards of Nature, movies that go wrong, mainly broadcast on the Sci-Fi channel, this is a quality product. There is action, humor, a decent F / X and Bigfoot. The computer graphics are used, but the same goes for some F / X practices, which I like. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is worth the detour if you're a fan of B horror / science fiction and need a solution. It's better than the Sasquatch movie and not a sequel, so make no mistake. <br /> <br /> The acting is better than what you can expect in a film like this and the realization is more than enough. . Expect that the characters are "developed", but know that things will resume. If you are watching a DVD, you can skip one or two chapters.
