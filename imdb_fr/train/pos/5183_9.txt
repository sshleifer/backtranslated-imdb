<br /> <br /> This movie is by far one of my favorites. I saw it at the university in the early 90's, and even though I could not identify with the film's thirties, I felt that the story, the characters, and the movie in general were of superior quality. For people who have spoken negatively of the Indian summer, do not hesitate to stick to your excessive Armageddon movies and leave the movies with a great and beautiful story to those who can appreciate them.
