Oh, those sneaky Italians. This is not the first time that they have made a film on source material without the permission or knowledge of the author, in this case, the novel. Of course, this is not something that is typically Italian, but that was done quite often at the beginning of the cinema, mainly because they often thought they would be able to cope. James M. Cain's editors managed to keep the movie off American screens until 1976, but the film itself has become a well-known classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as good to watch as the 1946 American movie but it's still a good movie. Of course it is not at all because the film is a strong, intriguing story that gives the film great characters and realism. It follows the novel closely enough and is therefore essentially identical to other film versions of its history, with the difference that it took place in an Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Let the Italians make a film about life and the people who live there. These first dramas always have a very realistic realism and are therefore also very fascinating to watch. Unfortunately, the film lost some of its power towards the end, when it began to feel a little too long and dragging in places. The film could easily have ended 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I do not have much negative to say about this film. It is simply a high quality document, based on equally great and powerful source material. A rather impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who has continued to direct many other memorable Italian drama films. <br /> <br /> 8/10
