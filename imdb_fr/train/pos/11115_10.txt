I think The Sopranos is a great show because of all its characters. So far, I've bought all the videos and I'm waiting for the rest. So far, in the 42 episodes, the best is certainly episode # 3, Denial, Anger, Acceptance. This episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan was great because he was one of the few characters to have opposed Tony and his gang. In the end, he was shot in the eye while taking a bath, and this is my most favorite scene in the history of the Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. Matthew Bevilaqua was killed after trying to assassinate Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shot him in Hucklebarney Park after they caught him and tortured him. My favorite number three character is Sean Gismonte, who was killed just after shooting Christopher. And finally, my favorite character number 4 is Chucky Signore, one of Uncle Junior's henchmen. He was killed on a boat by Tony. All the awesome characters are dead. This is the only bad thing about sopranos. All the cool guys are always killed. You know what would be nice to change in the Sopranos? They should have an entire episode where they will show all the dead support characters in hell and they will all try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie because they need to get their revenge. Brendan Filone must fight back !!!!!!!!! 1
