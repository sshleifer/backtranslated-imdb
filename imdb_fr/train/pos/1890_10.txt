This is one of those movies I have seen so many times that I can quote most of them. Some of the lines in this movie are simply unbeatable. I particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall drunk, go to the classy restaurant of drunkenness and the role of moose. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I have seen this sequence, but it's funny all the time. From the moment Arthur arrives at Susan's father's house until the moose is in, you're laughing almost all the time. I remember watching the shots about the bit with the moose. Everything happened as I had imagined. They all laughed so hard that it was difficult for them to film them. <br /> <br /> The passing of Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to that. His behavior, his one-liners and his way of dealing with Arthur were also hilarious. It's always a funny moment when he hits him on the head with his hat or tells him he's a little ____ spoiled. I laugh every time I listen to the "I'm going to take a bath" and the lines that follow.
