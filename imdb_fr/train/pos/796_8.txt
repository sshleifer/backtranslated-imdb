Thomas Capano was not the boss of Anne Marie, Tom Carper, but the governor. That's why the feds intervened. He called Clinton and asked him to involve the feds in the case. I lived outside of Philadelphia at the time, so it was in the news every day. I also read Ann Rule's book and saw the "City Confidential" segment on A & E. Tom Capano was a megaloman (sp.), A super controller and a monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie but all he wanted was someone he could control. When she did not let him, he killed her, the ultimate form of control. I think it's a waste of money that he's still alive.
