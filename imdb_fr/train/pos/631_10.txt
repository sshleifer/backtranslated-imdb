This film has everything a fantasy film has to have, romance, clever tricks, a fantastic action game and a good dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this film and was attracted by its original plot (based on Neil Gaiman's novel that I am now looking to read) and its colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the things that struck me most is how autonomous the story is. Unlike so many fantastic sci-fi movies currently on sale that leave open ends, it was a pure fairy tale, satisfying in itself and not requiring any further action. <br /> <br /> Original. Fun. Feel-good Fantasy.
