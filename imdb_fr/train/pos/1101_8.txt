While prices have gone up a lot and some details are out of date, any homeowner who has problems with home ownership issues should make this movie a lot of fun. I know I did it. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings, a director of advertising in New York, decides to move his family to the suburbs of Connecticut and build a beautiful home there. He finds himself caught in hilarious traffic jams, mortgages, lawsuits, and construction difficulties, while the cost and schedule of construction work continues to escalate. I thought the funniest scenes were those where Blandings hired a contractor to dig a water well. They dig hundreds of feet but never find water. Yet a few steps away, a few days later, the basement of his future home is flooded! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy present a reliable show as the Blanding couple, overflowing with problems, never imagined and Melvyn Douglas is even better as Blanding's lawyer and friend of the family. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a naive dimbul who has no idea of ​​the additional problems she causes, and there is a maid black (horror!). So do not look at this film through the social lens of 2003, and you will appreciate it all the more. <br /> <br />
