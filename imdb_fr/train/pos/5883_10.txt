I watched, fascinated and hypnotized by vocal and physical play. The roles that each character played were performed with excellence. The words, the words, every gesture, the sunrise, everything is said. The movie told me. This has enlightened me about a different perception of a person who believes in humanity. Who believes in peace and gentle behavior. I was also incredulous, by sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed. The power without grace, is crazy and without feelings. Want power to the detriment of humanity, it's so incredible. This film made me so afraid for people who are no longer in this world. And it is with sadness that I think of them. I like this movie for conversations and facial expressions. May this film be blessed.
