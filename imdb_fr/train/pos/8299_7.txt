When the scientist and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepts the invitation to work in a space suit project with Micro-Digitech Corporation, he moves with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy), their son Robbie ( Barret Oliver) and their daughter. Chrissy (Sun Moon Frye) in a huge modern house complex of society. They meet their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle. Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom tries to seduce Matt by telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric rise in Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted by this offer. Later, he is introduced to the club's director, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci), who befriends Patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children. Matt feels the evolution of his family's behavior and decides to investigate the club, discovering a devilish secret about Jessica and her members. <br /> <br /> In the 80s, when I saw "Invitation to Hell", I liked this movie, which reminds in part "The Stepford Wives", with people who modify the behavior in a complex suburban. I just saw it today and I found a great metaphorical message against big business when people literally sell their souls to the devil for bigger jobs and higher wages. I do not know if the author intended to give that interpretation to the story, but I think that's fine. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation to Hell")
