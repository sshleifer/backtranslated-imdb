A thief in the night must be the best of all end-time thrillers. I have no idea that people are complaining that people are lamenting when they say that these movies scared them to accept God. They just needed to find an excuse and blame a thief in the night. Do not listen! These movies not only talk about one of the many possibilities of tribulation, but they are also fun to look at in their simplicity. They are actually small budget and it's a bit obvious, but not too obvious at first viewing. I had no idea because I really thought that a lot of movies like the ones made in the '70s were always low budget. <br /> <br /> A thief in the night tells the story of the young and cynical Patty Myers who lives for what happens to her, until her husband and almost all his friends disappear in the prophetic rapture which everyone preached. At first, the film is not entirely based around it until the kidnapping. This leads us to show that everyone around her becomes a Christian and believes in Christ, which is generally the case for many people. Everyone around them that they knew and loved would be gone forever, and the one left behind is the one who blames everyone except themselves. No one can blame himself for being wrong because he is always right. <br /> <br /> Like those whiners who complain about the movie. These people must be adult adults. I'm thirteen and you do not see me crying, especially since I was exactly like Patty before re-accepting Christ in my heart. For those who have not seen it, if you want a bit of everything thrown into a Christian movie rather than stereotyped, everyone is wrong, so you'll enjoy A Thief In The Night. Do not hit him before trying. Something new is always good. Trust your own instinct.
