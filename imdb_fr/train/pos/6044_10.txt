A great British movie Indy! The fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters gives rise to hilarious scenes full of drugs of which Cheech and Chong would be proud. It's great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even though he has changed sides since Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! I loved the final fight scene with a nod to Zulu and now, I know what happened to Arthur Brown after setting himself on fire on Top of the Pops! ... he does not play ... he's really an authentic British hippie. !!! You do not have to be a biker to enjoy it and it's directly in my collection of repeated post-pub views on Friday nights. <br /> <br /> Try this movie and you will not be disappointed.
