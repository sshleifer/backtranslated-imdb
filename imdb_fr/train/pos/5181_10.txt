Overall, I really enjoyed this film, but four things stand out: Sam Raimi's perfect timing and comic performances as a practical man at the camp, the wonderful characterization of the camp owner by Alan Arkin, and the best of all, cinematography. The beautiful golden tones of the outdoor scenes lead me into the film, as a sunset at the lake reminds me of my own memories of summer. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and the atmosphere seem to me very natural and credible. Some critics criticize the lack of a more "deep" script. For me, it is precisely this lack that makes this film work. The characters and their problems seem real and because of that, I care about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all parties come together to create a whole that feels good.
