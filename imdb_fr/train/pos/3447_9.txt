There is no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii. Unfortunately, even though he has made quite a few films that have caught the attention of the international community, many of his films have gone unanswered. Tachiguishi is one of them and, even though I loved it, it's not hard to understand why Western distributors are reluctant to take it out. <br /> <br /> Between his big and serious films, Oshii is known for making smaller and more bizarre projects. While Tachiguishi definitely falls into this category, Oshii has really outdone itself with this one, creating something very difficult to categorize, even as a weird Japanese movie. Go understand. <br /> <br /> At the base, there is a documentary quite different from Otaku no Video. But rather than ridiculing an existing subculture, Oshii invents his own and plunges into the life of culinary heroes by getting rid of the food free of charge and preserving the Japanese culinary level. Oshii's approach to the subject has close links with Dai-Nipponjin, as the subject is treated with deadly gravity while the on-screen images are as ridiculous as possible. The humor of Deadpan pushed to the extreme. <br /> <br /> But that's not all, instead of shooting his fake documentary, Oshii decided to do it using a new visual technique called superlivemation. A strange mix of live action, photography, digital animation and stick puppets. Interpreted and played (or posed, if you wish) by the biggest players in the Japanese animation industry, as the project should be as economical as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think you should know that the film is extremely dialogue-oriented, which makes it a good companion for Innocence. The influence of the scribes is analyzed from all angles, cultural, political and even philosophical, directed towards the public through a continuous flow of monologues and dialogues. And to make matters worse, the film as a whole is completely steeped in Japanese history and customs, making it even more difficult for a stranger to master the film. Needless to say, multiple views are recommended to get the most out of all the hidden details inside the movie. <br /> <br /> That said, conceptually, the movie is easy to follow and already very funny. Various scribes are presented, as well as the most influential historical personalities of post-war Japan. The film plays as if you would expect a serious documentary of any other important personality to unfold, but in one way or another, the big, crudely cut members of photography, whose characters are assembled, do not make it really serious. The range of characters presented is sublime, Shinji Higuchi taking the cake like a cow wearing a nose ring by taking fast-food chains with his band of bulls / people. <br /> <br /> Kenji Kawai, an Oshii regular, provides, in addition to a pretty comic performance, a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky, strange and comical. The exaggerated noises and effects complete the animation and completely contradict the tone of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is very atmospheric, but it must be said. that the animation is quite rare and effective, but remains attenuated, to burst from time to time in an overactive quirk. Which is not really a bad thing, because Tachiguishi is so heavy in dialogues. Despite this, the film remains a visual masterpiece because each image has an absolutely lush appearance and is designed to match the overall mood of the film. <br /> Be careful, because Tachiguishi asks the viewer a lot. . If you do not speak Japanese, there is a lot of reading to do and many cultural references that require some attention. In addition to this, the monologues in the movie area are quite extensive and can be difficult to follow. The film still lacks subtitles in English and although my French was more than enough to understand what it was, I'm sure I missed many of the finer points of the film. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not easy. film to enter, but halfway it reaches its cruising speed and does not take off from there. I always hope to see this one again with English or Dutch submarines. A dubbing would actually be better for a movie like this (a bit like Container), but I guess a quality anime dub is a little too much to ask. <br /> <br /> That said, I can only congratulate Oshii for another wonderful movie. It's rare to find a film that mixes and blends so many styles and influences to create something so unique and always works. The film is smart, beautiful and sounds good, and it's full of creativity. It's extremely funny, even if you can not capture all the details during the first viewing. But make sure you at least get it with decent submarines, because the automated English translation that circulates there is of no value and does not make the film justice at all. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is addressing a very specific audience and I am not surprised that the French are getting their release while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the Western world) is still waiting for a sign of this film. But for those who love Oshii, who appreciate dry, impassive humor and thirst for creativity, this is a film not to be missed, even if it could just as easily be missed. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
