Meryl Streep is a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she made fun of her because she played a lot of roles with accents, but she always emphasized. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as described here, was not particularly friendly or intelligent. But that makes Streep's work all the more remarkable. I think she deserves all 10 Oscar nominations. As for the film, there were two interesting things. I do not know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big role in history. I missed it a lot when I saw the film for the first time a few years ago, but it was clear yesterday. And it seems that the Australian press is as accomplished as its American colleagues in the pursuit of misery and overexploitation. A very good movie. A little different. Category B
