I love this movie 'Spring and Port'. I was born in Leigh, a town about 11 km from Bolton. In 1965, I moved to Bolton at the age of 20. My place of work was daily, from Little Lever to Farnworth, sometimes by bike but also by car when I could afford The film recalls all the memories of working-class neighbors who were almost always broke but who would always help you they could. Fred Dibnah was at the corner of Bromwich Street where my apartment was. If you did not see the movie when it was released, you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap like Coronation St. I admit it's a soap, but it was called " Kitchen Sink Drama! Watch this film for the talented actors who, not long after, have become famous names of frequent roles on television. I mainly look at the shots of the locality and the factor of well-being of the poor people but happy!
