Written by the writer who wrote the excellent Murder Rooms series about ACD's adventures with Dr. Joseph Bell, I was eager to see him and was not disappointed. It was very slow, with a lot of emphasis on Doyle's frustration with Sherlock Holmes who was very precise and perfectly described. It was an interesting character study and very well filmed (in digital video, unusual for a period piece). The acting was excellent at all levels, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actor who portrayed ACD, whose name I can not remember, does not impress me. An excellent study of character that has about the same number of twists as any normal case in Sherlock Holmes. Do not see this if you have the chance
