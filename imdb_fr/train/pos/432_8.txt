I only watched it because it featured Josie Lawrence, whom I knew from <br /> <br /> of "Whose Line is it anyway?", The wacky British show <br /> <br />. I was very pleasantly surprised by this comforting and magical jewel. It's edifying, touching and romantic <br /> without being dark or sentimental. The characters are <br /> <br /> real people, with real weaknesses, fears and needs. To see him!
