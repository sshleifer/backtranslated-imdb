The whole thing does not even come close to the sum of the parts. No problem. This film presents some of the most diverse creative directors of our time and some very famous names in the cast. The segments are designed around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the resemblance ends there. In fact, since the approach of the theme by all these directors takes so many forms, it is amazing that we can even have the impression to watch the same film. No major effort has been made to turn it into a complete package. This buffet contains so many great ingredients, I'm glad no one tried to put them all in one dish.
