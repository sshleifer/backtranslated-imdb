Before commenting on this film, you should know that when I saw this film, I was expecting the typical shit, the horror, the movie B and just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only delivers results, but is actually one of the best I've known in a long time. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost. In fact, I think he has a future in being psychopaths in big films if ever he was lucky. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman by a stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements. As soon as this snowman begins to move and kill people, you will have a hard time not laughing. The lines that are said are completely late, but really funny. The fact that the rest of the cast is completely over-powered just adds to the stupidity of the movie, but it's stupid, it's his genius. The scene where the snowman is with the teenager is really classic in the fashion of horror movies. I really hope there will be a sequel and that I will be there to watch it, regardless of the cable channel. Of course, it's only fun to watch the first few times and it's not really a good cinematic tech job, but I just like to see snowmen kill people. I gave it a 7 out of 10, it's a great movie for dates and couples late at night.
