I think this film adds to the diversity and is very specific in terms of historical reconstruction. The way it shows the different communities that go together in Thailand is very interesting ... The Portuguese, the Japanese and the different communities run by the king. The intrigues around the field are, as usual, a struggle for power with much treason. The wardrobe is good. The film is also made locally in Thailand in a reasonable production. The scene with the student as performers is very interesting. It's fun and I think it can also be used in schools for its historical accuracy because it shows that Europeans in Asia have been subjects of local kings very different from the traditional Hollywood perspective.
