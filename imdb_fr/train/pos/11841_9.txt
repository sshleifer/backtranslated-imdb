It was a good movie with a good story. My kids (10, 7, 5 and 4 years old) all loved this movie, including myself. The music was also fantastic. No, the horses do not speak, but the story is told by the Spirit. And hear a story told at the tip of a horse if the view was fun. <br /> <br /> I think the title says it all, "spirit". This movie really gives you the meaning of family, home and friends. I must say that my 4-year-old boy and my 5-year-old daughter were really touched by this movie, and even so enthusiastic, they laughed so much and cheered their spirits. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "the Spirit" with your family and let yourself be raised through this heartwarming story. Your children will love. I think you also.
