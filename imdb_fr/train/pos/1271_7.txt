Having never seen this film, based on the entertaining novel by Nicholas Katzenbach, and considering the first-rate distribution reunited for production, we decided to take a look. "Just Cause", although not a horrible film, takes too many liberties with the original material that Jeb Stuart has not quite succeeded in his treatment. Arne Glimcher realized. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think of when a young black man is brought into the local compound for interrogation is the brutality of the police. After all, Sheriff Tanny Brown and Policeman Wilcox have no mercy beating Bobby Earl, accused of killing a white girl. We are horrified by what the police are doing to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother is sent north to ask a distinguished Harvard professor, retired lawyer, that the young man asks Paul Armstrong to defend him. His old wife is convincing enough for Armstrong to take a look at the case. He is also convinced of the innocence of the young man. <br /> <br /> Things are not exactly what we thought we were. When Blair Sullivan, a man serving time on the same premises as Bobby Earl, makes himself known, he explains how he is related to the murder of the girl and changes the dynamics of the case. The way it is played in the film has the effect of diverting the viewer and diverting Armstrong from reaching the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller is made pleasant by Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes a good impression as a sheriff who, to our knowledge, is guilty of mistreating his prisoner. Ed Harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and young Scarlett Johansson play supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film, even with its faults, will not disappoint you.
