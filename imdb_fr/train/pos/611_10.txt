I maintain that the ultimate responsible for the creation / approval of the trailer for this film has completely gone wrong. No one I knew wanted to see this film based on the previews, and EVERYONE who actually saw it (which I know) absolutely loved it ... The advertising campaign is shameful / disaster / blunder. <br /> <br /> Open at # 4 behind ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Ultimate of Bourn, I've seen, awesome movie but 3rd week, average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving, I would say). <br /> <br /> # 3-The Simpsons movie, which I saw, ok movie but 4th week, average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower than Bourn, but this is our position for 3 weeks). <br /> <Whether for bad programming or poor publicity, I think the powers behind this movie have failed! This should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy / fairy tale and not advertised as a fairy tale ?? Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I praised the merits for no reason ... Awesome movie, go see it!
