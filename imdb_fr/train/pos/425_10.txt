I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my favorites all the time because my dad, Nelson Malone, plays the trainer. I distinctly remember the arrival of Hollywood in Lexington, Kentucky, where we lived at the time to create April Love. My father had played in many plays and was a talented man. I convinced him to try one of the parts proposed, and now he went home with the script. How exciting! In addition, a number of my classmates attended the crowd scenes, especially those at the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown again, and Pat Boone's April Love is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a bygone era where you see the movies they shoot today with all the sex, foul language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love coming back into focus ...
