Teta y la Luna is a symbolic Spanish film. Everything that happens in this film has a symbolic meaning. It's totally different from the usual movie that we have access to. <br /> <br /> This film is good, but it will only be suitable for people who want to find the meaning of everything in the story of the film. I must tell you that this is not an example of a movie. <br /> <br /> Please enjoy !!!
