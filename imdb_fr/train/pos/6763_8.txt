Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when people (at least those who could do such a thing) sit down and talk about the film noir. <br /> <br /> Yet some of the best movies of its kind, "Out of the Past", "The Killers", "In A Lonely Place", "Night and the City", manage a level of elegant sophistication that raises them beyond a perverse slogan and its connotations of shadows, fedoras and femme fatals. <br /> <br /> "Where the Sidewalk Ends", a hard-to-find movie - the only copy available in the best-stocked video store in Manhattan was a simple hacker from the AMC cable channel - belongs to a category With these classics. <br /> <br /> From the moment the black cloud of the opening credits passes, a curtain wraps around the crumbling world of solitary detective Marc Dixon, and as the moments pass, it's approaching more and more, threatening to suffocate. <br /> <br /> Of course, he's that familiar "dark-haired cop," but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a dark look and a troubled intensity that makes you feel as uncomfortable as he is. 'air. And yes, he has been flouting the suspects for too long, and the newly promoted leader (Karl Malden, on a generally robust and imposing sortie) warns him "for the last time". <br /> <br /> However, Dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now. And the boy did not they come? <br /> <br /> "Balaclavas, rags, cups, nickel rats", he spits when this bossy idiot retrogrades him and unfolds all the complaints the office has received about Dixon's right hook. The advice is for him to calm down for his own good. But instead, he takes things in hand. <br /> <br /> And what a world of problems he finds when he relies on his instinct and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been transmitted a generation ago. <br /> <br /> He is immediately immersed in the cops, the union, his own partner. The questionable involvement of Dixon in an "investigation" into a murder threatens his work and leads him to wonder whether he is as basic as those he has sworn to integrate. Like Bogart in "Lonely Place", can he "escape what he is?" /> <br /> When he has nowhere to go, he discovers that he has practically condemned his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney) who seems to want to turn the existence of his sterile bachelor into a place worthy of returning home. at. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this superb film is tense and striking. The group of writers who contributed to the production tweaked the scenario - the dialogue is lively, without disintegrating into a parodic fodder dated, passionate without becoming melodramatic or dark. <br /> <br /> And all this direction and this game of foreground are neither too smooth nor polite to soften the emotional take of the film. The angelic beauty of Gene Tierney's gentle focus is used wisely. She turns out to be an actress of considerable scope, and her gentle and kind nature is as limitless here as her psychosis in "Leave it to Heaven". The scenes between Tierney and Dixon Andrews intensify and touch as it seems to self-destruct. <br /> <br /> At the end of his rope, Dixon, cut, bruised and exhausted, sums up his fate: "Innocent people can also get into terrible traffic jams ...", he says. "A wrong move and you're above your head." <br /> <br /> Perhaps what makes this film so compelling is it the feeling that things could go wrong for almost everyone - especially for someone who is trying so hard to do things right - with a slight change of wind, a bad decision or a punch, or, more frightening, because of factors over which you have no control. Black has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. "Where the Sidewalk Ends" does it realistically. <br /> <br /> (A choice with a magnifying glass on one side: this film, otherwise remarkable, has a very poor duo of a blond model who would not seem out of place on the Mystery Science theater. strange.) <br /> <br /> But Black Devil fans, ALL movie fans - who have never seen this one will have a great treat.
