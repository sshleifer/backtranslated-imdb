Freddy Krueger the elm street dream stalker returns, the great actor Robert Englund is back in this sequel to nightmare 5, child of dream.I hope I have understood the number.There have been so many, and this one is one of the best, especially for cameos; Roseanne Barr (then Arnold) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (who made the first nightmare 84) Alice Cooper (singer) you will see Freddy as a tormented child, a teenager who loves pain and a family effect (scary) the effects are very funny and creative, the cast also includes Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) Breckin Meyer (road trip) Yaphet Kotto (alien, live and let die) and Amanda Donahue (father knows best) I was a people who saw this in 3D, and the end. I love 3D movies. I missed the first wave in 1953 (I was not even born yet). The second wave was in 1983.I like all of Freddy's movies. this one stands out as one of the best besides the first one that was absolutely brilliant, Freddy became the new monster of the 80's and 90's, along with Jason voorhees, chucky, Micheal myers and leather face.c can you imagine a movie with each of them? I recommend it to all fans of Freddy and horror lovers.Also Freddy is it so badly cut that 8 out of 10.
