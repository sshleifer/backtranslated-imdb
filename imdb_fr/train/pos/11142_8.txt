I'm joking. <br /> <br /> Looking for greener pastures in jostling New York, Jon Voight is the upbeat young Joe Buck of the Cowboy (almost Forest Gump), Texas. It does not take long for the big apple to swallow it without mercy and its full ambitions and soon Joe is the target of the coldness of New Yorkers and the inconvenience of his street thugs. Given his pure heart, he pitied one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). He later moved with him to his ruined apartment and the two struggled literally to survive. <br /> <br /> While Midnight Comedy is called drama, it is better to describe it as a tragic comedy or a comical tragedy in my opinion. Above all, it's a beautiful film that captures with elegance the contemporary hippie atmosphere of the late 1960s, with its dizzying and compelling cinematography, and juxtaposing it with the ultra-urban city of New York. The film presses Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in between, thus highlighting his misplaced position. We strive to find his place, but also to get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy made me cry because he is also rich in substance and has a lot of heart. I imagine that this film must have inspired both Forest Gump with its main character to the pure and misplaced heart and, to a certain extent, Crocodile Dundee's films, because it deals with almost the same kind of humor - a contrast between the cowboys and smooth cosmopolites of New York. Very convincing and sensational film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
