I just watched this movie and found it very enjoyable. It's a quiet little movie that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" performances. It simply takes you into the lives of the inhabitants of a small hamlet in the North Carolina backcountry. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a great performance as Raymond Toker, a young loner who finds an abandoned baby in the woods. Toker's search for the baby's parents leads him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a slimy crook with an ulterior motive. And David plays the villain to perfection. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this film than we saw at first sight. Filmed on site in North Carolina and accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack of traditional music, it is worth watching.
