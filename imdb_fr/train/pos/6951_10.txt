I have never been a big fan of TV until I watched 24 channels for the first time. I entered the series very late. Season 5 ended before I saw my very first episode. It was an episode of Series 3 that was on my parents' DVR box while I was home for the weekend. It took this episode for me to be the spearhead and lead in the world of Jack Bauer. And the boy I was addicted! I watched the next six episodes without blinking. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited monthly fee for $ 20 and it goes without saying that this was the biggest amount of money I ever spent. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. It's 72 episodes of forty minutes !!! I will say that for DVD, it is easier to know what happens next than to wait for a whole week. I can only imagine the anticipation of watching the season 6 week after week! I find it a little tortuous and cruel, but I will try it and watch it like the rest of America !! The DVR is set and you can bet that I will chopper!
