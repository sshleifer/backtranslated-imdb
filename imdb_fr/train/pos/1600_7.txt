This is not a bad movie. It's not very funny, but it's interesting and <br /> entertaining. There are some fun moments. Dear gives a good <br /> <br /> performance in a role that is very opposite to him. Its performance <br /> <br /> alone is worth the detour. If this film was out today <br /> <br /> it would not have been nominated, but it was excellent by the standards of the 80's <br /> <br />.
