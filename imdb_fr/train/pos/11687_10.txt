My taste for Chris Rock varies with his films, I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4, but I hated everyone in this movie. I love him when he is himself and do not hold back, as in Dogma. Well, it's his best at the moment, I did not expect it to be so good. I had crazy ass all the time. Chris Rock tells a wonderful and wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedies I've seen for quite some time. Love
