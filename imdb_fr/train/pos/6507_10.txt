This series, probably produced at the most favorable time after the events of the Second World War, has a value that goes far beyond the presumption that any individual can criticize. <br /> <br /> The timing of the production of World at War in 1974, about three decades after the events of the war, allows accurate reporting of events in a manner that has no color of background for residual propaganda. The thirty-year passage allows the story to draw on an impressive and fascinating array of people involved, ranging from the highest military and political figures to soldiers on the ground, to civilians and survivors of the death camps. remain to testify to unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable. Most respondents who are approaching or have reached their advanced age have had sufficient time to reflect on their experiences and, in most cases, enough time for the propaganda and the ardor that had affected them in the past. be removed, leaving only memories of what they have seen and done. <br /> <br /> The information given by these survivors, reinforced in a striking way by the postures and expressions that they display by telling their part, gives an even greater impact to their history. Names such as Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (Hitler's personal secretary) ... the list is too long to describe. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, the survivors of this enormous lesson in the insidious price of political ambition are young people who sing the same kind of promotion of the militarist and nationalist war that led to the Second World War. World War. The DVD series we are discussing here should form the core of a compulsory history story in schools, that lessons purchased at such a horrible price at that time should not be wasted but should be taken to heart by those who have not seen it directly. terrible price. <br /> <br /> I've almost finished watching the 11-disc game, having seen the bulk of the show when a local TV channel broadcast it more than 10 years ago. It has lost none of its poignant character, it has even become a magnificent chronicle of some of the darkest days of humanity. <br /> <br /> The highest possible score seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation. . I think the value of this series is invaluable.
