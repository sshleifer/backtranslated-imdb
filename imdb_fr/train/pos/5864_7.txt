I did not like Apocalypse Now, pretentious and overrated. My favorite film about the Vietnam War is probably The Deer Hunter. The deer hunter focused on part of the war and then on life before the war. This film is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The script is too blurry compared to Deer Hunter. The story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel the characters as Deerhunter did. Flashbacks in Vietnam are not as captivating or as involved as those of the Deerhunter. That's why I can only give this film 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> However, I think the acting has been exceptional. DeNiro and Harris are really incredible actors. They completely immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two old friends who lost their best friend Bobby in battle. Harris's character is a half-dead alcoholic, hiding the guilt he has for losing Bobby's life while trying to save his life. <br /> <br /> I also like the secondary casting. Everyone in the city is part of the movie. The city obviously does not handle Vietnamese veterinarians very well. As in many small towns, it's all about being quiet, humble and doing business. Harris's character, however, can not be any of these things. It is interesting to see how wars affect people. Some people bounce quickly, while others never really recover.
