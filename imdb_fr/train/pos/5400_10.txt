This film is a brilliant lesson on Japanese history that took place at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate shortly before it lost the battle to the loyalist, who wanted the emperor to return to the throne to lead Japan. . Really, I had to read a lot of history to understand the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) gives a superb performance in the role of Izo Okada, one of the four Hitokiri (= Man). Slayer) of Bakumatsu. He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. In order to have a good life, he becomes a staff member of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke and Sword of Doom). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist politician who lets his Hitokiri group assassinate many pro-Western high-ranking politicians in order to achieve his political goals. Izo Okada follows his boss without really wondering what they are doing. As long as he has money to go and drink and spend with his whore. Okada's murders become more and more brutal during the film and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful portrait of the life of a simple samurai who gets carried away in politics and who is really naive to realize what is going on. After being betrayed and tortured and having always had discussions with Sakamoto (who is a samurai who refuses violence), he changes his ideas and views on life. But too late ... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the team make a brilliant performance. Each actor achieves his role. The sword fights in a very unique and fast way ... probably faster than several movies nowadays ... <br /> <br /> Discover it if you have the chance !!!
