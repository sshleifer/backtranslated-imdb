Okay - I'll admit. It's the film that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. It is a beautiful parody of someone who makes a parody of James Cagney, with a charm to spare. <br /> <br /> The basic actors are solid workers, and will do a great job in this comedy of the 80s. A parody of gangster films of the 30s and 40s, he innovates constantly, with a remarkably original material. (Well, yes - some copies have been copied since - but when this film was shot, it was original and much of it was not copied elsewhere.) Look Joe Piscopo warn people not to ______, with one of the best parody slogans. Watch Roman Moronie do profanity things in English that would make your grammar teacher, single girl, laugh. Watch amazing gags, such as pet shop owner Johnny Kelly, who uses the price tag gun on his puppies and dusted his kittens. Watch the biggest educational film "Warning against sex" ever made. Look at the most amazing representation of the Latin religion made in church, while a guy who has never attended a workshop class assembles a Thompson machine gun from pieces. Observe the lines you will use in an informal conversation over the next decade. Watch Maureen Stapleton make the perfect antithesis for the hardworking mother, with surprise gags that you will never see coming. <br /> <br /> If you see a gag that does not hit you, be patient - another will arrive in 30 seconds or less, and chances are you'll have to pause until you have finished rolling several times on the ground. Ducks and rabbits? Them too. Watch for subtle details - some of the visual gags may go unnoticed on first visits. <br /> <br /> There are some minor flaws - but it's probably the best of the pardons. Some are getting closer, but none are so good.
