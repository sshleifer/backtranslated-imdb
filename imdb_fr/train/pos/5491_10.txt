Although we know how the story ends, it is a captivating film that plays almost like a political thriller. During the calm that preceded the storm, we met Hugo Chavez as a charismatic, larger than life, who has indestructible links with the half-breeds, who constitute 80% of the population, but who were previously excluded from the political process and Venezuela's oil wealth. He seems to be as devoted to them as he is. He travels the country at a frantic pace, addresses the peasants, addresses a huge crowd, kisses and kisses ordinary people, accepts letters on scraps of paper and hears requests for help. People are delighted that one of their members has gone to the highest office in the country. There is an electric feeling of hope and optimism that change for the better happens in purulent barrios. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with the situation. The Spanish Castilian elites of pureblood who are a small minority but previously controlled all the wealth are full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most hilarious moments of the film is unintentionally the moment when a look-alike Ann Coulter, at a meeting of residents in an exclusive gated community, complains of the half-breeds, "they have no notion of struggle or sacrifice ". A few minutes later, a speaker asked the meeting to "beware of your servants - they could be supporters of Chavez". Duh! Of course, they are. <br /> <br /> In a late interview, alone with the film crew, Chavez reveals something of his soul by telling the story of his grandfather. He may be a sensitive and poetic person, but with a mischievous, even clownish sense of humor (as we saw when he addressed the UN and called Bush the Devil.) > <br /> Then the storm begins to gather The organizers of the coup call for a mass demonstration and cynically manipulate their supporters to change their route at the last minute and head to the presidential palace, knowing that he is surrounded by supporters of Chavez and that violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Another element of the plot is taking place as snipers on the rooftops start shooting at Chavez supporters, some of whom are fighting back. The local counterpart of Fox News shows that fire is coming back and claims that Chavez supporters are killing demonstrators. Then the camera goes back and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The demonstrators took another path. Needless to say, the images of the deserted street were mounted by the anti-Chavez private television channel (which broadcast an endless stream of propaganda calling Chavez mentally ill and sexually obsessed by Fidel Castro.) Immediately after the coup the ringleaders and their media propaganda masters openly boast about how they manipulated the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of their supporters and opponents. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers continue to be at the heart of this chaotic situation, a rapidly changing situation as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it. Chavez finally goes to avoid bloodshed, but refuses to resign and is taken to an island off the coast where a plane is waiting to take him - where? United States? How can the remaining members of the cabinet avoid the arrest and defeat of this highly armed plot of right-wing generals and extremely wealthy businessmen closely linked to the Bush administration? Watch the movie and find out! <br /> <br /> If you only know Hugo Chavez and Venezuela, you do not know it. He is not an "unelected tyrant" and does not "rule by decree". He is extremely popular. He was elected and re-elected several times with more than 60% of the vote (which George Bush Junior never achieved.) He usually inspires ordinary Venezuelans. This is ultimately the reason why the failure hit failed. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. The talent of the filmmakers is to remain discreet and to let the story unfold through the voices of Venezuelans at all levels, from the barrio to the presidential palace, through the tumultuous scenes, the chaos and confusion that result and in motion . Do not miss!
