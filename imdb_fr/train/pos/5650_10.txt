"Someone at the door". OHHH, I miss this show so much ... but we are lucky to have "Invasion" now. Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic had everything. If I had to choose one thing that pleased me the most in the series, it had to be his "unpredictable intrigues". The favorite actor was Lucas Black .. I love this southern accent. I bought the DVD as soon as possible and my kids are also fans. There are hot and hot scenes. Some evil ones too. So, if the kids are going to watch, you may want to edit (fast forward / skip). He has humor, on a level of Joss Wheedon, who misses so much shows. Adult mind and adult situation treated with finese. The DVD contains some extras, but I wish it had a lot more. If you want to marvel and enjoy a good show, come see "American Gothic"!
