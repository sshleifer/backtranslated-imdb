I was electrified when I saw this for the first time in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko left in the middle of the film, but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. I did not do it when I finally went to South Africa in 1993. It's also largely a story of friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and I heard the audience at a dance recital in Natal singing Nkosi Sikelel 'iAfrika, my hair was combed. There is much to learn from this story for all people.
