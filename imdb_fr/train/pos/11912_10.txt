I enjoyed Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for his nerdy action and semi-complicated storyline. Many people complain about the "confusing" plot of the first film, which probably explains why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a silly plot like a rock with the same super-action to bring it to a successful conclusion. <br /> <br /> This one gives the name of the hero of the first movie, Alex, to an extended super-woman sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good part of the film contains only dialogues in an African language without subtitles, which I liked because it gave the impression that it was rather authentic (how often do films of this kind really try to make?). The evil cyborgs were quick to go back in time to find her and try to kill her. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, it's a piece of shit (not that the first was something big). There are sub-plots involving political unrest in Africa, treasure hunting and tribal fighting. The picture is very short on the brain, so none of these things gets very good treatment. The image is basically a long fight with some lawsuits that boil down to a baby-muscle versus a cyborg. It has entertainment value, but do not expect quality or anything from the first movie.
