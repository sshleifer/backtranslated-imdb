I saw this at the theater and I immediately thought it was good enough to be recorded on video. Anyway, I'm a big fool for Sci-Fi action movies. <br /> <br /> Without telling the story, it's worth seeing if you love the Sci-Fi without thinking too closely. The story is basic and the plot is very good. It's worth seeing! <br /> <br /> Maybe they'll do a sequel? :) <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
