Note "10/10" Centerpiece <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I heard Spielberg comment that he redid the film here and there if he had the opportunity. Well, Mr Spielberg, I guess nothing is perfect, but this film, with Schindler's list, is your best. Even Oprah works well in this one! <br /> <br /> What attracted me the most is the realism of the story and the drama. Things like this have happened and are still happening around the world.
