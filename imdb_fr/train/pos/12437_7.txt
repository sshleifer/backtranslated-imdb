A long-time lover of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creation, I watched this film on DVD with little hope of enjoyment. In fact, I was expecting the remote control to be disgusted within fifteen minutes. But instead, I really enjoyed this production, and I particularly enjoyed how the producers and the director managed to tell the story of Modesty Blaise. They managed to avoid the trap of making a (bad) cinematic version of the books we all know so well, choosing instead to focus on a period of life in Modesty mentioned only in novels. <br /> <br /> for the production values ​​(and I'm not a student in cinematography!): yes, the film was shot on a tight budget and budget and maybe it shows. but does this spoil the pleasure of the viewer? In this case I do not think so. Instead, we discover one of the greatest literary heroines in the world and let us taste his abilities. <br /> <br /> Regarding casting: because we, in unknown territory, the only people who really matter are Modesty and Professor Lob. For me, they were totally credible. Alexandra Staden, described by some as being in wood and too thin to be an action heroine, showed on the screen the calm and freshness of Modesty; his technique (when the martial arts were needed) but above all personified the integrity that is at the heart of the canon of Modesty Blaise. <br /> <br /> OK, we all know that this movie was produced in order to claim the right of Miramax of Modest Character Blaise, it was made quickly and cheaply, BUT ... I'm impatient to see the next production of this series from these producers - as long as they respect the core values ​​and characterizations of the original stories!
