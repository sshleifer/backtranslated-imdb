I have this film about a month ago and I am now a fanatic of Drew Barrymore. I like a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant with the truths of Red Sox! He is a mathematics teacher who takes promising kids on a math trip to a company where Lindsey (Drew), a well-known figure, provides them with information. This then leads to the dating Ben (teacher) and Lindsey. But all is not easy when he admits to being an unconditional fan of the Red Sox. <br /> <br /> First of all, everything is fine, but then her baseball hampers Lindsey's life. All is well in the end and it took a shot for Drew to cross the field !! I got it for two books in Blockbusters so I was happy. If you like movies like this one, I suggest you see a little more of Drew's work like Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even his new film with Hugh Grant in Music and Lyrics.
