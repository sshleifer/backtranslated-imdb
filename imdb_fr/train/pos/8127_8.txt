Although a little preached on the subject of progress as humanity's saving grace, it is still a stunning film that heralds the sci-fi special effects superproductions that would take another 40 years to be screened on the big screen. He predicts the global chaos of the Second World War, but extends the principle by making the conflict last 30 years, then tells the epic story of man's struggle out of the rubble and into space. The actors' play seems wooden and strangely sterile, but that may be due to its contrast with the images that were to be breathtaking at the time of the release of the film and still impressing today. This is a movie not to be missed by anyone interested in SF.
