I had read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I did not see it until early last year when I threw myself into a frenzy of buying senseless movies and, whatever that was the reason, it had been bothering me for some time. I have been watching it for a few months now. <br /> <br /> This is a gripping film, shot in Italy around the 15th century. Certainly the medieval period (although I do not think that a specific year is ever given). This is the time of Christian descent, our era is a period of total madness, and the film makes very well. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist, Flavia, is a young woman who meets a Muslim who died on a battlefield. . He seems to be a warm and intriguing man, and she is immediately taken with him. His father, a standing family soldier, arrives almost immediately and kills the wounded right in front of his eyes. But she will continue to see it in her dreams. <br /> <br /> His father takes him to a convent that looks more like an insane asylum in the open air - the residents, so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval Christianity, slowly go crazy. Flavia is under the influence of one of the craziest nuns. But in a crazy world, only the healthy are really crazy, and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the madness that surrounds it. Her look at the time when they live will touch Flavia, who, young and apparently sheltered, begins to question everything about this world in which she is trapped. <br /> <br /> The film does not shine. in his portrayal of this world, featuring a lot of inconvenience. We see a gelding horse, a lord raping one of the women on her land in a pigsty, the pious torture of a young nun. Through all this, Flavia observes and questions, finally rejecting the Christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that deserve to the film critics over the years for their anachronistic appearance. I do not agree with this criticism. Flavia's opinions, although sometimes expressed in a way that vaguely reflects, for example, the feminist commentary of the time (the film was shot in 1974), revolve around very obvious questions. It may be hard to believe that she may be a fish out of the water in her day, but it is the kind of minor problem that is lacking. Flavia is written in such a way as to enable those of our time, or of any epoch, to show empathy for his distress. To get bogged down in such a case would be wanting in the forest of trees. <br /> <br /> Flavia is comforted when Muslims arrive invading the countryside and she finds in their leader a new version of the beautiful Islamist who still visits her dreams. Struck almost immediately with her, he almost let her lead her army, becoming a figure of Joan of Arc in battle dress, and ordering the invaders to demolish Christian society and avenge all those she saw commit evil. /> <br /> Is she the herald of a new and better world? She may think so, but the Muslim women of that time were not very ferocious about feminism, because she learns the hard way fast. As they say, meet the new boss ... <br /> <br /> This is really just a vignette of what's happening in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The film is rather dark and with a very slow, rather depressing end. It's not at all a mainstream movie. This is good enough, however, and does not belong to the "nunsploitation" stack on which it is often casually thrown away. I think the final film has a lot of value and I'm happy to have seen it.
