"8 SIMPLE RULES ... TO MEET MY GIRL," is, in my opinion, an absolute classic of ABC! I'm not sure I did not see all the episodes, but I always liked it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when an incident occurred. I always laughed at that. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the show more when John Ritter was the main man. If you ask me, his sudden disappearance was very tragic. Everyone has always given a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes well designed and the writing still very strong. In conclusion, I hope a network will rebroadcast it for fans of the series.
