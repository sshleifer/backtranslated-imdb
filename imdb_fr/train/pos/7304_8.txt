From time to time, a movie is as scary or scary, although it is not usually the case. Most modern horror movies fall into this category. <br /> <br /> Then there are those movies that do not just make tension and adrenaline swell louder than usual in your veins. In fact, they scare you to a level you have never known. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is such a movie. It takes so many risks that most movie producers would be angry. But almost all work. "Halloween" is impressive for its simplicity and terrifying overall. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysitting on Halloween night, while a madman is on the run after escaping from a psychiatric facility after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, starts killing the local teen population and ends up coming after Laurie. <br /> <br /> This sounds familiar, does not it? Just another brainless slasher filled with stupid teens and gore gobs. Not a chance. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli sums it up perfectly in his article on "Halloween:" "Because of its title, Halloween has often been grouped with all the other splashing movies that populated theaters across the in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, while Halloween is rightly considered the father of the modern slasher genre, he is not a member ... "<br /> <br /> He is right, and for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it's downright terrifying, as most teen slasher entries are gores (you could say that many of them are chilly, but most of them fail also). Secondly, there is almost no violence (very little blood). John Carpenter knows that violence is not synonymous with fear, and he relies very little on it (in fact, the number of people is quite low). In fact, we can say that it is not really a horror movie, at least not from the current point of view, with the greatest number of deaths that can be piled up in a single film, all more goriers and more sadistic the as each other. He relies on ideas to scare, but also on his skills. Third, while some characters can do stupid things (which sometimes seal their fate), they do not do them because they are stupid. The characters are real people. Instead of thinking that characters are dying because they are idiots, we are scared because they are making a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons that "Halloween" is so scary is because it's so easy to believe it's real. Nothing is hard to swallow in this movie. There is no supernatural, no ridiculously creative plot element, no "inventive" murders, or anything else. Instead, all the parts and the work of the camera (record the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter simply puts the camera in place and says action. What we are getting is the feeling that we are witnessing the murder of a murder before us. <br /> <br /> Horror movies are probably the most difficult movies to make, because for something to be scary, must be perfect, and ideas never work twice. It's a risky game. That's why, if I told you all the good ideas of Carpenter (which I am not), they would seem primitive (especially since they were repeated with less effect over and over over the years). ). <br /> <br /> To act here is not an advantage because it is not necessary to be it. It's a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic and conflicting characters. Actors act like real people, not characters in a story. Nothing more. The exception to this rule is anyone who plays The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary to ask a person to say nothing and simply kill, but it is difficult to succeed (and even more to prevent people from asking why). But the guy succeeds, and the result is terrifying. <br /> <br /> This is the Carpenter movie through. He directed it, co-wrote it, co-produced it and wrote the paralyzing score. He is a man of genius, and his later film "The Thing" corroborates this claim, although The Thing is not as scary as "Halloween". Unfortunately, its success has diminished considerably, as happens when the attraction of large sums of money for less freedom is put to profit by the big producers formerly "who recognize their potential". As good as it is, it is not without defects. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. And few fears work for the first part of the film. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there is no good reason to fear "The Shape". Fortunately, Carpenter mainly uses this time to establish a relationship between the characters and the audience. Although there is no intimacy in this relationship, it corresponds to the desired goal. We start to know the characters, but it's not so discouraging that they die. But once the film enters Halloween night, Carpenter is committed to it and NEVER stop until the end. <br /> <br /> Even if "Halloween" can be defective, it is only slightly. It's an immensely terrifying and must-see movie for anyone who loves horror movies. Be warned though, this movie will scare you!
