I would like to know why John Amos left the show and how did he die from the show? I could not understand everything, but sometimes they had problems that they faced. By the way, did they manage to get out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my favorite. We could see them live some good times. something they did not have very often. I wish they bring back the show. During the day, people can stay up to watch. I do not think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without the original distribution. They are really what made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
