Fast, funny, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always great. Blondel charms you with his spirit and energy. It is obvious that this is a pre-censorship film by the insinuations of the screenplay, costumes and the way they touch each other. And the bikinis before there are bikinis! This is not a forbidden pleasure for everyone. I do not understand John Garfield's problem though. Does it matter whether or not he is in this movie? If so, its screen is so short that it is basically an accessory. You have to watch it frame by frame to find it even if it is there. I'm a big fan of Cagney, but I've never seen this one before. I found it on Turner Classics. I found it by accident. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
