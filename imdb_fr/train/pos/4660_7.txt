"Hot Millions" is a well-written and well-played story about a stealing money-splitter (whoops! - class too low for a money-grabber, according to the main character of Peter Ustinov), a "hot million" from the London branch from a US company by creating shell companies on the continent and using the seemingly secure computer of the company to transfer funds to them. (Remember, the flap font is a comedy and not a mystery.) <br /> <br /> Beginning in 1968, the representation of computers in this film may seem naive to a more sophisticated population. computing; but as a person who has worked with computers since the release of this film, I would say that even then, it seems to have been written by and for illiterates in computer science, probably for the purpose of exacerbating the comical funny aspects of this British movie. <br /> <br /> If you have little taste for this type of entertainment, the movie may seem to hang around. Fortunately, its end is well packed; Unfortunately, the final credits do not give any indication of the classical music used - the symphonic piece at the end and the piano-flute duo in the middle - just the song Lulu sings I do not remember at all.
