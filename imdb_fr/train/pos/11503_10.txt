Kolchak is pure entertainment. Great stories and excellent distribution, nothing to make the situation worse. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that drives the audience with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage, and Ruth McDevitt provide McGavin with the kind of solid support that most key players can not dream of. Some excellent guest stars add color and verve to individual episodes - Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas in The Zombie. It's easy to see how a childhood spent watching Kolchak led Chris Carter to create The X Files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
