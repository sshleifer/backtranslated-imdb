After her Oscar tour in "Secrets & Lies", Brenda Blethyn played in the same success "Saving Grace". And let me tell you, this is not the kind of movie you find every day. <br /> <br /> After her husband's suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that her irresponsible financial decisions have left her with massive debt. Fortunately, she finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. That's it, Grace begins to cultivate it. <br /> <br /> Every aspect of this movie has been played with a lot of effect; there is not a moment of boredom anywhere in it. And of course I did not see this end scene coming! But anyway, you have to see this movie. You might feel more than a little festive after seeing it. If nothing else, it could work as a good lesson on knowing one's finances. But of course, there is MUCH more than that!
