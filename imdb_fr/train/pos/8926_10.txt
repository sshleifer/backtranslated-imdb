I do not think Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung are doing the cinema any cleaner than Claire Denis. That said, I do not like this new movie, as much as its 2001 masterpiece, "Trouble Every Day" (although it gets a lot closer), which is in itself one of my favorite movies . Only because the story here is perhaps a little too elliptical for its own good. Do not get me wrong, the fact that this movie has hardly a plot is really one of the best assets, but I think Denis took it about a degree farther than necessary and therefore the movie flirts with the incomprehensibility and some key points of the plot should have been clarified in one way or another (as if the main character was going to South Korea to get his heart transplanted, instead of showing it to him all of a sudden, without any explanation about where he was or why there). In addition, some of the other characters seemed useless and as an excuse for Denis to use actors that she still loves (the character of Beatrice Dalle in particular is a bit awkward because you expect it to have a meaning In spite of everything, the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is more than surprising. It's really a masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as the "Best Work" more acclaimed Denis, if not better. At this point, Claire Denis must be my favorite French director, even better than Leos Carax. I must also admit that the South Korean sequence is really "Lost in Translation" better than this movie (and I, unlike some, I'm also a big fan of this movie).
