I just watched 2 movies from the Pang brothers, The Eye and One Take Only. When I watched The Eye, I was a little disappointed by these two guys, with whom I had heard good words before. This film (The Eye) has a really bad scenario, especially the end (childish, clich√© and too coincide in my opinion), but still good in photography and experimental images. So I decided to take only one shot and I have not been disappointed yet. Still great pictures, amazing pictures, MTV style editing, cool music and this time, the story has a lot of indie mind, logical and beautiful, you'll see tiny intrigues, but that's no problem scenario. The only problem with this movie is that I get a bad DVD.
