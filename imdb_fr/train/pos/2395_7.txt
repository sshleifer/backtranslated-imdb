Even if he had the misfortune to make his appearance on the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film) just when we were getting tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, this film deserves an audience. An inner look at the staging of "The Scottish Play" as actors call "Macbeth" when he produces it to avoid the curse is a clean, effective and stylish treatment of the betrayal that strikes the troupe. With a wonderfully evocative score, and a look and sound better than those suggested by its small budget, it is a quiet jewel, not world class, but totally satisfactory.
