This movie was absolutely awesome !! All the performances of this film are excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr. Gyllenhaal will have a huge film career if that leaves something to be desired. I thought that Joe Johnston was a strange choice as a director because he is usually associated with big budget blockbusters (Jumanji, Honey I reduced the kids). He draws from each scene with the pure class. My favorite scene was when Homer went down the mine shaft and looked down at the sky, like all his dreams, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should make more brilliant, actor-driven films, as well as his blockbuster Big Block, which is also excellent. GLORY!! to all the actors of this masterpiece!
