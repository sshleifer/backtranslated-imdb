I think it's a good movie. I think it's a very Romanian film through sets and atmospheres; I think it was not meant to be sensual (sensuality is a result, not a goal); I think it's very natural. I think it's human; I think it was interesting I think the actors never made me think ... lame waw (they're not Sean Connory & co), the movie is not a puzzle, they're like the movie ... a normal character who can play ...; I think the film has reached its intention; I think it made me feel things (or feel them again :)); I think I'm not objective; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... that I know.
