What the film really represents (for those of us who grumbled in the belly of America at that time) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite exaggerated stereotypical stereotypes, the authenticity of the problems remains clear. <br /> <br /> Not only these times of radical change, but also very confused times. Our world then changed to two fundamental things: the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the overwhelming influence of the media. These two new freedoms marked the beginning of social changes that quickly became institutionalized. <br /> <br /> From chaos is born the sensitivity, from the disorder came the values. However, keep in mind that the majority of Americans are not involved in this ... they have worked, they have played, they have watched the news ... and slowly they have been affected by the efforts and struggles minorities ... civil rights workers, political activists, efforts against war, the war against poverty .... <br /> <br /> The representation of the power of the press and television in particular was well reflected, although the conflict between the attitudes of the general public and those who sought to change things were at best ignored ... and at worst, poorly represented. Middle-class Americans were not all angrily standing up, holding baseball bats or denying their misguided daughters. They were confused too. Let's not forget how the folk singers suddenly became Protestant singers and how the Beatles launched the assault that killed the folk protest movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie, nor even any mention of them. <br /> <br /> I think that if you do not live the decade, you may not have an idea of ​​what the movie is about. the picture is a little dark. At one point, I had a steady job while my sister lived in Hog ​​Farm and went to Woodstock. At another time, I was in Haight Asbury and the Detroit riot while working and playing housewife in Maine and Connecticut. The roles changed constantly. <br /> <br /> The film describes three brothers and sisters from a middle-class family. They represent the hippie child, the political activist and the active military personnel. The father represents typical attitudes, and the mother represents the voice of reason, tolerance and sometimes even compromise ... for reasons of peace. <br /> <br /> The Black family includes a minister and his son ... disproportionately, I think. I suppose the producers knew all the variables and had to be content with limitations, otherwise the film would have become a long, boring documentary. Dad's message was that anger produces bitterness and bitterness produces chaos. It was clearly a message to today's youth. <br /> <br /> We are looking for a unique solution to social problems, but also to the way in which problems divide us ... The 60s were unusual in this sense, and only the Roaring 20s compare. In other words, this film has a moral after all. In the end, it is our collective individualism that survives. Put this in your list of oxymorons. <br /> <br /> In the '60s, everyone was a god, a guru or a free-spirited genius. It was a moment of magic and madness. Nobody will ever succeed in understanding the 60's ... it was too diverse (this movie is close). At least we can say that we are not ashamed of that, that we have learned and grown up and that, for once, a generation has shaped and transformed America ... for the better.
