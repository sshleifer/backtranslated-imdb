I remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4, but the strange thing is that I never watched it after that. The other day I was babysitting and my cousin never saw All Dogs go to heaven, so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved those movies. So many memories came back watching this movie one more time and I must confess that I even cried a little. I am 22 years old and the end is still happening to me. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most touching animated movies and honestly, this 5.8 rating shocks me. I thought this movie would bring back good memories to others. I admit that the animation was a bit typical, but the story is so charming and fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a play dog ​​that gets killed by another play dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he comes back to Earth with a watch that can not stop or is at the end of its life. When he and his best friend, Itchy, search for Carface and spy on him, they discover how Carface recovers all his money. He has a little orphan who talks to the animals and finds out who will win the races. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes false promises to get the money. But he ends up learning that perhaps he should get Ann-Marie before him when Carface will see him with revenge. <br /> <br /> All Dogs Go To Heaven is the perfect family film, it's not Disney, but it's a great family film to watch. Not to mention that it's so cute and touching. I know it's ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but this film for me as a child made me believe that dogs have a soul. How could they not? They are so affectionate and I think I will cry again. But hey, I would recommend this movie to everyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
