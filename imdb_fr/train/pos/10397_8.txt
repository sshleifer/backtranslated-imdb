The filming of The Thief Of Bagdad is a story in itself, almost as wonderful as the one told in this film. Alexander Korda nearly went bankrupt with the making of this film. <br /> <br /> According to the series "Citadel Film Book" on The Great British Films, the adoptive son of the United Kingdom, Alexander Korda, had conceived this film since 1933 and planning and preparation. But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and mounting expenses for a big show. <br /> <br /> American cinema also has budget costs, only Cecil B. DeMille has always had a free hand in Paramount after 1932 he returned there. But DeMille and none of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs during filming. During filming, Korda transported the entire company to America and filmed these footage with Rex Ingram as a genius of our Grand Canyon. He certainly would not have such landscapes in the UK. Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all for an outing on Christmas Day 1940. <br /> <br /> The show earned The Thief Of Baghdad four Oscar nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best art & direction set for color film, and best special effects. Only the original musical score of Miklos Rosza did not win a prize in a named category. Korda had to be really happy to decide to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it is impossible to get bad color pictures of this place. <br /> <br /> Special effects do not, however, prevent the simple story of triumphing over evil. The good thing is the two young lovers, John Justin and June Duprez, and the bad thing is Conrad Veidt, the wizard who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez. It was Veidt's career role in Casablanca where he played the role of Luftwaffe Major Stroesser. <br /> <br /> Of course, good gets a little help from an unlikely source. Beggar and thief Sabu who could very well have been one of the few to be called at that time an international movie star. Literally emerging from poverty and working as an elephant stable for the Mysore maharajah, he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a home track for one of his jungle features. Sabu captures all the innocence and malice of youth as he realizes the fantasy of the Arabian Nights of the boy who overthrows a tyrant. This is not a bad message to send in 1940. <br /> <br /> The Baghdad thief resists remarkably well today. It is an eternal story of love, romance and adventure in any order.
