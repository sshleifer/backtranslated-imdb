I became addicted to this because apparently ABC authorized this show at Pearl TV in Hong Kong. It was a surprise for me because it was a pause to listen to anything in Chinese. But I started to get fooled, because the actors and narrative lines are only adequate and thoughtful in New York. Nothing amazing, although I think it's very very stereotypical of them to write Damien as a potential black man with a leaf !!!! This is the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great and I am sad to learn on IMDb that I can not wait to watch Season 2 when I return to the United States. I am just as disappointed as the other commentators to note that this was very promising, of quality and good taste. But just like shows showing characters coming closer, it's probably harder for people to watch if they start watching multiple episodes. Which is apparently a bit too late for eager networks.
