I highly recommend this movie. Located in the future of Bladerunner-2054 Paris, it is actually a classic film noir scenario: lady in danger, sister finding her, honest policeman fighting everyone. Fortunately, it avoids being stereotyped and combines a rather successful scenario with interesting and innovative images. The film may remind you of the Sin City look, but it has a sharper, more graphic, novel look that I found really convincing. Each sequence, each sequence seems to be able to be extracted from the office of an experienced graphic designer. In terms of history and works of art, you can find signs of head dating back to the 1940s (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and the Sacred Heart) and movies like Casablanca, while you turn to a dark future where our destiny governed by corporations. Make an excuse to see this movie.
