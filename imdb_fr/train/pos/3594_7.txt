Michelle Rodriguez was made for this movie, when I first saw her in Fast and Furious. You could say she was a hard woman. With this film, she not only proved her role as an actress, but shows no fear and is hard as she should be in this movie. She is no longer a bad girl and that's what I like about her. This film tells the story of a troubled girl who lives the life of a war boy and who has constant problems with school and family. Since she is interested in her brother's training as a boxer, she decides to continue her love for the fight and asks her brother's coach to train her. Even if they do not think she has the potential, they are proven to be wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a bit slow at the end, but was done well. This shows that people can do anything, even if they do not think you have the potential. I recommend it to be seen.
