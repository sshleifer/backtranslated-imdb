I'm not sure whether it's a masterpiece or just a fluffy fluff enhanced by performance and visuals. Anyway, I'm sure I loved it. Wonderfully twisted, sinister and inextricable stories, with the exquisitely sinister performances of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, the vivid and garish color with which everything is captured, it's a high class bag and it's a lot of fun. Not to mention the amusing, devious and barely veiled sexual sub-texts that permeate the whole film, always threatening to escape the dialogue but never doing it. I would be lying if I said that the entertainment value of the movie did not contribute to my love for it, but there is some sort of strange art behind unintentional comedy (or was it?) And I really , really dug that. I could really get into this melodrama thing.
