"Citizen X" tells the story of "The Butcher of Rostov", nickname given to a hateful and perverse serial killer who made 52 deaths between 1978 and 1992. The film focuses on the novice detective (Rea) who has pursued the killer against all odds, facing an uncooperative bureaucracy in an interested and convenient denial. Produced by the HBO channel for television, the film offers a solid cast, good performance, saving the public a great deal of grisly detail, but unfolds as a documentary without stylistic similar tariffs to Hollywood. A simple and direct dramatization of a serious and relatively unknown story, more interesting than "Jack the Ripper". (B)
