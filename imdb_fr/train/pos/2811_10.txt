Silverlake Life, The view from here, is an absolutely breathtaking film about AIDS and a love affair between homosexuals. Some images are indeed very difficult to take, especially when you are gay or that you fear AIDS, and probably for any sensitive person who looks at it. It's not easy to make a film about such a terrible disease and its consequences on the lives of two people. This film teaches how to take care of each other in such difficult moments, but it never becomes too morbid, it always shows life at all times, reminding you that outside the theater or your room, life goes on, Whatever the fate of some people may be. The characters are incredibly endearing, while we watch their intimacy in plans that never go beyond a strict limit, never revealing anything too private or offensive. Children certainly should not watch this film, but adults, whether they are faced with such situations or not, should do so and will not regret the tears they have shed.
