It is always sad to note that the majority of the spectators neglect "marginal" films like this one. "Panic" is a fascinating and poignant study of a character who feels trapped by the futility of his own life. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy, like Alex, is as convincing as ever. This talented actor seems to have a special talent for touching you, even if his characters are imperfect; we may not always support the lifestyle of the protagonists he plays, but the emotions of fear and confusion he evokes in us are often too painfully familiar. The title "Panic" seems at first paradoxical, given the lack of obvious emotion. At one point, Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. Yet as this story unfolds, it becomes more and more obvious that rage and despair, not indifference, are the driving forces of this man's existence. <br /> <br /> More than once, his performance in "Fargo" reminded me. another film strongly focused on the characters. In "Fargo" and "Panic" we see a middle-aged man who somehow seems to be out of sync with the rest of life. He has lost his way and the only way to return in appearance seems to be through the darkness. He knows that he makes bad choices, but despair prevails over self-control and common sense. <br /> <br /> Alex connects to Sarah, a 23-year-old woman (played heavily by Neve Campbell), whom he meets at a doctor's office. Office. Thematically, this union is less a coincidence, more the work of destiny. Alex finds some comfort with Sarah, perhaps feeling like a wandering companion, like him, someone who has gone astray and floats aimlessly for the rest of his life, waiting impotent for his inevitable conclusion. <br /> <The choice of movies like this is a clever and convincing way for Neve Campbell to respond to critics who question her. Too often, it is the characters she played with that are the weakness, offering Campbell no depth to allow him to falter. However, this performance could be a revelation for many. <br /> <br /> In a perfect cinematic world, there would not only be many more films like "Panic", but they would also be appreciated by a much wider audience. If you watch movies for the richness and depth of characterization, rather than simply for the latest state-of-the-art special effects, then, for you, "Panic" is not to be missed. A +.
