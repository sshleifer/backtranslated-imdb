With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout the cast and crew, "They all laughed" is a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate connection in a photo before, it looks like an almost private film made for the pleasure of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience is only an accessory consideration.If it smells all the smug "self - joke", you You will be happy to hear that Mr. Bogdanovich navigates well of this particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent "I love NY" paean, it is also an altar where we can venerate the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake: this is his picture. M. Gazzara concedes it to him in the most effaced manner in all his scenes. The plot - a detective agency is too personally involved in the affairs of its clients - is of minimal importance, it is the performance of the two main actors that dominates the film. Mr. Bogdanovich's triumph lies in the way his camera seems to like his actors, from "Targets". Each of his films is illuminated by special artists that only exceptional artists can shoot from inanimate optical equipment. Miss Hepburn has particular advantages. of this love. Further information on his work can be found by reading his essays on directors and directors, mainly "Who di's is in it?", Recently found in British bookstores. The soundtrack of "They All Laughed" varies, from Louis Armstrong's concert in New York Town Hall in 1947, to Sinatra, from country to Latin, as eclectic as the city she represents. The image of Mr. B's "Golden Boy" would surely tarnish, because that is the nature of the film industry, but it's just as sure to be restored one day. When that day arrives, "They laugh all" will be recognized good job whatsoever.
