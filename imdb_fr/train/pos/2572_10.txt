I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies, so combined they were twice as good. K-9, K-911 and K-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable, they are a great team. The only drawback is that I did not really understand how the wife of Dooley died. She died before this movie but how? If they said it, I must have missed it. Otherwise, I give him two inches / tail! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must have had a lot of training. They were so funny and all the noises Jerry Lee would make when Dooley would talk to him were so funny. My favorite was when Jerry Lee was singing and when he was biting private people to get very very funny information lol
