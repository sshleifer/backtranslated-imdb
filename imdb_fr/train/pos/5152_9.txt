"Hitler, the rise of evil" is clearly produced by emotionally drained people of the horrors of the Second World War. Which makes it a refreshing experience. <br /> <br /> I think its greatest value lies in its crystalline revelation of the Nazi mechanism. Among the totally corrupt means used by Hitler to reach the summit. Arrived there, this film ends. <br /> <br /> Once at the top, the "Fuhrer" (= "leader" in German) has led his Germany to the most important and most devastating war in the history of humanity. Ending six years later, during the total defeat of Germany. As a result, Germany lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of its pre-war soil) and was forced to accept a split of its remaining territory for 44 years. Both West Germany and East Germany had to be rebuilt to scrap, their reputation being seriously tarnished by the many Nazi atrocities inspired by racism. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Hitler, the rise of evil" is a good watch. Located in an environment acceptable for the thirties, with (more) competent actors. Peter O'Toole's role as senior president, von Hindenburg, stands out and even adds an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> My copy of "Hitler, the rise of evil" also offers a second DVD with two good documentaries. movies. One concerns Hitler's personality, the second deals with the falsification of Hitler's diaries. In 1983, this falsification caused a hilarious scandal in England and Germany, damaging the reputation of several historians and journalists.
