This is just another example of Gene Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and played in this terrible mystery. Nobody could have done better. The suspense was palpable everywhere. I would like Mr. Wilder to grant us another of these. I enjoyed everything I ever saw in Mr. Wilder, but I did not know how talented he was until I saw "Small Town Assassination" and what follows. He understands perfectly what the public wants and how to translate it into his writings and, of course, into his brilliant acting. His subtle spirit shines through. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves the mysteries and / or cinematic work of Gene Wilder. His star becomes more and more brilliant.
