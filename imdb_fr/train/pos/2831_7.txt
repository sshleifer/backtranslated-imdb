I came across this film when I was on eBay with Caesars Palace because I am fascinated by its rich history of Vegas, which is the last of the original luxury complexes still in good condition (unless you count Bally , the original MGM Grand). In this respect, this film offers all its strength. You make a great tour of the Caesars property which, despite all the renovations and additions it has made during its 40 years of opening, has an alarming aspect. As a film, the plot is a bit difficult to follow, largely because of the appalling editing. And when I say horrible, I do not use that word lightly. There are many fragments of Las Vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene where the character of Robert Drivas discusses with his father from his childhood and, without any explanation, he (Drivas) passes (in these infamous excerpts ) to be himself, to a baby, to a little boy, then to himself while talking with his father. (This gives no details on the plot, if anything, we can prepare for it and maybe they will not be as stunned as the editing made me.) The film has aged well if not, and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and son that most guys might understand in one way or another.
