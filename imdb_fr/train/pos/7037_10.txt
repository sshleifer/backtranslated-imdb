It's a brilliant political satire. No wonder this has been largely ignored in the United States: it exposes our deadly foreign policy for what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another good movie of this era, Rendition, was also totally rejected, simply because it was shown with precision. that the United States is a war machine determined to torture, murder and maim civilians in their quest for total domination of the world. <br /> <br /> A clever plot, a good acting game, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei?) And some scenes of hilarity should have made this film a success. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.
