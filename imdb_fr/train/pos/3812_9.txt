It's a real treat for the eyes. A world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities. Enchanting monsters whose favorite method of attack is to launch cathedrals on their opponents ... Who can resist this? An old prophecy, a group of oppressed heroes and a cute princess looking for her hero ... look familiar ...? Yes, we have already heard this song. But you will forget that by looking at the spectacular landscape. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun to watch as long as it lasts. But after leaving the cinema, you will want a little more history. <br /> <br /> What is behind the circle of 30? What made the knight crazy? Who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and cities ... and why do they collapse? And apart from this group of farmers, where are the people? Really, this picture looks so intriguing, but it's not the Lord of the Rings.
