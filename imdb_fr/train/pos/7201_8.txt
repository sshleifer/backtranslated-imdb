Very good drama comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head out of the water after missing ideas. I can not say much about this film without revealing the story. I can say that little was as it seems that you are looking at the picture. Everyone has their own agenda. Nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances by all.
