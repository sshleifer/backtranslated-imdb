Hilarious, evocative, confusing, brilliant film. It reminds me of Bunuel's Golden Age or Jodorowsky's sacred mountain - a lot of strange characters who mock and search ..... what is it? I laughed almost the entire way, while keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and sometimes horrified reactions of the audience around me at the theater. End-to-end entertainment from the beginning to the guts and from the poisoned bowels to the end, if it was an end. I only wish I could remember every detail. It haunts me sometimes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I only have the most positive memories of this movie. Since he does not seem to be available to watch at home, I guess I'll have to wait a few more years before Crispin Glover comes back with his Big Slide Show (and his subsequent projection "What is it?") ... I saw this film in Atlanta almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car accident. So I was a little dizzy at the time, which was perhaps a very good state of mind to look at prophetic arthropods talking and delays in superhero costumes and divine Glover in his own beefy scenery -Q, lightly dressed girls rising from the floor like a beautiful DADAist wet dream. <br /> <br /> Is this a statement about life as we know it? Of course, everyone WAITING that art is just that. I think rather that the truth is more evident in absences and in negative space. What you do not tell us is what we have to deduce, but it is more valid than the lies that others feed us day after day. Rather a "WHAT'S IT?" More than 5000 movies like "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle" (shuddering, quivering). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Glover (a fun man to watch on screen or in his big slideshow) - smart, funny, offbeat and overly hot). Make more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
