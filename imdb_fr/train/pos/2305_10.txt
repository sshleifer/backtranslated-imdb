I thought it was a very good movie. It would have been nice to see a little more in the film that the two sisters knew that they liked the same boy before he was killed. I'm sure if the film was made this way, the end would have been very different, which is why it made this movie so good. This shows that no matter what happens in your life with your brothers and sisters, you can still cross it and that if two sisters are dealing with a boy (the same boy), working through the pain and pain makes things easier and more enjoyable. to work between the 2 of them. It's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to do in someone's life and that you can still get through that get even closer after it's over. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I still do it now. It seems to me that I find myself watching it every time. It would have been nice if there had been a second part for this film, maybe having the older sister come with her baby, that would have really finished the story since her death, that way, it would continue he lives even if he is dead.
