I watched it at the cinema with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I did not have the best time mainly because I did not know Ned Kelly nor his story. <br /> <br /> But since that day is a biopic, it's important to know at least what to expect from the character. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the way events are told is true or if everything is fictional. But the way Ned Kelly is described as a hero and defender of justice makes me really want to believe that everything is true. I do not think he's portrayed as a criminal or a redneck thief, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a solid Western type film that suits all tastes. Heath Ledger is great, as always, and the sexy Naomi Watts seduces the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this film a chance if it is broadcast by cable. Otherwise, I do not think I can recommend it.
