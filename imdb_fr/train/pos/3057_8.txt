Wow, I really liked this movie. William H. Macy is great as a quiet hit-man Alex. <br /> <br /> All performances here are really good, the plot is interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Alex, a married hit-guy (like his father) with a grandson, is going through a middle age crisis and wants to leave the family business. He goes to the psychiatrist for help. will have the spirit Sarah whom he falls in love with. One day, Alex does not know what to do when he finds a job to kill someone he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch this movie if you like mature and interesting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
