this film must be seen. the best picture of what's going on in the world I've seen since Darwin's Nightmare. Go see him! and if you have the chance to open it in your city, be sure to see it on the big screen instead of DVD. The writing is clear and the direction is sufficient so that the ideas can be expressed, although they are not perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing, and the rest of the cast is good too. It's inspiring that John Cusack made this film, and I think he had to use some of his money to do it. It is a wild and absurd race, made obviously without the necessary resources, but which succeeds all the same. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher have not shown the courage to say what this movie says.
