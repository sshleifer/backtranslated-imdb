This film was excellent. It details the struggle between a committed detective and the ignorance of the corrupt communist regime in Russia in the 80s. I give this film commendations for his unfailing view on the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated community (thanks to the "Regime"). This is a graphic film. It presents a non-violent image of violence and tragic vestiges. Nothing is "covered with sweets" of blood or excessive blood to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This film is based on the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I know the true story well enough to have a deep understanding of the film's reality. This is not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry, dark humor, this film is a must.
