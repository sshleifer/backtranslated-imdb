It must be one of my favorite movies, unlike Elvira's weak 'Havired Hills ... anyway, I love the way the movie is a goth / com story from' Wizard of Oz "... <br /> <br /> Elvira is a Gothic Dorothy stranded in an unknown city after the death of a good witch (Aunt Morgana elviras) ... she inherits an extremely powerful" Ruby "ring and wanted by the Bad Warlock (his uncle). ..It befriends four characters she inadvertently helps grow throughout the film while dragging a dog. There is a show with her uncle (the wicked witch of the West) where Elvira realizes that she has the strength in her and ends up defeating him. She ends up being fired by locals after conquering their hearts and finally heads to her destination, Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references to the wizard of Oz throughout the movie ... she and her uncle both quote lines about their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus ... there is no place like home, there is no place like home!" Bad Uncle Vinny: "I'll get you my beautiful and your little dog too!" <br /> <br /> There is a sign that Elvira passes on her first road trip that mentions the state of Kansas. <BR/> <br /> But apart from that, the fact that one of the sequences she "stole, uh ... I mean, was inspired by FlashDance" is pure genius ... and if you do not laugh at his twirling titty at the end of his "very 80's" show in Las Vegas then you have no camp bone in your body ... This movie is a classic cult / camp
