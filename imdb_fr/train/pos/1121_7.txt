Here is a real crazy for you. It begins with another take-off on the PSYCHO shower stage on campus, then becomes more crazy when several students and their cozy boyfriend head south for spring break. The trouble begins when they enter Redneck County led by Sheriff Dean's homicide. One of the college girls walks in the woods, attends a sheriff's murder and blows her head. Then MACON COUNTY LINE takes the time to loot, trap and slaughter one by one the witnesses without intelligence. Tony March is the target of the evil Dean, delighted with shotguns. The general tone of the film is really disturbing. The end is so abrupt that you almost feel that the director has run out of film; it is also a study in desperation. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropists, misogynists and nihilists around the world.
