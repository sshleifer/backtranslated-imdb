Colman's performance is helped by the brilliantly written script. The gigantic Hollywood studios of the 30s and 40s were able to copy some elements of the German Expressionist film and incorporate them into Hollywood movies. very good use of shadows and light and silhouette. I really liked the scene where Colman turned off the light in his fitting room at the beginning of the film, and he began to recite Othello as his face instantly became dark and perverse. the viewer already sees the text and drama of Shakespeare getting their hands on "Tony" and he leaves for a tragic trip. I also enjoyed the scene of the dramatic death in the room, when he is overwhelmed with emotion and accidentally strangles his costar a little too hard to bear. her supplications "tony stop hurting me" are chilling and suspenseful. you simply do not know if it will go beyond and kill it at any time. The pursuit of the cat and the mouse to reveal the killer was nicely added to two-thirds of the film in order to add a faster boost and add to the narrative part of the movie. A masterful work of George Cukor. He is such a skillful director. Excellent movie. Too bad they do not make them as before.
