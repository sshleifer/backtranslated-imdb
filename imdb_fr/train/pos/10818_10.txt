Why is this note so low? I really do not understand ... Is it because of the bad acting? The wrong dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in cheesy horror movies at a low budget? Seriously, the acting and the dialogue are not important in these films. People who hate movies only because of bad acting and poor dialogue should not be allowed to rate low-budget, tacky movies. These films should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I was expecting a gorefest, but it's not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad (most of the time, it's just animal guts on the actors' bodies and it sucks), but I really did not care because the movie is hilarious! The characters are hilarious, the acting game is hilarious (playing bad is a good thing in tacky horror movies at low budget), the dialogue is hilarious (the wrong dialogue is a good thing in the nerdy horror movies at small budget), the zombie rapist with a big cock is hilarious, the flying demon baby is hilarious and I could go on and on, but I do not want to say too much ... BUT I have to mention that there is a scene in which a girl masturbates a doll sex as if she were alive lol! Oh, and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol! <br /> <br /> The movie's best lyrics: <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * coca-cola sniff * Detective Sloane: What's * beep * do you, Manners? What did you sniff? What is that? Detective Manners: It's nothing man, it's ... uh ... a cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * injects heroin into the Arm * Inspector Sloane: What * beep * do you, Ways? Are you * beep * crazy? Detective Manners: It's a cold medicine. <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * repeatedly hits a guy at random in the face * Detective Sloane: What's going on, Manners? What are you doing? Detective Manners: This maniac was looking for demons, then he smashed his head against the rock! He has just started breaking his head on the rock! I think he's on PCP or something like that! <br /> <br /> LOL!
