I mistakenly found this film many years ago, and then I wondered (again today) why it was not properly praised. Well written, beautiful acting, one ironic twist after another, and there is a plausibility in what the infamous characters are trying. I would not recommend this movie to people with limited attention span; it takes enough intelligence to understand that there may be a core of truth in this story.
