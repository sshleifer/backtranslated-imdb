Before, I had lived with a roommate who had attempted to commit suicide, and our apartment was in a building where we could have a $ 50 noise violation for sneezing after midnight - so, needless to say, I can easily talk about Polanski's "Tenant". <br /> <br /> But I also enjoy the film for other reasons. Overall, I'm not sure it works - the descent of Polanski's character into paranoia and madness, which takes about half an hour, seems rather shocking and bizarre. Ebert, for one, was absolutely unconvinced, and he slapped the film with a vicious criticism to a star. But I think that every scene and every moment works perfectly, so even if I do not understand the whole film, what does egyptology have to do with, for example? - I always have a positive impression. <br /> <br /> For example, I love the odious friend Bernard Fresson represents. My God, how many times have I managed to have stupid friends like that instead of no friends at all! I love the movie scene - the funniest moment in film history, I would say. And then, do I like Isabelle Adjani - she's so clever in this film, it's almost incredible. And she gives a great performance, as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I do not agree with the derogatory remarks made about his performance here. His character is supposed to be discreet and thoughtful, his discreet performance is therefore appropriate. For my part, I found it perfectly nice - although he lost a little bit when he began to dress in dredging for no clearly discernible reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is dark. And slow. But he captures the alienating qualities of apartment living - something I have done too much - so I search it. It's funny to see that all you need is a common point of reference, and suddenly, a weird movie like this becomes deeply meaningful! It's really worth looking to change pocket on DVD.
