I saw this film for the first time on cable about 5 years ago and I could not help but laugh. Everything in this film seemed to click, the script, the characters, the decor. As for movies, I would not call it a good movie, but it's fantastic. It makes sense. The cast is perhaps as good as ever in a comedy film. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For those who have not seen it, I'll give you a quick summary: Four criminals end up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank robbery. However, when their friend is stopped by two policemen who chased him out of New Jersey, they try to figure out what's going on and all hell breaks loose. The movie is really an excellent comedy and looks like a mediocre version of Oceans Eleven, with only four criminals who can not stand, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all, if you like to laugh, I strongly encourage you to watch this movie.
