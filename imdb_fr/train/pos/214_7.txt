A former vaudeville team consisting of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) was one of the best known, but they broke up by hating each other. More than 20 years later, they agree to meet for a TV special ... but discover that they hate each other again. Willy's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to make them work together. <br /> <br /> A resounding success in his day, which earned George Burns the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I have (a little) liked. It was written by Neil Simon and his non-stop one-liners. It was funny, but joking about Willy and Al's senility was NOT. So I never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me against me. In addition, his character here is so caustic that you quickly get tired of him. All that apart was fun. Burns is just great launching a single line with ease and even Matthau suited him well. Their verbal battles are the best sequences of the film. Also, Benjamin is very good, Willy's nephew trying to make them work together. For me, it's worth seeing just for Burns. This jump started his career a lot and two years later, he had another hit with "Oh God". So it's good. Simply good - not great. The character of Matthau really makes it difficult to love. I give him a 7.
