I feel like I have an extremely rare illness that no one has heard of, and I finally met a support group on the net! I finally found this title by asking for an answer on a site "experts" on the web. I too saw this film in my youth and I was struck by the atmosphere and especially by the end. I have never forgotten it and have never seen it since. I do not know anyone who saw the film and I almost gave up trying to find his title. Alas, even if I know the name, I will probably never see the film because it can not be found on the market. Small steps ... <br /> <br /> G
