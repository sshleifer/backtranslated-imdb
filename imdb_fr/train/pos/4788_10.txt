It's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen: I shone inside throughout the movie. Music and cinematography held sway when nothing happened on the screen. The slow pace was determined by the mode of travel (a lawn mower with a large trailer) and maintained by the sounds and background images and slow life of other characters. <br /> <br /> The story really happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. He did not play any actor; everything was completely real, as if the actors had turned into characters. Sissy Spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled girl, who had suffered a lot but had progressed, always wanting to do what was right. Richard Farnsworth was chosen to perfection and he became Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving old man who crosses Iowa to visit his brother, Lyle, who had a stroke. Alvin had learned a lot of wisdom during his life and this seemed to bring out the best of people he had met on his way. <br /> <br /> The film highlights the importance of the family for this man and, hopefully, for everyone. from U.S. I look forward to seeing him again and again. Directed by David Lynch, this film proves his talent as a director. Farnsworth has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; at 79, he was the oldest candidate ever to have won this award.
