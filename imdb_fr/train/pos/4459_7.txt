For films such as "Aweigh Anchors", few have received so many Academy Awards at a happy hour warm-up. Either 1945 was a beleaguered year for a good movie, or they were still in shock at Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend, where they wrote anything starting with A on the ballot to get the best image that would please to the public faithful to the musical images. As Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in Singin 'in the Rain, so there must have been something wrong with MGM's backstage editing systems. Of course, the studio is at its best on this highly praised tour of major studios and Hollywood itself, convenient for those stuck on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> Yet, a musical with sailor suit the brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra are certainly a pleasant farce, despite the need for more people to yawn at the musical premieres so that the public of 'today is not slapped by an unnecessary execution time. There have been many long pieces before and since, but in this case, all the charming scenes of Kathryn Grayson could have been eliminated. Until the screening of "Kiss Me Kate", it was perhaps necessary for opera lovers to watch none of his films with the remote in his hand. <br /> <br /> If it was necessary to practice picking up women for "On the City" in 1949, lucky sailors might not have had the chance to promise an audition with Jose Iturbi and take the piano Susie wholeheartedly. Few people have the chance to take a screen test in the MGM Gold Studios. Then, few people are even more likely to be assisted. Susan Abbot and Kathryn Grayson have not regretted their success in onscreen tests, but this encourages non-recurring opera enthusiasts to hope that the eventual pink sheet will be given to them. <br /> <br /> But for all, the star performers are in good shape and an above-average result is launched with a light but amusing navy history, interspersed with ambitious young boys from the Navy, good for morale in war, makes Anchors, at least, does not question the choice of the wrong MGM movie. The management holds up while the distribution carries the story in a beautiful color cinematography. Whenever someone sings music or songs, the film is a joyous occasion. <br /> <br /> The natural climax of the film is the cartoon adventures of Gene Kelly in an imaginary country, culminating in a brilliant dance with Jerry the Mouse. This is a well-deserved masterpiece of Kelly's career, and it's nice to know he had thought about it before Fred Astaire started dancing on the walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly a triple flavor, sprinkled with chocolate, cream, cherry and split banana, but it's a piece of solid, square sugar that eventually melts in your mouth and, despite guilt, remains a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
