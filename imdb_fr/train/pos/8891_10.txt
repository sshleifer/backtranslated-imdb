I agree with other comments about the fact that there was not a lot of story mentioned in the film but it was not a documentary! It was meant to entertain and I think it worked very well. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. As suddenly, it would have been projected, but I understood the story and the link that united the families afterward and I found it pretty good. <br /> <br /> Even though it was not a re-enactment in the 1960s, it did highlight some very important and important milestones of the decade. I found it very amusing and worth watching.
