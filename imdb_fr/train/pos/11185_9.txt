As this is one of the favorite novels, I was very happy to see the move. I was not deceived! Yes, of course, there are a few things I could talk about, but I think the film stayed true to the book and it was really a good movie. It seems that Stephen King's movies get mostly bad reviews, but that's one of the good ones. It's such a bleak story, and I guess that's why I like it ... and what better than reliving the life of the dead ... and something about the animals coming back from the grave is enough scary too. If you saw the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book! It's a well written script, the actors could have done a better job (I only say it for Rachel, and Ellie ... she was so sibilant). I loved the others ... and the most important for me ... it stuck. true with the novel.
