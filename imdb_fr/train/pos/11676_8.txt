If you liked Long Way Round, you will enjoy almost as much. It's educational, fun, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too much Russ. Ewan makes a few appearances but Charley really does it alone. He is funny, engaging and remains a source of stress and doubt. Great thing! <br /> <br /> The series ends in 7 episodes. Like LWR, the preparation is almost as interesting as the race. Although they cover the ins and outs of the race, there could be a little more explanation about trucks and cars, which are simply mentioned and rarely seen in the race. It's a biker movie and everyone on two wheels will love it. <br /> <br /> The series presents breathtaking photographs as well as some interviews of popular mouths. Yuck. There is another extremely catchy song like LWR, but it's not as good as Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the United States, God knows when it will be available, buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as I did. Oh, and get ready to buy another bike.
