Why did the producers not give a chance to this show Of all the stories on television, why did not the producers give Six Degrees a chance? Will the series go on video? I would like to see how it ends. Put the first season in video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and was waiting for his return. I set my recorder to record all shows. Thank you God for that. I just discovered that the show was canceled and my heart was broken. I would like to know that it will be canceled, why did not they tell us? I thought the show was starting to gain depth in the characters. The writing was very good too. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite of all time. I am so sorry to see him go!
