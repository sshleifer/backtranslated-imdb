I watched this movie while waiting for what I had: some good sci-fi cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did a remarkable job with an extremely limited role. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you have to act with these two constraints: you have almost no dialogue, and because you play hard, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions in using facial expressions! Howzat? A bit like asking a diva to make a great air while being gagged and taped. Despite being handcuffed verbally and expression, Russell performs an incredible characterization. His robot becomes human, despite the constraints. Excellent work! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs makes sure he gets into the story as a great representative of the meanest - the one you'd like to see drawn and cut into quarters. Connie Nielsen was sweet, sweet, maternal and beautiful. I do not know how much my impression is based on acting and physical beauty, but it was hard to ignore her. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot is pretty classic, with a lot of weaknesses, but as she has a sense of sci-fi comic, I do not see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. At the end of the story, the good guy wins and the audience, grateful, receives a great emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> The kind of feeb who thinks Russell did not do a good job as a comedian is the same kind of feeb who missed the point.
