I just saw this movie at TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley fans will not be disappointed !! And if you are not familiar with this director's work, it does not matter. This film can definitely be autonomous. I have to go to the second screening ... it was amazing, I need to see her again - and fast !! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. Her dialogue is very intelligent and Parker Posey's performances are remarkable as she plays the lead role in Fay Grim's lead role. Fay Grim is the latest feature film revisiting the world and characters featured in the movie Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the most prominent stylistic feature is the usual use of the angled (or Dutch) angle, which is often found in Hartley's early works appearing in various short films, available in the 1994-2004 collection of Possible Movies: Hal Hartley's short works. and in The Girl from Monday (2005). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with the utmost accuracy on September 11th. The story of Fay Grim's adventure in this story is repositioned in the world that changed after September 11, 2001. Without going into detail, I consider this book and the world of history as a courageously political and original portrait of geopolitics, if ever, put in the forefront in post-911 traditional fiction cinema (see Syrianna: side note - Mark Cuban Exec Prod in these two films ... most interesting, to say the least) . <br /> <br /> Finally, for those who are closely tied to the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this film is hilarious and self-aware. That being said, Fay Grimm's character begins in the movie, exactly where she was at the end of Henry Fool, but at the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experience has completely changed and are developed during the narration. What can be reserved in the future for Fay and the Fool family ... ?? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
