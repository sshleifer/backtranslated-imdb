Suddenly Impact is the best of Dirty Harry's five films. They do not come leaner and meaner than that as Harry fights for a series of violent clashes, the bad guys getting their just dessert. That's the way I like it. Beautiful story too and skillfully led by Clint himself. Excellent entertainment.
