Well, was Morgan Freeman more unusual as God than George Burns? This movie was much better than that one, "Oh, my God." I was totally absorbed and LMAO all the way through. Carrey was perfect as an outstanding presenter, and Aniston took her role as a frustrated girlfriend in her usual well-performed performance. For my part, I do not consider her as ugly or without talent. I think my favorite scene was where Carrey opened the binder thinking it could never remember his story. See if you can locate the folder in the binder that contains the events of his humor in the bathroom: I rolled on it. Well written and even better interpreted, this comedy will remain one of the best of this comedy.
