While Rome goes crazy celebrating Hitler's visit - uniforms, brass bands, parades - two strangers stay at home, in a big building, and meet at the end. She is Sofia Loren, wife of a brutal civil servant and mother of six children. This is Mastroianni, a radio speaker who was sacked because of his homosexuality. Both need companionship and understanding, they find one in the other. <br /> <br /> The film covers a period of a few hours. The colors are faded and everything happens with a soundtrack of military parades and hysterical radio announcers. Strangely, the Nazi anthem - the Horst-Wessel-Lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme. <br /> <br /> A beautiful film, an excellent reconstruction of an exceptional time in Italian history and a touching and sad story. Mastroianni lives up to our expectations and Sofia Loren does a superb job, far from the Neapolitan pin-ups of her usual truck driver. Do not miss it.
