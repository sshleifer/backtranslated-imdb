(spoilers ??) <br /> <br /> I did not really know what to think of the movie. Not too much of a children's movie. Should be supervised with a parent as this includes death and death. But I was surprised that it amused me a little. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed with the 81 minutes we spent. (even less without the credits) And the trailer makes you think that the rodent is a main creature. But alas, they torture him. Until the end of the film. These two blame moored the film 2 stars. But I recommend the movie. Even for a suite. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Playable: 7/10
