The title somewhat exaggerates the content of this film, which could lead to unrealized expectations. Frankly, there is very little "panic in the streets" to see here. In fact, throughout the movie, very few people know that there is a fugitive murderer who could spread the plague to everyone he meets. That said, what we have here is a story very well done with a level of suspense that starts high enough anyway (because, unlike people "on the street", the viewer knows what is happening) and this director Elia Kazan builds very deliberately. While the plague-infected killer is wanted, one of the most interesting elements I've found is the relationship that develops between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At first, the two really do not like each other, even if they have to work together. In the end, they forged a real bond of mutual respect. Kazan did a good job with that. <br /> <br /> Almost all the performances here have been excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great and I was very impressed by the fact that Jack Palance plays what would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Maybe Barbara Bel Geddes looked a little flat like Reed's wife, Nancy, but her role was not really central to the story. Overall, it's a great job. 9/10
