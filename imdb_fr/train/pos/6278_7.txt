I saw this on a flight to the United States and I was a little skeptical at first, because some people had said, there were so many characters that you did not get to know them . However, I did not find that at all. The film is fast, but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. The chase scenes are excellent and yes, it can be predictable, but most movies do not. The main villain is a little disappointing, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but that said, it's still a good movie.
