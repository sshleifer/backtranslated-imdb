"FULL HOUSE", in my opinion, is an absolute classic of ABC! I do not know if I've ever seen all the episodes, but I've always liked it. One of my favorite episodes is when Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) got married. If you want to know what's so funny, you must have seen it yourself. It was a two-part document, so you should have seen both sides. Another of my favorite episodes is when Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) were locked in a gas station on Michelle's birthday. You should have seen it yourself if you want to know how and why it happened. I have many others that I like too. Everyone has always given a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes well designed and the writing still very strong. In conclusion, even though we can see it in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it in case it disappears from the air for good.
