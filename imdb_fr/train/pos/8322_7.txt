IQ is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors who seem to click well on the screen. Plot is a typical guy who does not go for girls, the guy takes the girl format, but brings out the solid point that one must love with the heart and not with the mind. The addition of Albert Einstein and his group of geniuses provides an excellent comic relief. Overall, a good movie. Not great, but good
