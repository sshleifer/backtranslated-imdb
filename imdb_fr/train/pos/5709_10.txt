Directed in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and appreciated more often. <br /> <br /> We open in a small quiet French village, scrutinizing the roofs of the sleeping citizens. Then we hear something that looks like a party. While investigating the tumult, two men are told of the story of two men, so-called friends, who chose two numbers for the draw. <br /> <br /> The star of the photo has his number and his friend his. When he asks his friend, will he share half of the dough, if his ticket is the winning number, his friend quickly said no. In fact, H.E. double hockey sticks no! is the way he acts on it. <br /> <br /> Thus, when our man discovers that he has the winning ticket and has been lost, it is not his fault, he is unleashed. Everyone is outside, looking for this post, as a forerunner of "The Great Race". Even if all this is a step back, I got stuck all the time and I was so upset by everything in this all-money movie that shows me money. Watch The Million Today!
