Breaking Glass is a film that anyone aspiring to the music industry should see more than once. It's a very dark story about how a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and make the most money possible. Looking at some of today's "looking for a star" television shows in the UK and abroad, I still remember this movie. Although not an expert on the subject, the winners of these shows tend to have a very big initial success, then a descent from there. This film is prior to these series although the effect seems the same. After getting rid of her manager, brilliantly interpreted by Phil Daniels, the record company changes slowly but surely, her words push her to take excitement and she ends up being completely exhausted. You potential stars of tomorrow ... WATCH THIS AND ATTENTION!
