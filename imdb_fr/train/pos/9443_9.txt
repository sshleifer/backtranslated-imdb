It is unfortunate that Deliverance is primarily known as the Redneck rape film and Dueling Banjos. Even people who have seen the movie can not escape this scene of rape. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in any movie. People tend to miss out on the power of the movie that contains the scene of infamous sodomy. <br /> <br /> Deliverance's cast, plot, cinematography and soundtrack all lend a hand to his dark charisma. The hinterland in which it was shot is beautiful and contrasts enough with the dark subject. The major and minor actors make you feel as if you are descending this river with them. <br /> <br /> What sets this film apart from others is the sense of terror it inspires. Few movies can make you feel that way. Bottom Line: This film is a classic. I can not really say much more than that.
