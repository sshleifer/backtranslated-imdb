I do not know if it was true or false, but I read all the comments before watching the short film. I must say that I do not agree with most of the negative comments or problems that people have had with it. <br /> <br /> As a producer / director of "Lone Wolf" for the first time, I like to see things I can aspire to, not necessarily from professionals, but from people just getting wet like me. <br /> <br /> If indeed, this is also a beginner, that I read, I applaud the effort.Merveilleux work then in this regard! There were some comments on the music. I thought it was pretty cool for the song. Some people say that it lasted a bit, but I found that it created tension without (us) being necessarily conscious, and when he pulled the gun out and the guitar started chipping on the chords, it was like we knew there was a train going on, but realize it's moving. Yes, there is a gap / clip at 180 degrees, but shi * is happening. Has anyone else seen Hugh's dirty t-shirt turn white (late in the rain) into "Australia"? Look how much money and people were behind this movie! Give the child a break for God's sake! Overall, I think it was very well done. It's hardly worth mentioning just two things I would have mentioned - do not approach a shiny brass frame with the camera, and I would have just displayed the splatters at the beginning of the shots in fixed shot, so that people do not necessarily do it. know what it is. <br /> <br /> My experience has taught me so far that it's not difficult to make a movie, it just takes time to learn to do it, then the time to do it, and then you'd better take some time to think about all the details you'll need to shoot before calling "post-production time!" IMHO, it looks like director / screenwriter Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this is his first newsletter, I'll give him an "A". The rest of you report to the office of principals for a beginner.
