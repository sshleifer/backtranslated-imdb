The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites of Charles Perrault, with The Sleeping Beauty, which was also turned into a Disney movie in 1959; This movie is a charming and charming Disney masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent soundtrack; it's a film that I like in a movie, it's a very good soundtrack, and I like songs too; my favorite song is the romantic "So This Is Love". I like the movie mice too, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the narration, the little birds tried to wake up Cinderella in the morning; I also like when Cinderella's animal friends (mice and birds) repair Cinderella's mother dress so she can go to the ball ... until Drizella & Anastasia tore it to pieces, the b **** es!
