Sabrina, the teenage witch, was one of my favorite TV shows. V .: D I watched every episode every day when I came home from school. So far, I think I have watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teen / witch with normal teen problems that we can all relate to. She is funny, intelligent, extrovert, witty and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick are very suited to Sabrina's aunt's play. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda the mad and the crazy form the perfect balance in Sabrina's life. I must admit that college years are not as good as high school, but that does not mean they are not good yet. I think the ending was great even if it was not what I was hoping for, it made sense and I loved it anyway. :)
