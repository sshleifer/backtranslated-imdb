I thought that racism and prejudices against Carl Brashear were excessively dramatized for a Hollywood effect. I do not think the US Navy has ever been so racist. I can not imagine a full captain, the commander, who ever told his leader to deliberately throw guns. Certainly not at the risk of his life. And there never existed a first master of bridge with a prejudice as fierce as the WASP as the character of DeNiro. No leader so neglected and drunk as he would have been played would have risen to the rank of Master Chief. Cuba Gooding saved a film that was otherwise poorly made.
