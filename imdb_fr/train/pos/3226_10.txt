I do not remember this movie having got a movie going here. I only saw him when he arrived on the cable. The film deals with the dehumanization of children in killing machines. Especially a person, the way they are replaced and dumped (literally) in a community outside the world where they are unable to cope with who they really are and how they feel. <br /> <br /> Seems for me, a lot of people expected Rambo in space and would have been happy if that were so. <br /> <br /> I'm certainly glad that's not the case - Kurt does a great job of crippling emotionally. The scene where he sits outside the enclosure shows him, although the decision of two idling slow has a negative impact. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF film like Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running. The Logan series or the THX1138 were, but unfortunately it's the closest I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It changes in the film to a credible degree, it does not crack Arnie one liners, it will not become Snake Plissken and there is no definitive denouement. <br /> <br /> That's why this movie did not work well. It did not follow the formula, and among a target American audience aged 18 to 25, it is unforgivable, because it was not what they expected to see. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> <Always.
