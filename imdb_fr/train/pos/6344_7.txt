I am overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrey. I keep having this film stuck in my head. The Grinchs like Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very boring, her sweet innocence) who tries to get the Grinch in the Christmas spirit, Grinch's childhood (very funny!), And the obvious end with - Christmas is insignificant. t all about gifts. I must say that I felt stupid going out of the theater with a bunch of babies and young children laughing, etc., but this movie was a good full adaptation of Dr.Seuss and IS short film for all ages.
