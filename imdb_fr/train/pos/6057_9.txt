Of course, for its stunning images and impressive sound, it's an excellent home theater "show", but it's also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories that are closely related throughout this film will be of interest to all viewers. Young and old, boys and girls alike, will find that deep inside we are all fans of the automobile, especially high-performance indy machines, the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. The soundtrack of Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder is perfectly adapted to the visual and the content. I do not want to give the ending, but the final driving sequence of Quincy Jones' "Days Like These" might give you a tear in the eye. Enjoy it!
