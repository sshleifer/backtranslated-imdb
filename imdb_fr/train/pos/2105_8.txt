It is in the history of the Great Depression in Prague that the story of an ambitious store clerk who falls in love with a mysterious woman with whom he exchanged romantic letters discovered that this mysterious woman was no other than the saleswoman from her shop. , who seems to constantly quarrel with the colleague. Add a touch (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee - Stwart- has an affair with his wife), leaving Stewart briefly "fired", with the confession that the saleswoman "loved" Stewart all the time, the happy the end is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Although VERY dated (references to poverty and the consideration of my wife and two children) are used too often, with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, such as musical cigar box, are out of reach for ordinary people's enjoyment), this movie is much more effective (and more believable) than the 1990's overhaul "You Have a Mail". In the remake starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the real chances of the event chain are so incredible that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended. <br /> <br /> "Shop Around The Corner" is an innocent stroll behind the scenes of memory to get you to a less complicated, less hectic and more romantic place and time, known as Utopia for A novelist. Lovers of classic romantic comedies will appreciate this picture!
