The second alternative story of the Gundam universe (G-Gundam being the first), Gundam Wing is another different point of view on the Gundam verse. The familiar elements are found but Gundam Wing is actually different from his counterparts. The most important being the Gundams are nothing more than terrorists fighting a single organization. In truth, the series does not really become a war show until episode 7, but in reality, the real conflict, the wars of the day before, does not occur until the next episodes. <br /> <br /> The biggest positives of this series are his characters. All the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episodes and you can really sympathize with each of the roles they have put on. Another great benefit is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series. The designs shame some of his counterparts in Gundam. <br /> <br /> One of the most critical critics of this series is the countless number of UC fans who fight against the original UC saga. Why did Gundam Wing get this blow when UC's more apparent Gundam Seed clone is beyond me? It is true that many moments have been mentioned, but that they have been told in a new way and that there are also clear differences. <br /> <br /> Take for example the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more the Pariah of the Alliance and OZ too, while the Red Comet shone as the symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is the fact that Zechs lost many soldiers under his command, hence his other nickname given in the first episodes: "The killer of his own men". Char is not given this label. <br /> <br /> The problems with this series are not the gibberish philosophy but two problems. The first is the reused animation sequence of Gundams attacks. Of course, it's fun to see the tanks of heavy weapons, MS and planes the first time. But in the fourth, reuse scenes like this are getting older. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole series is supposed to take place for a whole year. If you really think about all the events in the series, there's a lot going on in one year. <br /> <br /> But I guess you can easily dismiss this fact by ignoring the front lines of the intro from time to time. As it ranks, it's probably the best of Gundam's tales of the Alternate universe and an excellent introduction to the world of Gundam. After all, it was Gundam's first-ever anime to air on American television.
