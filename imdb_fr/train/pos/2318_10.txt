I saw this film as a teenager and immediately realized that Dani Trant, a 14-year-old boy living in the Louisiana countryside, had been portrayed by Reese Witherspoon around 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her elder sister, Maureen saw Emily Warfield) and did not feel out of place in relation to her conservative Baptist education. Then 17-year-old Court Foster (Jason London), son of her mother's great friend (Gail Strickland), sits next to him, Dani gets his first crush, while Court loves his company and his voluntary spirit. Dani manages to get his first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving Dani behind him. The close bond between the sisters is severely shattered by the rivalry that only intensifies when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls are then made to realize how much they need each other. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are perfect as loving parents, trying to balance the individuality of their daughters while trying to get the family together. The beautiful cinematography and the beautiful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many others contribute wonderfully to the atmosphere of the film of a simpler time. <br /> <br /> A moving film of arrival with a timeless message.
