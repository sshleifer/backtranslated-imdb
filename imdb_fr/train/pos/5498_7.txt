This documentary has been broadcast on both RTE and the BBC in recent months. Having seen it twice now, I would recommend it to anyone interested in media and documentary filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Initially, this documentary was intended to detail the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew departed with these intentions. What happens when they arrive in Venezuela is striking as they witness the attempted overthrow by the rebel factions (especially oil tankers in Venezuela) of Chavez and his government. We, the spectators, witness how the media manipulate the situation and support the overthrow of Chavez by distorting the events that occur as the coup escalates. <br /> <br /> This is really an excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by two new filmmakers. <br /> <br />
