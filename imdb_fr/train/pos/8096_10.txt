First of all, the only reason people keep complaining about this movie is because they can not stand that some parts of the true story are "changed". Well guess what? Peter Jackson's film was not a perfect interpretation either. Pretty good. It's a very beautiful film. The sets are beautiful and come from well known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half of the trilogy (Community of the Ring and until the Battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers) and is moving at a good pace. The cast of the voice is top notch and most of the characters look like I thought. Samwise is a little too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks awesome. The film has a good score that completely supports the film. If you like good stories but hate to read (the books are even better), try this movie, keeping in mind that it was shot about twenty years ago. <br /> <br /> Also note: Peter Jackson's adaptation to The Brotherhood follows almost exactly the same path as that of Ralph Bakshi (Jackson has often repeated how much he admired Bakshi's efforts).
