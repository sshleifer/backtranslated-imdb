I agree with another user here and I must say it's one of the best Kung Fu movies of all time! I looked at it like a child and I loved it! The scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really understand this guy because he's treated like an outcast. Good humor and fantastic kung-fu, this movie is great! If you like Kung Fu, you'll love it !!!
