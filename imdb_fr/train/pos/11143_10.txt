Saw this as a naive young punk when he was released. Had made me sniff like a baby when I left the theater, trying not to let anyone see. So, when I saw him again in 2007, I knew what to expect and the sobs were ready and ready as the required time approached. Fortunately, this time, I was at home. <br /> <br /> What I did not remember from my youth - or maybe I did not notice because of that, is the technical brilliance of this film. The use of flashbacks that tell so much history without resorting to dialogue. The camera work that seemed to place the viewer, with the characters of the scene. Think of the opening when Joe crosses the street to get to the restaurant, the camera is panning behind the woman and the child sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself and the characters - shabby, sad and brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama like this, with people that most of us could probably ignore. Once again, Joe & Ratso could be one of us. It must have been 70 when I saw him. I remember when I left the theater, I was forced to find the company of my friends. All these years later, I'm happy not to be alone tonight. It's a pretty good movie.
