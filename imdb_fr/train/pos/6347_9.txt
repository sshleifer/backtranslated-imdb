How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing. Eight views later, it still has the same impact on me as the first time. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriters Jeffery Price and Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit are known for their fantastic work. to adapt The Grinch's story to the screen. Ron Howard's management gave life to the story and Jim Carrey's typically energetic performance in The Grinch steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some detractors of the film claimed that it did not conform to the spirit or principles of the original story. After reading the original story, I must say that I can not agree. The film does exactly the same thing about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. In fact, it reinforces the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what it was. <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * (They probably would not be ruining the movie for you ... but if you have not seen it yet and you're one of those who want to know nothing on a story as long as you have not seen it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.) <br /> <br /> I think that almost everyone can understand Grinch's terrible school experiences. I think we were all, at one time or another, the unpopular at school and always being criticized. I know I was ... and that's why I personally have so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Lou Who, in her naive idealism, was convinced that no one could be as bad as her heart. heartbreaking. When everyone had turned their backs on the Grinch for fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be her friend. If only everyone could have such an attitude. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the only thing that could have improved the film a little bit would have been to further reduce the content and humor of the adults. It was already quite sober, but this adult humor (as when The Grinch opened her nose in Martha May Whovier's cleavage) just does not fit into a story like this. <br /> <br /> be a classic Christmas, occupying a deserved place next to the book and cartoon Chuck Jones, to see absolutely every Christmas season.
