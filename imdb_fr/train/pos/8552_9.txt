This is by far one of my favorite among American Pie Spin offs, mainly because in most others, the main character (one of the young Stiflers) still seems unrealistic in nature. <br /> <br /> For example, AP: The Naked Mile. You have a teenager surrounded by naked girls, and one of them is on the right track to rid him of his "problem" of virginity. He ends up stopping in the middle of an action and riding on horseback to sleep with his girlfriend, who in his mind gave him a "free pass" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole, but let's be realistic; most people who watch these movies are not particularly looking for a romantic story. <br /> <br /> While the last episode finally seems to understand who the audience is and that the good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and, as always, Mr. Levenstein lends his "perfectly natural" humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie.
