"Girlfight" is following a project to house a New York high school student with a sense of worthlessness in the world of amateur boxing, where she finds self-esteem, purpose and more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about the movie. So you can almost feel the sweat. Technically and artistically, a good shoot with a sense of honesty and a reality, "Girlfight" is not a female film nor a "Rocky". It is rather a very human drama with which even viewers who do not know boxing will be able to connect.
