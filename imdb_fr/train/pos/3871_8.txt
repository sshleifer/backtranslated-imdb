Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman living in an overcrowded Jewish ghetto in the 19th century in England. It is surrounded by worn, oppressive, bleak, streaky, worn-out brick architecture, sidewalks and narrow streets, darkened windows and hordes of crowds in black and brown jackets. <br /> <br /> She lives in a small apartment with her big family who operate a clothing store in the apartment. As a child, she worked, had no intimacy, wore colorless clothes, shared a bed, and remained silent to ward off the ridiculousness of her mother and brothers and sisters who ridiculed her for imitating them with boredom. <br /> <br /> young woman, her life remains the same - she has no intimacy, lives in a state of mental and physical stupidity, lethargy and inertia, breathes an empty expression and lacks of features, dresses in light and banal clothes and is continually oppressed and downplayed by gray, mundane, towering buildings, narrow streets, narrow corridors, narrow doors, her mother and strong-mouthed siblings , and the prosaic and banal lifestyle of his family. <br /> <br /> She alone Yiddish theater is a form of mental escape. Sitting on the balcony, in the front row, leaning over the rail, there is a large space between his mind and the stage, a space that allows him to breathe, think, smell and suck. <br /> <br /> Yet, despite the freedom of thought offered by the scene open to Esther, his face and body remain drowsy, impassive, without passion. <br /> <br /> The Summer Phenix, with a simple and common appearance, brilliantly translates Esther's impassive behavior - Summer / Esther does not convey any desire to want anything or anticipate anything is. <br /> <br /> After an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther finally decides to free herself from the dark life in which she is trapped. <br /> <br /> She is finally performed in minor roles in a few plays and meets Nathan Quellen, played by the British actor par excellence Ian Holm, who begins to teach Esther the technique of acting . <br /> <br /> From that moment, Esther begins an exhausting double journey of learning to act and feel. <br /> <She begins to feel emotions she has never felt before, and begins to gain the experience she needs to fully understand and master the technical aspects of acting. <br /> <br /> Nathan guides her through the scene through the physical and the emotional. steps of surprise, hesitation, anger, disgust, self-loathing, etc. she begins to explore these emotions in her personal life. <br /> <br /> There are three truths, Nathan tells him - the truth about a character's reaction, the truth about the actor's reaction and the truth a character and an actor are not the same nobody. <br /> <br /> These technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct Esther's defenses and lead her to two inspiring experiences in the outcome of the film that mark the beginning of her freedom of thought. , movement and emotion. <br /> <br /> Esther Kahn is a technically difficult film to watch because of her strange and narrow shots, her drab photographic orientation reflecting the unrealistic setting of the Ghetto, and the characterless character of Summer Phoenix. an insipid and unattractive portrait that brilliantly conveys Kahn's mental and physical stupidity, his lethargy, and his dull nature. <br /> <br /> A must-see movie for those who want to learn the technical profession of acting and those who appreciate the f ilmes and studies of character.
