You spend most of this two-hour movie asking yourself "what is the story of the main character?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, in discreet "Ben Thomas", will let you guess. You'll find it in the last 20 to 25 minutes, and it's a shock ... but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. Until then, Smith plays the mysterious, almost stalking people. You know he has a good reason to do it, but it's never really explained, again, to let us guess until the end. <br /> <br /> All this, including a romance again turned on / off but touching. with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") could frustrate some viewers or want them to leave the movie ..... but do not do it because the last long segment brings together all the pieces of this puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour film, not the typical macho film of Will Smith. In fact, the most shocking aspect could be to see Smith's drawn and sad face throughout this story. It does not look like it in many ways. He looks like he has lost weight and is sick. Smith does a great job in describing a man with a lot of sadness. <br /> <br /> As a good movie will do often, this movie will let you think long after the end credits.
