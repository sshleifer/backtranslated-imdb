I thought the film might be a bit more complex, perhaps in a psychological sense, but the action and the dubbing were excellent. The animation was heavy in computer graphics in many scenes, but very good at that. This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever films, which includes novels and Wayne's conflicts and the motivations of the encounter. 007 fans would like this, and women too, super theme song! Wayne was very well portrayed in this movie and the Penquin has regained its form, no mutant gene in it this time! I liked the fact that Robin was not too used, Tim Drake was just a good computer scientist, a little indigo child or a spirit of the future. <br /> <br /> The secondary cast consisted of a star soap opera, decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like voice actors too. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this movie. <br /> <br /> I note this below Phantasm, Joker's Return and Batman vs. Dracula, but I liked the smarter scenario that I enjoyed Subzero. 7/10
