Ranked NR (would be rated R for ubiquitous powerful language and gross sexual humor). Quebec Rating: 16+ (should be over 13 years old) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first series of comedy comedies. Hours and places of negotiation and it was Saturday night Live.Eddie did two comedy films standing.Delirious and Raw.I preferred Raw because I just found the topic to be more humorous.Delirious is also very funny childhood and make fun of celebrities such as Mr.T and singers such as Michael Jackson. Any fan of comedy movies should see Eddie Murphy's Delirious.
