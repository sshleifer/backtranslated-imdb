Let me first say that, even though I have watched every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself a Trekker or a Trekkie. These are people who live in the basement of their parents and attend conventions in costume with pointed rubber ears. I gave this film a seven by putting aside the historical errors of fiction. The acting was better than average, but the plot had no surprises. They did their best to reverse the technology, but the special effects were still too tempting. As for historical errors, if you call them that, the first captain to fly the Enterprise was Commander April, then Captain Pike, Jim Kirk, and so on. According to a statement made by both Riker and Kirk, we will discover the Klingons and educate them and give them technology (that's why a main directive was created) but as I said, they do not constitute a reason to discredit this beautiful series. I hope that the intrigues will become deeper, and then the special effects may be relegated to the background.
