I enjoy Ralph Bakshi's films ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the underrated animator "The Lord of the Rings") and I am a collector and a fan of Frank Frazetta. I am also a fan of sword and witchcraft who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> <br /> I missed the theatrical release of "Fire and Ice" in 1983 and I can not wait to see it. video or some awakening since then. Therefore, the 2005 version was a dream come true for me. However, I bought it with some trepidation, because I hoped it was not worth watching once, then put it on the shelf as a "collection", picking up the dust 'the day of my death. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded and I was pleasantly impressed by this film. <br /> <br /> As in the case of Frazetta art, this is a rocky film that has a physiognomy and sexuality hard to find in most fantasy / sword and sorcery movies without being cheesy or dirty. Art is good and you see glimpses of Frazetta at its best. Even my young boys loved to watch it with me and ask to watch it again and again. However, my wife has some objections because of the slightly dressed Princess (very Frazetta-Esquire). I do not mind because it's credible and there's no sex scene. <br /> <br /> We use roto-scoping, but personally, I like roto-scoping. This gives the characters more fluid and realistic moves that are hard to find in the animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some continuity issues, I recommend this film to all fans of Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan, as well as fans of sword and witchcraft. Enjoy!
