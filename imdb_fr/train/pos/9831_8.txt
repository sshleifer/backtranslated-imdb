We have great expectations with this one. . . because it's Zombi 3 the official Zombi 2 sequel and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . however. . . his co-directed by Bruno Mattei (from The Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti but by Claudio Fagrasso (The Night of the Zombies) and his shot in the Phillimines as Night of the Zombies and looks like The night of the Zombies (Hell of the living dead) a lot. As a result, he looks more like Zombi 2, a companion to Hell of the Living Dead. Fabrazio DeAngelis, who produced Zombi 2 and his publisher, Tomassi (?), And efx gianetto De Rossi gave Zombi 2 his magic. . . Zombie 3 is not magic. . . it's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. But over the years, I accepted Zombi 3. I could swear I saw a version in which a soldier bit his arm and went to the hotel room. . . There was an incoherent Fulci-Cut and the Mattei / Fulci-Cut is the one on DVD.
