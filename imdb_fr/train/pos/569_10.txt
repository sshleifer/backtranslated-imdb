A river flows through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers, Norman and Paul (Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer) whose father reverend (Tom Skerritt) is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly-fishing, and for him and his sons the frontier is narrow. This story describes the slow progress of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate on two different paths. This is a moving film told by director Robert Redford, portraying the role of old Norman and reflecting past eras and dead people. <br /> <br /> Some recurring themes in the film, such as memory, death, eternity and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around Paul's almost tragic hero. He is a capable man, charming and courageous, but who has his fatal defects. <br /> <br /> The last lines summarize the "purpose" of the film: "So in the arctic darkness of the canyon, all existence fades into a being with my soul and my memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River. and a four-stroke rhythm and the hope that the fish will come in. Eventually, all things merge and a river runs through it.The river was cut off by the flood of the world and flows on rocks from the base of time. these rocks are timeless raindrops, under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs, I am haunted by the waters.
