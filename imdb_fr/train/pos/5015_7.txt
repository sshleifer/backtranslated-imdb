Hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful cinematography I do not think so. This movie was not too bad but it was not much better than average. The main story dealing with very immoral teenagers should have focused more on the forbidden love novel and why it was ... should have really entered it rather than scratching the surface with "basically" that mom says we can not. " Some parts should have been completely removed or reworked to be more important for the fate of the two main characters. Sometimes, I wondered if the screenwriter / director was a fan of George Lucas's classic American Graffiti. Not that it's a mistake to be a fan of this film, but for your film to sometimes look like that, I mean, come on! The worst part of it was that Madchen Amick had such a small role, I mean double go !! She was the only one, on one or two lines, to have tried a southern accent. (Listen, it was there even though her character was from California! DOH !!) Maybe if she was the star, the others could have followed and we would have had a more authentic movie. Oh well, what can you do when you have a director who is just a director and not an artist, too. Pity. Overall, I give a B- and it's a bit generous because I'm partial to Ms. Amick.
