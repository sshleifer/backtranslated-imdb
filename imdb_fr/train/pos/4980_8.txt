When browsing the Internet for previous sales prices, I came across these comments. Why are they all so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and I have always been totally delighted. I showed it to a lot of my friends and they all liked it too. I feel privileged to own Shirley's original black and white silent movie, dating back to 1932 and dating back to 1932, before it became popular or well known. After reading the other reviews, I agree that the movie is "classy". Big deal! I only wish it to be longer. It seems that I must be the only person to own one of these originals, at least for sale, so I wonder what's the value?
