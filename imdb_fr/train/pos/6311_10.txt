This film is very hilarious, and it has an excellent compilation of actors like William H. Macy who have always interpreted this kind of roles, perhaps even its most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney who is a very good actor showing his work as a comedian in the Cohen Brothers movie "Oh, my brother, where are you?" making it one of my favorite movies! But it was difficult to find "Welcome to Collinwood" here in Mexico. My city lacks good places to buy good movies. I tried to buy it from Blockbuster but they do not know it under its original name, so it may be a bit easier to find if I have the name they gave to Mexico, is anyone know it? because I can not remember! Cheers. A.
