I love that movie! 10 in 10 hands! It's as good as that! I am not a big fan of cinema but I must tell you that this one opened my eyes. Amazing color and fast energy. I had the chance to see him during a screening at the Zoinks! Film Festival in Boston, and the story has really enveloped me from the beginning. There were a lot of themes and characters for adults and when that was over, I wanted more. I hope they make a sequel. It would be fun. My only problem is Melissa Connor's performance as Anya. UGH! She sucks! I saw a block of wood get a better performance. I do not know what the director thought when he started it. But if you do not know, you can not help but give this movie a big ten !!!
