I really liked this movie ... it was cute. I liked it, but if you did not do it, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, although she does not really look like books. The old-fashioned outfits are weird when you see them in modern times, but it suits them well. For me, rich girls did not have clothes that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they have all the clothes - blindfolded - at a garage sale and have just decided to put them all together. All outfits were sticky, especially when they wore moccasins with their usual outfits. I do not want the film to look bad, because it definitely was not! Just go to the theater and watch !!! You will enjoy it!
