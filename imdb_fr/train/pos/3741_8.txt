War drama set in Louisiana in 1971. It follows a group of recruits with basic training, then Tigerland - a faithful representation of Vietnam on American soil before their expedition. It focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, become friends and deal with an honest squadron leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a Border Psychopath ( Shea Wingham). <br /> <br /> A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses a portable camera for most of the film and uses digital video for battle scenes. It works very well - the film looks gritty (as it should be) and strangely realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully conceals his Irish brogue and adopts a convincing Southern accent. His performance is simply superb - he is an extremely talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not so good. He is tall, muscular, very handsome - and very bland. However, the rest of the cast is just great. <br /> <br /> This film was sent by his studio. He had no star, a familiar story and was considered "just another war movie". He only played a week in Boston! It is also worth filming or DVD. <br /> <br /> In addition, Farrell and Davis have a long nude scene.
