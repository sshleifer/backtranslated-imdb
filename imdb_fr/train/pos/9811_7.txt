According to the book The Last of Cowboy Heroes, which talks about Joel McCrea, Audie Murphy and Randolph Scott, the author claims that Albuquerque is the only film he did not watch because he claimed to have lost it . Had not been seen in years. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing for Western fans to have someone do a spring cleanup at Paramount, as a print has apparently been found and is now in the open market. Albuquerque is also a very good western with Scott involved in a family quarrel with his uncle George Cleveland. <br /> <br /> George Cleveland sends his nephew Randolph Scott to his nephew Randolph Scott with the intention of getting him into his fast growing colony freight company in Albuquerque. Cleveland is more than just a business owner, he is the head of the city he runs from a wheelchair. He even has the sheriff in his pocket. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing. This includes not supporting parents when they are mean. He will work for a rival company led by his siblings Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig. <br /> <br /> Cleveland is full of tricks and even sends for a Western Mata Hari in the person of Barbara Britton. to fight a way in the confidence of his rivals. Barbara is great as a housekeeper who develops her own agenda. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott's original studio was Paramount, that's when his first studio contract was signed. Albuquerque scored the last movie he made for Paramount and gave him a good one. <br /> <br /> Also note Lon Chaney, Jr., who is the main henchman of George Cleveland, a rather disgusting bully of a man and Gabby Hayes, who is only Gabby Hayes. <br /> <br /> Albuquerque had to be loved by Republicans from all over the country in 1948 with his main villain as a wheelchair-bound city chief. A certain wheelchair democrat took it for four consecutive presidential elections and he was gone. They had high hopes of winning the White House this year too, but things were going well and they had to settle for an ersatz leader getting his job in Albuquerque. I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair because nothing was really done in the plot. I guess he was hurt and played that role because he had to. <br /> <br /> Still, Albuquerque had to have a big appeal for the GOP market.
