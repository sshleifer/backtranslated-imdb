THE NOTORIOUS PAGE BETTIE (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Pendleton Austin, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol shines like the legendary pin-up queen Bettie Page in a refined biopic. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is probably better known to have been tense like The Next-It-Girl a few years ago Not long ago, nobody knew who she was despite an infamous cover of Vanity Fair among other dubbing with media, but despite some roles played in the same movie here and there, his celebrity seemed to glitter less so far. Here, as the famous queen of pin-up Bettie Page, Gretchen Mol is indeed a shining star on the rise. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page is a Tennessee girl, born as a true God-fearing, family-oriented girl who seemed to find herself the undeserved object of lust and affection, while she was growing up. A group rape that is backtracking is not wisely described graphically, nor does the subtle indication of his own father having any disappointed designs for his own parent, it is important to understand how Page managed to Escape the nightmarish life possible for an actress on her way to New York in the 1950s, when it was the perfect time and place to catch a bottle of light. What Page did not understand is that in reality she would only be when she arrived. <br /> <br /> A beautiful darling raven haired with a divine figure, Page is seen in Coney Island on a summer day by a black policeman asking to take his picture that leads her to ask in her basement and finally the studios of Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor), who take care of their kitsch photos but considered pornographic to a single clientele: fetishist types. <br /> <br /> Although Page is rather naive, she is undeniably intelligent and knows that her body is not a sin and she can see the forest for the trees in the sense that she is in control - or the less remains in what is offered to him. working in the sense that it's not indecent and she's having fun in her less and less clad portraits - until the Congressional Witch Hunt looks for scapegoats to criminalize pornographic images. <br /> <br /> The talented filmmaker Mary Harron and her screenwriter partner Guinevere Turner ("An American psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol") make the biopic traps quite easy and may be a bit too hasty It was Bettie Page well that they do justice in describing an era of blocking at the zenith. Many thanks to the talented director of photography, Mott Hopfel, for his beautiful black-and-white images and dotted colored segments reminiscent of Douglas Sirk's films of the time for his melodramatic alliances. A feminist treatise and an American dream have perfectly fulfilled the story, with great performances by all, including the comic comedians Bauer and Taylor, brothers and sisters of coal and Harris, a day on the ground in as a photo comrade with a taste for wine and discussions. It is amusing to see Strathairn in a campaign campaign for justice after portraying the role of the senator after portraying new bulldog writer Edward R. Murrow in his latest film, "Good Night, and Good Luck" in the opposite role. But <br /> hat to the remarkable talents of Mol, Bettie Page, a woman at once casual, deep moral and above all intelligent, who lets his childhood innocence shine through its bold nudity and now considered tame and picturesque. borderline-kitsch poses that have captivated the male imagination for decades and are still a bookmark for human sexuality in this country and perhaps around the world. Mol is perfect and looks strangely about his portrait because of his complicit smile. The real Bettie Page would apparently not have participated in the project, but she apparently gave him his blessing and continues to lead a somewhat secluded life, which is referred to in the last moments as having found Jesus and fled his image "notorious" once and for all. It's a pity because this film strangely embraces the resounding decency that permeates his subject, radiating to the sight of all in its naked splendor.
