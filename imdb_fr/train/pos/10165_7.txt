In fact, my vote is 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it contains these fun elements that make it worthy to see it, do not get me wrong, it's not the funniest movie in the world, and it's not even original because it's an idea we've seen before in other movies, but this one has its own tastes, one of my friends told me it was a movie for boyfriends ... I think not exactly, but who cares? There is also another film that shows us almost the same subject, Chris Rock appears, the name is Down to Earth, the men, this one is a very funny movie, see both if you want and I know you agree that Mr. Rock won with his film. I wish that the male character was entrusted to Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is good.
