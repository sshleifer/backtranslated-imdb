This film talks about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> The development of the characters in this film is excellent. We come to believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family and that George is an innocent man who aspires to love and care for the "normal" society. The game is excellent and the award for best actor in Cannes is well deserved. <br /> <br /> The fantastic scenes of the film highlight the fact that George is miserable because of his abandonment by his family and his desire to be treated as if nothing had happened. the person. The song that is played repeatedly reinforces this message as well. The film shows that people with intellectual disabilities are in a good mood. We treat them with discrimination and negligence, which is highlighted by the scene where Georges offers a gift to the waitress of the kitchen). If we come to understand and share the world of these people, the mentally handicapped and ourselves can become very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so drawn to the movie and the emotional experiences of the characters. It is a touching film for souls in a good mood.
