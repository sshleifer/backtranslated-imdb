First of all for this film, I only have one word: "Wow". It's probably one of the best films that touched me, from his story to his performances, so wonderfully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed with him because he really brought depth to the character because it was a very difficult role. Yet, they are a couple who, from beginning to end, surprised me, showing in the way a friendship filled with love that has developed throughout the day and has settled in the film. The story takes a long time to unfold, as the character's introduction is long, but we are finally rewarded with a wonderful story of love and humanity. If you have the opportunity, go see it, because it's a movie that will stay in your mind many times. Simply amazing - 9/10.
