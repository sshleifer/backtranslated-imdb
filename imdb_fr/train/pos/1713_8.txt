It's a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol are very beautiful. Soha reminds you so much of her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born actor and will go up a lot in the future. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is very different from most movies. In a way, you are dissatisfied, but if you really think about it, you realize that the only sensible end is the end shown in the film. Otherwise, it would have been a blatant injustice for everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is about a professional witness meeting a girl who is waiting to get married in court. Her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness. Slowly, over time, he falls in love with her. It is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not. Watch the movie for more details. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Abhay. I can not wait to see more movies from him. Soha is pretty but does not talk much in the movie. His eyes, his innocence, made most of the conversation.
