This is Paul F. Ryan's first and only feature film. He has not done anything since. However, he managed to get an extraordinary cast to represent the characters in his story. I do not know when or why this idea came to mind, but Ryan wrote a screenplay that later became his own movie, "Home Room". <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps wears the film on her shoulders Alicia, a troubled girl; those we always see in TV shows. With black hair and black clothes; a pack of cigarettes in the pocket, a strange look and disturbing eyes (with makeup, of course). An event occurred at his school. a shooting. Some students died and she saw everything. Now, detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) is investigating the case and, as expected, Alicia is a suspect. But filming is only genesis; the film does not concern filming. <br /> <br /> Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen) is lying in her bed in a hospital room. She is one of the survivors of the hospital. The script links them, by the school principal (James Pickens Jr). He helps all the students recover from the event, but Alicia does not seem to care. She is isolated. Then the principal punishes her; she must visit Deanna every day until five o'clock. Then the movie starts. <br /> <br /> I can not even describe how beautiful the film is. I can relate to the characters and situations in which they live. I like reality. These things could happen to anyone. And the things they say are totally understandable. They grow up and try to manage things they did not experience; they do their best. Unknowingly, Alicia (when she visits Deanna for the first time) and Deanna (when she sees Alicia standing in front of her) begin a journey that will define their personality and ideas for the next stage of their lives. After high school. <br /> <br /> The director directs Christensen and Philipps very well. Look at the contrast between them. Deanna seems naive and with clear thoughts; no complexity inside his mind. When Alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers, she asks, "Who brought them?" "Many people," Deanna answers; although a few days later, we learned that they came from his parents, who came every week. The parental figures are all well represented but are not as important as the characters of their sons. Deanna is alone. Alicia seems mature and violent; smoke cigarettes and talk roughly. But after two days of visiting, she finds herself every day in the hospital. even sleep in Deanna's room all night. When they both argue, I think Deanna says, "Why do you always come back?" Alicia is alone too. <br /> <br /> The end of the film, without ruining it, is a little disappointing; it's something I did not expect. This eliminates some of the strength of the film. Revelation is totally useless. ruin the logical climax that the film could have had. It was an excellent script anyway; and excellent direction. A good movie. <br /> <br /> When it came to Erika Christensen, it was the role she needed to fly higher. His role in "Traffic" was impressive, but it was the big step; the main role. Maybe not many people have had the chance to see her in this movie, and it's a shame. She has not made a wrong move since. She even made good performances in terrible movies. Busy Philipps, who has shown great promise in this film (what a transformation), does not have many opportunities for other roles. <br /> <br /> Same thing I say about Paul F. Ryan (realizing, curse), and I guess he's sitting right now in his computer finishing his new script; I'm waiting for his next film. I hope the best for everyone.
