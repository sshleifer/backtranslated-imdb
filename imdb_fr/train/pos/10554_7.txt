NOTHING (3+ out of 5 stars) Another strange principle of the director of the movie "Cube". This time, two main characters meet up with their house in a mysterious white void. There is literally nothing outside their little two-story house. Intriguing to be sure, but I thought that the comic tone set for this film from the start was extremely poorly designed. There must be some humor, of course ... and I have no problem with the humor that was finally drawn from the fate of our two heroes (their final "confrontation" was really funny) ... but I really think the film would have been a lot better if it had stayed more grounded in reality at first. After watching the movie, I watched the DVD "Making of" and a short trailer in the end is almost completely devoid of comic aspect "sillier" ... making it a completely different movie (and slightly better ). The last half-hour of the movie is when things really start to take shape ... similar to the recent movie "Primer". The actors are fine when they do not do too much of shtick comedy. They are really very believable in their more "normal" moments. I was probably ready to write this film as a failed experiment halfway through ... but he convinced me in the end. (And keep looking beyond the credits of the final scene ... but do not ask me to explain it.)
