I entered my first comment about this film almost five years ago. Second, the ideas presented in the film still seemed essentially fictitious, if at all possible. No longer. Now, politics, society and the media in The Running Man really seem very close to you. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (year of the release of The Running Man): present today: <br /> <br /> Concern, as said the character of Richard Dawson, Damon Killian, "traditional morality". CHECK OUT <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort of competitors. CHECK OUT <br /> <br /> Cameras everywhere. CHECK OUT <br /> <br /> Limited travel for citizens at the mercy of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system with bar-code passports ("pass" in the film) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. CHECK OUT <br /> <br /> A growing number of conflicts between the government and the media, on the verge of incest. CHECK OUT <br /> <br /> Computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real movie sequences (like the "digital matting" of Ben Richards' double stunt image). CHECK <br /> <br /> The imprisonment of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> The sluggish economy widens the gap between the rich and the less wealthy; an increasing number of marginal groups responding to the tightening of the power of big governments; civil unrest just below or on the surface of almost every major public event, regardless of its origin or intent. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> Again, maybe it's just a movie based on Stephen King's short story. But just to be safe, I'm moving to Switzerland.
