Does anyone else cry tears of joy watching this movie? I like that! One of my 10 best movies of all time. It just makes me feel good. I'm looking at the closing production number with all the members of the cast, again and again !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is the daughter of the movie, IMHO! I have never seen the play but I get angry when I read reviews saying that the play was better than the movie. Both are like apples and oranges. The process of making the film will rarely provide a finished product faithful to the original work. I think it's only because of the fear of public alienation that many well-known and screen-adapted works are no more altered than they are. It's a very good movie, it's very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
