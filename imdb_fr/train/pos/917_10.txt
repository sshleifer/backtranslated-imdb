I watched it in July and even with the Christmas theme, I found it touching and sensitive. This is not for someone with a spirit of reality because it is full of fantasy and beautiful moments that sometimes have no meaning. William Russ did a great job as Hank. I saw it only in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer, where he played a weak character. But in this one, the expression in his eyes, as Hank thought of things that happened to him, was wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and adorable as usual and very credible in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was gorgeous and always brought a smile when he appeared in several important scenes. There were a lot of special scenes, including the one where Hank realizes who really was Max in his life. It's not for everyone ..... especially those who are not in the "well-being" movies and it's really one! If you like everything to be perfect and logical, avoid this one. But I think it's worth looking at again, that's why I recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have a VCR :)
