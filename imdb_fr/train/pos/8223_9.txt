When I first saw this film in London in 1958, I was shocked. I had never seen a movie like this before. It was a strange and hypnotic effect, very different from the films I had seen before and had a lasting impact. <br /> <br /> I believe that Odile Versios and Marina Vlady are sisters, even twins. Certainly, the interaction is amazing in its ability to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If this has been converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language, I would like to hear about it & where it can be purchased.
