Most stoogephiles consider it to be the best Stooges shorts, and they are right. Curly is a scream dressed in "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are in great shape as "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. Christine McIntyre's magnificent operatic voice is perfectly controlled - she was actually a trained opera singer - and that's wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is hilarious as a pompous Italian singer terrorized by the Stooges at a party of society. Some really funny gags, a good direction and a very tight editing make this climb to the top of the prolific production of Stooges. What is even more amazing is that Curly had serious health problems at the time. In many of his short films he made during this period, you can see that he is obviously sick; his timing is far away, he speaks very slowly and with hesitation, and has trouble moving. Fortunately, his health was up when he made this film, and it shows. A classic comedy from Stooge, appreciated even by non-Stooge fans (I had a girlfriend who could not stand the Stooges, but she did not care about this one). A must see.
