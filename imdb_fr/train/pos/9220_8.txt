A deliciously unpretentious shipment of Romeo and Juliet. Approach without expectations other than having a good time and you will appreciate this one. A talented group of comic actors let themselves go and had a riot in the vehicle of these playful performers. The bad reviews were due to the snobbery of Shakespeare's treatments. Some people think that all movies should be "important" --- If you share these views, do not bother. The credits read "introducing" Angelina Jolie, which is not even close to the truth, but she is incredibly beautiful like Juliet's character and, as always, her playing is fantastic - and, given her age at the time, even his dialect is very good. Recreating this classic tale with conflicting Italian families in the restaurant industry in New York is a lot of fun. See him in the right state of mind and you'll laugh out loud.
