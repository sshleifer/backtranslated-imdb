I have to give How She Move an almost perfect note because the content is really great. As commented on a previous comment, I have no idea how this film ended up in the bottom 100 list of IMDB! It's absolutely ridiculous! Other films - especially those that share the theme of dance - can not stick to this one in terms of combination of top-notch, credible actors and incredible dance routines. <br /> <br /> ending the underlying story (it's not just about winning a contest) is very easy to explore and surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters in this film is two-dimensional, and at the end of the film, it's very easy to feel emotionally involved. (And even if you're not one to cry, you might get a little crying before the credits.) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to dance lovers and more , to those who can enjoy a poignant and well-played scenario. Of course, it's not perfect (what the movie is?), But it's really a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half-cooked plot and / or characters that lack substance. The actors and the sets of this film form a very realistic and captivating walk thanks to the incredible talent of the dancers!
