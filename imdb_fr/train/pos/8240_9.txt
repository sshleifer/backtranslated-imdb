I was also present for the first time in Toronto. This film was a kind of consolation when I thought I could not come in to see my first choice. Well, I was totally blown away. By the time I arrived at the theater, I could only remember the basic plot of the film (yes, I had forgotten who was there.) Terrible performances of all actors. Carrie-Anne Moss was great to truly get out of her days as a Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I do not think so, since Chaplin has an actor who has played so brilliantly, unanswered. The kids were great too. Take a look at it if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> And, by the way, I still had the chance to see my first choice - and it was much better.
