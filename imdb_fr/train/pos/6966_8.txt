Overall, I was rather impressed by the pilot. The first fifteen minutes were worrisome because the creators were trying to create a sci-fi version of The OC, but this fear is corrected when a terrorist attack occurs. From there, the series addresses themes and situations that I see very rarely. TV. <br /> <br /> BSG has addressed themes such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism, but it is above all a subtext that the viewer can contemplate or ignore he wishes it. Here, on the other hand, these subjects are at the center of the series and I have personally found myself evoking works such as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as points of reference, while watching and being surprised at the quality of the discussion. . I think if you're a fan of the two films I just mentioned or other movies / TV shows that cover the topics I mentioned, I think you'll find at least something here. <br /> <br /> In terms of starting point to explain how the situation we are experiencing at BSG was born I think they treated it in a very interesting way. I particularly liked the way they explained the origin of Cylon belief in one God and the creation of Caprica just enough advanced and contemporary technology introduced to make it appear in the future but that is not ours completely alien as spectators. <br /> <br /> The only weak points I noticed are the relationship between Greystone's parents and the actress who plays "Lacy Rand". . Although I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, their scenes seemed to lack chemistry. At this point, it might just be about developing their characters, but I think it's something that requires work. I also found Magda Apanowicz unconvincing in her role. This may still be due to the experience and the time needed for development, but throughout the episode, his game seemed forced and not confident. <br /> <br /> Based on the pilot, I can not wait to see where Caprica will go. the future and we hope this will affect the greatness that BSG has experienced.
