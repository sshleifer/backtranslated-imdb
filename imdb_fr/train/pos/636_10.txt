Why are the previews so blahed for such a great movie !! Everyone should know how good it is. It's engaging and fun from the first moment, original and well played. I wish the film to do the press as it should! <br /> <br /> For all those who love The Princess Bride, Labyrinth and other truly fun and original fantastic adventures, this is one of the best. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. The relative newcomer, Charlie Cox, is an incredible leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is making a splash with her recent screen returns. There are also many wonderful moments of minor characters ... even facial expressions.
