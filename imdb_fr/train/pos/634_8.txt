I was one of about 200 people who had the chance to see an excerpt from this movie at first. <br /> <br /> Stardust follows Tristan, a young man searching for a fallen star and bringing her back to the woman he loves to prove his love for her. The only problem is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, a gateway between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie was a pleasure to watch, it contains something for everyone, all the action scenes go wonderfully and the comedy unfolds through the movie, making the movie fun without being nerdy. If I had to compare the tastes to another movie, it would probably be The Princess Bride, a classic. <br /> <br /> All the performances are exceptional, the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in her portrait of Yvaine The na√Øve confident and undervalued star Michelle Pfeiffer delivers an incredible performance like Larnia ... but the Robert De Niro's performance ... In every scene he's in, he steals the show ... <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood to tell a love story fantastic and whimsical, it's the movie. Guys do not let the description fool you, there's enough action comedy and do not mention a lot of eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained. Cinematography is dead and remains in the spirit of the film ... nothing in the film seems forced.
