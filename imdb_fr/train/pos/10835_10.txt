I love that movie. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and always find interesting. Congratulations!! I believe that everyone involved in making the film and script should be proud of themselves. It's so strange that you feel like you are watching a real life group. I would like to see more movies like this one. I'm glad they did not choose Hollywood stars to feature in this movie, as it probably would not have worked. And even though Billy Connolly is well known, he got stuck in the role and I could not imagine anyone else playing it. Once again congratulations, I really believe this film deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. And when you arrive at the final scene ..... and what can I say !!!
