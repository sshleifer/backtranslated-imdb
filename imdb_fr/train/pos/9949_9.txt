This one is a good surprise. A cute little story of the heroine's quest, a very surprising metamorphosis of the very sexy four-eyed guy who will soon become single in a hot-sex Queen DD-cup. <br /> <br /> Visually a show for sore eyes, not only for two pretty stunning actresses but also for (most) costumes and makeup of actors. A ridiculous castle imitation cost a bit dear. <br /> <br /> Back to the positives: The film is embellished with some unusually explicit camera shots that you would not expect in a hard core. I loved this scene with ice cubes, absolute potential of classics. A slight less than for (very) few strange scenes where bad acts by minor castes briefly suspended the suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> 9/10 with extra credit for the serious smudge effect.
