Jafar Panahi's comedy "Offside" features women trying to enter a sports center in Tehran where they are banned. The official reason: a lot of foul language and football players have visible legs. But of course, it's really a case of sexism. Thus, most of the film consists of a slight comic relief as women try to ask men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium. A woman even proposes her own plan to challenge men. <br /> <If I understand correctly, all the films of Jafar Panahi (this one included) are prohibited in Iran. The real tragedy is that the CIA's overthrow of the prime minister in 1953 and his support for the brutal shah provided Ayatollah Khomeini with an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Quran to establish a chauvinistic society, and that George's current politics W. Bush against Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is an excuse to play cowboy and reinforce censorship. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a good look at people who suggest ways to challenge the system. Not a good movie, but it's worth it. Since all Jafar Panahi's films are banned, I wonder how he is able to do them.
