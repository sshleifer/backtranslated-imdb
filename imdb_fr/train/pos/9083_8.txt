I enjoyed this film and my expectations were very low because of all the negative reviews I had read before leaving. I went there because I was curious to know what all the fuss was about because some of the publications were so angry with this movie and the Koreans. Oh, and it's from Korea that has released some of my favorite movies. I liked Host but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite science fiction / fantasy movies so you can get an idea of ​​my likes: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> As everyone said, it was not confusing. The monsters looked good and the battles were great. There are some holes in the story but it does not really matter. I sort of sorted out that sort of thing and I stopped asking why a long time ago when I see blockbusters in the summer. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation was different, and I thought that the main characters dressed suspiciously like Korean actors in other series. Ethan's hair (Behr) looked so Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it could be better and I hope that in the future, Korea, with its unusual sense of life, its intense emotions and its unexpected humor, can bring diversity to the genre. blockbuster. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?
