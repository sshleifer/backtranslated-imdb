It's a brilliant and well-made contribution by a group of fans, and considering it is done in a back room on a painted green screen, its story is complex and sinuous, and its characters show a realistic depth and dimension . The CGI created by the crew is breathtaking. Although his first season may be a little fragile, his final is well thought out and well drawn. Some fans may have thought that the Star Trek franchise ended with Enterprise's early cancellation, but these fans do not take no for an answer. I recommend it to fans as to newcomers, 10/10 crews hidden borders. <br /> <br /> Make sure ...
