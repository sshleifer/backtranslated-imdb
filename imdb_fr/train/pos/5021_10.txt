I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before bringing it back to the store. Bill Paxton has engaged top talent to make a good thriller with interesting twists. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both perform well. The story is told in an interesting way with the two returns back 20 years back, then points in the present, alternating back. This style of narration is a good thriller that can not be boring. Bill Paxton, please, do more horror movies, you have the talent!
