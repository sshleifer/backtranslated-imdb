It's a very dramatic film full of suspense. There are a lot of plots and turns. The story or director opens question marks on death row or alleged crimes committed by blacks. This film is very well done by Arne Glimcher and the fine sound of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this one, do not miss "TRUE CRIMES" or "THE HURRICANE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
