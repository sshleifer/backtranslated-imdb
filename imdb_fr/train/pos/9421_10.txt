Contains * spoilers * - moreover, my quotes may not be accurate. <br /> <br /> Everyone always notes satire in social comments and economic parallels - what a truth. But for me, I see this movie as much more than that. I like the symbolism of this guy in a bright white suit. There is so much confusion and dirt in the world around it, but it will not stick. Alec Guiness was the ideal guy to play this role - his childish smiles and his eternal curiosity are so appropriate: <br /> <br /> "It's ingenious - can you tell me what is the relationship between ink and gasoline?" > <br /> The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention has finally not worked - that he is almost naked. Yet, more than shame, it's the simple disappointment that "it did not work". He is never really intimidated by people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we also want to stop him." <br /> <br /> Just a moment's hesitation before he tries to escape. Does he show signs of the pain that such betrayal must have caused? No. <br /> <br /> The role of Dapne is also remarkable. She is fed up with money and power. She thinks she has finally found love, outside of her father's business. At first, she does not really care about Sidney more than anyone. But that moment when he falls from his car and she goes back to see if she may have killed him - and yet he thinks only of the beauty of his invention. She finally found something for which she thinks it's worth living. What's funny is that it's not even romance. It is friendship, but of a nature so ephemeral that the title hardly fits. It's more admiration and maybe even inspiration. <br /> <br /> When she discovers that Michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her, she gives in to cynicism and tries Sidney. Fortunately, she finds that there are really people in this world who live for more than power, money and lust. What a refreshment: <br /> <br /> "Thanks Sidney, if you said yes, I think I would have strangled you." <br /> <br /> I love the end, when all this crazy business seems to have failed. But then, the sparkling and offbeat beat begins and Sidney goes away, his stride corresponding to the melody: intrepid. Where is Daphne? We do not really know - but they were not really in love and she was not really a scientist. He had help to escape and she was "shot in the arm of hope". (Pollyanna) A solid relationship would have been nice, but as Billy Joel says, "It's more than I expected ..." <br /> <br />
