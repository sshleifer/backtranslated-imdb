When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was that it looked more like an anime than a movie. The reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts. The cascades are very similar to Matrix movements, such as movements too fast for balls and jumps very far. Another reason the film is good is that the adorable cartoon characters they make during the movie The way Gackt pouted or just the way they act, VERY ANIME. I think it's a very good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde are also a 10). ^ _ ~ If you are fans of Gackt and Hyde, you must see it.
