Is the future ahead? An overcrowded and ruthless wasteland with an infernal and undesirable existence? This film evokes a problem that still concerns us, especially since the release of the film in 1973. Hope that the world will not end like that ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie that I have a lot love. There were sympathetic characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting, a fascinating and stimulating plot, and the most macho macho ever: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant and dirty feeling. You are almost suffocated by the stench of the city and its filthy inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man has created this tough role, but he's a tough guy. I could certainly put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something is wrong, but everyone around him does not listen (rather like paying for not listening) or wants his death. Edward G. Robinson (in his latest film, R.I.P.) plays the old adorable old Sol, who is tired of this bad place. Everyone is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a "piece of furniture" provided with the apartment in which she lives. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The green Soylent factory, the futuristic flats and especially the "scoops" (bulldozers that eliminate people) were excellent. The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty. The empty streets of the city filled with vile and putrid people are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> A last note is the end, which shocks me again now. It's horrible, but if you think about it, it's a very good idea. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: <br /> <br /> An excellent sci-fi movie of the 70s that makes you think and lets you feel very uncomfortable.
