This movie is really good. The plot, which works like a puzzle, forces the viewer to think and guess what will happen next. Such a tour brings a lot of surprises and makes the viewer eager to solve an enigma. The fight scenes are very good. There are a lot of different fighting styles (though one of the styles is a bit unreal for me, but that's just my opinion) to watch and it's a fascinating show. The only thing that can be irritating is the actors' gaze. A little too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good in kung-fu movies, especially in the '70s and' 80s, so "Five Venoms" (or other versions) is an excellent choice.
