I'm a great classic movie buff, but I'm just starting to watch silent movies. Many dumb movies do not catch my attention, but Show People is a notable exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are just great in this picture. Davies, in particular, shows a wide range of cases where she moves from a gigantic little town girl to a starlet who takes herself a little too seriously. <br /> <br /> Show People is a fast-paced film, with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era. The film immediately caught my attention and I actually forgot it was a silent movie. (I know it does not make sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are needed. <br /> <br /> Show People is a perfect introduction to silent films. It's an interesting, fast-paced film, with two of the best stars of the era of silence. Add to that the satire Hollywood and Show Show should be on the list of sites not to be missed for all classic moviegoers.
