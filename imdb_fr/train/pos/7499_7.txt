But it's a little hilarious, at least if you grew up on Weird Al, as I did. It is a fake documentary about his life and career, which begins with celebrity and traces the origins. It's spotty in places, but some segments are always fun, especially when you're in Japan. Although his texture is not as emotional as Lost in Translation and he does not find love so fleeting, he captures in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural mixture that is life on Tokyo Street. <br /> <br /> Maybe Weird Al is not recognized as the insightful cultural commentator he is; maybe a rose with another name would smell just as sweet. Still, it's a funny movie.
