I would just like to say that I saw this movie twice now and I love it! The acting is great and although it's a plot similar to "Raise Your Voice", I think the plot is never boring for those who like that kind of thing. It contains great lessons and shows us that we can do everything if we try. An incredible movie. I'm sure it's a program I will be watching for a long time. Even though Britney Spears wrote the book, it's a pretty realistic plot, maybe not to the point of falling in love, but being different and having a hard time succeeding but better at the end is very faithful to reality. The only minor criticism is why is the main daughter of these films still beautiful? Do you really think Holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or mean? I doubt..
