Never read Jim Thompson? He is a hard black with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I have ever encountered. There are rarely private detectives in his job - just losers, psychotics and crooks. Thompson nailed this film - "If God has made real mistakes in this world, it's giving us the will to live when we have no excuse for it." All the characters of the film are balanced on the edge of the razor between realism surreal and terrifying. There is the lousy and complicitous uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and the docile Doc Goldman fantasy played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives a wonderful, often heartbreaking performance by Kid Collins, a shy, not-too-bright ex-fighter who is more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, the sexy femme fatale we can not really understand. It's not your standard movie, it's not meant to be. After Dark My Sweet and The Grifters are two great adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
