Ernst Marischka, one of Austria's most respected directors of the time, made films filled with beautiful scenes, a delicate love and respectful of all that is precious in life. <br /> <br /> These days, if they hear about him, they associate Marischka's name with the SISSI trilogy (1955, 1956, 1957). However, he has made other excellent films like DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and of course this one, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN showing the young years of Queen Victoria. Although it deals with a theme slightly different from that of SISSI films, I do not see many differences between this film and SISSI. They are remarkably similar. <br /> <br /> The film is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> The casting ... Romy Schneider is one of the leading roles. It was a nice introduction to his role as Sissi since this film was shot a year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian Empress. It's also a movie where Romy plays with her mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director to choose Romy to play with his mother. Romy's debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) was also his performance with his mother. This is why Romy began her Austrian career on the basis of the notoriety of her mother. Indeed, there is truth in it. <br /> <br /> Again, as in SISSI, this film shows love very gently. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small inn in Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles. And now...? How would it be shown? Only sex ... But is it the only thing on which love rests? <br /> <br /> I thank Ernst Marischka for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people may call it kitsch, but I will never give up on admiring these movies. They are impressive !!! Unfortunately, extremely underrated!
