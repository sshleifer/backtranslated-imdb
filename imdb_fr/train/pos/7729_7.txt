THE JIST: See something else. <br /> <br /> This film was highly appreciated by Gene Siskel, but after watching it, I can not understand why. The film is really original and different. There are even interesting dialogues, cool moments and a "black" feeling. But it's just not fun. It does not make much sense, either in the plot but especially in the motivations of the characters. I do not know anyone who behaves like these characters. <br /> <br /> It's a difficult film to take - I suggest you do not accept the challenge.
