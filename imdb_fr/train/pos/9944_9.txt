Of course, the plot is not Oldboy. It seems that the only "big" movies nowadays are surprisingly shocking or big budget / excited in some way. <br /> <br /> Spin Kick is a drama / comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their heart tae kwon do. Regardless of what you expect from this film, you are guaranteed to feel touched by the work, the pain and the expectations that the characters force themselves to experience. Although sometimes comical, many moments and characters are rendered wonderfully: there is the old guardian who takes things too seriously, the thug turned good man who just wants a second chance in life, the replacement of the team, who would die happy if he died just won once in his life, and many other well-rounded characters with their own problems - but most importantly, their own hopes and dreams. Although the plot and objectives of the film are simple, these aspects of the film only highlight the development of the characters as they overcome their personal and interpersonal struggles. <br /> <br /> In short, this film will leave you feeling refreshed, determined and satisfied.
