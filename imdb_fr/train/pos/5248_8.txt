Ok, like many other movies of the same genre, come from a sketch of SNL. But Tim Meadows does a pretty fantastic job of transforming a one-dimensional, 3-minute character into a moderately viable humorous movie character. He regularly drops amusing doublings and regularly beats with a medium frequency. Billy Dee Williams is in the group although his Lando years are over, and everything is going well. Admittedly, this is not great art, but if you went to Wayne's World in search of Gone With The Wind, you made a mistake. Nice for what it is .......
