It was simple and yet so nice. I think the whole sense of sex segregation in society, which can be bitter, has been shown very delicately. There was a kind of bitter hummer inside. The fact that most actors are not professionals has made the film more tangible and realistic. There was also a "documentary" side to the film. The best scenes were those that all the girls, forbidden to watch, listened passionately to the soldier, who is supposed to watch them, by broadcasting the match. If you are an Iranian, the familiar cheers and street dancing after a winning game fill you with national pride !! If you are not Iranian, you will love it anyway!
