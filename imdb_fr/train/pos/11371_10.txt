This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic success. From the beginning, I felt completely hooked on the (true) story when Lieutenant Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) was crying while performing autopsies on the remains of the child's body. This is the fascinating story of Andrei Chikatilo, interpreted wonderfully by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays so well and the spectator almost starts to pity him, until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, marvelously interpreted by Max Von Sydow, was quite credible in every detail, and the argument he makes when he talks about paranoia in the Soviet Union is clearly highlighted by the behavior Local Communist Commissioner Bondarchuk, played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the exceptional performance came from Donald Sutherland, which proves once again how much he is a superb actor. I was almost in tears when he explained to Burakov how the FBI had been watching and admiring his work. This film puts in the shade the silence of the lambs, atmospheric and dark landscapes of the Soviet Union with the exceptional performances of all the people concerned. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10/10
