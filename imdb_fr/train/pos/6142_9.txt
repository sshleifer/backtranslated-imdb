A delightful Disney movie starring middle-aged Angela Lansbury, she is interested in witchcraft during the Second World War in England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was around 51 at the time of the film. She is ideal for the party. It's still Jessica Fletcher, but this time it's for the benefit of the kids and mother England during a time of great peril. <br /> <br /> The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a teacher. of witchcraft trying to get some information about witchcraft. These three little girls sent to live with Price to escape the bombings of London are wonderful in this enchanting film, whatever their age. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe have so little to do in this endearing film. <br /> <br /> I really thought about Ben Stiller's movie - "The Night at the Museum", at the end of the film, when the relics come alive to fight with the Nazi invasion in the small British coastal city.
