WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS deserves to be a better-known film directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world to LAURA. And this time, he has the same co-stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It must be said that Tierney here is underused in what amounts to a secondary role while attention is turned to Andrews. <br /> <br /> He plays a hard-and-hard cop who is used to dealing with a bunch of thugs too vigorously until one night, he accidentally kills a man trying to stop him. When the taxi driver (TOM TULLY) is suspected, he participates in the investigation of the murder but begins to feel guilty because he is in love with the taxi driver's daughter (GENE TIERNEY). Tierney, by the way, looks a little too elegant for the girl she plays here and does not seem to fit into the sordid background elements of the story. <br /> <br /> The story takes a sinister turn as the investigation goes further and it is discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in the head of his service as a war hero . In the end, the film turns into a story of morality, Andrews developing his awareness of his crime. <br /> <br /> It's fascinating as a film noir with capable performances from a large distribution. A good entry into the field of black, forcefully led by Preminger and well performed by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight casting error of his character.
