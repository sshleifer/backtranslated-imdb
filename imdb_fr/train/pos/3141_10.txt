Let's face it: the last season (# 8) was one of the worst of any series I've ever enjoyed (most of the time, I've never found a drought that lasts a season). But if you judge this series by last season, it will obviously be lower. This is a totally unfair evaluation - because "That '70s Show" was, in his time, a brilliant and funny comedy about a bygone era and the fact that the people who lived there were not so different from what we are here in modern times. <br /> <br /> Okay ... ignoring Season 8. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace is portrayed by Eric Forman, an excited geek of a teenage girl in love with Donna (Laura Prepon), the feminist girl next door. Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) play fantastically in (almost) every episode. The best of them is probably Fes, a foreign student who is as mentally promiscent as possible. Which country is it from? Try to understand it! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, as a Kitty, is both great and sweet, as if Mrs. Brady was meeting Marie Barone, while Smith's Red existed primarily to scare everyone's pogees. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well in front of each other as parents of Donna, the chauvinist but friendly Bob and the Midge in the air. Tommy Chong sometimes has appearances as Leo, a stoner who plays the role of father to Hyde. <br /> <br /> Aside from the anachronistic mistakes that appear frequently and the excessive lessons that come sometimes (and this deplorable last season), "'70s" is a fantastic show with incredible writing, perfect direction and an atmosphere of thrilling well-being through every episode. They're all fine.
