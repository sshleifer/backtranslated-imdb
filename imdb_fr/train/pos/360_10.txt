11 Oscar nominations and zero wins !!! I still do not understand why - it's not as if the actors in the movie did better afterwards than you can by awarding them rewards for trivial roles as was the case with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery and Danny Glover etc- were all amazing - I'm curious to get the text of the Oscars debates that year ...... this should be in the Shoulda-woulda -cana category for judges .... <br /> <br /> This is an amazing book - but true to Alice Walker's writing style, she seems to be exaggerating her characters - I'm so glad they adapted their film with an adaptation. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was incredible - the African scenes live a lot to be desired - the African part of the book is supposed to unfold in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that they can not think of Africa apart from Safaris - so yes, there must have been a complementary scene of zebras and wildlife when we all know it does not matter. there is no West Africa ---- and above all why get people to speak Swahili - who in West Africa speaks Swahili ?? I just had to get it out of my way ....... <br /> <br /> But as a story - amazing, filming - out of this world - CLASSIC yes !! <br /> <I own it and I look at it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.
