Dear readers, <br /> <br /> The final battle between rebellion and empire. The second death star is nearing completion, and once completed, it will condemn the rebel alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! They agree to lead the Shield Generator attack on the moon of Endor Forest, while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. They hardly know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and that Emperor Palpatine himself personally supervises the construction of the second death star. <br /> <br /> The return of the Jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy. There's action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, incredible fighting scenes and fantastic John Williams music. Mark Hamill has now become a Jedi Knight, the naive farmer is gone and in his place is a calm and relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is always cool in this movie, just like Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie play the lead while James Earl Jones is still the biggest villain of the cinema: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain in the role of Emperor Palpatine, twisted and brutally ruthless. The action sequences of this film are breathtaking and sword fights are serious and difficult. The score of John Williams is always fresh and improves the film of several levels. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
