Well, what can I say, this movie really got me, it's not that bad, as many say, I really liked it, although the idea seems so simple, and rather boring, it is not. First, I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the movie. Second, the simple story and the drama of the Spirit draws your attention. One of the things I love most is that they did not give the stallion a human voice to interact with other horses, it makes the film more realistic, few animations seem realistic, no is not it, but ... I do not know it, to make the animals talk is so ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful animations of 2002, in my opinion, I recommend it to everyone, not just children :), because c relaxing.
