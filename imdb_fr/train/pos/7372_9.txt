"This Is Not A Love Song" is a shining example of the kind of hunting that many people think has an underlying meaning. The love between the two main characters can be more than fraternal. I think Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see him. <br /> <br /> I really think that this is represented with scenes such as backtracking and sequences of letters. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. With intense facial expressions and with great care in writing Spike's name on his letters. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the movie was announced, the critic seems to have misunderstood the movie because they did not even mentioned the possibility that Heaton has sexual feelings for Spike. I also have the feeling that some critics have not recognized him, when they use phrases such as: "Who is Heaton, what is he doing with a delay like Spike?" This person, however, may have hit the nail on the head with his remark. Spike shows obvious signs of a doctorate, although I do not think that person understood this because he seems to use the word "delay" as a derogatory term. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. Although it is not for the shy. The film is extremely character-based. After the shooting, the dialogues between the two anti-heroes do not have much more. Unless you are used to watching such deep and difficult films, stay away.
