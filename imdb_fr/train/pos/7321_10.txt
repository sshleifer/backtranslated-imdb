Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It is very well done and has more psychological elements than you would realize at first. It is a simple film very well told. The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores ... If you have not seen this movie yet, you have to go. The casting is great. I wish they never do aftereffects after sequelae. The first was by far the best and should have ended like this without having any follow-up. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She did not seem to grow old (she is just as beautiful today, without the hairstyle and clothes of the 70s). The scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things of all time!
