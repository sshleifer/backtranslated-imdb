I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic, and the older movie was far superior. I liked the way lighting, makeup and costumes changed as Gillian changed in the story. The mannerisms of Jimmy Stewart did not help me much in this film, but I guess they served to highlight the reserve of the character Gillian. The mannerisms of Nicky and Gillian also struck me. It was as if the director wanted him to look effeminate and Gillian looked masculine. The gestures Nicky made when he showed Redlich his powers struck me particularly. I never thought that warlocks were effeminate, so it was an interesting way to contrast these characters.
