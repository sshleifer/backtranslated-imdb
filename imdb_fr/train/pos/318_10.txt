This is without a doubt the biggest film of all time. It's almost incomprehensible, even after many repeated screenings to try to understand what exactly is happening. The film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers, commercials, competitions that are entered by mail and a host of other innovations. Also, what other movies have Martin Luther King cameos, Jr? To decipher the film, look for director I Was Curious's book. Everything will become clear. It is a grandiose and daring experience in the making of improvised recursive films. A triumph. Now, if only someone released a version with subtitles in a color * other * than white ... white subtitles tend to fade and become invisible.
