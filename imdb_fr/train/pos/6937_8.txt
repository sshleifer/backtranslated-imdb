This moving western person brings to life the story of the famous rifle from the beginning of the west coveted by all. James Stewart is the cowboy who won the prestigious Winchester shootout before losing it in case of theft. The story details Stewart's pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film. The rifle changes hands over and over again, as if the owner were doomed to lose it by violence. The photo is full of action and suspense as Stewart gets closer to his career. A large cast supports Stewart, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems to have misunderstood and the role of his role is rather obscure. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, the idols of later years, have short but good roles.
