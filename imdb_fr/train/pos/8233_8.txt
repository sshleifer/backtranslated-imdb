Fido tells the story of the higher well-trained zombies who were trained to serve the human race. Everything falls apart, however, when Timmy's young zombie, Fido, eats the family's neighbor. From that moment, a catastrophe (well, maybe not a disaster, but to a certain extent, chaos) occurs. Most people treat their zombies with fairness, and one of these characters sleeps with his zombie (very amusing part of the movie, if not very disturbing). And we find the affectionate Fido, whatever he can do. It's a very funny and unique movie, especially for the zombie genre. It's also probably one of the least violent movies of zombies (no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to people looking for something funny and different. I note this 8/10. R rated for zombie violence
