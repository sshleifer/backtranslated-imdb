Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent for the time. <br /> <br /> This film was originally aired to illustrate the shuttle disaster, which is a real drag on the popularity of the shuttle. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the doors of the shuttle open in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, that is to say ... on a television .. it just seems way. I remember that scene at the theater. It made you feel like you were really up there. <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie to see on IMAX, but I'm sure it will never happen.
