I thought at first that this movie would be your typical Western movie. However, it was very interesting and spellbinding to the end, which turned out to be very unusual. Charlton Heston, (Sam Burgade), "Midway", '76, had previous experiences with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), "Deadfall", '93 and Zach never forgave Sam and would stop at nothing to make sure to catch up. with him and he returned. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), "The Portrait of a Lady", 96, managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex-hungry men who never seemed to leave her alone. Sam Burgade had to make very difficult decisions and the conclusion surprised me. It is a very entertaining film and the acting was exceptional.
