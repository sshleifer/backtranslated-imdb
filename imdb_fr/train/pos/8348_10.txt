Around 1986, I saw this film by accident on television one evening. I was 6. It looked like my accidental observation of the terrifying end of Do not Look Now in 1987. I went on vacation to Venice the following year in a silent terror, hoping my parents would not find out that I had looked at it! <br /> <br /> Would I have been scared if my parents knew that I had watched Les Valseuses when I was a child? I would probably avoid the subject with my father, even nowadays, and my mother probably disapproves of it in the afterlife. I do not know if they would like to see him anyway. From stalking and trapping a woman in the building in the first scene to slipping on the mountain roads with saturated eyes, I'm not sure that this film is an insensitive piece of the basket that does not hold not counting the sexual revolution. sexy liberating movie to watch as it realizes you could never be so offensive. <br /> <br /> It's really violent. He has a violent vision of sex, almost no recognition of love. Even when breastfeeding a young baby, it turns into an avid sexual act of exploitation. But the scenario is very erotic and (god I'm so British) exciting! Do they suck her breasts for her own good? It's exploitation. So, why am I getting a wood? <br /> <br /> Fellows go looking for an experienced and older woman, looking for a former prisoner, a mother figure? I do not know. It ends with a really horrible suicide. I described it to my friend JB Nelson, who has the guts of the Cannibal Holocaust, and he went crazy! No maternal love for this film, on the contrary. Mutilation of where the boys started. Why are they pulling the girl in the leg? Why does it come back to them? Should women be punished for learning what is right for men? <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of two films, one I would never have seen, the other making me wish it was not a hard world. Swadept Away / Madonna, what a pile of madness never calculates has never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes a slave to the man and her maybe that Madonna says that everyone respects Guy Ritchie, I am so angry that I can not use punctuation! Once upon a time in America / Leone Leone why does Noodles do it? Destroys the path of joy that we have followed all his life. So close to finally finding love with Deborah. Now they are both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> There is no rape at the Valseuses but a lot of sex and nudity in abundance, of both sexes. Very honest, no titillation. No spooky shags, no perfectly smooth movements in Hollywood Jokes, yes. But there is too much darkness, jealousy and deceit here to call it a sexual comedy. Forget about photographing a naked hairdresser in her leg, because she'll come back and join her with your ex-con's vengeful son and she'll learn how to enjoy him. <br /> <br /> Two things I can not stand are rape movies and prison movies. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God no one will want to look at it now! It's a brilliant film!
