Good evening Mr. Tom is beautifully filmed and beautifully made. It's not completely faithful to the book, but should it be? Not at all. John Thaw hypnotizes under the name of Tom Oakley. Her bumpy transformation into benevolence was so well done, making her more believable than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, it's the most advanced time in Thaw. A young Nick Robinson, who gave him a convincing portrait, evokes a recess traumatized by the violent relationship with his mother. The script and the music were worth it, and you also see Thaw playing the organ. Unbelievable! The most moving scene was Willie hearing about Zak's death, then telling Tom that his dead family had died of Scarlatina. Buy this, you will love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
