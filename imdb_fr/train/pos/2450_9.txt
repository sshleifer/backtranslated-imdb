I watch this show since I was 14 and I love it since. I love this series because it's just funny! You will enjoy this show a lot because it presents something new and fun every day, and my favorite part is when Benny always has his last comments on George after every punch on his big giant head . * Laugh * I laugh and watch it with my friends at home, it would be like watching a funny but short film. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, spectacular. It's a funny and fun family comedy series for everyone and you'll definitely enjoy it - I did it! And if you have not looked at it yet, I suggest you start looking because you would not want to stop watching. Even if there is no new episode, I still enjoy reruns. Always funny. Never dissipate. <br /> <br /> 9/10
