Just after the end of the Second World War, Powell & Pressburger were invited to propose something to try to remedy the fracture that was developing between the United Kingdom and the United States. At the time, there were a lot of "overpaid, over-sexed, and here" comments. In one way or another, they imagined this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of ALL times. He has everything. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very offbeat. <br /> <br /> I can never explain exactly why, but it hits well and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm always sure to cry a few times. <br /> <br /> Was it the beautiful game, the beautiful scenery, the inspired scenario? Who knows. But look at it and you'll see what I mean.
