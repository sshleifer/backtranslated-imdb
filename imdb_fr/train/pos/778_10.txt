I am not a great expert on acting or other details of the film, but this film struck me deeply. I do not think I'll ever forget it. One scene in particular (I think anyone who saw the movie will know which movie I'm talking about) is printed in my brain. <br /> <br /> I also watched the similar film Lilja 4 (as shown below). by a previous commentator). It was also very moving, but not so direct and brutal. If you are sensitive, it will make you cry, but Anjos Do Sol (Angels of the Sun) may stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> It's a very depressing subject, but I think, no, I hope the film will succeed in attracting more attention. <br /> <br /> More people need to see this movie !!!!!!
