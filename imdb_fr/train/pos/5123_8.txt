A 20-year-old unmarried man (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and goes to Houston where he discovers life and love in a Texas honky-tonk. At first glance, it's a modern love story ... Texan. There are plenty of cowboy hats, vans, neon beer boards and references to big belt buckles and rodeos. The music, if not native to Texas, is adapted to Texas, thanks to the talents of Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee and Charlie Daniels Band. And this twang texan ... "everyone". <br /> <br /> The story and the characters are as subtle as the taste of the five-alarm Texan chilli made with Jalapeno peppers. It is enough to abort the film to civilized viewers in favor of a classical classic, with Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman, perhaps. "Hamlet" it is not. But "Urban Cowboy" is spicy and explicit, and I like it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is generally good. The dialogues, the design of the production and the costumes are realistic. the editing is clever. And the casting and the acting are laudable, if not worthy of an Oscar. I would not have interpreted the role he plays in Travolta, but he does a good job ... ditto Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson, among others, are also good at supporting roles. But, cinematography seemed weak. The copy I watched was grainy and sometimes suffered from a red / orange hue, a feature that I noticed in other films of the same period. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the movie does not seem to offer any social or political "message". But I would say that when Urban Cowboy was published twenty-five years ago, it had rather prophetic implications. In 1980, the United States had all kinds of problems, not the least of which were American hostages held by Iran. In the minds of many people at the time, the United States was forced to be rushed. <br /> <br /> This film, along with others of its time, offered something the Americans wanted to see among their political leaders. .. tenacity. "Urban Cowboy" is a very physical movie. The characters on it may not be the brightest on the planet. But they are tough! <br /> <br /> Everything about Urban Cowboy is anti-intellectual. As a vector of cultural expression, this 1980 film was one of the films that heralded a new and challenging era for the United States. He started in 1980 with the election of Reagan. And that era continues to this day, with a president whose mind will probably not be remembered, but his stamina and aggression, traits that seem to attract Americans as surely as the five-alarmed Texans.
