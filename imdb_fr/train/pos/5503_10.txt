The content of this documentary is so powerful that it made me cry. Yes, I tell you tears. This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire us all to defend our rights, to promote the greater good of the community, and to stop cowardly pretending an apology so as not to defy the institution. Chavez represents the weak and the unfortunate in the same way that Bush is the face of big corporations and that capitalism has gone mad. Latin America is in the process of reshaping itself, and the marginalized majority has finally been heard for more than five centuries. Although, in the case of Mexico, the election was clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He is trying to change the constitution to allow him to govern indefinitely. This can not be tolerated. Enough with politics and return to the film; The rhythm is breathtaking at times and deeply philosophical to others. He describes Chavez as a popular hero without fear of challenging the hegemony and dominance of the United States over the resources of the world. If you think that the author is biased in favor of Chavez, nothing prevents you from doing your homework. One of the crucial messages of the film is the interrogation of sources of information, as clearly proven by the wounded snipers shamefully blamed by supporters of Chavez. Venezuela is shaming the so-called American democracy. Hasta the revolucion siempre!
