This series is "something different". Sometimes, the European series are less precise than those in the United States, but this time, the authors have achieved the right goal by creating a fluid mix. Edel & Starck is awesome, he has everything: super intrigue, smart lines, witty, always well delivered, an amazing theatrical timing presented by all the stars and great shots of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It is amusing to see how things are going in the field of justice in countries other than the United States and, for once, to "feel" the way old Europe manages its life. Congratulations to all the actors and the team for a well done comedy that will be a must see in the years to come. See the series in German is superb.
