This short film is a perplexity. I miss the words because it is almost indescribable. Technically exceptional after more than 90 years (the visuals are remarkable and even sometimes breathtaking), it's not something you look at if you like mundane or "normal" things because they're definitely not either. It's a strange group, a gang. It's worth checking, but if things like Ren and Stimpy are hurting your head, you might want to avoid that. Recommended.
