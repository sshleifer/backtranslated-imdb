It takes patience to overcome David Lynch's eccentric, but - to change - an affirmative chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick to that. Although it moves as slowly as Straight's John Deere, when he meets strangers on his pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, regrets and painful secrets, and finally about the power of family and the reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth sums up his career with the most authentic performance of the year, sad and poetic, flinty and benevolent. And Sissy Spacek corresponds to her as her "slow" daughter Rose, who overcomes her own loss by taking care of her father. Rarely has a modern film preached so positively about the family.
