The National Gallery of Art showed the uncut original version of this long-lost film, July 10, 2005. It restores vital scenes cut by censors when it was released. The character of the shoemaker, a man morally endowed in the first censored version of 1933, is presented here as a disciple of the philosopher Nietsze and urges her to use men to make their way to the top. In addition, the old-fashioned end of the original, which I suppose is in the current versions of VHS, is eliminated and the end is restored to its original form. A wonderful film of seduction and power. Hopefully this DVD movie will be reissued so that everyone can appreciate its great qualities. Search.
