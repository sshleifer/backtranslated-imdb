Many things are dated in this episode (as in most episodes of Twilight Zone), such as the incredibly sexist military uniform of the woman. And some things are so incredible, like the ease of access to clean water. Nevertheless, consider the year of creation and the time, and you will quickly understand why this episode is as special as you look at it. There's a good sense of hope, something missing from many Twilight Zones, as well as an interesting female character (despite the fact that she rarely speaks), another thing rare in Twilight Zone. "Two" is a great example of how the Twilight Zone, in just over 20 minutes, could contain more emotions and dramas than most two-hour movies today. And it's a pleasure to see two people who have become American icons so early in their careers.
