Pickup On South Street is one of the brightest movies ever made. Example: When Candy (Jean Peters) begins to rummage through her purse and notices that her wallet is missing, an alarm sounds in the background in the building she is in - as if was an alarm in his head. It's not like in a cartoon - it's subtly woven in the background in a way that strikes you subconsciously until you've seen the movie multiple times and just "click" to that an alarm goes off when she starts desperately going on in her bag. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is at the top of his game as a smart-alec - he's really great - but the film's stellar performance was the first scene of "Moe," the street vendor / informant , played by Thelma Ritter. Later, in his apartment, you do not see a movie, you see a real person. I've never seen anyone "play" so much that I felt like I was looking in a real room until Ritter's performance - up to the way her hair was a little detached when she took off his hat. <br /> <br /> About a million other works * have worked *, the way Lightning Louie picks up money with her chopsticks and clicks Candy's jewelry when she pulls her hand away Moe from his brooch, Moe passing through the dollars and the change of police captain on the chest of the FBI guy - and even the way the captain opens his binder, as if he's been doing it that way for many years . "Pickup On South Street" offers detailed gestures with consummate performances and beautiful nostalgic visuals of the day, such as the panel truck, the boards leading to the cabin, the dumbwaiter, and the unforgettable place, Skip hides its pickings in poached. Wonderful things. <br /> <br /> "Pickup On South Street" is also one of the few movies where, even if the characters are not perfect, you stick to it - maybe because they were somewhat marked by Their past is hard to escape: Skip as "triple loser" and Candy as a young woman who "hit" a lot. When these people behave a little worse than expected, it's as if you're looking for people you never imagined otherwise - and yet you know they're possible because the actors make them so humanly recognizable.
