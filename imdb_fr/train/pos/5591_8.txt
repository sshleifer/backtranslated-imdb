The alternative title of ecstasy, is Symphony of Love; A title that appropriately describes the mood and feeling of the film. Ecstasy is one of the first languages ​​and could very well have been a classic film if it was released at the time of the silent film. This film is a visual delight and is deliberately punctuated to allow the viewer to savor his sensual lyrical quality, presented in an artistic and discreet manner. The director's style is distinctly European. The subject and approach of sexuality were much more sophisticated than those produced in Hollywood at that time. Consider the censorship code in the United States, in the 1930s, which sums it up pretty well. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauties of all time, was a perfect choice for this "Symphony of Love".
