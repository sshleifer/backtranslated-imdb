This is unfairly canceled with Darkwing Duck. Disney has been in decline since Tarzan and we need a show like this to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sounds familiar?). The melody of the theme is also catchy. Of all the bad guys, all of whom are very good at their merits, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo are very similar to the Jungle Book voiceover, which is not a bad thing at all. In fact, it's quite inspiring! The animation was perfect, and the script had a lot of wit that was sorely lacking in animation for years. PLEASE REPORT THIS SHOW! 9/10. Bethany Cox
