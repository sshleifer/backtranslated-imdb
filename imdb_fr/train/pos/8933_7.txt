Claire Denis has repeatedly shown that the film does not need to tell a story, but that it was enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and do what they want. <br /> <br /> Ostensibly, the idea in the context of a very nonlinear film is the old man living on the Franco-Swiss border, a man devoted to his dogs, who always has a lover, but whose cardiac status is increasingly endangering his life. He has a son with a small family who rarely meets him, but when he discovers he needs a heart transplant, he chooses to go to Tahiti via Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and revive a long lost relationship. with a son, he had trained a Tahitian woman many years ago. <br /> <br /> Denis describes this story by using his camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the immensity of nature and the relationships of man vs. animals, etc. Most of the time, the "film" does not make sense, but it is because we try too hard to connect all the points that await us on beautiful images. Life is a little like this: we look, see, observe, integrate, treat and do what we want. <br /> <br /> Using this form of film making (a bit like she did in the strange world of Beau Travail) Claire Denis has developed a signature technique. Whether or not the viewer finds the rewarding finished product, it has a lot to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. It's an interesting and visually captivating film, but many viewers will find too much talk about very little. Maybe watching again will change that. Grady Harp
