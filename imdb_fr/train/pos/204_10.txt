First of all, I do not like almost every Neil Simon movie. But there's something about it that's unique, that attracts me, and I would say it's one of the most entertaining comedies I've seen. The second time I watched it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Ah, fearing that they will sue, he has turned them into men. And how boring would it be if they were just housewives, the show biz star is more fun. Well, it's a personal criticism, and my grandmother still alive at 97 (she even survived the wonderful imitation of Walter Matthau!) Would deny it - but some of you have to find resonance in these characters . <br /> <br /> Secondly, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but one way or another, he has achieved one of the finest secondary performances I can remember (and my deceased grandmother even loved it, although she did not recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character). <strong> A very ethnic flavor, and above, you would laugh or laugh or extinguish this. For me, the pleasure lingers.
