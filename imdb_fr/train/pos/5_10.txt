I arrived in the middle of this film, so I had no idea of ​​its credits or even its title before having examined it here. I note that he has received a mixed reception from your commentators. I'm on the positive side about this film but one thing really caught my eye when I watched the film: the beautiful and sensitive score written in American copeland style. My surprise was great when I discovered that the score was written by none other than John Williams himself. Certainly, he wrote sensitive and poignant scores such as Schindler's List, but his name is usually associated with such bombasticities as Star Wars. But in my opinion, what Williams has written for this film goes beyond anything I've ever heard from him for his tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, perfectly in tune with the plot and the beautiful plot of the film. And another of his latest scores, for Catch Me If You Can, shows even more spirit and sophistication. As for Stanley and Iris, I like educational films like How Green was my valley and Konrack, this one with John Voigt and his African-American youngsters in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc. They tell a necessary story of spiritual awakening, a story that can not be told often enough. This one is a great addition to this genre.
