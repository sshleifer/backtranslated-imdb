It is an animated film in computer graphics based on a series of French animation in 2D. The series was briefly aired on Cartoon Network, but its run was so short that its inclusion in the list of Oscar nominees for this year's best animated film left most people I know "Huh? This is the story of Lian-Chu, the kindly heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brain of the operation, who, along with Hector, their dragon to fire, looks more like a dog. Travel the world offering their services as dragon hunters but never paid. Zoe, the loving fairy of a king who becomes blind, lives in their lives. It seems that the world is devouring a huge monster and that all the knights sent by the king have never returned, or if they come back, they come back in the form of ashes. In desperation, the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater. Zoe, of course, lags along ... <br /> <br /> What else can I say then why does this movie hide under a rock? This is a very good little film that is completely out of the radar, except as an unlikely candidate for the Oscars. It's a beautifully crafted and fantastic film (the world in which it unfolds has floating lands and crazy creatures) that has constantly pushed me to "Wow". The English cast with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi) is top notch. Equally awesome is the scenario that does not denigrate the audience, using real expressions that we do not normally hear in animated films (neither Disney nor Pixar). Everything is really well done. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some songs last too long, but at the same time, it's damn entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, see it. This is one of the best animated films of 2008 and is on my beautiful list of surprises for 2009.
