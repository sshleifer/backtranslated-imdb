We bought the DVD box "Es war einmal das Leben" (German) / "Once upon a time ... Life" (English) for our bilingual children because everyone liked the "Es war einmal der Mensch" (German ) / "Once upon a time ... Man" (English) series (we parents saw him as children) and he even exceeded expectations! The series is very well done, does not show its age, and our children at different ages really like to watch it. At the same time, they learn things that parents did not know until a long time later. The series covers everything related to the human body: organs, senses, blood, infections, antibodies, etc. in animated episodes of 20 to 25 minutes. Subjects that some people may find "reasonable", such as digestion and reproduction, are approached with taste, discretion and user-friendliness (the reproductive episode begins primarily when the baby begins to grow), while being informative and informative. fun. <br /> <br /> Children are usually fascinated by the way their bodies work and, over time, they understand this better in the context of their environment. The format of the episodes switches between the outside world (a family of 2 children) and the inside of the body. For example, in the episode covering infections, the boy accidentally cuts himself off, the wound is infected, and the episode deals with the body's response to this situation. Similarly, episodes about the senses, such as hearing, seeing, connecting what is happening inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode about breathing and the circulation of oxygen in the blood, covers everything. the life cycle, including (briefly) the origin of oxygen (plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best kids programs ever - I would say it's a must for all families with kids!
