I loved this film. I knew it would be full of camp and foolishness as in the original series. I found it very comforting to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar. Anyone who loved the Batman series of the 60s should have taken advantage of Return to the Batcave. You can see that the actors had a lot of fun making this movie, especially Adam West. And I bet he would gladly have taken his Batman suit back if the script had asked him. I talked about this film to several friends who chose not to watch it ... now, they would have liked it. I have all 120 original episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my collection. Thank you for meeting Adam and Burt.
