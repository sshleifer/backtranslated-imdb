I've always been a fan of the series, so I'll admit I'm biased. When the series ended, I thought there were too many unanswered questions. This film seemed like a closure. Seeing all the people I have followed in the last few years was finally very rewarding. I have heard that this is probably the only movie on homicide that can be expected. If this is the case, this is the appropriate way out. This film is sometimes poignant, sometimes overwhelming, but always satisfying. If you are or have already been a fan of the series, watch this movie.
