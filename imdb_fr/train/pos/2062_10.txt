First, I'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow itself is a little excessive. A softer scarecrow perhaps less acrobatic would have made this film a lot less cheesy. But overall, I think it's one of the best B-series movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely gorgeous, if not incredibly beautiful. Although this film does not take into account the important nude factor, there are several other films to see it. But here she has a hard time living, especially towards the end as she moves away from the engulfed scarecrow. Richard Elfman also does a great job as sheriff and stuffed boyfriend. Yes, it's a low budget movie B But of all those I've seen, it's certainly one of my very first favorites.
