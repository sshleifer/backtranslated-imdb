When I first read the plot of this drama, I assumed it would be like Sex and the City, but this drama is like nothing. The characters' stories seem more real and you are more empathetic with the situations. The concept of the drama is similar, with four women out of 30 guiding us through their friendships and relationships with issues and conflicts along the way. Katie the GP is a dark and dark character that you have trouble understanding. She is also the best friend of Trudi, a widow. The character of Trudi is comforting because you can understand the difficulties she has and the fact that she is the only mother of the four children. Jessica is the very determined party girl and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a friendly character and is close to Siobhan, the new wife who, while loving her husband, can not help but look into the eyes of his co-worker. Overall, the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the BBC continues to produce the series, it may well succeed. It does not look like other female dramas such as Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives. This if played well could be the next Cold Feet. In addition, male actors are not bad for the eyes.
