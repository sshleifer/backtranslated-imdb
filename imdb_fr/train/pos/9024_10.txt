Five years later, the survivors of Tenko have returned home and the "Good, that's it" Marion. <br /> <br /> It's now time for the meeting. The whole group is present: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominique and the late Maggie and Alice. The story unfolds is beautiful: it is perfectly written and interpreted, it is as stimulating as it is moving, just like the original series. <br /> <br /> All the questions left unanswered at the end of the series find a neat answer here. From Marion's family to the Joss Health Center, everything has changed in five years and everything has not changed for the better. <br /> <br /> A trip to the Dominica plantation is rich in shocks and truly at the cutting edge of technology. seat tension. There is a real sense of tragedy and disaster as, once again, fate prevails and women struggle for their lives. Dominica finally shows its true colors and some dramas shout on television. <br /> <br /> A lush shoot in Singapore and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends. It's a shame that this is really the end. I could watch everything again. Perfection.
