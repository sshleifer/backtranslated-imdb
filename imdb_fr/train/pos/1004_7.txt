After a brief prologue of a masked man harassing and then slitting an old man on a deserted, urban street in the Australian world at the turn of the century, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they search for 'housing. . They manage to get a loan for a repairman-superior on a chic Sydney street, but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem of their new home. It may be haunted. <br /> <br /> 13 Gantry Row combines a memorable, albeit somewhat clichéd, story with a good-to-average direction by Catherine Millar, in a slightly above average shock. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaws seem partly due to the budget, but not totally excusable at this hurdle. A crucial problem arises at the beginning of the film. The opening "thriller scene" features a moronic edition. Freeze frames and series of images are used to hide the fact that there is not much action. The suspense must be created from the staging, not sophisticated "problem-solving" techniques. There is a good atmosphere in the scene from the place, the lighting, the fog, etc., but the camera should slowly follow the murderer and the victim, passing from one to the other as we follow the street, showing their growing proximity. Follow-up and cuts should be slow. The attack had to be longer, clearer and better blocked. In the current state of things, the scene exudes an impression of "made for television" and reduced budget. <br /> <br /> After this scene, we move to the present and the flow of the film improves considerably. The story has many similarities with The Amityville Horror (1979), although the budget imposes a much more subtle approach. Millar and screenwriter Tony Morphett effectively create many spooky, often dramatic, rather than special effects-oriented scenarios, such as the mysterious man who arrives to remove the old iron slabs, which had been strangely stuck to an inside wall . . <br /> <br /> For some horror fans, the first part of the film may be a little heavy in realistic drama. At least the first half-hour of the film is mainly about Julie and Peter trying to find financing for the house and then settle down. But Morphett writes an intelligent and intelligent dialogue. The material is well done so that you often have as much suspense as the more classic aspects of the thriller that will appear later, especially if you have experienced similar hardships trying to buy your own house. <br /> <br /> installed and things start to get more bizarre, even though the special effects often leave a lot to be desired, the ideas are good. Performance helps to create tension. There is no abundance of death and destruction in the film - there is more abundance of home repair nightmares. But neither danger nor danger is really the problem. <br /> <br /> The problem concerns human relations. There are a number of very interesting character arcs. The house exists more as a metaphor and catalyst of stress in a romantic relationship that can make it bad and eventually destroy it. The fact that it is in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is created between two prosperous yuppies shows that these problems not only affect those who can accuse of external misfortune, such as money or health problems. Peter's character evolves from employee within a company with "normal" friendships based on working in a more desperate person as he becomes subversive, seeking to achieve something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time, we are learning how superficial these professional friendships can be. Julie suffers an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she frees herself from her failing romantic relationship. <br /> <br /> Although 13 Gantry Row never completely transcends its clodé made on television, as a TV movie, it is a very good project with admirable ambitions. All lovers of haunted movies, psycho movies or horror / thrillers with a more metaphorical depth should find their happiness. It's certainly not worth spending $ 30 for a DVD (it was the price charged by my local PBS station to get a copy of the movie after showing it (considering shipping and processing fees)), but it's worth it to rent. worth watching for free.
