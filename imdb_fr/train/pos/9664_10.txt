Bette Midler presents her talents and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I am delighted to have recorded it and to be able to view it at any time. She has what it takes to keep an audience captive. Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will really impress you. The highlight of the series was his song "Stay With Me" from his 1979 film "The Rose". You can feel the emotion in the song and end up having goose bumps. The show will leave you wanting to go out and rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of Bette Midler's albums.
