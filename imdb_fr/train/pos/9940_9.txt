This animated TV series is simply the best way for kids to learn about the workings of the human body. Yes, it's biology, but they'll never say it. <br /> <br /> I really think it's the best part of this stream of "educational cartoons". I remember that you can find small books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton and of course: organs. <br /> <br /> In the same flow, you will find: "Once upon a time the man" who tells the human story of the big bang in the 20th century. There is also "Once upon a time space" (on space and its exploration), but this one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future.
