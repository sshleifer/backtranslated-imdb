A breathtaking and high quality film. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on real events that, as they say, has a sound of truth, this film is very moving and deeply moving. <br /> <br /> An abused and neglected child often becomes capricious in adulthood, one of the failures of his life, whether it's a gangster, an addict or a burden for the society. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher, a young adult in the navy, is troubled. He is about to be a loser. It is recommended in therapy by a psychiatrist and it is this relationship that occupies a central place in the game. <br /> <br /> In flashbacks and therapy, the source and remedies for anxiety Antwones are revealed. <br /> Exceptional performance of all actors. The story is actually a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment. All actors play with conviction and realism. <br /> <br /> One of the messages of the film is the importance of raising children in a decent way. <br /> <br /> The real Antwone deserves success. To have endured malice in one's childhood but to rise above this ordeal shows a magnificent character. <br /> <br /> And to all those who have endured such a torment, but have survived and succeeded: you are all winners. 10 of 10.
