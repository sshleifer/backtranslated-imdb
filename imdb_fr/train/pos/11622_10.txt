Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams play the lead role in this action thriller written and directed by the master of suspense, Wes Craven, himself. The whole film begins with some trouble at the Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem is solved entirely by Lisa Reisert, the hotel manager. She then goes to the airport and that's where the whole problem begins. She meets Jackson Rippner, who does not like to call himself Jack because of the name of Jack the Ripper, if you know him and I mean. Then they get on the plane and, quite crazy, Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other. For the next half-hour, Lisa is terrorized, tormented and terrorized by Rippner. I will not give anything. Then we go to where Jack is chasing Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her dad is doing well, and pretty madly, Rippner is already there. There is almost twelve minutes of violence and intense intensity throughout the scene. In total, there is about 25 minutes of intense action. <br /> <br /> Not only was the film intense, but it featured a big screenplay. As I said, I will not reveal anything because it is so shocking and exciting and somewhat disturbing / scary. And the acting of every character in the movie, even those without lines, was perfectly perfect. It was incredible. Everything was great in this movie! The acting, the music, the effects, the makeup, the staging, editing, writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely the Master of Suspense. Red Eye is really a must and is worth spending your money. You can watch this movie over and over again and it will never be boring. <br /> <br /> I must say that Red Eye is better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA classification: PG-13: Some intense sequences of violence and language <br /> < MPAA Rankings: PG-13: Some Very Violent Violence Sequences and Language <br /> <br /> My Canadian Classification: 14A: Violence, Scary Scenes, Disturbing Content
