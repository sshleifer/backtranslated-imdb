This movie is a super. The plot is very faithful to the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The film begins with a scene where Hank sings a song with a group of kids called "When you fuck your head on the moon." She reminds me of Sinatra High Hopes' song, it's fun and inspiring. The music is always good and my favorite song is sung by King, Hank (Bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. Overall, a good family movie or even a good date movie. It's a movie that you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is beautiful. I love that movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye in the court jester, then you will definitely like this movie.
