I saw this film in August at the 27th Annual Convention of the National Association of Black Journalists in Milwaukee, WI, this is his first public screening. THE FILM IS GREAT !!! Derek Luke is wonderful as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. The real Antwone Fisher did a good job writing the film and Denzel's direction is absolutely right. See the opening weekend. You will not be disappointed.
