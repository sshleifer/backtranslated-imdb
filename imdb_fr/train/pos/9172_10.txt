I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school and it left a startling impression. Here is a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a simple and poor person with a strong spirit and will. Her story, which Bronte told through Jane's eyes, was both sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we watched the adaptation of history in 1983, and it completely upset me. The mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte's original text and the essence of the story, but the actors who portrayed the characters were simply awesome. Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, Rochester's name) have brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone else in their roles. (Other Rochester performances in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion, energy, and tenderness to describe Rochester faithfully, and I say that Timothy Dalton stands out because he owns all of these characteristics in her rendition of Rochester Zelah Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre, but captures brilliantly the calm, firm and passionate nature of Jane, who keeps her in her emotions, like the Jane of the book, at the appropriate moments of her life. While letting fire spread in Jane's, the chemistry that Clarke and Dalton describe in their scenes together is also credible and faithful to Jane and Rochester's dedicated relationship.) Similarly, the supporting actors perfectly match their roles and the sets fit perfectly with the Gothic nature of the story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale. If you have not read the book before, you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.
