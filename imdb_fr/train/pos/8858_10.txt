I must admit that this is the kind of film I would normally avoid, but I rented it mainly because of the stars. I was certainly not sorry. In fact, as you see, I rated it five stars. This film is the perfect combination of clean direction and superior acting. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who have decided to commit the heinous crime of stealing their parents' jewelry. The crime turns terribly bad - begins a review of the three men of the Hanson family. Through a series of flashbacks, we get to know Charles Hanson and better understand the tense relationship between father and son. <br /> <br /> Hank, a younger brother, is basically a mess. He has always struggled to keep a job and is heading in the direction of the wind. Hank is precarious, cowardly and very influenced by his big brother. Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank "nailed to a T" and gives what is probably his best performance to date. He shows us a man who is fundamentally good-hearted but is so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to carry out an important task. <br /> <br /> Andy - on the surface - seems to be a successful businessman, but we soon discover that he is an addict and that he has diverted his funds from his company to pay for his habit. It is Andy who invents the ploy to rob his parents' store, and he asks Hank, who is not very willing, to commit the act. Andy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, surely one of the best actors of our time. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who, on the surface, is a charming businessman appreciated by his acquaintances, but a real slimy ball underneath. He's absolutely perfect for Andy's role or you could say he's made Andy the ideal role with his superior acting skills. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays a common father to his generation. Charles Hanson is not a mean or insensitive man, but he has a bad relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was needed to maintain a positive relationship between his sons and himself. He has always been too quick to criticize and reprimand. He always said that he favored his youngest son over his eldest son, causing a great emotional discord between him and Andy. As we get to know Charles and Andy, the idea that Andy makes a plan to steal his father becomes less incredible. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can not believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of mine. father, and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and myself. Maybe that's one of the reasons I liked the movie so much as the story of a distant and critical father, a more prosperous big brother, and a less-successful younger brother who hit so close to with us. Fortunately, my brother and I have never committed a crime against my parents; I suppose we were made of harsher and more moral things. <br /> <br /> This complex of personalities and actions has been expertly set up by director, Sidney Lumet. At age eighty-three, he still has the chops to give the audience captivating characters and action at the edge of the mesmerizing seat. 12 Angry Men was his first film shot fifty years ago, but he lost none of his magic by showing us characters that will be remembered for a long time. <br /> <br /> The events and characters of Before the Devil Know You're Dead are hard and unattractive, and it's really not a film that feels good. However, it's two hours of ultimate entertainment that I highly recommend.
