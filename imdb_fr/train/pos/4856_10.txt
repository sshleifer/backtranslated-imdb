I saw this film for the first time years ago and continued to watch it several times a year when the opportunity presented itself. It's on my list of favorite movies with some of the classics. If someone tells you it's silly or obsolete, ignore them ... This movie is for anyone who likes to laugh and listen to music. Dance is not as important in this film as in other Astaire films, so that comedy and actors play shine. Watch this movie if you can, it may be light but it's still fun. So I know that many people hate black and white movies, they think old movies can not be really funny, this movie should make them change their minds. No one I know can watch this film without being at least slightly amused. The only problem with the movie: Fred Astaire sings without dancing. He may be a great performer and a capable singer, but it's not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. The comedy is a little clich√© at times, but the vaudevillesque performances of G burns and G Allen are perfect for the play and can satisfy anyone who wants easy laughs. Give this film a chance even if you do not like old movies, this film can make you laugh.
