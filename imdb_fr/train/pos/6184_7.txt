As it is Black History Month and I am reviewing the chronological order of the achievements of many African Americans, I got this film on VHS at the library because Duke Ellington and his orchestra were there. . Their jazz version of Franz Liszt's "Rhapsody" was the highlight of this almost mysterious mix of murders and musicals. Many other numbers I liked were Kitty Carlisle's, especially "Sweet Marijuana", Carl Brisson's "Cocktails for Two", and her duet with Carlisle and Gertrude Michael's, as great as the one that you love to hate. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen are probably going a little too long with their jokes of love / hate as a producer and detective, but they are growing on you. And Toby Wing is a sexy idiot like Nancy, who tries to say something to Oakie but receives a "not now" from him every time. While many characters have a motive for the murders that occur, I was not surprised by the revelation of who did it. And get a load of how naked women are here (although of course their breasts are covered either by their hands or a fragile top). It was very obviously pre-code. Worth a look for any moviegoer interested in this kind of thing. P.S. As a long-time resident in Louisiana, I like to note the fact that someone was born here because Carlisle was originally from New Orleans.
