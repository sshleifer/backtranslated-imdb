Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have just welcomed a baby girl, Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon, Azaria is dedicated to God in their church, overseen by their two older boys. Michael takes a vacation and the family decides to go to Ayer's Rock, one of the most impressive tourist sites in all of Australia. Not being rich, the family camps near the site. After a wonderful first day, Lindy has her Azaria baby sleeping in one of the tents. Suddenly, she hears Azaria cry. As Lindy rushes to the tent, a goofy dog ​​comes out of the head shaking his head. The baby is gone and soon, the dingo too. Although the whole camp is looking for the baby, he is not found. In concluding that she died and that the dingo left with their beloved child, the chamberlains have a hard time accepting God's decision and continuing their lives. Unfortunately, the story was covered sensational media and soon, it is said that Lindy murdered the baby. She is subsequently arrested and tried. How could this happen? It is a beautiful representation of real events that shows how the "rule of the crowd" is not a product of the imagination. The whole country turns against the Chamberlains, partly because they are considered strange. Streep achieves her best performance ever as a Lindy complex, whose resolutely voluntary behavior annoys her at every step. Similarly, Neill does a remarkable job as a hesitant and confused Michael. Distribution is one of the most important of all time, with representations of people across the country being searched in Lindy's case. The costumes, sets, scenario, direction and production are all high-end products. If you have never seen or heard of this movie, correct it immediately. It is not too far from the reality to say that this "Scream" should be seen by all those who are interested in film and the power diverted from the media.
