One of my favorite movies of all time, ever. Simply beautiful, full of human emotion, wit, humor, intelligence. The story develops, as well as the lesson of life, is only a wonderful film in many ways. <br /> <br /> The actors are also fantastic ..... a superb selection of the finest British talent of the moment. I loved them all for the various elements entering the film. <br /> <br /> Italy must be one of the most romantic places to form a story like this: everything about this film works. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
