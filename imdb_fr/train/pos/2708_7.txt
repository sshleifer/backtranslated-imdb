Jackie (Erica Gavin, from "Vixen" and "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"), in prison, after being jailed for 10 or 40 years, for drugging and refusing to give up drugs The last role of the film) must get used to life in the big dollhouse, or at least try it, in this first film by Jonathan Demme. Because of its cheeky nature and ease of observation, I would also say it's one of his best movies, just below "Silence of the Lambs" and "Stop Making Sense", but far superior to all his other films. This minor classic is just campy, shabby and fun enough to be an incredibly good guilty pleasure and, thankfully, it never goes too far in a complete parody of the Women In Prison genre. He almost erased from my mouth the rancid bad taste of "Philidelphia" which ridiculed me. However, the film is not without drawbacks (the show 'nonalent is a huge task to accomplish and lasts far too long, Barbera Steele is sadly lost, among other things little things), but do not let these blame stop you from watching a otherwise nice movie. <br /> <br /> My note: B- <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: 5 minute interview with Roger Corman; Biography of Cast & crew; Original trailer and trailers for "Candy Stripe Nurses" (with nudity), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (with nudity) and "Crazy Mama" <br /> Candy with eyes: Juanita Brown, Cheryl "Rainbows" Smith Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold and a few others all show skin
