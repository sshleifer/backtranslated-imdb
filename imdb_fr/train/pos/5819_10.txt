I liked this movie since its release. I was about nine years old and now 27 years old. I remember playing video games on Sega Genisis. I had so much fun that I would like to show this movie to my son. He also loves Michael Jackson and I know he will love this movie as I loved it when I was a kid. Although he is much younger than me when I first saw him. I can not wait to see it on DVD! I hope it comes out on DVD! Please let it out on DVD! I'm dying to see him again !!! Well, that's my comment. I hope that one day soon I will be able to watch this film again. I like all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
