There are not many movies in the area that make me feel like Stardust did it all the way through the movie. As magical as a fairy tale like The Princess Bride, Stardust is without a doubt the most wonderful fantasy show of the 2000s and 1990s. Exciting, hilarious, with beautiful images and unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro in particular, I encourage anyone to watch this film without smiling. From the first ten minutes of the film, you know exactly how it will end, but it's the journey and not the destination that fascinates the viewer from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Ten stars, not one less decimal.
