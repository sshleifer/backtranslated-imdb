While this movie has a lot of flaws, it's actually a fun 80s movie. Eddie Murphy climaxes during his 80s movies here. His character is indistinguishable from previous films, but his timing is almost impeccable, with partners and perfect foils. <br /> <br /> Add to that the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, this is a fun action comedy movie in rainy weather. <br /> <br />
