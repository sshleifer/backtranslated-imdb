From the beginning, you see that "Anchors Aweigh" is an excellent comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are such a fun team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is beautiful and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the cutest kid actor I have ever seen. If you like the piano, you will be amazed by Jos√© Iturbi. This film was the first to combine animation with real actors and he did it wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number. Without a doubt one of Kelly's funniest movies.
