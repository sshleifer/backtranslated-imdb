When I really started to get interested in movies, at the age of eleven, I had a long list of movies to see. I went to Blockbuster and rented two or three per weekend; some of them were not for everyone and my mother would go crazy. I remember that one of the movies on this list was "A Chorus Line" and could never get it; So now, see that it's a dream come true. <br /> <br /> Of course, I lost the list and I would do anything to get it back because I think there were some very interesting things to look at there. I mean, let's take "A Chorus Line," a play turned into a movie. I know it's something we see a lot nowadays, but at the time, it was apparently a little different. and this film has something special. <br /> <br /> Most of the musicals are shooting today, take the opportunity that the camera gives them for free, to create different sets and bring the characters to different places; "A Chorus Line" was born on a theater stage as a play and dies in the same place as a movie. Following a large audition by renowned choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough conducts a large number of dancers as they attempt to land the position. <br /> <br /> Everything happens the same day: the tension of not knowing, the stress of having to learn the numbers, the silent competition between the dancers ?? And everything happens on the stage, where Douglas puts every dancer in the spotlight and makes him talk about his personal life and his most horrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but they shorten over the hours. <br /> <br /> Like a movie I recently saw, "A Prairie Home Companion," the radio show, Atenborough deals with the problem of continuity here. On or behind the stage, things are happening and time does not seem to stop. Again, I do not know if Atenborough has cut a lot to do that, but it probably does not look like that; and anyway, it's a great work of direction and editing (John Bloom). But in this small step, you wonder what to do with the camera? With a single setting, Ronnie Taylor's cinematography finds the way, taking close-ups of some characters, zooming in and out, showing the scene from a different angle. also giving us a great view of New York. <br /> <br /> At a crucial moment, Douglas says to those who stay: "Before you start eliminating: you're all great and I'd like to engage you all, but I can not." That made me think of today's reality shows, where only singing or dancing talent counts and where the jury always says the exact words must be spoken before some of them leave (even if they are not good). It's hard, you have to imagine; at least here, where all are really great. <br /> <br /> To tell some stories, the characters use songs and, in a second, the scene takes on a new life and is literally "a dream come true". The music of Marvin Hamlisch and the words of Edward Kleban make the theater seamless by showing the feelings of these dancers and allowing them to do these wonderful choreographies of Michael Bennett. The book in the theater also becomes an impeccable and short story by Arnold Schulman; which is very touching sometimes. So, if it's not with a song, it will be with a word; but in "A Chorus Line", it's impossible not to be moved. <br /> <br /> During one of the audition rehearsal breaks, Cassie, a special dancer performed by Alyson Reed, comes on stage to convince Douglas. that she can do it. The words "let me dance for you" never sounded more honest and more beautifully set to music and lyrics.
