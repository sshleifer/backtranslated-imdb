I started riding quite recently and, as all those who have already ridden, I have fallen in love with horses and their world. I rented Spirit on a whim, I was just trying to prepare my life with as much equipment as possible on the horses, and I was surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> What I expected was a Disneyesque movie beneficent. with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> <br /> What I got is an amazing movie, filled with beautiful scenery and animations, and an amazing storyline that has the potential to warm the heart. <br /> <br /> The spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose world collapses around him when he discovers that humans are slowly taking over his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide range of characters, some humans, some animals, all well written and most are nice to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a good story, and who appreciates history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention but that I think is important is that the animals in this movie do not speak. It was a very nice holiday with the animated movies Lady And The Tramp to which everyone is accustomed today.
