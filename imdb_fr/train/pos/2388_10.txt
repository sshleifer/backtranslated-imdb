I LOVE Doodlebops. My son has been watching them for over a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year as well as a concert yesterday (Connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers, but who cares? Are you serious? television is not supposed to teach your kids the numbers or the alphabet. parents should. To move on. Doodlebops can really sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert, you can tell all three that they have beautiful voices and do NOT sing. Imagine, they dance, jump and sing ENCORE. they have talent, the kids love them and I even like watching the show. This show is by far the best TV show for children. AND a rock band for kids. How is this incredible? Why do people say Chad (Rooney) is gay? where did you hear that? Whether he is or not, he is great! Leave him alone. It's not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality with our kids!
