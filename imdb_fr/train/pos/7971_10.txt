It's an excellent movie for all ages. It's the story of three animals that have to find their way home. There is a bit of twisting at the end and mainly throughout the film. You never know what will happen next. This film makes you cry and makes you laugh. You simply do not know what will happen next. The trek to the house is beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes. They producers also spent a lot of money on this film and it shows as well. The animals in this film were well trained and are excellent actors / actresses. Everything in this movie is great! 10 out of 10 all the way! Rent or buy today, I can guarantee you that you will love the whole family!
