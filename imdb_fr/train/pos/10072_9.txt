An unexpected pleasure because I had not heard anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> Ashamed because it deserves to reach a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully human story with a social message nicely said, although predictable in its resolution. Solidly acted by the directors. Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against the gray that captures the film's nostalgic tone. <br /> <br /> My recent incursion into the Chinese movie (Shower, The Road Home, not one less) has been an excitement that I hope to continue exploring. China and its people are an incredible backdrop for filmmakers. "The King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for all those who are interested in the same way in recent Chinese film. <br /> <br />
