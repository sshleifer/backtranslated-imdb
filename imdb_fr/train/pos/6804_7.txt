Do not let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this classic Romy Schneider. This film was shot on a reduced budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to pay the price. For example, England is portrayed as being on the German border. By a will of the Wisp, Victoria and her mother take a vacation in Germany. in buggy alone. They arrived too quickly. It probably could not be solved, but the castle they rented for the film was Austrian. When she learns that she is queen, she goes to the royal hall where the members of the court bow to her. Where are the British citizens outside the castle who claim to be their new queen? Why does not ISBN appear on the balcony to greet her subjects? Small budget! Where was the public aware of these imperfections? I wonder what the critics felt? During the hostel scene, she meets Prince Albert, but she is not thrilled. During the meeting of the gastronomic side of the inn, you will hear music of old famous songs from the American Civil War, such as "My Old Kentucky Home" and "Old Black Joe". What? Civil War songs in the 1830s? Is Romy Schneider described as Scarlet? Where's Mammy? Does Magna Shnieder play it too? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What was going on in Marishka's mind? Well, that adds to the camp. It's an unintentional satire of Queen Victoria's story. That's the only reason you should go get it or see it 03 11 09 correction Germany and England are connected
