A classic Hollywood biopic is the best sense of the genre. Gooding and DeNiro both give spectacular performances in the heart, in both main roles, and the distribution of support is always excellent, with outstanding performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could choose is that Theron's role was useless and embarrassing (not his performance that was good, it's just that the movie seemed to add two useless scenes to hold account of its role.) <Besides, the characterizations, dynamics and action of the real story are fascinating and unforgettable. The evolutions of the main characters and the way they live evolve their beings are characterized in a unique way by the performers. Despite the extreme length of the film, the rhythm remains intact. The score is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> Is this a predictable Hollywood movie? You bet. Mike Leigh should subtract a star, but everyone should enjoy it.
