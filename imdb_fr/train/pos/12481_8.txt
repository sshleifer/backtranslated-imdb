OK, so I do not watch too much horror movies - and the reason is movies like 'Dark Remains'. I caught this DVD (surprisingly feature-rich) and it scared me stupid. In fact, the only extra I missed in the DVD was a new pair of pants. However, the next day I told someone when I realized that I had only really seen 10% of them. The rest of the time, I watched the pizza on my coffee table. I was worried that my girlfriend would catch me if I covered my eyes. The few times I had the courage to look at the screen, I jumped so hard that I decided to stop looking. <br /> <br /> The making of the film is solid and the situation of the characters is really fascinating. The simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump button - it's just a wood, a shack and a disused prison - and LOTS of darkness. The most surprising thing to me was the fact that, while it was clearly not a multi-million dollar production, the makeup effect really looked like! In addition, it is obvious that it is about a film realized by a person having a big love for the cinema. Sound design and music have really used my surround system like many Hollywood movies have never done. I noticed online that this film had won the LA Shriekfest - a major feat, and I guess the festival had seen the obvious talent of the filmmakers - and probably a lot more from this movie than I had managed to do . <br /> <br /> Turn up the lights, turn off the lights, and if you want to keep your girlfriend, order a pizza.
