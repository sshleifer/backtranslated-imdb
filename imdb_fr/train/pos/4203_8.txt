This is yet another serious and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This fast-paced, minimalist director has something unusual in his previous films: a cast with stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley are the protagonists of this film about a group of communist agents trying to escape the secrets of America - and they will stop at nothing to succeed. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Peters on a subway car guarded by federal agents. They know she is a link in a long espionage chain. Not everyone knows the joker in the equation - a small pickpocket (Widmark) is also in the train and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters carries. Widmark thinks it's just another handbag he's searched - only later does he realize the seriousness of what he stole. Now it's Widmark alone - with Commies and the FBI on the right track. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is striking from start to finish. Although Thelma Ritter is not on top of her policy, she deserves special mention. This supporting actress may have had the performance of her life as a pigeon. She rarely had that chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a fallen, sad old lady. <br /> <br /> As for the script and the realization, they are very good- - but with one exception. At first, I liked the way Widmark and Peters interacted. This is one of the few times in the movie that you will see a woman hit in the mouth! Now it's difficult. Later, inexplicably, they become incredibly close - too close to be credible. Yet with so many dramatic dramas and a movie as effective as Black, this can be overlooked. See this film.
