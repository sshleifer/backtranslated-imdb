I love this movie because it showed that they did not kill for pleasure but to save those they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job in describing Ned and Joe. There are some inappropriate fast scenes, but everything is fine, other than that. The tongue is very soft and sometimes I do not even know it's there. This film shows that it is not because they are outlaws that they are vicious killers! I hope people will watch this film and learn about important moments in history like this. One thing that fascinates me about this film is that they found inspiration for their armor in a book that Ned watched! It's also how people remember them, their armor. I hope people will watch this movie and get interested like me.
