Jim McKay directed one of the best movies you'll see all year. The silent simplicity of this film attracts you from the forefront and never lets it go. There is not a wrong note in the whole movie. Everything does not work. The handheld camera is never annoying and is never where it should be. The three young women we follow are still real. There is no political agenda, hidden or otherwise. This is the most basic film, and although it is probably only seen by a handful of moviegoers, it deserves a much larger release. A special hat to Hugh Hefner for providing filmmakers with grant money necessary for the realization of this important film. I can not wait to see what Mr. McKay will do next.
