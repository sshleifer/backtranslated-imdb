I saw this mini-series for the first time several years ago on British television and was immediately captivated by the story. I was rather surprised because I am not a big fan of "Jane Eyre" or "Wuthering Heights"; I consider that the heroine of the first is a perverse person, and that the last job is an ice trap. <br /> <br /> 'The tenant of Wildfell Hall', just like the aforementioned works, is also somewhat depressing. in parts. However, the darkest parts of the film were offset by the excitement of Helen's escape, the breathtakingly beautiful landscape and wilderness of Yorkshire, and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens. <br /> <br /> This film successfully describes the frustrating and restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time. At best, they suffered from a form of minor domestic tyranny, as described by the treatment of women in the Markham family. Conversely, Helen, married to a rich and rich man, is exposed to brutality and humiliation, alternating with long periods of neglect. She flees and experiences a brief moment of freedom but, as a mysterious woman living alone in a rural community, she inevitably becomes the subject of rumors and speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is excellent Helen Markham. Not only incredibly beautiful (despite this terribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most amazing cheekbones, she is also more than able to play the central role in the film. Tara is dignified and distant while allowing us to see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Rupert Graves IS Arthur Huntingdon depraved, but curiously attractive. After seeing it, I could never imagine another actor playing that role. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother, as well as the actress who plays her sister Rose and Simon Carter, a charitable vicar and lover of the good things in life. Finally, I could watch this movie only for Toby Stephens; he is so handsome, sturdy, sexy, sensitive (but not nauseatingly sentimental). I'm not even sure he's a good actor, because my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively! <br /> <br /> If there is a flaw in the movie, it's the use of flashbacks that, in my opinion, have interfered with the flow of the story and is slightly confusing. Other people, who watched this film with me, also had problems with that, and I discovered that I had to explain to them that some scenes were actually retrospective. <br /> <br /> I am extremely grateful to those responsible. to make this movie. Not only did I buy the video (a rare occurrence), but it led me to buy Anne Bronte's beautiful novel. Naturally, it was better than the film, but only by a narrow margin. I recommend anyone interested to watch the movie and then read the book in that order. <br /> <br />
