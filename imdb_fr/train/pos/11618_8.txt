Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. The dream team. This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. A beautiful plot. A good turn. A candy for the eyes. It's one of Wes Craven's greatest movies, apart from "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". This could be the best. The plot is one of the best things about the movie and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), a struggling hotel manager, settles at the end of a Red Eye in Los Angeles. She barely knows she was followed by Jackson Ripner, aka Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They drink a few drinks and end up sitting together on the plane. Later, he reveals that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the Secretary of Homeland Security who lives in Lisa's hotel. And what does it have to do with Lisa. Well, she should move her room upstairs so they can bomb her, if she does not, Ripner will murder her father (Brian Cox). The storyline and narrative really give it extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it. Overall, one of the best thrillers of 2005. Worth a visit. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 4 stars
