A classic cartoon, always nice and fun. It has an interesting intrigue complete with adorable characters. Road Rovers is a show that deserves to be seen, it's about 13 short episodes, and if you manage to see it one day, you should do it. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD containing the 13 episodes. I would certainly buy it if they did it, and if they do, you should buy it too. if you have kids who love dogs, they will love the truckers! Road Rovers should have received more attention during its broadcast, it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was.
