Beautiful and unforgettable, incredibly atmospheric, and brilliantly acted by all. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand what kind of person sweeps this masterpiece and gives the preponderance of voices to 8 (and nine!) <Br /> <br /> This, with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's greatest film. I would say that Long Travel Home is the following, although there is still a long way to go. <br /> <br /> Note: 10. He deserves a 12.
