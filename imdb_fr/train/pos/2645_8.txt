No film caught my attention like this. You see, I wanted to see this movie for over twenty-five years. The only time I saw the movie was as a teenager, the year it was released in 1977. <br /> <br /> What I remember from the movie is that he touched those deepest emotions. so deeply that there is always a crushing desire to look at it again. The plot of this film by the human element of the father / son to research and research is sure to touch every human soul who looks at it. Why has not this film been released from the store and shown as many times as other films of less depth, I do not know. <br /> <br /> PS: Received copy of the film and after watching it, glad to see that my memory was true. The note reflects the content of the film. Would like to watch this film on DVD because to see this 1977 production on a worn VHS tape away from the general quality.
