"Atlantis" is a new step forward for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a movie with a mysterious legend like "Atlantis". I had no expectation for this film, but after watching it, I do not quite understand why this film had such bad reviews. Even in my country, the critics have not been positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but remains one of Disney's best movies, although I doubt that this film ever gets the reputation of "Disney classic". Well, that's another case. It's amusing to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to get away from the reputation of their monstrous films, him, me, I'm joking). <br /> <br /> Well, enough nonsense. "Atlantis" is an exciting film, enjoyable to watch and watch. Even this film is an action movie classified by PG, it is also suitable for children, in my opinion (parents say the opposite, do not kill me for writing this, he he). <br /> <br /> the story is a little predictable, but it does not spoil the movie. The cartoon-inspired animation fits the film and stands out from the usual Disney style. It's colorful, dark and detailed. The sequences of Deep Canvas are quite impressive. The film is also sometimes funny, even I laugh more than laugh through the film. The characters in this movie are also very nice, but unfortunately, there is not enough time on the screen to get to know everyone. Some characters have been left behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> The score of James Newton Howard is absolutely great. It's bold and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive thing about this film is the way they give the Atlantean language a very natural, ethnic and authentic sound. It's really great (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well written, but there are still some unanswered questions in the story. But fortunately, they are not so numerous. <br /> <br /> So do yourself a favor, do not listen to the critics and do not look at "Atlantis" because it's waiting for you ...
