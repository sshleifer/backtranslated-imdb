ROLL is a wonderful little movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old (very well played, by the way) who loves football. Malone's cousin takes him the day before his big match in an adventure rich in twists: two sports bags, a drug lord, hard-nosed bikers, cops and prostitutes ... and the film suggests which. the characters are on which side of the law, what is the contents of a sports bag and even what sex is a key biker. Some of its parts reminded me of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING TOBACCO. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL reinforced three opinions that I already shared before seeing ROLL. These opinions are: 1. I really wish to go to Australia one day. The country and the cities are beautiful and it looks like a cool place for a holiday. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers in the country are Australian. The cinematography in ROLL was particularly impressive. I loved the stylish colors and the lighting of many scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian women are hot!
