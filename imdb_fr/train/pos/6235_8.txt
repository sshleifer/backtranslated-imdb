It's one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies, or at least one of my favorite movies. Most A-R movies feature beautiful dancing but sodic love stories. This is always the tone of the court, but not as pronounced as the other films. <br /> <br /> This film is not only about great dancing, but nice characters and lots of good songs. Music is the central theme here and what's good is the addition of a Rogers solo tap. She was not only a great dancer, but a very pretty woman, with an extraordinary figure. She also dances with Fred, of course, and it's always a fun couple to watch on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> Growing up in the 1950s watching "Ozzie & Harriet" on TV, it was a real The first time I saw that, I saw this young Harriet Hilliard. No surprise that Ozzie fell for this beauty. Even though she had this short hairstyle of the early 30s, I immediately recognized her voice. In this film, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball made brief appearances, but I must admit that I have not released Ball yet. I do not find it, but I know she's here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, aside from some odious mess in the first third of the movie, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - although better in westerns - is nice too. <br /> <br /> It's just a nice movie, that's good and good if you want to take advantage of the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
