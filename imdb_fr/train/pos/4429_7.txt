Personally, I found the film very good, very well played by Tadanobu Asano of Ichi the Killer. I really can not say much about the story, but some parts have been a little too confused and, overall, I found the film too long. Apart from that, the film contained great fights and many fights were shot, many effects were shot, as well as many swords. Another solid effort from Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well, I really can not say more about the movie, but if you're just Asian cinema, it's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers, I'd advise you to rent it, but if you're a dead-fan of Asian cinema, I would say that this must be in your collection of very good Japanese film.
