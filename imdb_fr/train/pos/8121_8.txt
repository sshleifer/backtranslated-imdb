The message of a world on the brink of war is ignored by the masses; The mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it could just as easily represent any nation in the world. When the war finally arrived, the ravages did not continue for five more years, but until 1966, when Everytown was completely destroyed. The "wandering disease" adds to the plague that lasts another four years. <br /> <br /> "Things to come" balances a vision of the world that is both fatalistic and futuristic, in which science resists. a hope for a revived civilization. The concept "Wings Over the World" is a little tacky, although its spokesperson Cabal (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, others will follow. This message is continually reinforced throughout the film and has been convincingly taken up in Massey's closing speech. The insatiable need of man to test the limits of knowledge and success requires a state of mind "the whole universe or nothing". <br /> <br /> The film's images, which show the automation and machines of the second half, are reminiscent of the great silent movie "Metropolis". As each city is rebuilt and transformed by 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth resonates, while the architecture of modern cities suggests that the film's strangely prophetic vision materializes. If the film is mistaken for sixty-seven years, it is the first man's mission on the moon, but in 1936, a hundred year old calendar probably seemed more legitimate than that of 1969. <br /> <br /> > "Things to Come" is one of those rarities in the film, a sobering image. Which side will you face, the forces of progress in the face of uncertainty or the maintenance of the status quo? This is not an easy question because both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable results. Those who choose to be passers-by may be swept away by forces beyond their control.
