I waved at the bar, expecting it to be a hot beer on a sweltering Texas day, but I was pleasantly surprised. After suffering the "Saturday night craziness," I had no desire to see a recovery in a South Texas backyard ... and I did not do it. John Revolta was good as a jealous redneck, Scott Glenn was well presented as an out-of-the-box thuggie and Debra Winger was, as always, a delight. * Love this woman * Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and it comes from a guy who does not support the sound of country music]. A funny movie all the way.
