I only saw this film once, on television, and it was not repeated. It is strange when we consider the waste that is repeated again and again. Horror movies are usually a source of fun for me, but this one really scared me. <br /> <br /> DO NOT READ THE FOLLOWING BIT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM AGAINST <br /> <br /> What is most frightening is when the townspeople pursue the preacher where his woman is almost dead (they had poisoned her). Anyway, he asks who the hell are you. One by one, they give their true identity. The girl who pretended to be deaf to bribe and seduce him said, "I am Lilith, the witch who loved Adam before Eve."
