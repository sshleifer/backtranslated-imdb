First of all; I am a fan of Modesty's and I read comics since I was a child and I found the previous films on our heroine unsatisfactory, but where they fail, this one is ROCKS! <br /> <br /> Well, here we go: Ms. Blaise works for a casino, a bunch of burglars introduces herself and she starts playing for the life of her friends. If the thief wins a trick, she will have to talk to her about herself. If she wins twice, one of the staff becomes free. (That sounds stupid, yes, well, I'm not very good at explaining that either ..););) <br /> <br /> She talks to him about growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends, to help him old man in the refugee camp and how they escape, respecting the rules of nature. They hunt for food and he teaches him to read and to fight. At the approach of civilization, they are caught in a war and are taken for rebellions. They shoot at them and the old man dies, leaving her to join the city alone. <br /> <br /> Then she meets the man for whom she is now working at the casino and the story ends. <br /> <br /> What follows is that there is a great fight and the line is totally cool. Alexandra Staden is a modest terrifying Blaise! Just as modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as the comic. <br /> <br /> Feels awkward, also hear Modesty speak with a slight broken accent, but this is irrelevant, because the comic book can not speak out loud, but must certainly have a somewhat existing. (Not to mention that it's odd that everyone speaks English in the Balkans ..) <br /> <br /> The acting is really good, even the child who personifies young Blaise must applaud! <br /> <br /> My favorite part should be where she rips her dress to kick the ass of the stupid thief! Absolutely awesome! : D I can not wait for the real adventure to start in the next movies! <br /> <br /> Look at it, you will not be disappointed!
