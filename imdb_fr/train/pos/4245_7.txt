If the themes of The Girl From Missouri seem familiar to you, you should do it. Indeed, Anita Loos, who wrote the screenplay here, also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in this film, Jean Harlow will accept any type of means men jewelry. <br /> <br /> And these are men of means that Jean Harlow seeks. She leaves the country house run by her mother and stepfather because she has decided that the best way to make an easy life is to marry her. Her talents as a choir girl are limited, but she can exchange this beauty. <br /> <br /> Her odyssey begins with her friend Patsy Kelly and her guest performing at a millionaire party. Lewis Stone. But without Jean's knowledge, Stone has one last attempt before being made because of the money he does not owe. However, she still tells him a few trinkets, as noted by fellow millionaire Lionel Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Lionel is having fun until Jean sets his sights on his playboy son, Franchot Tone. After that, he is no longer amused and he tries to stop Jean from climbing up the family tree. <br /> <br /> The Girl From Missouri went into production with an adaptation of The Code, which was therefore subject to special censorship. I feel like we would have seen a much more risky movie. Nevertheless, Jean Harlow as a younger and sassy version of Mae West is still appreciated. What a comical talent this woman had to see The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss suffered by the film world three years later. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Patsy Kelly's cast with Harlow was undoubtedly influenced by the success of the short films that Kelly made with another famous platinum blonde, Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry between Patsy and Thelma. Todd would also die a year later in an unprecedented accident / suicide / homicide, with no satisfactory explanation ever given. <br /> <br /> Do not miss The Girl From Missouri, shiny and sassy, ​​must come from all these sparkling jewels.
