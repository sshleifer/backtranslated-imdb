I may have seen an episode or two when the show aired originally, but when I watched an episode on netflix, I was also hooked. I watched the whole series in 2 days. :) I really liked Gary Cole's character. First, it is completely reprehensible, then you start to like the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! His friend Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson and Satan is awesome. Charming, charismatic, intelligent, and uh kind of dangerous and by "kind of" I mean "really". I want to be like Him when I grow up. Lucas Black is great too. The accents are great too. Anyway, I thought it was one of the best TV shows of all time and you owe it to yourself to see it.
