Do not listen to fuddy-duddy reviews, it's a gem! The rich young Joan and her brother find themselves penniless after the death of their father - and now they have to work to make a living! Naturally, she becomes a journalist and he, just as naturally, pilot for the crowd! By senseless coincidences, their careers meet head on, thanks to the gangster Clark Gable. Meanwhile, a moonlit underwear can swim for a group of pretty young things and Joan can do some daring dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam shovel). <br /> <br /> But none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - it's really fun to live those wonderful days of pre-code, when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks great and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity (thank God, she stopped the dance!). Gable is remarkable as a sticky gangster - he was not yet a star and therefore did not have to be the hero. Glad to see him play something different. And William Bakewell is excellent as a poor confused brother. And there's some great editing and action shots courtesy of director Harry Beaumont, who moves the piece with a frantic pace - and an occasional nod to the audience! Very funny!
