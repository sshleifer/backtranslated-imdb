The other night, I removed it arbitrarily from the library, having no idea of ​​the cult or the influence of the film, or the current staging of this musical. (!) sad, and yes, a little exploitative despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. The expanded edition of Chriterion is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see in the little Edie the fall of a class that has somehow disappeared, you can also hear it in the old movies of Jackie O; people do not talk like that anymore. I think that as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information on how the house fell into disrepute. Old Edie seems at least always aware of what is happening to a certain extent. could not she see the once spectacular house disintegrate? <br /> <br /> Yet the subject of the film is the life that the two women have built themselves, a real life act of Tennesse Williams. It's worth your time.
