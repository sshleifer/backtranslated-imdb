WAQT is a perfect example of chicken soup not quite for your soul. Unfortunately, the broth has lost its current taste because of the dilution and the excess liner that have been. <br /> <br /> What is surprising and disappointing at WAQT is that it comes from a director who did not take the usual clich√©s. Hindi cinema in its first venture, but in its second release gives way to all forms of stereotyped films. While Vipul Shah was convinced that he was showing something as unlikely as blind people robbing a bank in AANKHEN, he simply can not create life in all WAQT packaging that is based on something so conceivable. than a father-son relationship. Adopted from a play in Gujarati, Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT has a sensible plot with a social message to back up. A mature look at the father-son relationship, a father's unconditional love for his son, and a son's responsibility to his family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who founded his entire empire, leads a rich life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Their only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar), never needed to fight for anything because he did everything custom-made and spoon-fed in life. The care of Ishwar only spoils him more. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams of becoming a superstar but does nothing to make her dreams come true. In the meantime, he marries his ladylove Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes the wedding will make Aditya a more responsible man, but he is disappointed. Aditya is always at her best level leading a carefree life. <br /> <br /> The endurance limit collapses when Ishwar expels Aditya from his home. The sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father towards him and his wife, who is now waiting, disconcerts Aditya. He has no choice but to fight for the livelihood of his wife and future child. He begins to become an independent man, but the relationship between him and his father is growing more and more. <br /> <br /> The story is simplistic while the uncomplicated scenario has a very basic approach. One can easily identify and relate the credible characters of father and son. If you are not one of the two, you may have at least met people who look like them somewhere in real life. <br /> <br /> Add to this the ease of realization of the scenario of the director Vipul Shah. With a family affair like this, any other director in his place would have added a ton of melodrama to the proceedings, in accordance with the Bollywood film laws of family dramas, turning the film into a compulsive ripper. However, Shah excels in the effortless management of emotions during most of the film. <br /> <br /> The clear example of his unpretentious direction is palpable in the scene preceding the interval where the father expels the son of his house in a rather frivolous manner. The goal of the scene is achieved without erasing the brain of the audience. Ditto for the scene of the second half where the son of the father, now separated, has a casual conversation. This differentiates WAQT from KABHI KUSHI GHUM or EK RISHTAA and places it even at a high level in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after getting all the points of distinction, one wonders where WAQT still fails in? The problem lies in the fact that, although WAQT differs from the others in its treatment group, it is failing in terms of packaging. What to say on the part of the director in song-n-dance from time to time in the first half. There is a little Johar shaadi song, a Holi song a little Chopra, a dandia father son disco song, a dream song and a dream song come true that make the audience yawn enough. Imagine this ... the father has just ousted the son from his house and the son dreams of a song in the Moroccan mountains with his wife. Not in its place! Out of reason! and the public outside the seat. <br /> <br /> The film hangs in the first half and the story begins only in the second half. The director wasted WAQT too much on unnecessary items. The sequence of dog chases that is so talkative is not bad, but does not buy either. However, Akshay Kumar's taandav dance is simply ridiculous. Imagine that he qualifies for the hunt for stars in the film with this (hilariously) hilarious histrionic. Add to this the culmination of the final of the star hunt where the son overflows with emotions. It's so archetypal! In addition, the layout could have been reversed to hide the reason for the father's change of attitude towards his son. <br /> <br /> The music of Anu Malik is good but useless in the procedure. The work of Santosh Thundiiayil is sufficiently competent, although not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia has developed good dialogues for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav very effectively make up the light moments of the film. While Rajpal Yadav surfs with his histrionic comedy films in many films lately, he is under-exploiting his character and is completely restrained. His impassive expressions are perfectly complemented by the excesses of Boman's drama. <br /> <br /> Shefali Shah is convincing in the role of the mother. Not to be taken for censorship, but she is flawless at the same time playing and "looking" at her character. Priyanka is beautiful and plays her role well. <br /> <br /> Of course, the major applause deserved is Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is particularly expressive in the scene where his father adulterously reprimands him intentionally to make him aware of his responsibilities. Although Bachchan is a little dramatic in some scenes, its brilliance resonates throughout the film. <br /> <br /> To sum up, WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritious, but the final recipe is not the same. It's not that appetizing.
