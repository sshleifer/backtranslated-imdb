Friendly development of the characters in a rather cool environment. Being a man, I am probably not qualified to fully understand him, but they are very successful in establishing the restrictive environment of the Victorian era from the beginning. It is not as dark as it has been and the treatment of women has probably been even more severe. What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the main characters. Everyone has their own "thing" with which they fight. Once out of the rain and cobwebs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I liked in this movie is that he did not choose cheap comedy when he could. He did not try to hammer us a lesson. People who seem totally worthless are really well developed human beings who are lucky to see the light. I had a little problem with the character of Alfred Molina having such an epiphany so quickly, but in this world, it had to happen. Play well all around with something positive in the lives of some pretty good people.
