Wow! Stacy Peralta gave Dogtown and Z-Boys an equally remarkable documentary on the history of wave culture in America. By assembling insider archive footage and interviews with surfing legends, we are transported into the bold, free-spirited life of the early pioneers whose passion for sport has spawned an industry that now touches millions of people. <br /> <br /> It's becoming more and more to know these icons and their stories that gives the film its warmth. You can feel the respect that Peralta has for this group as we hear stories of Greg Noll leaving a group of marvelous surfers on the beach to singularly challenge the 50-foot waves off the north coast of Hawaii. Or Jeff Clark, surfing alone for 15 years on the extremely dangerous Maverick off the northern coast of California. It was later discovered and became the surf destination in California. And the story of Laird Hamilton's storybook, today's surf icon. Hearing Greg Noll say with respect that Hamilton was the best surfer of all time, I had chills in the back. <br /> <br /> (By the way, Noll, Clark and others were at the Sundance screening.) Noll humbly described himself as an old man, He is deeply moved by his welcome by the audience and by the movie He and Clark were as likeable as the film itself.) <br /> <br /> The riding giants pay tribute to these extraordinary athletes while rewarding us with a glimpse of the magnitude and terrifying power. waves they seek to conquer, the heart-rending lows needed to get in, and the almost unfathomable combination of adrenaline and fear that surfers will feel every time they face a swell of monsters. <br /> <br /> All this, and the film has more. For those of us who did not live in California in the 60s, we have a glimpse of the impact of surfing on American pop culture. (And, to my surprise, the impact of Gidget on surfing!) Peralta also addresses some of the technical aspects of the sport and the history of equipment innovation. I'm not a surfer, but like the rest of the Sundance audience, this movie totally captivated me. Peralta claims the title of Big Kahuna of the American documentary.
