When I bought my Toy Story tape when she came out on Video after it was released in theaters, I saw a trailer for that saying about the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew it was going to be a good feature! I was right! The life of a beast like Toy Story is a beautiful story, great characters and excellent animation. My favorite characters are Sun the rhinoceros Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is where Slim, the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) raises Hemlich trying to distract the bird and Hemlich is like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a good worm tasting on a stick and that Slim is like I'm going to break! I will break! I just died laughing at this scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, although I know that many people consider it to be the worst Pixar movie of all time! I do not know how you could hate a Pixar movie! I think these are all very good movies! Good job PIXAR!
