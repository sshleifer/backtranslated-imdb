I usually do not like Emma Roberts so much, but after looking at Nancy Drew, it changed my mind a little bit. The actors in the movies made it all exciting and fun. Most of the time, when you watch a mystery movie, you can solve it before the middle of the series, but in this film, it's as if you were there. The clues must be compatible so that you can finally understand the crime. I am always amazed at how she discovered it. The whole movie was really clever and the people who watched it with me loved the movie. The clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I do not think there will be another movie like this before the release of the sequel. I give it a new one because popular girls do not really seem to have the right role, but they always make me laugh. It was a very good film and a great mystery. I highly recommend watching it.
