Hello: <br /> <br /> I heard about the loss of a colleague who had obvious differences of opinion about entertainment, he loved it. Well, I watched an episode or two at the beginning of the season and I got bored, so I fixed it. After a few years, I came across lost; bored with the current science fiction fare. Wow was I surprised. Can you say that gravity is good, I got myself. The pace and the scripts are very good, some of the forward / backward flashes are so good with the shinier, but overall good characters. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are definitely immature, very spoiled and immature asshats. Kate a little higher than them, Juliet was much more elegant than Kate. Mr. Eko was underestimated and at the level of Charlie if not more, a pity they were both dead. The guy dressed in black who talks to Jacob (way back) is a real curiosity. Overall, a large series very stratified: looking for more. <br /> <br /> greetings
