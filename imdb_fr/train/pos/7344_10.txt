In my opinion, this is a good example of a film that could have been much better if it had been short 10 years earlier. I doubt that modern technologies would take advantage of modern technologies, but it would have been much better if it had lasted at least 90 minutes instead of 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> Artists and animation did a great job. In my opinion, this movie can boast of the best wallpaper and one of the best characters. The animations are extremely fluid and realistic. Throughout the movie, you believe in the world you see, so everyone has done a great job. He can also boast of one of the sexiest, if not the sexiest, female animated characters who easily make fun of the typical anime beetroot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are some bad things about this movie that will not make it so attractive at the moment. First, the plot and performance are comparable to contemporary adventure movies and are really out of date with modern standards. Secondly, because of the duration, an additional 20 minutes of dialogue would be very useful. Finally, the decor is not very popular at the moment. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a great alternative to a new short on Conan the barbarian, but not to a novel.
