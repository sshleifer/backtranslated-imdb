Tip number one - read the title like "The time of the crazy dog" or maybe dogs. It's a very good set (watch the actors and praise it - you know you're already curious), and the director for the first time, Bishop, gives them a chance, taking his time, letting the characters interact and chew the decor while they wait - without enthusiasm - the return of the "big boss" and the revenge that will ensue. <br /> <br /> For some of us, the highlight of the event is to see Christopher Jones after his self-imposed exile movies; it remains an imposing cinematographic presence. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor involved, this is the party of the meeting "Wild in the Streets"!
