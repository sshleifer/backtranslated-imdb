I saw this in the early 70's (when I was 16) and despite the lengthy preparations, meetings, riots, etc., once the desert section started, everything fell into context and I loved it. (It's still the case, it has aged very well.) At the time, I was in what appeared to be a tiny minority. All the critics seemed to focus on lack of action and narration. Fortunately, I am no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> This cleverly shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political breakdown, the turmoil, the confrontation, the brutal repression, the commercialization and the deceit that await us. <br /> <br /> The appreciation of this masterful film has grown, and I am happy about it.
