Ghost Woman (1944) Director: Robert Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), after a heinous fight and a split with his wife is trying to drown him. pain at the local watering point. There, he sees a woman in a similar emotional state and, looking for a little camaraderie, invites her to a show in a club so that both her problems are solved. She accepts, but only if they keep their names for themselves. When Scott gets home, he finds the police waiting to interrogate him. His wife was murdered. Where were you at 8 o'clock tonight, asks Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi, right? Only he does not know the name of the woman. And the bartender remembers Scott but not the woman. The taxi driver either. Neither the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) at the club. Even the club dancer, whom Scott clearly surprised by looking at the woman (they were wearing the same hat), will not recognize that there was anyone with him. Something is happening, but anyway, Scott is unable to defend himself in a trial and is sentenced to death for the murder of his wife (on the most fragile "evidence" in the judicial history of Hollywood). It is to his faithful secretary, Kansas (Ella Raines), joined by a friendly inspector, Burgess, to find the real assassin before Scott's execution. <br /> <br /> The Phantom Lady is built on themes that recurrence, almost compulsively, in Woolrich's work. For example, the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man. In addition, there is the character who becomes mentally helpless by the death of a lover or a wife, as can be seen in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black. This may leave the viewer feeling like he is walking on a well-worn floor. But in the right hands, feverish intrigues, desolate dialogues, narrative inconsistencies are unimportant. Fortunately, the Phantom Lady was guided by loud hands. <br /> <br /> This is the first black of Siodmak. He would continue to distinguish himself as one of the foremost practitioners of style (The Killers, Criss Cross). He is fortuitously associated with the director of photography Woody Bredell (they would be gathered during the Christmas holidays and The Killers). There are great stories told in the camera. In one blow, the deterioration of the mental state of a character appears while sitting in front of a three-way mirror, suggesting multiple personalities. The same character, who is an artist, has the self-portrait of Van Gogh with the bandaged ear hanging on the wall of his apartment. But what Siodmak and Bredell really do in Phantom Lady practically creates the look of black. Released very early in 1944, everything is there; the wet pavement, the pockets of atmosphere and fear, the sharp contrast between the b & w, the extremely expressionist versions of reality (when Kansas visits Scott in prison), the discordant rays of light, and so on. It's a fantastic picture to watch. <br /> <br /> Franchot Apart from that, the actors, as well as the subject and the relative inexperience of the director (and presumably the budget), suggest the ambitions of the movie "B". I thought Tone was a little hammered. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not up to par, and is rather weak in some scenes. Ella Raines is especially good (and pretty). Her "sex scene" with Elisha Cook Jr. is so delusional that you have to see her to believe her. Another unusual scene is where Kansas is looking for the bartender to question him. This equates to a hunting scene, as it drags it relentlessly through the streets, with a stop at a subway station. There is very good tension in there. <br /> <br /> *** out of 4
