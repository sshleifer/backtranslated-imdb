This film is outrageous, funny, scathing, sophisticated and never goes out of style. 99% of Hollywood movies do not even target. Paul Bartel should be recognized as one of the great directors of this time or any other era. He is the American Renoir & Bunuel _ combined !!! Happy to have the videodisk.
