Take 4 couples whose relationships were already difficult and install them on an island paradise where they will be tempted by 26 singles. It was the principle of the show, simple but scandalous and amusing. Leave it to Fox to cast morals out of the window and let debauchery flow. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the series is that there was no question of people conspiring and manipulating themselves for a cash prize. It was lust and temptation, pure and simple, and the ultimate test for a relationship. <br /> <br /> People either liked the show or hated it. It was a bit like slowing down to watch a horrible road accident. You know you should not watch, but you can not help but watch. Drama aside, there was a lot of candy for the eyes.
