The animation always seems to be marginal. In Japan, this may not be the case, but in Europe and much more in the United States, the animation carries a big label "KIDS". France is probably one of the most comical and liberal countries, with classics such as Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon, etc. (If you've never read them, it's not too late - there's no age limit and they do not carry the DC or Marvel nerd stigma). It seems natural that a film like this goes out in France. This suits my preconceived image of the French as talented filmmakers, passionate about art, anti-American. Fortunately, there is also "A dark scanner" to remove this view - it seems that the art is international enough. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as you may have understood, Renaissance is artistic and French. If you are a normal person, it will scare you. There is no need for that though! Under his cool and elegant appearance, there is a good thriller and a good film as a whole. <br /> <br /> That was one of my fears for this movie. It's so easy to turn the spectacular animation into gimmick, much like Sony & C: o with their Pixar scams. I was expecting a confusing film, sometimes boring and not very engaging, but fortunately I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would have liked the Neo-Black movie, but it was good that it's worth it too. NOTE: I saw the French dubbing which was OK as far as I could see. English could be more interesting than with Craig and all the rest. <br /> <br /> A last word of praise to the animation. It was great. Futuristic solutions, well designed, very photographic, intelligent solutions (Eyes for example was very beautiful, which is difficult to do) and so breathtaking that I wanted to burst "It's really impressive!". Once again, I really like animation and I appreciate the efforts of the studio. My verdict is a bit biased. <br /> <br /> A good movie, anyway, definitely lives beyond its "gimmick".
