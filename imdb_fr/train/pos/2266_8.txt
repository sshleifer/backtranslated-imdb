It takes a while to get used to Nick Nolte's Nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as the famous intercontinental playwright. Once past the bar, it becomes a fascinating story of a man who loses while trying to do good. <br /> <br /> Nolte, an American, moves to Germany, marries a famous actress and satisfies success in all respects until the war is about to break out. He is visited by a jovial American, John Goodman, who convinces him to accept an anti-Semitic radio station for the Nazis. Nolte has no politics but thinks it's a challenge to write an almost impossible role and play it yourself. Another US secret agent will modify Nolte's radio scripts - by inserting a cough here, a sneeze - which will serve as a code for transmitting intelligence to the Allies. There is a trap, however. No one will know about Nolte's real role as an American agent, with the exception of Goodman, Donovan and Roosevelt himself. If he finds out one day, he will be refused by the Americans. <br /> <br /> Nolte is making good progress and her perverse programs are very popular in Germany. His beloved wife, Sheryl Lee, knows nothing about what's going on and does not care. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly calls "a nation of two". The war ends and trouble begins. He is captured by bitter Americans because of his betrayal. They beat him and left him in the mud. He is rescued by Goodman, his "fairy godmother," who sends him to an anonymous life in Greenwich Village and sends him some money from time to time. <br /> <br /> In 1960, he managed to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor, the painter Alan Arkin, who also lost his family and claims that both now belong to a secret fraternity. But his location and identity have somewhat fled and he is more or less adopted by a group of former Aryan racists, led by a dentist and a priest. Its facade and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. He is beaten insane by a former GI. But miraculously, his beloved wife is returned by the ancient Aryans. Another problem: it turns out later that it is not his wife, but his younger sister who has loved him since adolescence. <br /> <br /> According to his findings, he was typing his memoirs in an Israeli prison in 1967 before his trial. crimes against humanity. It's not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Nolte can speak with the occupant of the cell above his prison, but does not see it. It's Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann looks pretty nice. He warns Nolte that hitting fifteen hours in a row is a bad habit. "It's important to relax, you have to learn how to relax." Nolte bursts out laughing and shouts, "That's the way I DO here." The film is filled with such ironies. At one point in their relaxed conversation, Arkin tells him that "despite everything, I still think people have a good heart." I do not know if the film was a commercial success, but if it was not, it's the kind of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of moviegoers who could not -being never heard of Anne Frank, let alone be supposed to be final statement in her diary. <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is an adult film, and for adult patients. The story goes slowly, there is very little violence, no car chase, no shooting, and people do not seem to be subject to manic pressure of speech. A good part of it will probably pass in front of viewers who will not open up to its deliberate approach. Nolte calls the war relationship between him and his wife a "nation of two". It's a rather compact sentence. No doubt everyone could propose a simple definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional impact. <br /> <br /> The story is about a man who loses everything - his ability to write, his identity, his wife (twice), his only friend, his country, his self-esteem. At one point, he stops walking down a busy New York street and stays there until nightfall, when he is taken away by a curious police officer. The reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go. What Vonnegut describes is much more than depression. I do not want to sound condescending, but it's the kind of feeling that is hard to understand in your youth. Adolescents may want to think that they know what keeps Nolte in this place, but it really requires maturity and the accelerated sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring. <br /> <br /> Do not forget Robert Frost's line that the house is the place when you go there, they have to take you? Well, no place will take Nolte in.
