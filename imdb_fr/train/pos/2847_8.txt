As we know, anthology films do not please the American public very much (I guess they prefer a standard plot). New York, I Love You, is the second phase of a series of anthology films about cities and their people. The first was "Paris, J'Taime", which I really appreciated. The film was composed of several segments, each written and / or directed by a different director (most of whom were French, but there is a very amusing segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like 'Paris', this one is also an anthology directed by several directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.), as well as' Paris'deals with New Yorkers and why they love The City in which they live. It features leading actors such as Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom and Ethan Hawki, as well as veterans like James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really do fly, and some do not (although I guess it will depend on individual tastes - I will not ruin it for anyone else by revealing the ones that worked for me and the ones that did not work). The word is that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece are they out of the question?). Spoken primarily in English, but contains elements in Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. Filed 'R'by MPAA' for strong language and sexual content
