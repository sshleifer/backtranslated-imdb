I just read the novel "Mother Night", I have the DVD for a while now and I look at it from time to time. Few films that I own and have seen made me think and question as much as Mother Night, I am amazed by the brilliance, not only Vonnegut, but also the translation of its text on screen. <br /> <br /> not rent or watch this movie on VHS, this must be done on DVD, and it must be accompanied by the director's comments on the film. To see how they have taken a fairly simple story, yet complex in its substance and in its dialogue, and have worked so well, I think that any spectator will be amazed. <br /> <br /> The omissions in the film are few text, and does not take away much, the film might as well be the book, and is the best adaptation I have ever seen. I highly recommend the book and the movie together that it's no use saying just go watch it. <br /> <br /> It will change you if you do it.
