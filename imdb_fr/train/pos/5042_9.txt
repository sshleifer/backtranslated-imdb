The synopsis of this film explains very well what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Well shot. Hard to believe it was Bill Paxton's first film, although some plans look EXACTLY like a storyboard version. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, there are some really attractive shots that show real imagination on the part of Paxton. <br /> <br /> It's a solid story that has great twists in the end, many of them, all credible, fun and, better yet, obscure enough to make real twists. <br /> <br /> The children actors of the film also do an excellent job. I'm generally suspicious of movies in which children play the lead roles, because they too often reject Nickelodeon, but these two kids do a good job. <br /> <br /> This film is not gore. It's not very scary. But it's very, very scary.
