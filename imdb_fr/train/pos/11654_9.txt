I agree with the comment above, I love realism, and in many movies (not just those on eating disorders), producers seem to forget it. They take a problem every day and create an extremely dramatic scene, then come the end of the film, everything is perfect again, which I do not like because it is not the reality. Do not mean that things can not get better, and not mean that things are not going in this movie, but it does not spend most of the film creating all these problems, and at the end of the film everything is perfect again. . When people have eating disorders, people just do not recognize it and want to get better, and then life is beautiful, it takes time, and I like how, in this movie, we grow up with the characters , we go through the difficulties with them, better and worse, because it's a very important part of the film. It affects the minds of people with eating disorders and shows the complications and pain in a very realistic way, which I loved. I also like the way it manifests itself. People with eating disorders experience secrecy and betrayal when they experience eating disorders. It is scary to see how people react when they discover it, especially if they approve of it. I thought this movie was very touching, beautiful and well told, and one of my favorites.
