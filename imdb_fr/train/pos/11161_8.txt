It's a very funny movie! I do not know if it translates well into other languages ​​or not. However, I think men around the world can relate to "Frank" and his thoughts to a certain extent! These ideas are extremely fun and women will also enjoy this movie, I'm sure! <br /> <br /> All the cast members behave well, and this film could have been a huge hit around the world if it had been shot in England or the United States. But for those of you who have the chance to understand Swedish, you will be happy! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
