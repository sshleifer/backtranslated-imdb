Each child is traumatized by growing up and the active imagination of each child has made the most of it, but for Jake (Anthony De Marco) of Clint Eastwood's upcoming film CHANGELING - which looks like Henry Thomas around 1982 - the combination can be deadly. <br /> <br /> A lonely six-year-old whose imagination is in full swing when he is discouraged to learn that his parents are arguing, Peter (Sean Bridgers, deceased "DEADWOOD") and Jules (Brooke Bloom , "CBS: Miami") suddenly decides to divorce, leaving him to himself and releasing a new tenant ?? a zombie in his closet. <br /> <br /> Jake gets this seed planted by playing with his neighborhood friend, Dillon (Matthew Josten), who provides him with a print of the FAQ on zombies on the Internet. Jake is so convinced that we try to find him ?? and his family ?? he starts developing an action plan to protect them before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Independent newcomer Shelli Ryan ?? who wrote and directed ?? mixes the national drama with elements of horror, but the first prevails (intelligently) on the second, with a decent story carried by the actors' game (De Marco is the rare breed of child actor where he is a CHILD and not an 'actor' - all his nuances are very obvious to the awkward, shy and introverted child that many can also relate (I can certainly) Bridgers makes her unfaithful husband empathic by realizing that he really loves his son, while that Bloom has the most difficult job of building sympathy as a somewhat insensitive mother - it does not help when Dillon's mother, Ruth (Monette Magrath, who looks like Laura Dern), constantly feeds her with implicit information that creates a gap between Jake and her father, Magrath also has a difficult task to accomplish, her manipulative character is relatively nice but she proves, in a revealing scene, that I'm not going to enter the dice. Details, but shows why it is as it is (and especially how it has also affected her own child). <br /> <br/> The subjective camera of the fillmmaker is also well used (many of the angles shown form Jake's point of view at the waist or slightly at an angle; the reverse of Peter carrying his son in the same position while having fun in the backyard), and editing is relatively impeccable. <br /> <br /> Ryan based his scenario on growing personal experiences and on the direct testimony of a friend living the same situation and on how romantic relationships can be detrimental if they inflict on their fears, their anger and stress their children. Here, the film succeeds very well in spreading its theme. <br /> <br /> Yet the foundations of horror are a bit disjointed, but George A. Romero's zombie tribute is shown with love by Ryan (Jake's mother). is asleep in front of the television while NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is discovered, making believe his own conviction that the undead live at home). The metaphor of a monster acting as a substitute for domestic violence may be a bit cumbersome, but again, the child's fear of having something under his bed is universal.
