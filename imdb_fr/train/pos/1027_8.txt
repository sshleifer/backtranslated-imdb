I am not good at writing reviews, so I will express my opinions ... <br /> <br /> I loved this series at first. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought it was great. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. Davis, it seemed, was the fifth most important person in the cast. Not a big problem. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the show suddenly fell from cliff. I do not know if it's because Hammond was more important than I realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned into ****. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, however, were great. The Stargate movie seemed mediocre the first time I saw it, but it turned out that, even though it was not the original intent, a brilliant installation for the series. I recommend you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you'll have a brand new appreciation of it the second time, believe me), then watch the rest of the series. the television series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not as good as the first seven, but that does not mean they are not good. It simply means that they are disappointing if you are spoiled by the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After completing this series, be sure to watch the derivative series, Stargate: Atlantis. He is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. <br /> <br /> EDIT the 18/07/08: I just discovered that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
