It is always the reference to judge all the polarities of the golden age, and to take into account the limited technology and the dubious ethical standards of the authorities (on the screen) resists well to all the generations of similar attempts since in cinema and on television. Fast and furious with lots of Warner Bros wipes, and fortunately there is no time for a love that interests him galloping, resulting in the magnificent casting with the violent end. I never understood why the prosecutor had to follow Vance everywhere, I always thought they were reserved. Palette as a detective but especially Girardot as a doctor are deliciously eccentric and non-PC. When he takes a look at the second victim of the murder, he feels that there are too many people in the world anyway. Of course, it's William Powell in the role of Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz in the director) who makes the film what it is - when Powell has already made a failure? <br /> <br /> The army of cops at the crime scene did not really do a very good job at finding the second dead body and the unconscious dog does it! The best is where Vance tells us all the events surrounding the murders - sets of wacky models combine with fantastic traveling camera angles to produce a very modern feel and surprise by what happened before. The only problem is, as usual, that the conclusion can not correspond to the overall deduction processes displayed all along and that a somewhat artificial end is invoked; Some Chan, Moto and many others, of course, can only be concluded this way. But because it happens so quickly and so ... slightly morally dubious, it does not diminish my opinion of KMC's status as a classic! <br /> <br /> All the engravings I've ever seen of KMC are (at worst) like looking in a goldfish bowl, so if you're interested in seeing it endure until you're sucked .
