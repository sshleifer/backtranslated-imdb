All readers of this film, and probably many professional critics, simply do not understand. This film was made with sequences of matage and techniques of art very similar to those of the great Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get one of Zeman's films, such as Jules Verne's The Fabulous World, Baron Munchausen, Journey to the Beginning or On The Comet. If you can not locate a movie, read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If we had to look at Zeman's work and try to compare it to one of the other fantastic science-fiction films of the day, then viewers probably would not have had it either. It is unfair to compare the styles of these filmmakers with the standard technologies of the day, because Zemen and Hines "do not calculate". They have a style of their own and should only be judged for their creativity. If you watch this film in a perspective where you KNOW that he intentionally tried to create a collage of matte pastiche mixed with real action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a great job. It's not easy to run a lot of computer cutouts. I thought the creatures were also very good, also considering how they were made. Hines has taken a great gamble and I think his film will not be judged equitably for years. Someone who promotes the film should have told the audience what he would see rather than let him go blindly to the theater, waiting for the usual CG work. As for the actors, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book, in which a lot of Zemen's actors were a little inexpressive at first, but became much more appealing as the movie and the action unfolded. It's totally refreshing for me to have this movie in my library. I will watch it for years, every three hours.
