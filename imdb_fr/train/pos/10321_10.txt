Most people miss the concept of Hollywood. If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds in a child's mind, within the confines of the law, I approve of the lessons taught by Doc Savage. <br /> <br /> In all cases of conflict or war, the public and the government are looking for heroes to decorate. The film industry brings on-screen heroes that people can relate to, such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. For over a generation, Doc Savage has been remembered as the "best of the best" before James Bond, Superman or any of the others. All the others who follow Doc Savage are only part of the character, not the bronze man.
