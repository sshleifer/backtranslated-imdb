In 1976, I had just moved to the United States from Ceylon. I was 23 years old and I have been married for a little over three years and I started to be a lesbian. I saw this film on an old black and white television, with a terrible reception, alone and uninterrupted, in an alarm clock that seemed to be an echo of the story. I lived in a small house in Tucson, Arizona, and it was summer ... like everyone here, I never forgot the feelings expressed by the images of this story and its remnant of fragile magic, and I kept hoping that I would see him again one day. I will continue to check. I would also like someone to make a film about "the other side of Venus" by Shirley Verel. he also has the same delicacy and the same poignant intensity ...
