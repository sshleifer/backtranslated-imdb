Alain Resnais's films are strange to the extent that they are not really set for continuity, but on the contrary, the plan seems to end where a memory has been published. Love to the death is sometimes a discreet existential drama and a realistic realistic film, but it allows the audience to discover a whole new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or perhaps to create a new relationship, that of Agape / Thanatos. . <br /> <br /> The beginning looks like a strange surreal horror movie. A woman runs desperately around the house while a man is dying in bed - did she kill him, or what happened? Soon this tension is dissolved when a doctor arrives and declares him dead, but begins a newer and unknown drama: the man wakes up and after being dead, the woman and the man fall in love with really tragic consequences. Meanwhile, their friends, who are both priests, monitor and submit their own debate about the nature of love, faith and dedication. <br /> <br /> Resnais always seems to have a way to make these kinds of stories work, and what's amazing about his films is that these devices still work. In this case, Resnais intersects the scenes with shots of snow falling on an exciting orchestral score, which fades and expands in subsequent shots that extend the story. Trapped on this elegiac side periodically, the film develops a rhythm not very different from an epic poem, and I got strange flashbacks on Dante's Divine Comedy, despite the lack of direct reference in the film. Resnais is known for being a very poetic filmmaker, but this is not limited to the cinematographic structure, but to an element that imposes a certain degree of introspection on the viewer, which makes it possible to bring out strange memories. Memory-memory, created by Resnais. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
