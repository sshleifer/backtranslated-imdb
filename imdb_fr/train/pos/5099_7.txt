The only reason I came across this movie was that it was on the LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD and I recommend you watch it, even if you will not like it as well as the best-known movie. and Carole Lombard as a crook and his companion. The film begins rather light, but becomes even more dramatic as Coop plans to use his daughter to extort money from her brother-in-law, but after meeting the girl and seeing the discipline to which she would be subjected with her Stepmother's brother chooses to keep her. However, he struggles to stay on the right path and the drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley always manages to steal the scenes in which she is. There is little music, and Shirley only has one song. However, it's entertaining and worth watching with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
