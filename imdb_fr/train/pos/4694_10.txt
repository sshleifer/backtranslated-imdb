If you are a fan of airplane type movies, it's a must see! In the 1920s and 1930s, Johnny Dangerously has not only great actors, but also beautiful aftershocks. "cut down data wall, break down data wall and shoot down dat # @ $ $% # @ $ wall." "You should not hang me on a hook, johnny" or "Looks like Johnnys gets fucked". It's certainly a parody of James Cagney's old movies and references them a lot. There is a big scene when Jhonnys walks down death row and a priest is installed for his escape. Listen carefully to the reading of false priests, it's quite funny. Another great scene is the one where Dom Delauise plays the pope. Watch his reaction to Johnny after he tipped the pope, they said without making any noise. I recommend this film to anyone who likes to laugh or are old moviegoers.
