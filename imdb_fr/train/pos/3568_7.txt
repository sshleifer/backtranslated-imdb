This film advances Cinderella's story in the early 1950s and makes good use, albeit eccentric, of the Isle of Man as a backdrop. The Ugly Sisters have become extremely glamorous English girls of the upper class and, with Kathleen Turner, as stepmother, they fly in beautiful period costumes. The story is a little changed from the traditional version: very early, it is strangely combined with the intrigue of "King Lear", and later, Cinderella is a little more assertive than usual. It looks splendid and works pretty well overall, but sometimes goes beyond.
