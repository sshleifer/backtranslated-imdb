The Cameraman's Revenge is an unusual short film, not because of its subject (adultery) or animation (Winsor McCay had introduced Little Nemo to the movies at the time), but because it depicts insects to tell the story ! Ladislaw Starewicz originally wanted to shoot bugs while fighting, but could not film them because of the burning light they experienced. He took the dead and began using gesture-stop techniques to manipulate the movements to his satisfaction. This short film highlights the human characteristics of small creatures such as motorcycling, painting, filming, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would also do Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first notable work would be this one. If you're interested and other short films mentioned, check with your local library to borrow Image Entertainment's The Cameraman't Revenge DVD and Other Fantastic Tales.
