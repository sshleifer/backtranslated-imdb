Rainy and gloomy England from the end of the winter of the early 1920s ... <br /> <br /> --- where there still reigns sadness and many young widows and veterinarians disabled from the great massacre of men and the murderer of their dreams - now known as the First World War ... <br /> <br /> Four women share this charming little sunny Italian castle on a hill; a young widow who drowns her sorrows in a frenzied party, two women who are going to rediscover their own husband and a fourth woman who is fed up with her famous dead friends ... <br /> <br /> ... These four women will gather with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to "transform" themselves spiritually for the summer holidays of April to the early 1920s in Italy. <br /> <br /> NOTICE TO budding Filmmakers. Study this film to find out how the mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a film that will please many men ...) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Stock up on coffee and hot chocolate and invite the girls to spend a sad, late winter day .. Spring is coming ... April enchanted promises you!
