Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers in a European train. Both come from very different backgrounds, he is American and she is French, after having spoken a little on the train, Jesse managed to get Celine out of the train and explore Vienna with him. For the next few hours, the two are walking around Vienna enjoying all that the city has to offer and mourning wildly. But will this new relationship last until dawn? <br /> <br /> This wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air for a genre in decline. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before Sunrise" is never boring because of its small distribution. In fact, it blossoms through tracks that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between them. The intelligent dialogue makes it a must for romance fans.
