Being a giant monster fan, seeing "Yeti" was an absolute necessity, especially after hearing so much about it. Thanks to the cheap illegal market of the underground market, I could find a copy quite easily and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was actually, if I dare say, decent. <br /> <br /> Decent for what it is, in fact, to know a giant monster cheese movie. It starts quickly enough because Yeti is quite fast, and we discover various characters. They are made up of sordid people, good people and a girl who is pretty much one of the most beautiful girls in any sci-fi film of striking beauty by far. <br /> <br /> Yeti looks like a long - a guy straight out of Woodstock's original gig, and really, he's not that naughty, especially after being introduced to the world in some sort of funky-looking thing to a cage. Godzilla, he is not - despite his brutal awakening, he does not even unleash (in reality, he rarely destroys anything in the complete picture), but just looks puzzled while trying to understand things . Yeti seems to understand English well (my copy has been dubbed in English) and he knows who the good guys and the bad guys are. <br /> <br /> However, we want to see the giant Yeti doing his thing, and he's pretty much all over the film, and in the typical low-budget fashion, he seems to change a lot of size depending on the scene and there are even some of the "fake legs" plans of him standing right there. <br /> <br /> Yes, the special effects are not the best, but there are certainly good ones here. One scene where Yeti passes through a warehouse is doing very well and in another, he uses the windows of a building as "ladder steps" to get off of the top of it - smashing every window with his foot and Shocking often the occupants inside - in a sequence that really looks a lot, much better than it should in such a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never lowers as low as "APE". In fact, the only time that it gets close to real nonsense is when the beautiful girl erects Yeti's nipple and raises her eyebrow so "oh yeah baby". Even if it is not so serious and the viewer has a little fun. The film is long enough for this kind of thing, but quite surprisingly, it is not boring - the story is good, and just watching this absolutely gorgeous actress on screen will make any viewer happy. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may not be in the top tier of giant monster movies, but other King Kong '76 scams like "APE" and "Queen Kong" from afar .
