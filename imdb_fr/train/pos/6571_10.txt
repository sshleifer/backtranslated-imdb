<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I own Jake Speed. I saw it at least 10 times. This film is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) looking for her sister. His sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family did not hear anything. Then comes Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), who tells him exactly where his sister is and offers to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He does not work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes their adventures in novels. This film is a beautiful adventure. It's hilarious, it's full of action, it's great. I guess it's a cult movie with a very small sequel. Crawford is perfect as a Jake Speed ​​and throws one-liners that you'll never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as a girl and a sidekick, respectively. John Hurt, the belly-blowing guy in Alien, plays the evil and evil villain, which just adds to the fun. In many ways, this movie looks like Indiana Jones, in some ways it looks like James Bond movies. It might have been called Indiana Bond, but whatever its title, it's a very nice movie.
