When I learned that this movie was coming out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I discovered it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before seeing the film. I'm sure the film would have been very different from me if I had not read the book. Writers have actually done a good job of staying true to the book's main plot, with minor differences, of course. I think the biggest disappointment of the movie is that Boyle plays Col. I'm not a big fan of Boyle and it seems that, whatever the mood that reigns during the film, she always tries to use it with pinched lips and eyes darkly makeup to be super sexy. Indeed, I think the film has remained faithful to the real goosebumps of the house. My favorite subplot was the Sheehan family (which is so bizarre because his son was killed in Iraq and in the current events there is Casey Sheehan whose mother had a huge anti-Iraq tirade). In the book, obviously, the war was not in Iraq, but in Vietnam, and when the house lights up the son's video in the helicopter, I was really caught off guard. Overall, I was impressed by the film because it followed the book very well.
