Very light spoiler <br /> <br /> This film (although it is broadcast on television) is absolutely excellent. I did not pay much attention to differences in appearance or accents, so I can not really talk about it. The game in this movie was so good that I had to pinch myself and say, "Remember, it's just a movie, it was not really happening". Listening to Harris and Quinn talking, I knew that was exactly what John and Paul would talk about if they had this meeting. John's flippant comments and burns matched his character perfectly (especially at the restaurant!), As was his depression while Paul was very casual and laid-back. Both actors did a great job and I was delighted to have seen this film. It's a bad experience for all Beatles fans. And get ready for some surprises!
