Having seen and loved Greg Lombardo's latest film "Knots" (he also wrote and directed this feature film), I decided to take a look at his previous work. This film was well worth it. Macbeth in Manhattan is a tongue in cheek, excellent take on Shakespeare's favorite, updated and moved to New York. I was impressed by the underlying spirit and intelligence of the screenplay and how the production scenario in the film mirrors that of the play itself - and very intelligently. The trials and tribulations of Manhattan's life correspond to many Shakespeare plays, and Central Park is seldom better used than in the woods around Macbeth Castle. Mr. Lombardo is clearly in New York and New York City (Knots is a funny and warm-hearted comedy featuring six New Yorkers over thirty years old, mostly in a charming neighborhood in Brooklyn. , with offices in Manhattan and a loft in downtown (for good measure) and spent a lot of time around Shakespeare's plays. The film is well paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the heart of Macbeth. It made me think of Al Pacino's "Looking for Richard" - another wonderful Shakespeare film "played in a movie". I highly recommend visiting Macbeth in Manhattan.
