The last of the blond bombs is an entertaining piece of down. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a newly defeated widow. She spent most of her life being a devoted wife and mother, but she was never really happy. <br /> <br /> Shortly after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth holds her lunch appointment with her stick-in-the-mud kids when she spots a street artist. It reminds me of memories of being part of a women's swing group in London during the Second World War. We quickly learn that the band was not really a girl, the drummer being a man dressing like a woman Some Some It It Hot. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth takes out her sax (which she practiced secretly throughout her marriage) and associates herself with the street musician who plays the guitar. Elizabeth has a lot more talent than the guitarist and the money starts to flow. She does not take money because she is rich and does not need it. His game is strictly for artistic fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is seen one day by Patrick (Ian Holm) who was the group's drummer coach. It seems that Patrick was - and still is - a women's man, and that Elizabeth - was only fifteen at the time - was the only member of the group not to experiment with Patrick's "talents" other than that of percussion. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to bring the old band together to play dance at her granddaughter's school. Thus begins a delicious journey in the past, associated with some aspects of a humorous film, all ended with very good swing and blues. <br /> <br /> I guess I'm at the age where I really enjoy myself. This film is a treasure, because not only Judi Dench, but also Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, and many experienced British actresses support it. All of this is crowned by the extraordinary voice of Cleo Laine. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's down, but absolutely delicious and very entertaining.
