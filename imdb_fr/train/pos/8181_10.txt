Dr. Feinstone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool. Suddenly, he discovers that his wife is done with the guardian of the pool. He realizes that behind everything that is clean, there is rot. He begins to torture his patients. ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as a disturbed dentist - he is completely believable.It is surprisingly little gore, but the scenes of dental torture are pretty nasty and grotesque.Highly recommended. "The Dentist 2" is also worth watching!
