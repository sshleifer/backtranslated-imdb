It's a great short film. I think every voice is made by Jason Steele. (You can barely tell if you've heard his normal voice, so do not worry.) It takes about 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> edward the spatula is fighting the spoons and he is meeting strange people. In fact, everyone he knows seems pretty crazy. <br /> <br /> "Edward!" "General Peterson, we must bring you to a medical unit!" "No, I will not do it Edward." "Do not talk like that, I'm sure everything will be fine." "I'm an Edward Goner, and you know it before you go-" "Yes?" "Can I just have ... a kiss?" "uh no." "Come on, just a little, little kiss on the lips?" "I'm going away now, sir." <br /> <br /> the film will be available soon. the date for that is in September, but it's probably going to be postponed.
