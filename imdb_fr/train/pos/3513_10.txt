The actor Herman Jos√© plays the football of a football entrepreneur who acquires the pass of two African players and tries to sell him for very little money to the rival club of Benfica (club of his heart), FC Porto So these players were not playing well, and he wanted FC Port to be wronged with that. But what happens is that these two players are good after all and FC Porto sells them a lot for a foreign club, which makes it a good deal. The film, for a country as small as Portugal, without a great background in big films, is a very good and funny comedy showing the rivalry that exists between the North and the South of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
