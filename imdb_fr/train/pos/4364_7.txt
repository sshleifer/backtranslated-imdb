I had never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before the release of "Rob Roy", but the film is definitely worth it. While playing the main character, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role he has brought to Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange is also doing a very good job as his wife Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a person very likely to crawl your skin. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is as good as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think of how Hollywood has released two films almost back to back in sweeping England. Very well. Also with John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
