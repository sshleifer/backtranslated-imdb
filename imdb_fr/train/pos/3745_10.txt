Many mysterious stories follow the usual path of groups of readers: the most heinous murder, gathering clues, fights of possible morons, dusting of red herrings and inevitable confrontation between malefactor and even more intelligent crimes resolver. <br /> <br /> "Forgotten" abandons the march and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts. The fact that at the end of three episodes we do not have easy answers or carefully linked packages can frustrate some, but for me it was an indication of a cleverly crafted story that would sound, disturb and haunt the question: Does an evil person look like? <br /> <br /> The excellent interpretation and production combine to make a mystery difficult to ... forget.
