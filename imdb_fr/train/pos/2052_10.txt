I do not have much to add to my summary, this movie ranks as one of the funniest movies ever made with Top Gun, without trying to be. For my part, I do not think that should be taken seriously because it is very pleasant. <br /> <br /> I do not think that undermines the reputation of Christopher Walken either, because his reputation was declining at the time anyway. . It took Pulp Fiction to get him out of his sleep. As for Michael Ironside, he was one of the great funny without looking to be a serious film. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I think is amazing is the budget that this movie had. Scenes and actors and explosions, etc. are pretty amazing, so obviously someone liked it a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever they are, I like them because I like this movie! <br /> <br /> If anyone reads this by looking for information on McBain (and I doubt that there will be too much), just know it's a hilarious movie and should be watched with smile!
