An Australian campaigner (Mat) travels to town the night before a major AFL test match, where his cousin has to pick him up. And then things go wrong. <br /> <br /> His hopeless cousin has been involved in drug dealing involving local shark / drug dealer Tiny (who looks like any gangster but is definitely Australian). Needless to say, Mat is immersed in chaos and he is not long in thinking of tomorrow's game as the frenzied events of the night unfold. <br /> <br /> Shakespearean, accomplished Western Australian professional Actor Toby Malone plays a remarkable role as a na√Øve young farmer, Mat, and successfully plays a role well below his age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny and the entertaining role played by David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events. Roll is fast, often funny, and a very useful one hour use.
