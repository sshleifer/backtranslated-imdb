Without being one of my favorites, it's good to change pace ... even if it's only for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a big fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (who is renamed "Butch" here). They all fight, but suddenly, Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: he stops the fight and suggests that they are all friends. So, all sign a peace treaty and become friends ... which will not last long. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the three become affectionate, patient and kind to each other. They flee even when one of them is in danger of death. The relationship is only excellent, until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy. The three are guilty of returning to their usual struggles and rivalries. <br /> <br /> But still ... seeing Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is really a lovely and grateful experience, even if only for a while. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, it's curious that two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" are played here in instrumental versions: "We'll see the magician" and rainbow ".
