Thank God, ABC chose this instead of Fox. The best description (for connoisseurs) is that Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if an experience lived with death and fate at the beginning of my life makes me a fan of Fuller but I certainly appreciate his productions. I also like checkerboard floors, pies, talking toys, gravel and other mischievous objects :) Although a bit "Burtonesque", I certainly think it takes advantage of its own niche that does not require that J Depp or HB Carter is a wonderfully imaginative playground. Here, we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood crashing on each of them, which gives meaning and makes us want to live fully.
