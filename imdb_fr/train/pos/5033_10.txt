It's one of those movies that, after watching it, you'll continue to think about it and come back several months after watching it. The acting is spectacular for two kids (I usually hate movies with whiny kids). Bill Paxton is great, his directorial debut is even better than what I expected from an actor whose most memorable phrase is "Game over, dude! Game over!" (from the movie "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is the dichotomy between the scenes where the actors play a family and when they do their "work". This makes the film believable and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Bill. I will wait for more movies than I am sure to like!
