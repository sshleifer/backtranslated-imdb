In Brooklyn, a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades led Brodie to bet he could jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be familiar to many people thanks to a parody of Bugs Bunny, "Bowery Bugs" of 1949. <br /> <br /> This generally very nice movie would probably be more widely available if the infamous scene and disturbing depicting some Chinese residents - a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes, which gives the film a considerable historical interest, in my opinion.
