It may not have been the best movie of 2006, but it was just a movie to be excited and meditated. The Sentinel is a good political thriller that looks similar or even borrows elements from other political thrillers like In the Line of Fire and the Manchu candidate. The basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this: A plot to kill the President of the United States. Michael Douglas plays the role of secret service agent Pete Garrison, who directs the operation, but later discovers he has been mentored. Kiefer Sutherland plays the role of a rival named David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin, a rookie. Agent under the direction of Agent Breckinridge and Oscar winner Kim Basinger as First Lady, Sarah Ballentine. An improvement for this film could have been more action than some sources considered as much as an action movie as a thriller movie, but a good thing about this movie is rather a murder plot aimed at to kill the US president concerns a mole (traitor) in the secret services that leads the president in the wrong direction.
