For starters, it's a very funny movie with some crazy characters running and laughing (look at the two Russian bugs). <br /> <br /> A Bug's Life has a classic Disney story of good things about the movie. The family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film undergo an evolution to finally stand up against the grasshoppers. Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey (of course) have also done excellent voiceovers ... But in reality, the most amazing thing in this film is animation. It's just wonderful. All the details, beautiful colors, each ant has a different look, beautiful backgrounds ... And Pixar's guys and girls made it all so realistic. In short, it is a very nice job. It's the best animation of Disney since Aladdin.
