The premise may seem crazy, but as Murphy's character does not take it seriously, it helps relieve the public in this mix of mysticism and abduction of hard-shelled kids. Excellent actors, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is at the peak of his 80-year high in comedy / action. There are also some great F / X, a very surreal dream sequence and a pretty original plot. Often neglected in the pantheon of Murphy's films, but this one is worth the detour.
