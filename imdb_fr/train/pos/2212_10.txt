E! The TV is an excellent channel and Talk Soup is so funny, you can see in the blink of an eye the change of episode. We want the funniest writings of the best writer of all time, Stan Evans. The patron saint of the masses without thought ... He is a really talented writer, actor, comic, producer, director and creative consultant. Anna Nicole loved him, but he was not a billionaire, he so left for a billionaire. Many super stars have wanted to make movies with actor Stan Evans, who has an acting style "Humphrey Bogart" {Clark Gable}. He should do a lot more movies. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or maybe with a lot of other talented producers. We wish him a moment of FAME with a big fortune to win. Has he produced fake dramas? or maybe any docudrama ??? A project on Bernie Madhoff would be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many scenarios has he written ?? Does he have a billion dollar deal with $$$? He should earn more than 50 million dollars ... He could also write a TV movie about the late KING OF POP .. Michael Jackson. We want to see a lot more and by Stan Evans in movies and on television. Thank you so much. Elvis left the building !!!!!
