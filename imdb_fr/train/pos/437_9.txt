April enchanted is a poem of tones, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece that consists in transmitting a message in a few words. This is one of my 10 favorite movies since its release. I continue to wait, though less patiently, for the film to come out in DVD format. Apparently, I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If the listings of Amazon's parent company are correct, many people want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this casting and this scenario. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The cast is spectacular, the cinematography and direction impeccable. The film is a definitive guardian. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.
