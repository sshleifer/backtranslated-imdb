Erich Rohmer's The Englishman and Duke is a perfect companion for Peter Watkins' "The Commune" (Paris 1871). The two films - screened at the Toronto International Film Festival this year - ironically illustrate how storytelling is shaped by storytellers. Ironic, given the tragic events that took place in the United States during the festival. <br /> <br /> Located in Paris during the French Revolution, the film is based on "Memories" by Grace Elliott (Lucy Russell). A first-hand account of how she survived those exhilarating but dangerous days. She also describes her relationship with the Duke of Orleans (interpreted by Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who, unlike her, is a supporter of the Revolution. <br /> <br /> Faithful to its form, you do not know which side of the story will Rohmer tackle? Rohmer, one of the first French filmmakers of the "New Wave", has often been criticized for being too cautious. After all, in the midst of rebel-Vietnamese youth of the late '60s and' 70s, he was filming small romantic confections like "Claire's Knee". But do not sell the old boy, he has always been a student of human nature, not an ideologue, and "The Englishwoman and the Duke" continues to prove it. <br /> <br /> Rohmer's characters are never the "bad guys" nor the "good guys", they are above all human beings capable of presenting a whole range of human potentialities - and their limits. That's why his films are always provocative and this film is no exception. . <br /> <br /> Let's move on to technology now. <br /> <br /> Rohmer, although he advances in his 80s, remains at the forefront of film innovation. The look of "L'Anglaise" looks like something you have never seen before. You guessed it, the old man, like several directors of the festival this year, has gone digital. <br /> <br /> All the exterior scenes of the film have as if they took place in their original Parisian decor of the 1780s. In fact, you could be so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the look of the movie. You may have to come back for a second screening to capture the subtleties of the movie's political ideas (and yes, I'll say it). <br /> <br /> Toronto presents some of the world's most challenging young directors this year, as well as some of the world's oldest. And the old masters are at the forefront of cinema alongside the younger ones. <br /> <br /> Long live the youth. Long live old age. And long live Erich Rohmer. <br /> <br />
