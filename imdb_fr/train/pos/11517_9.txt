If you like Cleese and all the British "Pythonesque" humor of the time, then this gem is absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a real treat! <br /> <br /> I saw this with friends on TV when he came out, and his classic quotes have been part of our jokes for 30 years, and will do it forever! I have it on tape and it is continually appreciated. <br /> <br /> Maybe some commentators take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> I can not believe it is now only available in the US (NTSC of course), and not in the UK, where it should be an essential part of the history of the world. British humor !!
