Have you ever wondered where the romance ideas and other published articles came from? According to "Jake Speed", they are based on real people and live the adventures on which they write and publish. This film is quality family entertainment, moderate violence and tight clothing at worst. Language is not a problem either and jokes are fun at all levels. This is a look at "Austin Powers" on "Indian Jones", without the excessive antics of Michael Myers. I highly recommend this movie to children from 10 to 15 years old.
