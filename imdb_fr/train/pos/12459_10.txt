This movie is really one of my favorite movies in this genre. The interaction between respectable characters and morally irreproachable people is an ode to chivalry and the code of honor of thieves and police officers. It covers topics such as duty, guilt, speech, manipulation and trust, as few films have done and, unfortunately, none that I can recall since the death of the "policeman" at the end of seventies. The sequence is delicious, to the point, living nothing and thus leading the viewer in a masterful plot, without complication or catchy, but in spectacular scenes often necessary in small specimens of the genre to keep the public awake. No scene of this type is present or necessary. The discussion is not fluid and honest for the viewer, which is an important asset in a genre in which suspense is often achieved through public betrayal. No, it's not missing Marble ... A note of congratulations for the music is in order A movie to watch and savor every minute, not just to see.
