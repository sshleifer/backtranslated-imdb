Since I'm not a fan of almost all of John Waters' post-drama "Desperate Living," I got used to "Pecker". After emerging from the underground, Waters produced trash-lite versions of his previous work ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray "), which hardcore fans tasted and tasted like diluted liquor." Pecker ", which does not attempt to regurgitate your early successes, is a modest, discreet and humble commentary on the vagaries of celebrity and the claim of the art world.It is clear that Waters knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the most pop art lovers ever created that you can not imagine giving except the Waters "name." Edward Furlong is good as "Pecker" and the Waters' non-histrionic style is comfortable the subject.
