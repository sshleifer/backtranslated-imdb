This is without a doubt my favorite novel of Le Carré and it is transformed into a big screen with all the love and attention that one can wish for. I read a review on this site that seems to find disgusting characters but I think it misses the point. All of Le Carré's stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception. It is a faithful reflection of the period in which it is defined. Treason is everyone's key to the good of anyone. Pym's education is so close to mine that I find it icy to watch. Peter Egan is in his best role and the late lamented Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Even the smaller roles played by Andy from the Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are on hand. This casting is a dream of Theater Impresario. History should not be spoiled by an uninformed description but suffice to say that it refers to a young man devastated slowly but inexorably, descending into espionage and treason. All my sympathies go to Magnus Pym and her only (non-sexual) love for Poppy (Rüdiger Weigang), always so wonderful. His only true friendship, but also by definition another in the long series of betrayals. like.
