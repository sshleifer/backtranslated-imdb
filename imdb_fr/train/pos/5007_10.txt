Barbra Streisand's first special show was just fantastic! From his child's sketch to his mix of songs in a haute couture department store, everything was great! It was easy to understand how this special award had been awarded. <br /> <br /> Even if appearances had not been confused, the attention remained on Barbra throughout the production.
