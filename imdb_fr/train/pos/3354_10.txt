This film is finally released on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen this film so many times and I find it even relevant (2003), while Italy is suffering again from a kind of dictatorship resulting in brainwashing (or even the United States). I am happy that there are outcasts like the one played by Mastroianni in this film that can sing wrong; maybe they can teach the Sophia Lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognized as human beings. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: As most people here have already mentioned, the acting is wonderful, but the audio background is amazing. I must assume that, unfortunately, something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that the demonstration of machismo, the distortion of reality in this ever-present radio chronicle of Hitler's visit to Rome can actually make you shudder! <br /> <br /> A masterpiece! <br /> <br />
