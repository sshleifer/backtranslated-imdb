When you see the cover of the DVD, you are convinced that it is a cheap film of class B, a movie made for $ 1,000 in someone's yard. <br /> <br /> False! <br /> <br /> It's a quality material and really good. It's a comedy and an intelligent one. It is also very touching in places, with a nice place of kindness. The production values ​​are very good (it seems excellent), the actors are known, the direction and the scenery of the film are excellent. It's incredible. Who could have thought? <br /> <br /> Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against-type, is great, like "Helen Robinson", the woman who looks like June Cleaver; Billy Connolly is great as a grumpy zombie with a good heart "Fido"; Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a fucking neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy", and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are excellent, also K'Sun Ray as a young "Timmy Robinson, "should not be neglected either. In fact, he probably has more aftershocks in the movie than anyone else. <br /> <br /> If I explain the story, it will sound so stupid that not many of you would look at it. All you have to do is speak to the people here who liked it and found it very pleasant. However, you need a sense of black humor. an appreciation of the absurd.
