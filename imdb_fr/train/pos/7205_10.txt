Deathtrap is not a thriller. It is one who will do it to whom the first. It's so difficult to describe this film without revealing anything so I will not talk about the plot anymore. As for acting, Cris Reeves plays the biggest role in the role of Clifford, a young screenwriter. You really see how his acting abilities in this movie range from "exhaling cheeseburgers" to downright scary. Clifford is such a difficult role to play and I have never seen Clifford play well on this stage. The actor plays him like a little puppy or a murderous maniac. Reeves is the only person I've seen who has the character to the end. As for Michael Caine, he's ... well, he's Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the last 50 years and in this film as good as it never was.
