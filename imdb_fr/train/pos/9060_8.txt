Saw this today with my 8 years old. I thought he was cute. I agree with the other poster that it was not a book at all, but we have always appreciated it. All the children are very good and quite entertaining. Billy is the new one who accepts a challenge from the bully of the school to eat 10 worms a day. If he loses, he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants. The beginning of the film is designed to show that Billy has a VERY weak stomach and vomits almost anything. The hilarity ensues with a lot of different ways to cook worms. Good message on how to resist bullying and of course, a happy ending.
