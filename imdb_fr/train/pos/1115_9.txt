This is one of those unfortunate films that have suffered an even sadder and unhappy death at the box office. I saw this film in a local art cinema, in the form of revival, shortly after its release in traditional cinemas. This certainly deserves to be addressed a second time (or even a third). Sandra B. goes beyond the limit by talking and repeating some well-known songs from this piece (her version of Hank William's "I'm so lonely I could cry" could easily move you to tears). Maybe one day the audience will be ready to take this movie a bit more seriously (but not without a few laughs). The film is moving at a fast pace (thanks to a good editing), so some viewers will not find it obsolete and boring. A recovery may be in progress.
