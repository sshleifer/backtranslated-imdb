I will keep this one pretty short. I think it's an extraordinary film. I see other critics who have commented on the fact that it is badly written, badly shot, that it has a terrible soundtrack and, worse, that it is not real in its representation of life. While the film may not be entirely believable, this film carries a message of hope that some people seemed to have missed. I hope it's not too late to save people from the terrible events that are happening in so many lives. The gang violence is real, right? Is it true, no! This film carries an important social message that the cynics may not like but which must nevertheless be praised rather than disparaged. I watched this film with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with the same pleasure and with the feeling that the world could perhaps be improved and that it would not be beyond the safeguard (well, not before 2008 anyway). 9 out of 10 of me for this one. It's almost perfect for me. JMV
