As another reviewer puts it, Hanna's War is an exceptional film about an exceptional person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who will become the Jewish Joan of Arc. Unfortunately, I do not share the opinion that I do not agree that Miss Detmers, as a leader, is too good to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter. In truth, for me, her performance is not hindered by her beauty, it makes her even more cruel in the terror of the sadistic brutality she faces. The performance of Maruschka Detmers is courageous, poignant, sincere or understood and totally believable. In other words for me "in the zone". of the opening credits. If you want to know more about someone else's suffering for something that he believes in and that you are impressively entertaining, try Hanna's War with Maruschka Detmers. I would also like to thank Ellen Burstyn as the mother of Hanna, a well-known and well-known actress who could have made an effort to go out with the film. In this, it may be a team effort involving two actresses, but not a situation of All About Eve.
