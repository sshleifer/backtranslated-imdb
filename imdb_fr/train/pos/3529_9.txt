Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. The night of his assassination, he had gone out with a mysterious woman who refused to give him his name. After being charged with the murder, the police go to all the places where he was, but people only remember him. He is sentenced to death and his secretary (Ella Raines) goes in search of the murderer herself because she loves him. <br /> <br /> This is a Universal B-movie (watch the cast - all the cast of the character and a star - Franchot Tone - in decline). The budget was small and the distribution largely unknown, but what came out was one of the best black films of the 1940s. It is beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic storyline from an excellent book by William Irish (pen name Cornell Woolrich). It moves fast and it looks fantastic. And there's the famous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr. coming out of the screen with incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised the censors did not cut it). <br /> <br /> There are only a few faults that prevent this from being perfect. Ton gives a terrible performance. He looks horrible and he is just awful. Also, Curtis is stiff and bland like Henderson. You really wonder why Raines loves him - he's so emotional. But Raines is very good in the lead role. She is pretty and full of life. In addition, the last scene where the assassin is after it never rings true. He is not physically a threat and his reactions seem overrated. <br /> <br /> I still give a 9. It's really a fantastic movie - apart from the flaws.
