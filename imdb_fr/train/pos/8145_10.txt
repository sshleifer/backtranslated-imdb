I first saw this movie about 4 years ago and I was expecting something funny, similar to CB4. I was dazzled. I was on the floor laughing, this movie is so great. Much better than CB4, the characters, the songs, the plot, everything. Top quality independent film that has been awarded to "Two Thumbs UP" by Siskel and Egbert (and if two old whites can understand the humor in this film, you know it's good).
