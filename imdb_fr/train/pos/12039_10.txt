The woman in black is fantastic in every aspect. It's scary, suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happen in real life. I saw it for the first time on television in 1989, and with all the lights off and the volume increased, it was probably the scariest experience of my life. I managed to get a copy of it and now I make it out every Halloween and show it to the suspicious family members, who have no idea what they are meant for, and everything what I can do is laugh with joy. Regarding the film: <br /> <br /> It starts with a young lawyer, Arthur Kipps, who is instructed by his office to go to the town of Crythin Gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client - Mrs. Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story. But then, Arthur attends the funeral and, from this scene, we do not feel safe. We are constantly on the alert and we bite our nails, and it lasts about an hour, until the final final thrilling. <br /> <br /> A warning to all new viewers: do not look at this alone. ..
