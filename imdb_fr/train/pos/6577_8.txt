With a few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's plays have virtually disappeared from the theater these days. Too archi, too talkative seems to be the general verdict. This BBC version of one of Shaw's funniest plays does not refute this verdict. He is certainly archy and talkative, but it is also wonderful. And because of the quality of British theater, it is perfectly interpreted by actors of which, with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter, most of us have probably never heard of us. Carter is beautiful as a Bulgarian girl who shelters the professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and falls in love with him afterwards. One could oppose the particularly ridiculous interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Ryecart), the Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge in the enemy lines and succeeded only because the enemy had bad ammunition for his machine guns. However, the role invites to over-act and Ryecart was obviously asked to over-act. The other players are perfect letter. Carter as a self-dramatizing Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as a Swiss soldier of fortune are at the center of the play, of course, and they are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" appears as a filmed play. But you're unlikely to see a Shaw movie that does not betray its origin. Plots are usually smart. However, Shaw is all about dialogue. The action is minimal (even in Sainte-Jeanne) and the sets are immaterial. Enjoy it for what it is.
