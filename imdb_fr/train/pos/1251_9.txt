This documentary explores a story taken from Pilger's latest book "Freedom Next Time," published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of residents of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands of the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br /> The islanders are British citizens, Diego Diego being a British colony, a bit like Mauritius, the neighboring island where the natives were exiled. But the British government ignored their demands for return to their home country, the island now being a military base for the US military, which used it as a base for bombing Iraq and Afghanistan. . <br /> <br /> As usual, the cover of Pilger is shocking, especially because it documents the current impoverished treatment and living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews are excellent in all areas, and he is one of the best representatives of Parliament, where he uses the government's own information to identify him. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses a spectacular reconstruction to dissect a series of recently published documents that fully illuminate the British plot to expel the natives. The weaving of these images with the interviews and the music of the inhabitants of the island really reinforce the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to see, but "Stealing a nation" is John Pilger at his best. Recommended.
