I admit that I have a soft spot for alternative history stories, from ITS A WONDERULUL LIFE to Groundhogs Day at 12:01. Among these big is this little gem. It's pretty difficult to get through the MR. DESTINY without giving any sign of appreciation to each cast member, from the brave James Belushi to the murderous Courtney Cox. This film lacks gravity and scale to make a great movie, but it's a good incentive for a rainy afternoon. It is also an excellent rental for an inexpensive date.
