I agree with most other posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? for me, he leaned a little too much on the comedy side. I could have been a good movie without comedy and it was horribly artificial. Jamie continues to run in the Julio and what is his name. In New York, how often do you meet someone you know in downtown Cleveland? How did Robert Pastorelli unearth Yankee Stadium to hide the gold? Another comedy or a drama? But it was always fun especially for a Sunday morning. I enjoyed the performance of Kimberly Elise, she is certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her talent seriously. She is a young actress who will be viable.
