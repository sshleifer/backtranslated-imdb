When I heard this film was directed by Ang Lee, I made sure to see it. This Taiwanese director became known a few years ago with "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman", then "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". He is now turning to another American icon: the Civil War. <br /> <br /> This story takes place in Missouri, Federated State of the South. These have never officially joined the Confederate army. Instead, they formed groups of outlaws, called "bushwhackers", developed their long hair and sometimes confiscated the uniform of the union they wore over their usual clothes. <br /> <br /> The film describes their moral dilemma, the ultimate tragedy of the time, and their allegedly heroic assassination missions of the traders and farmers who helped the Union. There are no stars in this film, unless you consider "Jewel" as a singer well interpreted as a young confederate widow as a star. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire is interpreted as a young German farm boy who makes fun of his inheritance because the Germans were supposed to be sympathizers of the Union. This young man is an excellent actor, full of youth with a fresh face, whose performance encompasses his wonders and subtle achievements while exposed to the horror of war. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. It gives a fine and discreet performance. <br /> <br /> Part of the acting game, however, is in wood, especially in the long conversations they have on morality. And their costumes are too new. And the theme of the "gentlemen of the south" of the manners, the do-it-yourself and the politeness towards the women appears a little too much, all the more since they aim at murdering all the men that they draw from the arms of their women, and then burn the stores. and houses. <br /> <br /> Although I do not think it will become one of Lee Ang's "big" movies, I was fascinated by this film, despite the slow and excessive length of it. 140 minutes. I was interested in what was happening next and I felt empathy for each of the characters who all presented themselves as real and imperfect human beings caught in the forces of history. <br /> <br /> Not as much action as the usual war. film, yet still recommended - especially for civil war lovers. <br /> <br />
