Many things have been written about Mamet's "House of the Games"; most of it is good. I decided to see the film again to see how it held after 17 years and I was surprised how much I liked seeing it again. The success and sustainability of the film probably has a lot to do with two main ingredients that are always fun on the film; a good story and a good scam. Mamet manages to bring to the film his characteristic mood and obvious headaches, while cheating on us, the audience and the brand at the same time. Then he explains the art of knowing to never do it again, etc. while building the story. "The House of Games", which is now a free cable player, is well worth a look for beginners and a satisfying cover for Mamet fans. (B +)
