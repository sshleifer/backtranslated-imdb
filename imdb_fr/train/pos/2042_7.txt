STAR: ***** Essential **** Very good *** Okay ** We could go out for a meal instead * to avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> Stuck-up bitch of career Kate (Franka Potente) goes to the London Underground to catch a train that will take her to meet George Clooney. However, after a hectic day of work, she falls asleep and wakes up to find herself alone on a deserted platform. As she rushes into a situation that takes her from one discouraging encounter to another, she learns however that something much more evil and evil is waiting for her there. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the British The film industry is becoming an autonomous entity, especially in the horror thriller department, with films such as Creep and the success of 28 Days Later (which has strong echoes in part). As for the success of his project. Creep cleverly creates (especially at the beginning) a frightening sense of isolation and fear. When he is clever, he also (although I inadvertently assume) pays tribute to some of the high-profile horror films of the 1970s that are based on shock and fear without focusing too much on the development of character and such. <br /> <br /> Among its weaknesses, some scenes are a little predictable, but they do not really manage to make it less scary or more effective. I'm not sure if the end was supposed to make it a kind of morality game and it's not quite perfect, but it's certainly very effective and performs very well its basic function. ***
