This film is one of the best American B-movies of the 90s. If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for action, bursts of laughter and a deadpan variant on cops who fight gangsters, it's worth watching. Everyone chews the scene a bit, but that's really what the movie is, and everyone is pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have excellent chemistry and need to make another film together.
