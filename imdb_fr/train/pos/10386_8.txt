what's wrong with you, if you're not dazzled by Jessica Simpsons' action car footage and hot body, then you're mostly headed for it. Of course, the film is not a masterpiece, I do not think it was intended to be. It was fun and fun, I had never watched the show when I was younger, I only saw one episode recently and when I watched the movie, I felt there was the same kind of atmosphere. The movie seats were practically shaking and the car footage was good because it did not bother me and dragged me like some 2fast 2furious scenes. and jessica Simpson is just hot, I just wish they used it more in the action sequences. Overall, I spent a lot of time looking at this and I would see him again soon and I will buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.
