This is a well-considered and very disturbing drama. I am very impressed by the film, not only for the plot and the superb acting, but for the fact that such a unique film was shot. Most spy or war movies are filled with Brit or a powerful battle, but that's not the case. It's not about this type of war, but about the war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, who pretends to be an evil that no one will ever forget. At the end of the war, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic position must remain a government secret. Back in America, Campell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi enemies, proposing interesting conflicts, both internal and external. Nolte draws more than the role, and corresponds quite well to the plot for what he asks.
