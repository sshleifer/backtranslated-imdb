I do not quite understand why none of the "critics" attributed this documentary "0" other than for political reasons. No, the film did not investigate the two "faces" of the story, but a film in favor of Chavez against the wave of propaganda directed against him should be seen as an attempt to balance the story in general (especially in view of A. the involvement of the CIA in Latin America in the ferment of civil unrest - Google and B. National Security Archive, coverage in this country and elsewhere of clearly faked scenes of Chavez supporters firing non-existent opponents). What is most amazing in this film is the fact that the filmmakers stayed in the presidential palace all the way, which is certainly a first in the production of documentaries: images of a sudden on both sides !!!
