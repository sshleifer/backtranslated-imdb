We always watch American films with their particular accents from each region (south, west, etc.). We have the same thing here. All foreigners must watch this film and must have an open mind to accept another culture. In addition to the American and European industries, they almost dominate the film industry. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about a parallel world in which it is not pictured even for those who live in a big city like São Paulo. All actors improvise and they are very realistic. The camera gives us an idea of ​​their confusing world, the loneliness of each character and invites us to share his universe. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie and a worse rent at home.
