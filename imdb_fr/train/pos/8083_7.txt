If you have read the books, forget the characters that Tolkien has built in your head. The representations of hobbits, dwarves, etc. have been treated as "disney". The dark horsemen are excellent and, as I had always imagined in the books. <br /> <br /> Cinematically, this is an excellent film mixing live movement and animation to produce incredible effects for the year. I only wish he (Bakshi) received the money needed to complete his epic. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching the video, because it will be worth a little after the Lord of the Rings of 2001 !!
