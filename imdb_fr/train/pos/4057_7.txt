Like many Americans, I was introduced to Hayao Miyazaki's works when I saw "Spirited Away". I fell in love with the movie and I saw it many times. Now, I'm looking for all Miyazaki movies. One of his first works is "Castle in the Sky". While it's still nice, it's not as good as "Spirited Away" (although comparing this film or movie to its 2002 masterpiece may be unfair). <br /> <br /> A young boy by the name of Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working in a mine late at night, when he sees a girl falling slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret and before he knows it, Pazu is embroiled in an adventure that will take him to danger with the pirates, the army and a lost floating city. <br /> <br /> Entering a Hayao Miyazaki movie means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and fear like Miyazaki. Watching a Miyazaki movie is like living a fantasy dream since childhood. <br /> <br /> Because the film is animated, dubbing is not really a problem, because it is almost impossible to determine whether or not the movements of the lips correspond to the words. It is also useful that the translated dialogue is well written and expressed by talented actors. The dubbing is varied. James Van Der Beek ranks better. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu, perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is almost as good as Sheeta. She is frightened by the events unfolding around her, but she knows what she has to do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the mean Muska. He is dangerous and wants something from Sheeta and will do anything to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is awful like Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for "The Last Picture Show", but she is annoying as a pirate leader. Leachman gives the character an odious squawk almost always monotonous. It's so bad that it almost ruins the film! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he poses as the general. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend to watch "Castle in the Sky". I will probably end up buying it myself. But even if it's not as good as "Spirited Away", it's still pretty good.
