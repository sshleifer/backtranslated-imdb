This film reminded me that some old black and white movies are really worth watching. <br /> <br /> Initially, I had some reservations, but from the beginning to the end of the film, I was captivated. I was VERY impressed by the mix of drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILAIRE and shoved me. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, film in your movie night to relieve some of the sometimes depressing and "too" powerful or "funny" films of today.
