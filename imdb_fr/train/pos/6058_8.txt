It's a quality documentary about the exciting world of Indy racing. The photography is simply exceptional. The scene where Mario Andretti drives the old race roadster into New England Street lined with old maple trees, leaves blown to one side by the speed of the car, is incredible. The film loses some of its beauty on the small screen, but if you like watching cars pushed to the extreme, you should see this movie.
