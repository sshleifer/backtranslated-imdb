Moe and Larry are newly stitched husbands, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. In his music studio, Shemp learns that he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! <br /> <br /> "Husbands Beware" is a remake of the "Brideless Groom" of 1947, widely considered by many to be one of Stooge's best films with Shemp. The remake contains most of the images in this movie. The new scenes, shot on May 17, 1955, include the story of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp's sisters, as well as cooking a turkey turkey! Some new scenes are also added at the end of the movie (a double for Dee Green was used, if you blink, you'll miss the double.) <br /> <br /> "Husbands, beware you "would have done it for a good movie with just the plot of marrying the sisters. Budgetary considerations, coupled with fewer reservations for two-reel comedies, influenced the decision to use older images. <br /> <br /> Although the Stooges still make entirely new films, most of their 1955-1956 films were composed of older films and a few new scenes. "Husbands Beware", although one of these hybrids, is viewable and entertaining; we're seeing most of the Brideless Groom movies again, and the new scenes are fun enough to get the viewer to watch the movie. This film is one of Stooge's latest comedies to present new images of Shemp. He was released six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
