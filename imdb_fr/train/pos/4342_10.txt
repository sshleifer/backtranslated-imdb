This film did not really surprise me, as such it became better and better. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote this, eh? Well ... we'll see how he goes ..." Then I saw that Peter Falk was inside. I appreciate Colombo. Although I've never been a big fan of the show, I've always loved watching Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They played so well that I felt almost amazed! ... and I did not even drink! <br /> <br /> This film was so well done that I wanted to contact Paul on the phone and tell him how much I liked him! but I could not find his number. Must be unlisted or something. <br /> <br /> It was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was going to be or who was in or anything. It just started and I thought, "Hey, why not, come on in. If I do not like it - I do not have to look at it ..." ... and I ended up worshiping!
