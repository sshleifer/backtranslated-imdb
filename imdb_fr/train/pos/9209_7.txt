STAR STARTING: ***** The Works **** just misses the mark *** That little something between ** Late * The pits <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) takes his way in the Wild West when he sees a group of men mistreating a lady. As a gentleman, he naturally interferes and puts an end to this and thus kills the son of a wicked performer. This is just the beginning of a fierce battle to the end, where there will be only one winner. <br /> <br /> Mr. Dudikoff is a star of action who never really managed to take off with me. Maybe I discovered it too late and after the other movie I saw with him last Monday, The Human Shield, it was just another Dud (ha ha ha) added to the list. But I have a soft spot for Westerners, because they are films that transport me to a different place and place and that is a real entertainment for the escapees. With that, Dudikoff chose one of his best scripts, because his films still pass. The film hits a few low points in the form of a naughty central naff, sounding like a white Marlon Brando and a few generally acting from some of the cast, with mandatory sets looking cheap. But if, for some strange reason, your life depended on watching a Dudikoff movie, it would be one of your best choices. ***
