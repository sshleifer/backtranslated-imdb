I'm a big fan of movies where people get ripped off, and House of Games is almost the pinnacle of "movies where people get ripped off". In short, it's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters on many levels, without ever revealing what is happening, while adding many twists and surprises to completely upset what you come duty. The film against the public several times, and despite that we know it; It's still hard to guess where he's going and every rebound is a surprise. As mentioned, I am a big fan of movies and the plot of it follows a psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt to another player. She then addresses the player to try to help his patient and, on the way, learns the art of reading to give a hand. <br /> <br /> House of Games exudes a sordid atmosphere. David Mamet is successful in setting the scene for his film in the basement of the city. The film is also well played, all anxious to bring life and credibility to their characters with the greatest talent. Joe Mantegna plays the role of crook at the heart of the film and, although his performance is a little under-worked, he is still strong and credible as a villain of the play. Lindsay Crouse plays by her side, the psychiatrist seduced by his work and is again credible in his role. She may not be the greatest spectator, but at least she can act. The way the film performs its plot is the main star of the series, however, and you will no doubt be surprised by the way the film always manages to surprise and deceive the viewer. Sometimes it's almost like we're in the thick of the action and we're trapped in the scammers of the movie. Another great thing about this movie is the way it shows the audience how to draw some disadvantages, which is useful if you are interested in earning twenty dollars, for example. Overall, House of Games is a real thrill circuit.
