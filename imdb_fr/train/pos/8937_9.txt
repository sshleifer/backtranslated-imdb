This is a nice example of how an interesting movie can be made without using big stars and important effects. Simply tell a true story about the struggles of two African-American women in a tumultuous century. <br /> <br /> This film challenges us all to look at our own prejudices and see that people are human beings and not white, black people, etc. <br /> <br /> Good movie with a good message.
