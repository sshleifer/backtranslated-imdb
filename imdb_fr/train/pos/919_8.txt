Being a fan of 'Columbo', I was very disappointed with 'Corky Romano'. Although this is certainly a fun movie, the character of Falk Boss Boss is far from the adorable lieutenant he played for many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After "Corky Romano", I was both surprised and pissed off by Mr. Peter Falk. However, after seeing 'Finding John Christmas' and his predecessor, 'A Town Without Christmas', for the first time in a week, I have to say that 'Max', the charming Peter's Falk character in two films, is surely as memorable and kind as "Columbo". Although some parts of the film are quite predictable, such scenes do not detract from the pleasure of seeing the story unfold. I would also like to have recorded these two heart-warming Christmas movies, and I highly recommend them, whether you are a fan of Falk, a Christmas jester, or just someone who loves the occasional movie that feels good, of the week. This film may be lost in the multitude of holiday films designed for television. So be sure to find "Finding John Christmas" before it's too late.
