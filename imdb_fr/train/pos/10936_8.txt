Most of Kong Kong's martial arts movies of the 70's (and 80's) hardly work like movies; In general, there are some well-planned combat sequences, but the plot is simplified to fill the gaps between these nodes - like pornographic movies, in reality. <br /> <br /> But this one does several things well. The most openly is the direction and choreography, which confines each fighter to a "style" - it is really based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comic theater, but the effect works. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is camera language, which uses impressive techniques (even compared to current measurements), modifying the real-time projection speeds at idle, as well as unfiltered views to filtered to indicate the direction of the story to the past or the future. <br /> <br /> Less obvious, but the most powerful and unexpected, is construction. The winner of this contest is determined by whoever "unveils" the story. The master (the writer) sets up a game in which the main character does not know who he is looking for, which is the same situation in which the viewers are. One by one, he discovers who is who, at the same pace as we find. who is who? All this follows a tragedy / a black bow. The end tends to irony, to the "Sting". Much smarter than what we usually get from this genre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the "five venoms" is the model of the "murderers of dead vipers" of Tarantino, extracted from the volumes of "Kill Bill".
