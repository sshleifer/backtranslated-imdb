Why did I enjoy the show until the last episode? Because of the true talent of Melissa Joan Hart and her support team, she has shown that comedy, light humor and deep thought can coexist. What I liked the most was that I could go home after a hard day's work and make me smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to watch because this magical person was so happy in helping others. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Sabrina was a heroine ... even though she was vulnerable in a way that was not so different from ours ... at a very different level; she had at her fingertips powers, wishes, and orders that could be used for good or for evil, and that exist only in many of our imaginations. Almost everything we see, have, know, possess, or even desire can be used for better or for worse, and the way we choose to define it defines who we are. <br /> <br /> She traveled the world and other realms keeping in mind these constant and unshakable ideas: to learn, to live, to laugh and to love. She was always learning to improve her skills for the benefit of everyone around her; she made mistakes while she lived her life, going through different growth paths, because she, her aunts and Salem (the underrated but imperfect hero) did well to demonstrate that even through mistakes, you can always be noble, talented wonderful. <br /> <br /> She has also demonstrated many selfless, educational and loving acts along the way. If that's not enough reason for 10 stars in this war-torn world, where people are so hostile to each other, not realizing how much difference is the spice of life rather than the reason to kill ... . This show was certainly a trip to a better world, a source of inspiration to improve ourselves and a gift to make our chops smile ... I have already heard a doctor say that everything I mentioned above it leads to a healthy "heart" ... and is not that what we all need? :)
