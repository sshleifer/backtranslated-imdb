I sat with my children while we watched this movie. We all thought it was a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth-year bully begins with him and that's what leads to eating worms. <br /> <br /> A bet is made and Billy only has time to eat 10 worms or whatever. From that moment, the bully and his friends are trying to find bad ways to cook, fry or bake earthworms in an attempt to make Billy sick so that he loses the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy stays strong and eats his way to become more and more loved by everyone, even bullies. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you if he wins the bet or not ... you'll just need to watch it to find out but I'll think that if you like good family movies, you'll like the one -this. <br /> <br /> PS Let me add that this movie is not just for boys, I have all the girls and they liked it a lot.
