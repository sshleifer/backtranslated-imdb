This game is amazing. Really, you should get it if you do not have it. Although he is old at the moment, it was amazing when he came out. I think this game will always be a classic. It's just as good a Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend and I sat and played this game for hours trying to beat him, which we finally did. It's not as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a fan of Mario, it's essential. It's fun entertaining and challenging. All you could want from a fantasy game, with the exception of good graphics (well, it came out in 1996). ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
