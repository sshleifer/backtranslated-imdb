Vivah is by no means a classic. However, at the time of hardcore action, special effects and intrigues complex (none of those that Bollywood has yet mastered), it is rather refreshing to see a film as simple as Vivah. The story, as we all know, is a journey between the first meeting of a couple and their eventual marriage after moments of timidity and hard times. No more no less. The music is not quite in the same category as MPK or HAHK, but it does not work either. Two songs stood out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan Abhi Aadha and Hamaari Shaadi were humble. Shahid plays sincerely and shows a lot of potential. It's nice to see him play something other than the cool guy he normally does. Amrita is very kind and plays the role of a docile girl from small town to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher and Seema Biswas are excellent supporters and the rest of the cast is doing a reasonable job. The management of Suraj is simple but effective. The main flaw of the film is the slowness that could test the patience of many young viewers. But overall, a good family film, clean and decent.
