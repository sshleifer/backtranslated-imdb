Brilliant adaptation of the essentially interior monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom of Joseph Strick in the recreation of the endearing portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - a day to celebrate - dual purpose! The director Bravo Strick, the screenwriter Haines, as well as the casting director and the director of photography for the creation of this masterpiece. Gunter Grass's novel, The Tin Drum, filmed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another fine film adaptation of an inner monologue that I compare favorably to Strick's film. <br /> Although there are clearly recognized landmarks in Dublin in the original novel and in the film, there are also recognizable characters, but with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan with whom Dedalus lives proved to be a leading surgeon in Dublin. <br /> <br /> This film, thanks to its excellence, is enriched by additional views. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
