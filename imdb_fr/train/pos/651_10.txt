** possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I have no problem staying awake. It reminds me of 20 years, except that it is even better. As Veronica says, two girls at the same time. This brings out my excitement in me, the informal conversation, these two real real-life chicks, rather than prostitutes, who tease us at every step. I'm going into conversations too. Even if they are completely b.s. sometimes, so what? Every chick, pretty much, whoever I've ever talked to and who is high on herself is usually full of the same bs.s. philosophy. It's just a lot of nonsense and about as sensible as the other b.s. Philosophy chicks are often in: astrological charts. The only problem with this movie is that the guy is almost as feminine as the women, he is in the same b.s. and in a bad mood. The brown chick is actually the most masculine person in the country. <br /> <br /> I think it's a bit funny to see that the brunette chick is so visibly activated by Veronica. She would like to remove the little blonde from Alexander, but Veronica plays it to the end. She is brilliant She makes the brunette understand that there is something that separates them, then she steals the boy-child / man, which is appropriate because they seem to belong to the same age group. The brunette knows she had it before the end, when she fell into the hands while Marlene Deitrich sings at the end of the scene that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this chorus. /> <br /> But do they finally marry, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine an extremely tumultuous relationship that ends in a premarital breakup. They are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones. <br /> <br /> I like the movie. It amused me, it looked nice and it's sexy.
