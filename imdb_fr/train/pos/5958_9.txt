Unlike some comments, mine is positive. This movie takes place around the table with a group of friends, some you like, others you do not like. Some are related - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not harmonious, happy with everyone and everything, type of life - much like real life. Some stories do not evolve, they just happen. But like real families and good friends, they stay together. Wishing parents who buy a baby are such a - hole! You are happy for the end. Poor Delmar is stuck between a rock and a rock, taking care of herself, her mother, her son and trying to keep all their lives together. It does not end with a sunset stroll or a suburban home and all live in a dream world, but is a very real picture of the daily lives of people living from day to day, from month to month. Overall, it's a good story and a good movie!
