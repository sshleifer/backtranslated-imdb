A fairy story of a Martian attempt to colonize the Earth. (The situation must be rather difficult on Mars.) Two state soldiers are investigating the scene of a UFO crash. All that is landed is buried under the ice at Tracy's Pond, but there are tracks in the snow that lead to a nearby restaurant. <br /> <br /> The restaurant has not received customers since eleven o'clock in the morning. Now, a handful of bus passengers are sitting waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were on the bus, although he did not notice who they were. The problem is that there are now SEVEN people waiting for the trip to resume. One of them is an extraterrestrial, but which one? All are suspicious. There is the crazy old man (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to be exercising a sub-rosa spirit. There is an angry businessman who has to go to Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on honeymoon. (Execrable husband's performance, Ron Kipling.) With the exception of couples, no one noticed anyone else. And even couples are wary of each other. Married to her new husband: "I could have sworn you had a mole on your chin." The story continues unrestrained but slightly scary - the phone rings for no reason, the lights turn on and off, the jukebox turns on by itself - and none of this should be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a nice ensemble piece and the climax is worth a laugh. There is no discernable "depth" to this. It's not a moral message about people in the pod pretending to be ordinary citizens. It's not a warning of any kind, it's just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses. <br /> <br /> I always appreciate it when it's on. It is particularly interesting to see John Hoyt as an irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman senator behind the murder of Julius Caesar in the version of Shakespeare's play by MGM. And here he is - with three arms. <br /> <br /> Oops.
