It's an excellent series. You will laugh, you will cry, these great people will be part of your family. The way this family cares about each other and helps each other during their crisis is a great example of how we should live our lives. They do a lot of good things and many bad choices, but they never turn away from the family, they solve their problems. Michelle, the youngest girl, is the cutest thing I've seen. Stephanie, the second grade girl, suffers from Middle Child Syndrome and, with the help of EVERYONE in the family, it's better. DJ, the eldest daughter, is growing, whether her father wants it or not. One thing they all share is that they miss their mother. Danny (daddy), Joey and Uncle Jesse love these kids so much, and it shows in every episode.
