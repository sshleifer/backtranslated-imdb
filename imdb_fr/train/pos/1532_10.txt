This, like Murder She Wrote, is one of those shows that, after a stressful day at school, sit in front of the television and watch. Why? Because I really appreciate it, and it's unfortunate that it's no longer on the air. Dick Van Dyke is incredible, because Dr. Mark Sloan, a doctor turned detective, resolves murder with his son. He is joined by a largely unknown but highly competent support cast, namely his real son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that every series of dresses changes hairstyle. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter a lot, but I particularly liked Michael Tucci as Norman and I was surprised how he had suddenly disappeared. This show is so much fun, with excellent stars, it's sometimes a bit obvious, like Colombo, but in every episode, there's always something to laugh about. In conclusion, a nice series, with two inches in the air and a 10/10. Bethany Cox
