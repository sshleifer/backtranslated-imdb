It was one of my favorite shows when I was a child. The Swedish television channel decided to broadcast it again a few summers ago when I had just finished my first semester of medical school. I was surprised to see the depth to which the organs were explained. Of course, some things are simplified but most were correct (even if it was done 22 years ago!) And quite understandable. I would suggest that all future medical students look at it. It's a great way to learn some basic medical words, for example. Now that I'm in my 7th semester and I think I'll watch the show once again as soon as I buy the DVD box :-)
