In the late 1800s in San Francisco, poor Errol Flynn (James J. Corbett), well dressed, works in a bank and likes to attend local "fights" (boxing) with his colleague and boyfriend Jack Carson (Walter Lowrie). One day, pretty Alexis Smith (Victoria Ware) goes to the "Comstock Bank" where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is so seduced by the elegant beauty of Mrs. Smith that he offers to carry her bag of withdrawal. Smith is secretly caught with the handsome Flynn, but he is discouraged by his audacity. <br /> <br /> The good action of Flynn (in fact, a pick-up attempt) earned him a free subscription to the "Olympic Club" conveniently includes a gym (with boxing equipment). However, Flynn's presumptuous manner and his practical jokes (he tickles men with parallel bars) irritate the members of the "Club". When an English boxing champion goes to the club, members try to get Flynn to fight the man. They hope Flynn will resign, humiliated by his defeat - but Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> The first producer, Robert Buckner, prepares a nice package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Mr. Buckner certainly attended the success of his contribution (script) to the brilliant "Yankee Doodle Dandy" of the studio. Unfortunately, this story is positively ridiculous. There was a "Gentleman Jim" - this story is supposedly the filming of James J. Corbett's true autobiography "The Roar of the Crowd" - but this film has to be significantly fictionalized. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very attractive leading man; he slightly manipulates the script and should have been recognized in the early 1940s as an excellent actor. Many of Flynn's characterizations have been (are?) Neglected as great performances, and this one is. Smith has a strong feminine interest, skillfully transmitting her emotions to the viewer. The director Walsh gives foolishness a smooth and extravagant appearance. The support troop is a treasure trove, ranging from Alan Hale (Pat Corbett) to Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
