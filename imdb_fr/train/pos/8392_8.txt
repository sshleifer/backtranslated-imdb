This film presents clever cinematic techniques in which, instead of capturing the camera's attention by a landscape, there are small details about how a person appears, about the fact that the woman can wear a cocktail hat and to be wrapped in a leaf. How the husband can wear a hat and socks and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely comfortable and comfortable. The provocative position of the woman is another characteristic of the painting that the director chose to let us know that she is a sexually free spirit and that she seeks to obtain the pleasure she seeks without flirting directly or with particular sensitivity what man can feel. The relationship between the wife and the husband is unique. It is an open place in which she will stop at nothing, feel no shame about the way she has behaved and wants to share these facts with him because his main goal is always the fact of their marriage. Nothing and no one can intervene between them. Only the chances of destiny can intervene: his imprisonment during the war and what will follow after his return. A very intriguing and totally absorbing film.
