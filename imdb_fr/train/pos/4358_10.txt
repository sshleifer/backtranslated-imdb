Okay, this movie probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to help offset the misleading odds of the handful of bozo's that gave this movie zero or a 1 star rating. Each segment of this anthology has promising potential and prospects for talented filmmakers ... three of them have had remarkable success in major Hollywood productions. The performances range from rough to impressive, with remarkable turns by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove is perhaps a great melodramatic as a psychotic hypnotist with bizarro's strobe light, and Lance August seems to have been deliberately masked as an unsuspecting laboratory casualty. But on the whole, there are very good laughs and really scary moments. Well worth a visit, so judge for yourself!
