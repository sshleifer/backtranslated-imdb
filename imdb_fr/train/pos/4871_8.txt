It takes a Serbian or at least Balkan familiarity to understand and appreciate many situations, characters and jokes of "Zavet" as well as many other films of Kusturica. See for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with basic features that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, nostalgia for the good days of communist rule and the awakening of the young kid looking his teacher naked to the sound of the Soviet anthem. Kusturica tries not only to deviate from the tragic story of Serbia described in his previous films, but creates a whole world of himself in the process. <br /> <br /> This is neither a political film nor an explicit political film in any case. It's a fun movie above all else. Kusturica creates a set of characters that is important to us. The music plays an active role in this film as in all his other films. His style is direct and grotesque, we now have what he feels about his characters and we know he wants us to feel the same way. The space he develops combines the present, history and magic, and the colors seem to be those of a Rousseau Douanier of modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie either. The main defect is the length; it would have been useful to make modifications and shortenings, because at a given moment the director seems to be short of ideas and the repetitions are presented. Yet it's one of the most captivating, entertaining and moving films I've seen recently.
