It was a great episode, one of the best of both seasons. A horror in the bottom right for a change, with a story that is well above the average episodes of the MSP, if any. A man's wife is almost burned in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving. His airbag worked, not his. She is burned beyond recognition (excellent makeup actually), and has no chance of living without a complete skin transplant. BUT, even in a coma, she continues to die, but brought back to modern technology, and when she dies for a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit. A carnage of course ensues, as well as extremely bloody murders and extremely sexy scenes. What more can you ask for? Not much, because this baby has everything and a very satirical end, which should leave a smile to the faces of most viewers. I just loved the direction of Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn), he has a great talent for horror. Excellent episode is the one I buy for sure.
