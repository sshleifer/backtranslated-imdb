From what I read, many people were disappointed with this movie, compared to Part 1. At first I could understand that, but after a little thought, I think they're wrong to be. Soderbergh goes on to tell Che's life that he started in Part 1. The first part told the story of a revolution from unpromising beginnings to a ultimately successful conclusion. The second part tells the story of a revolution that goes from unpromising beginnings to a totally unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Che's life have had completely different results. He courageously chooses to say the two in a rather simple way. The viewer may feel much better after the first part than the second part, but this is the reality of Che's life and, in my opinion, no fault of the director. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in Part 1, we saw different aspects of the war, because the guerrillas were successful. In Part 2, they can not take a break and we find that their numbers are constantly reduced by death and capture. The capture and death of Che are well treated. The film is greatly improved by the dialogue in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentine. So, if you've seen Part 1, you'll see a very similar story from a very different story in Part 2.
