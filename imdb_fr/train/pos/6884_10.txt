This film miracle is one of those films that have a lasting effect on you. I read a review or two of angry people who, I suppose, are Republican or beating, and their extremist talk about the power of movies to confront people with their darkest secrets. No work of art of this kind has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and it is the miracle of the film. The realism of the film and its performance by Bret Carr is not to be missed. The very nature of its almost interactive effect will cause people to leave the theater released or to question their very identity. Congratulations to the next level of cinema.
