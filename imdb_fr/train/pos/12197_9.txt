It may be the ultimate black movie of all time, if Columbia Studios were not cut off from the Orson Welles original. What we have left is an imperfect but brilliant film that highlights the overwhelming talent of Welles as an actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a dramatic and serious talent. <br /> <br /> 'The Lady From Shanghai' is the hottest and most confusing film noir. Welles, with an unequal accent, describes Michael O'Hara, an Irish companion, who, after a fateful encounter with the seductive and dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth, in a GREAT performance) is practically forced to accept a position as a member of the 'crew. she and her yacht (Everett Sloane) crippled. Elsa, or "Rosalie" as Michael likes to call him, plays the innocent and defenseless doll very well, trapping O'Hara in his web. While lovers lead a not-so-secret adventure at sea, Arthur Bannister's partner in his law firm, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), comes on board. This is a strange and untrustworthy character who offers Michael a unique proposal: he will receive US $ 5,000 to help Grisby simulate the death of Grisby. The plan is for Michael to get rid of all technical details and to put himself in the sun with Elsa. But things do not go as planned. <br /> <br /> Hayworth delivers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrait. Sometimes she seems truly vulnerable and childish, others brutal, exhausted and hard. Always she is brilliantly beautiful, no matter what her situation, she asks that she be soaked in a swimsuit or dressed in black, brandishing a gun. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here and she is far from her famous role of "Gilda". Her husband at the time, Orson Welles, cut his auburn locks for a blond-tinged crop (Columbia boss, furious, Harry Cohn). It was a great marketing ploy, and the change he made is a perfect fit. She is not the benevolent femme fatale of "Gilda," but a dark-hearted predator who views murder as a very useful option. <br /> <br /> The agreement between Welles and Hayworth took place when the couple had extreme difficulties in their marriage. They would divorce after the filming, so it's also a curiosity to give a glimpse of the complicated relationship. They are hateful, not romantic, in love with music. It is therefore difficult to know if they have a real chemistry on the screen. Admittedly, each encounter is powerful and filled with raw sexuality, with Welles as "dude in the fall" (he even admits it himself in the movie!) And Rita as a double cross girl. <br /> <br /> The character of Welles is the typical black "tramp" with little meaning. As evidenced by the use of Welles' voiceover, O'Hara does not use her brain a lot "expect to think of her (Elsa)". Welles usually played with smart and charismatic guys, so his turn here as Michael's weak mind is unusual and very interesting. Indeed, Welles was a very talented actor and he did it well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloane is suitably thin like Hayworth's paralyzed husband. One wonders why he hires Michael. It is obvious that his wife is romantically interested in him, so why does he invite a "threat" on board? One of the interpretations could be that Michael provides his wife with the "service" that Bannister can not in his crippled state. There is definitely something in this theory, which has many implications for Elsa's behavior before she meets her husband (was she some sort of prostitute?) And Grisby's knowledge of Bannister's most intimate secrets. evoked in several scenes. <br /> This is a confusing, complicated movie, with a ultimately flawed plot. We are more interested in the love triangle than in the assassination plot, as in most blacks. Welles gives us many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches, including the rightful culmination of the "Hall of Mirrors". It's a great scene, an end that can almost erase the mistakes earlier in the film and bring it to greatness. This fun scene is visually stunning, with a Dali feel in the painted sets (apparently, Orson painted them himself). The subtle visual images used in the film by Welles enrich the plot and make it an experience that encourages reflection. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is burning and confusing, beautifully presented by the low voice, alternately panting, Rita and helpless, voice of little girl. Hayworth proves her acting abilities in this one, and proves that SHE is the ultimate femme fatale of the "black". Too bad (only a slight, because Rita was a brilliant dancer) to have made so many musicals at once charming, frothy and often forgotten for Columbia in the 40s instead of a black with a dark theme like this one. She was a brilliant actress when she had the chance to show off her talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
