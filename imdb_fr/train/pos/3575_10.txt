Robert Duvall and Glenn Close both played their roles with such credibility, I just cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth showed that she wanted to face the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. "Let him think about what he did," said Robert Duvall's character Joe. The story depicts a rural family struggling with the accidental death of a son by his brother, called "The Stone Boy", which means he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he had done that he became emotionally paralyzed. Then, towards the end, when Arnold, the character of Jason Presson, told a stranger everything, my heart was so broken for him that I was actually thinking of some of the terrible things I had done in my life. I personalized and identified with his character. The roles of Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs, did NOT add much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Andy, Ruth's antagonistic brother, who feminized the woman, as a fool who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a mad lady, hitting Arnold without fear of frustration at his own problems and blaming him for his problems. I could not really feel sorry for those two. Although Lou tries to keep her marriage together, she fails. Both did not deal with their problems effectively. They really did NOTHING for the movie and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as grandfather was touching, as he was the only character to attract Arnold's attention. I felt that his role should have been elaborated. The players were doing just what they thought was adequate and sufficient. However, I loved the end so much that I ended up smiling and crying with joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were once again a family. I really wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
