This film really captures the feeling of freedom ... and what is the freedom of your integrity ... in the most delicious and lightest way possible. Not a serious but hilarious adventure. <br /> <br /> History is a reflection of life. We do not always get what we want right away, but we discover that we get what we need to understand why we did not get what we wanted ... so that we get more than that that we hoped to get! You will get this once you see the movie. <br /> <br /> And this movie really talks about finding love and knowing that we found it and that it totally changed his life. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites of all time .... ..not easy to find but worth the hunt ......... I guarantee you will watch more than one time!
