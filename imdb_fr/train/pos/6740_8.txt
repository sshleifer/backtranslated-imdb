The complete role of the film's main role, that of the policeman torn by his past and on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, was unique in his time, in 1950. <br /> <br /> With music Bewitching and well-written plot, the movie is a prime example of black film at its best. Close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal her anguish. Karl Malden is his boss, his boss, who does not do any nonsense, but who also has compassion for those under his command. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this type of film pretty much his own. If there's a problem, it's with Gene Tierney's breathtaking beauty that seems strangely out of place with the hardened cop. Their cafe scenes, however, are beautiful and sound right. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in the role of his father is perfect, just like Gary Merrill in the role of the hood. Very good lighting and atmosphere. The building where the murderous acts take place very atmospheric, I like the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10.
