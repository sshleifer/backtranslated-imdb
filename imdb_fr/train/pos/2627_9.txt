Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their own movie ... <br /> <br /> "The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata" is a new irreverent interpretation of a classic tale. What a classic tale, ask yourself? Why, "The lion king" of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there is one thing that never fails Disney is narcissism. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean it's not a good movie. These are essentially the events of the "Lion King" as described by Timon and Pumbaa. And that's why you must know the Lion King story by heart to see where they come from. <br /> <br /> Anyway, on a certain level, I was looking at it and thinking, "Oh my god, it's so bad ..." and on another level I was to party. Much of the humor is predictable - I mean, when Pumbaa creates two beds, a big one for him and a little one for Timon, during the first nanosecond, we all know that Timon will take the big one. But that does not prevent it from being hilarious, which, in short, is "Hakuna Matata". That's not what happens, it's like that. <br /> <br /> And a warning: there are also pet jokes. Seriously, did you expect anything else in a movie where Pumbaa takes center stage? But as jokes of farting go, they are particularly good, and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur. <br /> <br /> The talent of the return voice is great. I'm a little surprised to see that some actors were ready to come back, most of them having only two or three lines (if they're lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is particularly welcome. <br /> <br /> The music is also excellent. From "Digga Tunnah" at the beginning to "That's all I need", an adaptation of "Warthog Rhapsody" (a song cut from "The Lion King" and which has improved in this incarnation), the music leaves me <br /> <br /> In the end, Timon and Pumbaa are impressive characters, and even if one can argue that "Hakuna Matata" is simply an excuse to see them in various funny and compromising situations. so be it. It is rare to find characters with whom you just want to spend time. <br /> <br /> Do I start to look scary? <br /> <br /> In both cases, "The Lion King 1 1/2" is great if you have seen 'The Lion King' way too many times. Especially if you think right now "Do not be silly, nothing like seeing the" Lion King "too often!"
