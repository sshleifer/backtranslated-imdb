This little appreciated film is one of my favorites. I can watch it again and again. Dreyfus and Braga are masters, but Raul Julia steals the show! Gomez Addams, a threatening and humorous humor, with the right tone for this irreverent parody of this story often told. <br /> <br /> In general, Moon Over Parador allows you to take a look at the reality and join the fun happening on the screen. Two thumbs up!
