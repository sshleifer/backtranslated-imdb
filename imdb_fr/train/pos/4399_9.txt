The most succinct way to describe Ride With The Devil is to use one word: authenticity. I will not go back over what has already been said about this wonderful film, but I would like to say how much the historical research and the careful attention to detail by the team have undoubtedly been appreciated by this viewer. <br /> <br /> As a history student who is familiar with the period and setting of this film, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fiction films about "Kansas bleeding" ". Yes, freedoms have been taken on real events, as all fictions are likely to do. But the general feeling of the film is genuine. Authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (no recoil on PC here), even the actors look authentic.Even Jewel Kilcher (who has a small role in the film) had the impression to pass a photo of the middle of the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> A few viewers with whom I spoke expressed their disbelief at the stylized dialogue. They can not believe that 19th century farmers "speak like poets". <br /> <br /> What they do not realize is that, at the time of verbal slobbism, the American public of the 19th century was surprisingly literate eloquent bouquet. These people were built on the biblical version of Shakespeare and King James. The writers have reconstructed the most probable verbal styles of these people, judging by the documentation of the time. The stylized dialogue only adds to the magical atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> But in addition to a historical document, this film also works on a visceral level. Beautifully photographed and interpreted, it goes back to the time of the great Western epics. The raid on Lawrence, Kansas, has many times before in so many other less important films, is described with a sense of urgency that places the viewer at the heart of the action. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral conflict and ethics. This film has everything an informed viewer could wish for. <br /> <br /> In a year that has been dominated by overpowering trash like American Beauty, this superb work has been buried by an indifferent studio system. But I'm sure Ride With The Devil will receive the deadline for years to come. Please rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.
