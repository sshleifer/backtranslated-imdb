I did a bit of digging and found a website that pretended to be a joke about the gay world of Greenwich Village after the Second World War. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, wizards and wizards represented this alternative way of life. John Van Druten who wrote the play was apparently gay and very familiar with this village of Greenwich. I thought it was ironic because I had seen Bell, Book and Candle for the first time at the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents had taken me. It was hard to find myself in a movie that did not include horses, machine guns or alien monsters and I was planning to get bored. But, I remember when Jimmy Stewart kissed Kim Novak at the top of the Flatiron and threw his hat as the camera followed him floating on the ground. As the theme of George Duning's glorious love skyrocketed, I suddenly had an idea of ​​what it was like to fall in love. The first love emotions / sexual love amazed me leaving the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent teenager to have been seduced by Kim Novak's direct and surprising look. It is ironic that a homosexual parable has succeeded in reviving heterosexual puberty for many of us. I'm in my late fifties and I saw the movie last night and those same feelings were moved when I watched this hat come up fifty years later. . .
