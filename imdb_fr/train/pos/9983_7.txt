This film focuses on human relationships and their interactions. The main character is an old lady who, at the twilight of her life, begins a journey in her past by analyzing how she lived. This trip is precipitated because of the economic crisis of his son and his intention to place in a retirement home. It's a very honest look at some of the questions we all ask ourselves at one point in life, and there are a lot of secondary ideas to discuss in this film, such as family inheritance, true love, marriage or destiny. Although this type of movie melodramas is not new, it may be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance of the actors and the characters are very credible, but because of the weather, some characters may not be fully developed. I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
