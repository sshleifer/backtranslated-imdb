The suites hardly ever respect the original. This is certainly true in this case. However, if you are a big fan of the original, give it a watch. Although the work of the camera is missing, the character of Brian Krause is annoying, and the plot is a breeze, it's a lot funnier than the first and that's what I find funny about it. <br /> <br /> You do not see this movie waiting for the same performance as in the first movie. Frankly, it's a little different. Rather than stay in his cabin writing scripts, Stanley is in Hollywood to try to realize his dream project, Cabin by the Lake. This film has a very different feel, but it's always good to see Stanley come back into action. <br /> <br /> I give it a 6 out of 10.
