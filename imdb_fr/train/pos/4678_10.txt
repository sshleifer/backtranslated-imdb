I chose to watch this movie at Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and I found it one of the best movies of the festival. The two main actors offer a well-balanced, sensible performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level. The director did an excellent job of bringing the characters and the story to life with a skill not usually found in a production for the first time. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodworking and the city of New York. (Brooklyn in particular). The film revolves around the making of family furniture and weaves a delicate cinematography of carpentry and ordinary life in Brooklyn. Congratulations to the director for this wise choice. <br /> <br /> It's a jewel and I would recommend it with all my heart (I'm sure the poster will be on the screen).
