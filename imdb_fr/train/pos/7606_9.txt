The first series of Lost started with a bang ... literally and slowly slowed down. It may have made some viewers feel comfortable, and people who have started to look half-way would be either bored or just confused. <br /> <br /> I would advise newcomers to the world of Lost to simply watch from the beginning and avoid the slowest episodes. The acting is excellent, but why 5 series are planned ... WHY ??? It simply means that there will be no answer for at least 4 years. Well, I will continue to monitor if the tension and the dialogue are maintained.
