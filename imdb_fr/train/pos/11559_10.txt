The Odd Couple is a comical gem. One of the funniest scripts ever devoted to celluloid - surpassed only by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are the best friends in the world: obsessive-compulsive Felix and sloppy and irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because it is impossible to live with his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the beginning of the film and, after an aborted suicide attempt, he settles with Oscar, his poker buddy. This is the moment when the pleasure begins. <br /> <br /> The whole script is brilliant and contains brilliant one-liners. You probably already know the "F.U." joke but it still works brilliantly because of Matthau's comedic timing. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clean his sinuses in dinner and when the Pigeon sisters are charmed by a very sweet Matthau and Lemmon totally out of his element. This one requires repeated visits!
