Even though Ian Kershaw has distanced himself from this project because of inaccuracies about Hitler's life, it is certainly dramatic, but essential. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler in his later years, in this documentary that deals only with Hitler from his childhood until he became Chancellor of Germany, including The Night of the Long Knives. This TV movie (also a mini-series in two parts) shows how a series of factors allowed Hitler to seize power, for example: the financial disaster of 1930. <br /> <br /> The series follows Hitler and little others, apart from the life of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all, interesting and valuable actors, but I think the film should have been more closely directed with a stronger cinematography; most of the actors are represented in half-body shots, which (for me) gives a theatrical and non-cinematographic posture. The tempo is sometimes drowsy and the film suffers, it lasts about two hours and a half.
