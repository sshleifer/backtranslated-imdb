I just sat for 45 minutes of ROLL at a very nice pace. <br /> <br /> Roll talks about a boy from the country, Mat (Toby Malone) who dreams of becoming a sports star. Mat goes to town and has to be picked up by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved in a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and makes a delivery for him. Needless to say, Mat is drawn into George's world. <br /> <br /> I found it awesome that Matt teaches George a little morality and respect, while George teaches him to relax and enjoy life. Toby and Damien were well united and did a remarkable job. <br /> <br /> All the characters of the film were very well complimented, both policemen were great. David Ngoombujarra brought a great comic relief to the film. Tiny played a nice gangster that reminded me of one of my favorite characters, "Pando", from Two Hands. <br /> <br /> One of the other things I liked about Roll was that it highlighted the cities where I grew up and lived in Perth and Fremantle for 20 years. It was good to see the sites and monuments I grew up with, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> This Rocks 'n' Rolls
