This show was a landmark in American comedy as it was the first sitcom to feature an all-African cast. Unfortunately, this was never broadcast on British television. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor African-American family living in a tower. His father's name is James, he's trying to run the house, but his wife, Florida, is still taking over. The three children are the artist JJ, the bad mood Thelma and the young intellectual child Michael. Willona, ​​the talkative friend of Florida, always enters the house. <br /> <br /> I watched two episodes of this show on youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and the Evans Family - the only two on the site). You may be wondering why an English viewer has seen a show that his country has never been shown or heard of. The answer is as follows. In 1976, the first black sitcoms of Britains are all called "The Fosters". Only two series have been made and it seems now forgotten. But I watched an episode and was really impressed. Then I learned that the scripts were identical to "Good Times". They were exactly the same characters but with different names - Sam Foster was the father, his wife was Pearl Foster and the three children were Sonny (a young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Vilma was Gossipy's friend. (To learn more about The Fosters, I wrote a review about this). Looking at "Good Times", only two things annoyed me. The first theme was the opening theme (awful) and then the laughter of the audience. I like the laughter of the audience, but in this case someone will say a slightly funny phrase and the audience will go crazy and start cheering. Other than that, it was a very entertaining show. Hopefully more episodes will appear on youtube and someone will publish "The Fosters" on DVD in England. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: The Sex and Evans Family - Series 1, Episode 6. The episode of The Foster was called Sex in the Black Community. The other episode I saw, Black Jesus was the title of an episode of "The Fosters"
