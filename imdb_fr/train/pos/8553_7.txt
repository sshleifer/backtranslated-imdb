I just watched the movie, I was afraid it would disappoint me. I was pretty surprised at the end though. The American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all time. yes, it will not be true if I say that I liked it as well as the originals. beta house and the two previous pies have definitely lost something that the first two pies had. It will not become a classic as the first two have already done. but damn it's always funny with a lot of good times and I think it should be the first movie to choose if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school. beta house deserves 6/10 but I gave it 7/10 just to be another slice of PIE.
