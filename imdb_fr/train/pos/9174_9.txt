Jane Eyre has produced many film and television productions, each with some aspects to recommend, but I guess it's the one people will discover and love for decades. It's just a classic (and offers a lot more history than others). Timothy Dalton is completely in his element as Rochester, rarely missing the mark; his performance is surprisingly agile and multicolored, while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character. Jane, of Zelah Clarke, is more cerebral than in another world, but she is a perfect haven for Dalton (who dominates her appropriately!). The nuances of his performance stand out better during a second viewing (once you have absorbed the shock of Dalton's charisma.). There are some technical flaws and some moments where the production values ​​could have been better; although this is roughly a high-end production by the standards of the BBC of that time. But it's the performances that make the real pleasure. Do not miss this one!
