I know it's brutal, and I know it's not PC at all, but it's so funny. If you can put it in perspective that it goes back to the early eighties and that it takes all the stereotypes of the time - and that the film almost makes you laugh - it's really a good comedy. Following the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years, the subject of this film is exaggerated. If you can suspend your politically correct for an hour and a half, do not be shy, so look good. <br /> <br /> P.S. Could someone put this on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS.
