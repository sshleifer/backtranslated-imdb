This movie is so good! Despite Carmen Electra, this must be one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Jamie Kennedy is just amazing and Loren Dean plays very well a spoiled and crazy movie star. The plot is very good too. It's very real and scary. It says here that it's a drama, but it's one of the funniest dramas I've ever seen. Go check it out.
