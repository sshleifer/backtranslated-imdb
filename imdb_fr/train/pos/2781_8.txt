It was an adorable movie. A true film of well-being when you need it. The story is light (it's not over with the wind) but sometimes we need this kind of intrigue. Funny and warm characters, fantastic actor and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV show ER) is ADORABLE in this role. She is definitely a shining new star for Hollywood. Everyone should watch her, she'll be GREAT in the future. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of this film has also been impressive. A good mix of modern and Indian melodies. I danced throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you need a fun movie.
