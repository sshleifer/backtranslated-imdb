Los Debutantes tells the story of two orphaned brothers from the South, who moved south to Santiago after the death of their mother. The older brother, Silvio, confident and dynamic, finds a job at a shady strip club owner after he takes the naïve Victor to his 17 years. <br /> <br /> While Silvio flourished under the tutelage of his boss, the two brothers involved with the owner's sexy and manipulative mistress, Gracia. As the film unfolds, the characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and obvious ways everyone manipulates the next. <br /> <br /> The film is well done, with good cinematography and a fast pace. It's also very sexy, with lots of nudity and explicit sex scenes. He uses the now popular technique of superimposing different scenes from different chronological perspectives. Many people hate movies like this because they do not understand what's going on - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good movies use this device. The plot itself is really nothing new, there are elements of Body Heat, Pulp Fiction and many other good black movies. <br /> <br /> As the different layers are revealed, our understanding of the characters and their motivations evolves. The plot is a little cliché, but it is also intelligent and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I would say it's a nice movie, worth watching, but it's not memorable. I have not seen many films from Chile and it is always interesting to see black films from other countries. If not, rent it if it is available, but do not lose your sleep if it is not.
