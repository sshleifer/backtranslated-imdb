After watching this film last night at Sundance, I realized that much of Nakata's style was created for the first time in this film. Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series, especially the idea that the media is the source of the supernatural. Instead of the cursed video, we rather have a haunted studio and strange pictures appearing on film. In fact, the strange images appearing on the film immediately evoke the accursed video of RINGU. The only thing missing was the obsession with the water running through Nakata's latest movies. The last scenes are quite frightening, with a nod to Murnau, which, with the door opening and the ghost entering the room, immediately reminds me of <br /> <br /> NOSFERATU. A scary movie that will make you think twice before getting on a podium.
