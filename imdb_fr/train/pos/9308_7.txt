If you're used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles such as Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects, I recommend you take a look at this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular, all the actors of this film give very good performances. If you have about eleven dollars (that is, almost nine pounds), I recommend you order it online or rent it from your favorite movie rental agency. Guaranteed to make you laugh, whether you like gangster movies or not. Mad Dog Time / Happy Trigger is one of those movies you'll never forget and watch again and again. You will talk about it so much that your friends will beg to borrow it.
