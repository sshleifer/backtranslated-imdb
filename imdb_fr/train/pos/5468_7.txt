I did not see the restored version, or even a version of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck, until I caught her in MTC. What a beautiful movie! In summary, Lily lives in a clandestine bar, she is made up by her own father since the age of 14! Then he continues to explode and is killed, leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone except for his black cleaning lady Chico, played very well by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city (New York) and decides to use her sex to reach the top. She does it with a lot of style! <br /> <br /> She seduces a chubby employee to go to the ground floor and passes through men like disposable candies! One of them throws his fiancee and kills his stepfather, Lily's sugar-dad, then commits suicide! Lily is barely flashing! STanwyck is great as a girl who really does not know what love is. <br /> <br /> Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, she gets married, but when he is in a difficult financial situation, she bolts. Almost free with Chico and half a million, she realizes she loves Court! Lily is looking for her, but will she be too late? <br /> <br /> This is the best pre-code for Hollywood. Stanwyck is great and the look and music of the film are perfect. It made me think of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another film unfairly ignored with an amoral woman. Those who did not like ultra-romantic movies would not like baby better, those who believed in sex, love and power, love. Highly recommended! To see him!
