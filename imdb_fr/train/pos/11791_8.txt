It's a very intriguing short film by David Lynch, and to say that David Lynch's name is probably enough for a lot of people. This is your typical Lynch shorts. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. The blonde cried, the brunette speaks in a threatening way to the blonde, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> With many moments of silence, but with the haunting music of Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange form of suspense. This short film is a bit like "Mulholland Dr.", a movie that I loved and that I liked too. It's probably mostly for Lynch fans, but there's a chance you'll like that.
