A young mountain dweller with a sad past (Henry Thomas) falls on a young girl abandoned in the woods and immediately falls in love. The city's elders usually support him to keep the child, although a local temptress (Cara Seymour) thinks little about the new family. A determined little girl who takes a long walk and a grim salesman (David Strathairn at its scariest) tell parallel stories that converge in a fatal way. This is a slice of life in the Ozark in the same vein as "Where The Lillies Bloom" and "The Dollmaker". All three were slaughtered in these beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple but simple people of the American people. A minimum of strong language and a brief but sharp violence make this family viewing safe enough.
