I caught the last half of this movie on the cable one night and was struck by its morbidity. Even when one of the two victims is the most deteriorated, the camera continues to work. the persistent plans of his uncovered body and his concentration camp character locked in a body bag are both moving and depressing. do not watch this movie if you are already depressed. Again, do not look at it if you feel really good.
