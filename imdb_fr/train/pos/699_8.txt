I saw Insomniac's nightmare not so long ago for the first time and I must say that I really thought it was pretty good. If you're a fan of Dominic Monaghan, you'll love it. The film hole unfolds in his mind - or does he? The acting game is a little hurried and fragile, and some scenes might be cut off, but it works in the end. The extras on the DVD are as good as the movie, if not more for the Dom fans. There are many candid moments on the set, shots and an excellent interview with the director. All those who have already made an independent film will love to see Tess (the director), Dom and all the other actors of the very small personal setting, trying to break through this terrifying little film. It was very nice and I'm happy to have it in my collection.
