Among the standard action movies to a movie, where action and logic are checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. If the person in charge of the casting had put "good" actors in this film, it would have been worse (with the exception of Richard Dawson who acted well, if you can call play "by yourself"). I love that movie! The running man is in all likelihood a gift from God to man (okay, maybe just men). Certainly the most quoted movie of our time, so I'll separate you from my favorite phrase: "It's all part of the richness of life, Brenda, and you better get used to it." Ahh, more people have been called "Brenda" to quote this movie that I can not imagine.
