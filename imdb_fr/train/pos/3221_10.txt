In the film, Blade Runner is subtly referred to, but one of the most obvious is the fact that the Cain 607 and its unit are all genetic constructs, of lost warrior types. But as my favorite quote from the movie says, "you should have made them smart and fast". Kurt Russell did an amazing job, his facial expressions or his absence in the movies allowed him to tell the story better than the rest of the cast. Even when he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to handle those emotions and her tears after being expelled from the group, or her thrill when he is hugged, and her attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded of Todd of himself and of what he could have been if he had not been chosen as a soldier.
