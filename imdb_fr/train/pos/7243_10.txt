A brilliant Russian émigré conceives the "Stanislavsky" system to win a contract - which makes him, as well as his beautiful wife, the great slam in love with America. <br /> <br /> What could have been just another silly drama is lifted by good production values ​​and an excellent action game with a very nice little comedy status. Some unexpected touches are made to hold the viewer's attention - the way the main cast is introduced as faces on a deck of cards; the introduction of a crazy acrobat into the plot for another reason than to enjoy a little bit of madness; and how a wide variety of different types of Americans are transposed by listening to the broadcast of the last match. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas and Loretta Young are doing very well in Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas Suave & Sophisticated and Miss Young loving passionately and beautifully (although the script pulls her a bit too much on a cigarette). They are fun to watch, even when their behavior is not always the most credible or the most convincing. <br /> <br /> Frank McHugh gives another good performance as a happy ghost writer who loves Miss Young. The delightful Glenda Farrell avoids her perverse, perverse character in a small role as a sad McHugh buddy. Roscoe Karns considers quick dialogue as a raucous radio announcer. Diminutive, Ferdinand Gottschalk is an expert in snobbish bridges. <br /> <br /> The legendary filmmakers will recognize Dewey Robinson as the patron of the belligerent nightclub; Emma Dunn as a sister journalist; Paul Porcasi as owner of the Russian discotheque; Charles Lane as a Russian server; and Jimmy Conlin in kibitzer at the last bridge match - all uncredited. <br /> <br /> The film takes advantage of the craze for the contractual bridge that swept the country since its development in the twenties. He expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and not try to explain anything to the uninformed.
