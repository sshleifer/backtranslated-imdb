Several years ago, the Navy moved away from the realization of "Men of Honor", a film based on the experiences of the fight of the first big black diver of the service to defeat racism virulent. Always eager to support films showing the best side of our navy, the US ship Nimitz and two helicopter assault aircraft carriers with shore facilities were provided to complete this captivating narrative of a young sailor with uncontrollable rage. Part of the film was shot aboard the American ship. Belleau Wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote the screenplay for the beginning of Denzel Washington's director in which he plays a Marine psychiatrist treating Fisher, played with seriousness and depth by Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher is a clearly shining man assigned to the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a front-line helicopter assault platform. Fisher does not seem to be able to avoid launching his own attacks at the slightest provocation from his colleagues. Sent to the doctor as part of a possible pre-separation procedure, Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist, revealing a terrible childhood of neglect and shuddering brutality. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds as a Fisher cautiously but more and more trusted to his doctor and has the courage to be interested in a love, a sailor enlisted by the name of Cheryl, interpreted by the beautiful beauty of Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher reluctantly agrees with the doctor asking long questions that simmer but soon realizes that it is necessary to look for the answers, as painful as they are, to develop and to move away from destructive behavior in search of conflict. <br /> <br /> While all the main characters are black, this story transcends the race while showing unabashedly the evil of exuberant religiosity. concomitant hypocrisy in host families. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films, is an image of gloomy immorality but is nothing compared to the host mother, Ms. Tate (Novella Nelson), who in short, but burning scenes would win - if it existed - Oscar for unstable brutality. <br /> <br /> The films on patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability (everything about transfer and countertransference), but the seriousness of Fisher and his doctor / mentor is striking. It's a good story, well told. Period. <br /> <br /> As it unfolded in the Navy, "Antwone Fisher" is not really a service story like "Men of Honor", an excellent film about crushing racism directed against a real person. . It's not a movie about blacks either. It's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, being able to proclaim as an adult that the victim is still "standing". The persecutors shrink in size and meaning as a courageous and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the help of a caring doctor. <br /> <br /> My only problem is that Washington is second in command, but we are talking to him. as commander. With all the support Navy members listed in the closing credits, someone should have told Director Washington that his character, like all naval officers with a rank of lower commander, is referred to as "Sir". Not a big criticism, is it? :) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie is shown in so few theaters. This deserves a wide distribution. Derek Luke could be nominated for the Oscars. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
