I just thought it was great and I always do it. I am grateful that we can always see things different from what Hollywood has almost flooded us with. Saving Grace is smart and nice - those who feel offended by marijuana would be better off going to see the American bride's movie genre. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a fun movie does not have to be stupid. I laughed at myself for most of the time, but I also wondered what the main character was supposed to do to pay off the debts of her deceased husband. and good game and direction. You could not ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
