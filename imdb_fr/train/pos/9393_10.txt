Some movies you know you'll like from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. His roots go back to "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the 1940s - this is a fine example of the modern film noir in the 90's. Nick Cage plays the lead role of the main character "Unlucky" and entangled in a conspiracy plot between spouses - and his luck only gets worse as he tries to get away from people, the city, violence and threat from Red Rock West. A lot of twists and turns, great performances by Cage, Hopper and Walsh, a hypnotic musical backdrop with a slide guitar, and a flawless staging make it a real pleasure. Preferred Line: When Cage looks at the empty fuel gauge in the escaping car, shakes his head and says, "F *** in 'story of my life."
