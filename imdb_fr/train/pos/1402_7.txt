Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" is probably the weakest film that Paul Verhoeven has directed for such great films as "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop". <br /> <br /> It's probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven found himself stuck with a totally mediocre script and he made the most of it. <br /> <br /> The first part of this film is pretty good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the film falls flat in the second part, if it degenerates into a standard movie or a very bad clone of "Alien". The end is particularly ridiculous <SPOILER>, because Kevin Bacon comes back to life after a number of incidents that should (in the logical sense of the word) have killed him. </ SPOILER>. And all this is rather superficial, indeed: the subject of invisibility is never completely studied. <br /> <br /> But overall, Verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 stars on ****
