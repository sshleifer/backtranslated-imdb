Being a grafted New Yorker, I could be more critical than most people to look at the City Hall. But I must say that before I even talked about the story, I was captivated by the filming and political atmosphere of New York created by director Harold Becker. <br /> <br /> For example, reference is made to the restaurant Woerner's. in Brooklyn where political leader Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There was or was a Woerner restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York City in 1996. Politicians in the borough were particularly favored, even though they had a few others. meeting places. <br /> No surprise, as the screenplay was co-written by Nicholas Pileggi, who still writes stories of political crime and organized crime. He knows the atmosphere very well and knows very well how these two worlds meet as in this film. <br /> <br /> A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes to an unofficial meeting with a relative of Mafia boss Anthony Franciosa and things started and three people were killed, including an innocent boy from 6 years old whose father accompanied him to school. The story overflows and ends inside the city hall itself. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor, a transplanted Louisianan, a state that itself has a tradition of corruption. Cusack discovers more than he had hoped, <br /> <br /> Danny Aiello plays the role of Brooklyn political leader, Frank Anselmo, and for those of you who are not from New York, his character is based Donald Queens, President of Queens Borough, also a victim of a scandal. This is the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew at the time, whose friendship with organized crime and the favors that were done to them are Aiello's business. <br /> <br /> City Hall was Anthony Franciosa's filmed farewell performance, one of the most underrated and undervalued talents of all time. Nobody looks at anyone else when he is. <br /> <br /> The best moment of Al Pacino is when, at the funeral of the young child killed, he takes things in hand and makes it a political triumph. It's a complex part, it's a pretty decent man, but it's caught in the corruption it takes to get into a place like New York. <br /> <br /> For those who want to know more about political life in the Big Apple, the town hall is highly recommended.
