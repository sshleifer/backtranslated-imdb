Class Reunion is a jewel of comedy very discreet. We are in 1982 and the 1972 class of Lizzie Borden High is back for a 10 year meeting. Among them, we find the usual stereotypes, the handsome kid, the baby, the big boy and the nerd, etc., but the former students are in a chaotic night, one of their classmates is Walter Baloer, the wimp of the class who was the subject of a comedy joke by the rest of the class on the graduation party and has since been in a psychiatric home, Walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation ,,, , <br /> <br /> Despite the dark premise, it's really just an excuse for a lot of funny gags and board games. Saying too much could spoil the film, but if you liked the Naked Gun & Airplane movies, you'll love that, and what other movie features a cameo from Chuck Berry's music? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
