I love more recent episodes with CJ and Grandpa. I also liked the scenario with Kate falling away from the principal. I want to know what's happening to Rory, Kerry, Bridget and the family. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with his grandfather. I've always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it's an honor for him to never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and totally believe in him as the father of Kate. This family is so real and fun. The death of John Ritter / Paul Hennessey was terribly sad, but as in real life, these things happen and the way they are written and treated is both funny and sad and always extremely sensitive and loving. But usually a very funny show with lots of laughter and fun.
