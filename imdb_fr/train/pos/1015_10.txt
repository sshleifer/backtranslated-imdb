I wait for each new episode, each rebroadcast with anticipation! The new look of science fiction created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder that I hope will never end. Combining the past with the future is a new twist that fascinates me. Season 9 should be a thrill in itself. I wish Richard Dean Anderson to appear more often in the new season, because I like his dry spirit as much as his tantrums in his character of Jack O'Neill. The other characters add their own originality to the show, which makes them a winner, season after season. You cancel this program in the next three years and you make a big mistake. In addition, you need a bigger role for the Asgard: they are too cool.
