I liked it! The plot was strange, Drew Barrymore and DC were clumsy for both of them. Drews was playing badly in some places, but that could be due to his life at the time. Dennis Christopher was very cool and, as always, he does his best. I am a big fan of Dennis. That's why I bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> I did not have the end! this strange animatronic red skeleton thing looked like a movie school outing, which is OK I suppose but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> ... and all with the knife - if it was so uncomfortable, why did not they get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing to know when it was Doppelganger's strange thing or when it was DC - or was it Dennis all the time? Because the Doppelganger is out with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenes with Patrick, if it was Dennis like the Doppelganger, then I think Patrick would realize it. <br /> <br /> The music was OK but annoying in places, the whole orchestral score seemed to revolve around a theme, but this theme was excessive. <br /> <br /> A big mixture of blood and free shots of Drew naked. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a GPM-Guilty Pleasure movie. Do not read too much in it, do not look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you will not find it. There are moments of diamonds and gaffes to gog-- WATCH IT AND JUST ENJOY YOU!
