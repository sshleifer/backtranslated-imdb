Imagine being so embarrassed by a bureaucracy that a man has spent 8 years of his life and is mentally collapsed to try to solve a case of mass murder almost by himself! The killing technique is clear, but a government that does not want to admit the truth allows a monster to destroy dozens of lives. When I think my work is stressful, I just remember the real story behind this miracle film. The dedication of the main character to duty has been masterfully described by Rea. The comic (and almost tragic) relationship between Rea and the character of Sutherland has made this movie one of my favorite films of the past 5 years. The capture of one of the worst mass murderers in history put me on the edge of my seat. Although not as well advertised and spoken as "the silence of the lamb," the plot was just as suspenseful. Rent or buy this movie today!
