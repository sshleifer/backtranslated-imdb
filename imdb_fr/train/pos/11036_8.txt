A prison cell. Four prisoners-Carrere, a young entrepreneur charged with fraud, a 35-year-old transsexual in the process of transformation, Daisy, a 20-year-old mentally stupid idiot, and Lassalle, a 60-year-old intellectual murdered his wife . Behind a stone slab in the cell, mysteriously detached, they discovered a book: the diary of the former prisoner Danvers, who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century. The diary contains magic formulas that allow Malefique's detainees is one of the scariest and smarter horror movies I've seen this year. The film exudes a dark, somber impression, influenced by the works of HP. Lovecraft, which creates a very scary and disturbing atmosphere. There are a lot of gore in some imaginary and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed. It's a pity that Eric Valette made a remake of "One Missed Call" after his amazing debut. 9 out of 10
