Val Kilmer ... Love him or hate him, sometimes he puts himself under the skin of a character and performs a performance that makes you say "Hey, this guy is a great actor!" He made in the leather pants from Jim in The Doors and he did it in John's leather underpants. <br /> <br /> Turning around the fall and decline of porn king uber John Holmes, Kilmer struts on his knees we solve one of the greatest mysteries of murder hollywood has ever solved for over twenty years, Holmes being the prime suspect in a brutal massacre at Manson. <br /> <br /> What Kilmer does effortlessly is to exhume the lack of life of the celebrity, the nothing to do to anyone thirsty who overwhelms someone who has had it and then lost it.Go to see it, you will know what I mean.
