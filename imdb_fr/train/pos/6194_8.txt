Henry Fool surprised me. I did not expect it to entertain and entertain as well or as strongly as it did. Fay Grim continues to surprise insofar as she offers a solid follow-up to a story that seems not to need it. Once the viewer watched the first 20 minutes of the film, he became blindly aware that it was one of the best sequels of a brilliant independent film. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I'm a little disappointed with Jeff Goldblum's small part, but I'm glad he's part of this short course. He is convincing and delightful as a Fulbright agent. Liam Aiken is also a delight and he describes Ned Grim, the son of Fay and Henry, very well. <br /> <br /> This film is a pleasure for many reasons. I'm happy, for example, to discover that Henry is not really the loser, it seems (by the end of Fool), and to discover that he's actually a genius ... well, that's is really an adorable pen shot. <br /> <br /> I hope they make a third one ... like the end of the trilogy. He seems to be missing. They should name him Ned Fool Grim and it should be Liam who is looking for his father to validate the impressive change in his mother and the feeling of quasi-genius that he feels himself. Assuming, of course, that Fay continues to conceal from his son many of the most important facts about his father. It's like it has to be done. I would buy it. <br /> <br /> Even with more action, it's still not an action movie. It's more of a drama and a plot ... a mystery, sort of. I watch it often. <br /> <br /> He notes a 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend :.
