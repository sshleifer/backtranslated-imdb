As a collector of movie memorabilia, I had to buy the movie poster for this film which, now that I've finally seen it, must be the best. There is nothing more attractive to hang on the wall than a 27x41 inch picture of the man melting. However, there is nothing more awful to insert into your VCR than an image of an hour and a half of the man who melts. At first, I thought this movie was bullshit, but I realized that it had some qualities that made me laugh. The character of Dr. Ted Nelson must be the most tasteless character ever on the big screen. His dialogue is so commonplace that it's amazing! ("It's amazing, it seems to be getting stronger as it melts!) <br /> <br /> And could anyone please tell me how on earth do they know exactly how much time is left to Steve before completely melting and If this film is intended to scare his audience, I think he missed his call.
