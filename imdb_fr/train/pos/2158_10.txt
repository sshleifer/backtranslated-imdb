I do not like "inflation", but I just had to give a 10. I can not think of anything that I did not like. I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it. I'm sure the Hollywood remake I heard about, with J Lo and Richard Gear, will be great, but this original 1996 Japanese version was so moving and provocative for me that it's hard for me to think of either how it could be improved or its setting changed for a different culture. <br /> <br /> A story that I find interesting to watch, and with scenes of fist fights or firearms or something! Imagine it! <br /> <br /> All the characters seemed well developed, even the non-primary characters enjoyed a good character development and a nice roleplaying, and the cast seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> It's always hard to find a good musical movie nowadays, and that may not be quite acceptable (there's a lot of dance learning, but no singing) but I really think that Gene Kelly and those who have championed a prominent place for dance in our lives would have enjoyed this film so much and the role of dance in narrating the story of a middle-aged man who has been successful in a family in Japan looking for something ... he does not know exactly what. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the Japanese team who contributed to this film to create it and realize it.
