This film has a rotting core of morality, yet a sense of unusual justice. So many ordinary people among us would like to "stick to the man". The "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, whom Carla reports to his office. Later, Paul owes $ 70 to Mr. Marchand, the owner of the club. And then there's Paul's parole officer. There seem to be so many questions about the parallel story of this last character. Critics point to it as a weakness in an otherwise well-designed underground ping-pong game between our two protagonists, which intensifies until their lives change dramatically. They are indebted to every agent of the "MAN". One or both could be fired, killed or imprisoned if they do not do what they are told. <br /> <br /> The film has a sense of relief in the end. Carla is finally fucked. His boss is forced to go out to be a fool. Mr. club owner is a pulpy disorder in his own bathroom. They receive the money. And ... they do not have to worry about what they report to the parole officer, because his moral weakness leads him to hide his wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police found to stop it). This is an essential subconscious trigger of the lock that has made us so tight. It does not matter if someone else can get Paul's case back later to supervise his release; for the moment they are free! They could even get away! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> They are stuck to the man!
