Have you ever dreamed of escaping your monotonous and stressful life at school or at work and embarking on a magical adventure with one of your closest friends, dealing with all kinds of dangers and bad guys, and by unveiling the mystery of a lost civilization that is only waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you do not really like fantasy, have you ever wanted to be able to just experience what it's like to be a child again and not have care in the world for a few hours? <br /> <br /> That's exactly what Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky" is. Pazu, a young but very courageous and ambitious engineer, leads a rustic life in a mining town until a girl named Sheeta falls from the sky like an angel and takes her on a journey beyond the clouds, while During all this time, they have pirates and military units in their tracks. Simply put, it's just the incredible adventure that every child dreams of at one time or another, and I can not help but feel my worries fade away every time I see them. <br /> <br /> Among the oldest works of Miyazaki and occupies a prominent place in the everyday world, the film is not as spectacular or deeper in its story as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle or even Princess Mononoke. However, I find it difficult to say that one of these films is superior to the other, because these three films are, at one time or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not confusing, especially for the youngest of viewers. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Castle in the Sky" does not try so much to be an allegory, nor is it a story of transition to adulthood; it's rather one of the best representations of the inside of a child's mind that I have ever seen. Not only are the artwork beautiful, but the use of the children's eye perspective is simply amazing. Whether it's panning the "camera" to see the huge trees or clouds above the head, or the incredible sensation of height when you look at the ground or the ocean while you're at the hundreds I can not help thinking of FEEL, as I am with Pazu and Sheeta, a child in another world, far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even the children themselves do not have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka / San or Chihiro / Haku; Sheeta is the angel of Pazu. He literally fell from the sky into his life someday. This is the perfect person for him since the very beginning. As the film progresses, more and more of their adventurous childhood spirit shines through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they an adorable reminder of what I was, but their endearing friendship never lets go of the film, it only gets stronger until the last picture. For this reason, I fell in love with these two people more than any other Miyazaki couple. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Castle in the Sky" is an easily accessible film. because no matter what kind of casual viewer you are, you'll be sure to find your solution here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, science fiction, romance, even a little western ... it's all there, just about everything people go to the cinema (except perhaps the horror). That's why I can easily recommend it as Miyazaki's first film; it's perfect for those who do not expect to have seen the incredible phantasmagoria of some of his more recent works. <br /> <br /> Even the final song of the film, translated into English, reflects the longing for the discovery of a kind of lost civilization and a kind of soulmate, which could not be found in our worldly lives. "The reason I want so much enlightenment is that you are in one of them ... The earth turns, carrying you, carrying us both, we will meet surely." Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make end songs of Joe Hiasashi's beautiful scores, but this is the only song I've seen that is both a touching love song and an inspiring dream. I found myself on the verge of tears listening to him. <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky" is perhaps not Miyazaki's most developed, most spectacular or most significant work, but it's perfect for her was intended. : a true vision of the fantasy of childhood and a wonderful escape from reality for all adults who wish to have the same wonderful sense of imagination as when they were carefree little ones. Sit down, relax and enjoy what it is.
