Looking at this early work of DeMille, I was once again reinforced the fact that DeMille was far superior to the late DeMille. His attention to the use of light in scenes is remarkable. His pace is very good, which allows to say many things in the space of an hour or so. It's a pity he's not as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie in which I saw Cleo Ridgely. She was remarkable, quite restrained and yet transmitted a broad spectrum of emotions. <br /> <br /> The end is beautiful.
