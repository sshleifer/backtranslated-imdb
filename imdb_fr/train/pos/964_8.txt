"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's film by Takashi Miike, but as you can imagine, it's probably a bit too dark and scary for the youngest. However, older children may well eat it, that is if you play it doubled in English. <br /> <br /> The story is about a young boy who moved with his mother to the countryside. with his grandfather, after a divorce. During a village festival, the boy is chosen as "Kirin rider", a great honor, but with this honor a lot of dangers and adventures of course. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil is within the reach of the woman in a white mini-skirt, boots and a hive of hair, teamed with a diabolical Yokai to dispel the resentment of people and the discarded thrown objects. And this evil manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster heading towards the city of Rage itself, Tokyo. A pretty funny scene has two wrecks watching the monster fly over the city ... said one, "Oh, it's only Gamera". <br /> <br /> The boy became friends with Yokai, who are monsters of a kind, mostly benign, who isolated themselves from humans, and all the Yokai of Japan s unite to fight against evil. <br /> <br /> In many ways, Miike and his team took Yokai's films in the late '60s and early' 70s and turned them into a modern action-adventure movie for (older) children who also associate strange mechanical monsters that made me think of "Transformers". The film has a great look, the effects are fun and some of the humor will just be over the kids' heads, but the older ones could still enjoy it. For adults, there is not much to dislike here, if you are a fan of Japanese monster movies, you will enjoy it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Nice and funny stuff, a little dark sometimes but maybe it's just Miike..and what a crazy race. 8 out of 10
