After becoming completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think there would ever be another show that would be nearly as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is bewitching !! I love this show and I can not turn it off. The richness of the characters, the subtleties of the plot, the beautiful surroundings are all amazing. I am totally and completely addicted. I do not know how the creators do it, but each character touches me deeply. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, deep inside me !!! I do not have a cable, so I rented the series on Netflix. When I put it on, I watch all the episodes at once and I feel sad when it's over. I can not wait for the next record to come to my place. It's probably the best TV show I've ever seen !!!
