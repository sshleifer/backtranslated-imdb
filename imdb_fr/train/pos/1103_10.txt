This film contains some of the greatest comic dialogues and memorable quotes ever assembled in one movie! The plot is somewhat lacking, but jokes are enough to make up the difference. This is a timeless film for all ages that will not fail to please. As a cinematic art, it is very entertaining; and with major stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you be wrong? <br /> <br /> Comic dialogue and timing like this have long been underestimated and very difficult to imitate. A good example of this can be seen in the 1986 edition of The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged on and received bad reviews and commentary from viewers. Real comic dialogue is an art.
