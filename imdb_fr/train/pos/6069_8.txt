....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. the man was wide enough and a scream. I like to watch him interact with Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or whoever he was - he was clearly shooting himself and I think he also made it easier for his guests - as long as they knew how to the advance that it was not a disciplined, 19 take kind of production. Relaxing and being loose was clearly the name of the game. <br /> <br /> He reminds me of guys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis. Good timing, antique gags that kept the audience in stitches for decades, pure pleasure for what he was doing. His sad little clown he played was good too - but in a touching way. <br /> <br /> Personally, I find it great; he has just bought a set of two DVDs from his 1961 or later shows. return things in a loving way for me. I remember seeing him on television at the end of his series when he was curling the series in 1971 or so. <br /> <br /> Look at this if you are a fan or a curious person. It was a riot.
