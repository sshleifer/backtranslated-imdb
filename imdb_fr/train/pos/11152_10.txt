Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a master class in theater, directing, cinematography, editing and writing. I was too young to see it when it was released, and I only saw it for the first time a few years ago, but the film stood the test of time and I watched it several times times since. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is awesome, poignant performances of Voight and Hoffman (although I'm familiar with this movie, I always find myself gushing every time Voight throws one of his innocently painful looks , or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and threatening way) in front of the superb cinematography and superbly mounted sequences of dreams. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that more and more of our filmmakers are not ready to take the risk of making films as interesting visually and audibly as this one. Midnight Cowboy should be forced to watch in all film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
