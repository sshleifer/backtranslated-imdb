I saw this film for the first time when I was a freshman in high school, and the film stuck me through the years. It's not about the soundtrack, the cinematography, or even the dialogue and the game that's a little bad, but about the educational purpose, and the message that underlies it is the most important. Having a child as a teenager and always in high school is not a sin, and it's not really a bad thing either, but it's a problem. Tons of girls I knew all have children now, and I guess they have never watched this great movie, and if so, they clearly did not understand the message. It's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. This is not a myth. You do not necessarily lose your dreams, but they must take a step back in your future because you must first think of a child. <br /> <br /> This film has a clear message behind all this: JUST DIS NO!
