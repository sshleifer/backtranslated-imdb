It's a good movie! I played all the Nancy Drew games and read the books, and I did not expect the movie to be so exciting and funny! If you've never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (The Secret of the Old Clock) to get used to Nancy a little, then watch the movie, because in the movie, they do not really introduce the characters . names quickly. ;) My whole family enjoyed and the plot was extremely interesting. It's an ultimate comeback from Nancy Drew's previous films, which Nancy Drew's actor did not seem to match. This film is very similar to Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. This is so cool! Nancy Drew in love, you have to watch this!
