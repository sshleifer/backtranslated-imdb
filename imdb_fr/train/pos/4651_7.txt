I did not have high expectations for this film, which pleasantly surprised me. The story is sometimes a little strange, but overall, I think his credibility is acceptable. The action scenes are pretty cool and the accompanying music is used to induce some of the patriotic feelings common to American movies. It may not be the best movie of all time, but it is rare in Sweden and I hope to see other similar ones in the future.
