Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher movies. Death scenes are elaborate and most of the acting is good. Marley Shelton played very well the female lead (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the movies "I Know ..."). David Boreanaz, who is the main reason I saw this movie, had a rather small role, but he played it well. Denise Richards is an exception to the list of good actors. She was horrible in that. The only scene I was happy to see her was * SPOILER *, her death scene. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You must watch this before watching "Scream" or "I Know ..." again.
