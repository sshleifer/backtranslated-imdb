Longtime fan of Bette Midler, I must say that her recorded live shows are my favorite. Bette makes us vibrate with her jokes and makes us cry with her ballads. A true rainbow of emotion and talent, Bette shows us her best from her strong repertoire, as well as new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". Covering generations of people, it offers something for everyone. The only Divine Diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer of the moment.
