I saw several comments here about Brando using a Southern accent, some saying it was a mistake. When this film was shot, racism and discrimination were very strong in the South. The Jim Crow laws were still in effect. Civil rights were in their infancy. Could it have been a subtle social comment, a Southern man in love with a woman of another race? In the same way, MASH was a subtle critic of the Vietnam War? Reflections? <br /> <br /> Another comment was made about Myoshi Umeki "cold". Anyone who has been to Japan would understand. The Japanese, at least in my experience, did not tend to show emotion to strangers. Social rules were strict, especially for men who met single women. Americans in Japan were totally foreign to this culture and brutal attempts to meet women shocked women. A characteristic feature of the Japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many US servicemen took for the sign that their advances were well received. Do not forget either that at the time represented in the film, Japan had just been defeated and the occupying forces treated with reluctant acceptance. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible performance of what she would have been her situation. His interaction with American actors reminded me of many memories of my own experiences in the country. I met a pair of pretty girls who, after convincing me that I was not a typical American, taught me their language and culture during my stay in their country.
