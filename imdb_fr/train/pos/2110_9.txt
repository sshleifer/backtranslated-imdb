So much has been written about the film's plot, the wonderful actor's performance, the script, the melancholy, the bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction - what can I add? Just watch one of the most moving and poignant scenes ever recorded. It's Christmas Eve and the character of Frank Morgan (the owner of the shop, Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from his broken marriage and suicide attempt. As each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each of them politely refuses him. They all have plans for their own Christmas Eve. At this point, there is a deep sadness in front of this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene makes me cry easily. Fortunately, we have a happy ending for this very special scene. The new employee, the shopping boy, is the last to leave the store in a beautiful snowy street scene. Desperately, Mr. Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would like to spend the evening with him. He will be delighted with all the wonderful Christmas dishes this racing boy has probably never seen! The guy is overwhelmed, he too is obviously as lonely as Mr. Matuschek and together they can savor a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene, it touches me. If you manage to get this great DVD, watch the beautiful trailer with Frank Morgan posing as Mr. Matuschek and an appearance of the film's director, the talented Ernst Lubitsch. This film is a joy from the beginning to the end.
