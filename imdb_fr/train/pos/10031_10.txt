Previously, I wrote that I loved "Titanic", cried at the end (many times), and I'm a guy in his sixties. I also wondered why this great film, which had won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, received only a score of 7.0 from users of imdb.com. <br /> <br /> user evaluations. While 29.0% of votes gave it a score of 10, 10.7% gave it a rating of 1. In fact, these 10.7% of these irrational users of imdb reduced the overall rating to 7. , 0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden rise of 1 note, with a high score of 10, falling only gradually and then suddenly reversing the course and jumping to level 1) on one thing: the hate of Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I consulted enough chat rooms to observe the jokes of young people (mostly young men) who defame him on the left and right. They absolutely hate this man and they will not want to give him a credit in "Titanic". (To answer another user: I'm NOT talking about someone who really does not like the movie, who gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. Everyone has and has the right to taste his But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 for the "Titanic" set, shot at this level by an inordinate number of 1 ridiculous ratings, is a faithful reflection of the entire movie.) <br /> <br /> Let me demonstrate my point of view by comparing the voting pattern of "Titanic" to five randomly selected users and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point of view). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was quickly removed from theaters after a very bad box office performance. According to voter estimates, 23.2% of voters voted for 9.2% of votes (overall score of 6.1). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) earned 4.3% of 10 and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall score of 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) earned 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) earned 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 reviews (overall rating 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) gets 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). What do all these films have in common with "Titanic"? ALL THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 CLASSIFICATION ARE LOWER !!!! THAT "TITANIC", AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS HAS NEVER BEEN NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD. Again, "Titanic" has 10.7% 1 reviews! Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Can there be any explanation other than Leo factor hatred? <br /> <br />
