As the jacket claims, this film is "Beautifully shot and masterfully edited", and, yes, it is fascinatingly beautiful. The timelessness we perceive in the stoic rock and the ever-flowing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works of Goldsworthy's hands so that, in their very ephemeral, they point to eternity. <br /> <br /> And the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven into it - or in the words of Matthew Arnold of "Dover Beach": <br /> <br /> Listen! you hear the roaring roar Of pebbles that the waves bring back, and throw, On their return, mount the high wire, Start and stop, then start again, With a slow trembling cadence, and bring the eternal note of sadness. At one point, at the end of the film, Goldsworthy states that "words do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more." As a word builder, I do not mind and find it immodest, because the combination of form and time and change, texture, color and composition that Goldsworthy creates meticulously and intuitively is more than just words. <br /> <br /> At another time, he comments, "What is there to stay ... and what is not?" This is his theme. <br /> <br /> I think 20th century artists have realized that even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time; and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing deliberately ephemeral works. The idea was that by underlining the brevity of the lifespan of the most powerful works of humanity, a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of Goldsworthy's work efficiency is of this type. expression. He painstakingly composes a form of straw or leaves within reach of the tide or places it in the river where it will be carried away; and in this process both the composition and its ephemeral are merged. <br /> <br /> Transient and timeless are necessary to understand our world and our place within it. And it is important that these works be done in the context of nature so that what is composed is placed in what is natural. Thus, the stone walls and stone eggs built by Goldsworthy are silent and solid, but we know they are not monuments of eternity, but will remain indefinite, then dissipate and find themselves a state similar to that which existed before our arrival. <br /> <br /> It's an art as it should be art, similar to the spiritual. <br /> <br /> In a way, Goldsworthy's work is an inarticulate understanding. It is an experience purely of time and form. In a sense, his work "responds" to Shelley's famous poem "Ozymandias" by saying that even if the tide carries work, and even if the river dispels the expression, art continues to live thanks to our experience. In the same way, one thinks of Tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured, then, as they are so beautifully and so preciously finished, they are given to the wind, so that we can know that everything is flow. <br /> <br /> However, in the modern world, these works of art continue in the form of photos and videos. Goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer (out of necessity, I would say) and all his works, even those that have failed, he tells us, are photographed so that they can look at them more thoughtfully and see what he has accomplished and what he did. at. <br /> <br /> This film production by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and bewitching music of Fred Frith is not to be missed. This is one of the most beautiful documentaries I have ever seen and one of the most spiritual.
