It was a wonderful little American propaganda film that was both very creative AND openly discussing Nazi atrocities before the full extent of the death camps was revealed. While the end of 1944 and until 1945 would reveal how horrible and perverse they are, this film, unlike other Hollywood movies to date, is the most brutally honest film I've ever seen about Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> The film will begin in a courtroom in the future - after the end of the war (the film was shot in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictitious world court, a Nazi leader is tried for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one, we call witnesses who reveal Grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks. At first, it seems that the film is nice or explains how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. However, after a while, it becomes very obvious that Grimm is only a sadistic monster. These episodes are surprisingly well done and certainly hold your interest and make the film look less like a propaganda than a legitimate drama. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie does a great job considering most of the movies. stars second level actors. There are many scenes and compelling performances - especially the very prescient scene of Jewish extermination towards the end that can only bring you to the brink of tears. It was also interesting to note that at about the same time of the film, there were super-creative scenes that used crosses so that you might not notice at first. All in all, it's a must for history buffs and anyone who wants to see a good movie. <br /> <br /> FYI - This is not supposed to be a serious criticism of the film, but Hitler has been called "this paper hanger". This is a reference to the myth that Hitler had already made money by painting wallpaper. This is actually not true - before he was a "hungry artist", a homeless man and had served well in the German army during the First World War. A horrible person, yes, but never a hanger!
