I totally disagree with anyone who might qualify this movie as "just" entertainment. Located right after the carefree, carefree 20-year-old, during the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, dance is at its heart an edifying story, putting forth a clear message about the best way to withstand these difficult times. Yet this fast-paced, tight-scripted film is far from a dark moral tale. <br /> <br /> In the 30s, Hollywood had the gift of producing entertaining entertainment * and * enlightening the audience, all without losing a film image. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of the * four * films Harry Beaumont made in 1931 - takes just 80 minutes, but his characters are well-developed, his story never seems rushed, and despite his many twists in the intrigue, the public is never left out. <br /> <br /> With the sole exception of Lester Vail, Bob Townsend having a flabby loving interest, the support distribution is consistently strong. It is worth mentioning William Bakewell as Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (best known for Jiminy Cricket's voice) as reporter Bert Scranton and Clark Gable in a secondary role of gangster Jake Luva. <br /> <br /> But this is Joan Crawford's film, and she shines absolutely in this movie. Made at the age of 27, this lesser-known version of Crawford will likely be unrecognizable to those most familiar with his later work. However, here is the proof that well before she won an Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, a wonderful actress with the charisma of carrying a photo to herself. <br /> <br /> Score: EIGHT out of ten
