A unique sci-fi animated movie and, frankly, I love uniqueness, no matter how it tends to be better or worse. This French film is quite interesting to watch, the technical part is innovative, like "Waking Life" that I recently watched. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to get used to the Black-White style, but eventually I love it, the sketch-like images are really fancy! The future world under contract is a symbol of the final destination of the human race and I love it a lot. <br /> <br /> The plot as a whole is perfect for a science fiction. It's not so intriguing, but it's okay, like some Hollywood products, a giant conspiracy on human eternity, a little clich√© and twisted end is not convincing, some developments are too clear and bland, and the whole movie is too long. <br /> <br /> So I think I'm just in love with the style shown by this movie, others are not so good. <br /> <br /> About the eternity of life, I think most people are unanimous in saying that we do not want eternity because it destroys the meaning of life, we cherish our lives because they are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, then the world will become a disaster and a chaos. Leaving someone you love is difficult and heartbreaking, but it's also a way of showing that our lives are authentic and that all emotion is fulfilling his life and making the world colorful and alive.
