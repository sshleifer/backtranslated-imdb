******** Spoilers - Careful ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I am biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I love it and have watched it countless times - and usually discover something new every time. <br /> <br /> I think one of the things I appreciate about this is that Urban Cowboy is about the workers, not the rich people living in Los Angeles or New York. Well, that's true except for Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a boy from a small Texas town who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And that's when Travolta played in good drama movies like Saturday Night Fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys / vouchers in big-budget movies. It's a very good film. The mechanical bull contest and the two-step dance may be ridiculous, but you have to enjoy it for what it is. <br /> <br /> Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with slutty brilliance) - and soon after, they are married and live in the caravan of their dreams. But their relationship becomes a real battle of the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. But in modern times, the roles of men are not so clear. Where can Bud prove that he is a real man? He can do his dangerous job during the day and ride the mechanical bull by night - he can be an "urban cowboy". But Sissy wants to drive his van and she too ride with the mechanical bull. So where does that leave Bud? While Sissy affirms her independence, she lies about the bull and flirts with the ex-prisoner and the prison rodeo star - a real bull rider - Wes (wonderfully fat Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened and Bud and Sissy separate. <br /> <br /> Sissy gets up with Wes, who abuses her. Appearing more, Bud becomes Pam's boyish toy, a rich girl whose dad is in oil and all that that entails. Sissy passes by the trailer to clean it - Pam does not do that kind of thing. She writes a catch-up letter to Bud, but the wicked Pam rips it up and takes credit from Sissy's housework. <br /> <br /> Bud's uncle dies tragically at work when lightning strikes and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance to come to terms, but are too stubborn. Later, the bull's mechanical competition is at Gilley's and you know that Bud will win. Pam realizes that Bud does not like him, but Sissy - he did it for her. Wes tries to steal Gilleys, but do not you know that this urban cowboy, Bud, saves the day and gets the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> Of course you can wonder why Bud and Sissy would go. to Gilleys about every night and "live like pigs". Maybe that contributed to their bad marriage. Or why did not Bud stay with Pam - she was not so bad and had money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had friends as stupid as Marshall and Jessie always trying to separate them: Marshall tells Bud: "She {Sissy} rides this bull better than you!" But part of Urban Cowboy's fun is a little fun - and saying, is not it Bonnie Raitt on stage?
