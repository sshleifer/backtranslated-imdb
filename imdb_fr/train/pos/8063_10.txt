This incredible Oscar winner (4 in total) and the first Academy Award winner by John Ford is simply breathtaking with Max Steiner's breathtaking score. Called an art movie, because Ford had very little money to make this beautiful story about guilt and punishment, greed and stupidity. But what makes this film a classic is the direction, the amazing photography and the use of fog and light, which were so different from the usual American film and more in the tradition of German Expressionism. And Victor McLaglen's Oscar-winning performance under the title of Drunk Gypo is simply incredible. The film takes place mainly in Ireland and Gypo sends a friend of the rebel movement to the English to collect 20 books to give to his girlfriend. But having all this money, he starts to blow it all night and give it, while the leaders of the movement try to find the indicator. The whole film is a night in a dark and hazy Ireland, and a host of memorable characters, but everyone, everyone from Gypo gets closer to him psychologically. If I had to choose three directors to have ALL their movies on a desert island forever, and no one else, John Ford would certainly be one of them. What a truly remarkable film ...
