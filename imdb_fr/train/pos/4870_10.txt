The movie celebrates life. <br /> <br /> The world settles for the innocents and the pure souls and everything has "Happy End", as in the final scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The film has a wonderful soundtrack, a mix of Serbian neo-people, Gypsy music and jazz. <br /> <br /> This film is a piece of visual poetic very refreshing. <br /> <br /> Live the experience of looking like you I was sucked into another colorful, romantic and sometimes rough world. <br /> <br /> Like Mr. Kusturica's film should be.
