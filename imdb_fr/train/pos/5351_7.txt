Although this movie is a bit full of cheeses from the eighties, I have a place for that in my DVD rack and I do not know why. I think I like it because the moral of the story is: "TV is crap, turn it off and go get a life." For those of you who decide to take the message into account, you should try to read the book, which is nothing like the movie. At the end of the story, Richards, wounded to death, eventually crashed a plane into the network building, killing himself and everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time. I read it many years ago, but today it would be difficult not to compare it to 9/11.
