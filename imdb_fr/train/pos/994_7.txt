I watched this movie once and I could see it again, but although Jamie Foxx is good in the film, I think they could have used a "less funny" character like Alvin Sanders. The scenes of Foxx in the prison, for example, when he is confronted with Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) are too funny. David Morse is again a wonderful representative of a cop. His hard but especially silent features are perfectly suited to his role. Once again, Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) at the theater. Morse ends up falling heavily on Hutchinson. They are both perfect for this scenario in every movie. Personally, I like this quality in a film, where actors find themselves in the same situation as a previous film, like those of The Green Mile. Overall, it was a very good movie.
