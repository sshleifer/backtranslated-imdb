This film is a perfect representation of The Nutcracker; the dance is beautiful, the scenery in the background was excellent and I loved this floating bed. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the costumes ... I particularly liked marzipan, the tutu was adorable. The special effects were very good (eg the tree, the bed, etc.) and I liked the rats. I like how they did not make them scary, but cute and hugging. Other than the king, I suppose. <br /> <br /> If you are a very masculine man, you will not enjoy it, but it is a very good film that is suitable for all ages - but not at all levels. testosterone. <br /> <br /> But I have some complaints. <br /> <br /> First, why did they have to put the partner of the Sugar Plum Fairy in these terrible pantyhose? It would hardly make a difference if he was naked! And secondly ... why on Earth were they forced to make Culkin PINK outfit?
