God! Zorro has been the subject of almost as many films as Tarzan and probably as many actors in the lead role. <br /> <br /> This series is one of my personal favorites and, as noted earlier, is one of the top five sound series. Curiously, this is a production that appeared during the year 1939. * At the time of this production, in 1939, Zorro was well known as a literary and cinematographic character (Pulp). The film begins with a small footnote on the history of Mexico's struggle to free itself from the authority of the European monarchy, namely Spain. History invites us to compare ourselves to the American war of independence. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the mythical province of San Mendelito and its "Council". Benito Juarez ** spoke about the relationship of their gold mine with the new Republic of Mexico. Gold shipments must reach Mexico City. Don Francisco's uncle to Diego Vega said he had organized a group of patriots to serve as a protective force for gold convoys. A thug from Don del Oro mob, staged an "insult" and challenged Don Francisco in a duel with swords, Don Frasncisco being executed. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the swordsman dressed in dark mask appears to fight with the sword and after engraving the trademark "Z" on the face of the wicked, he sends it to the afterlife Don Francisco declares his last breath to his winger Ramon (William Corson) that Zorro is his nephew of the city of Los Angeles, he also tries to tell the true identity of Don del Oro, but expires before ending his statement. /> <br /> There is a big reception for Diego at Don Francisco's Hacienda, where Diego disappoints Ramon'sister (also Don Francisco) with his timid act. "A FOP !!", she declares <br /> <br /> Later, Diego and Ramon slip away to join a meeting of volunteers.When they ask, "Who will lead us with Don Francisco now dead?", Ramon declares: "Zorro, we are Zorro's fighting Legion! "There is a great battle with the Legion, now fully dressed in gray, with masks and capes, protecting the Train from gold. Then, Zorro seems stuck in an artificial avalanche for the convoy, while you know the end of the first chapter. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot of writing for a chapter, but like most other serial publications, the first one is longer and there is still a lot of work to do to set up the script. Let's just suffice to say that there are 11 other chapters of good, well filled and filled with action. <br /> <br /> FIGHTING LEGION by ZORRO has all the elements that have contributed to optimal action. We have an unknown evil leader who foments problems between different groups. There are a number of suspects to know who was really behind the 'Don del Oro' mask. We had soldiers, renegade whites, hostile Indians and the Legion. <br /> <br /> In short, we can say without fear that there is everything we can want, and even more, in this series. And, incidentally, they have judiciously chosen not to let the actors affect the Mexican accents. <br /> <br /> As for exactly what here, who distinguishes the ZFL from others? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First of all, he has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score that plays and highlights the drama and action on the screen. The opening theme appears even in an interpretation of the flamenco guitar at Cantina in chapter 1. This is probably the only time such a highly specialized innovation appears in a serial soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Yet, there is an additional feature that really defines the Fighting Legion saga among all the others. In other words, the film not only has a heroic musical theme, but it also contains lyrics. Yes, Legionairres are singing! We hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters! It works really well and adds to the feelings of viewing. <br /> <br /> When the series premiered on local television (circa 1955), all members of the gang immediately recognized Reed Hadley's voice. owned by Captain Braddock of RACKET SQUAD, the television series. Mr. Hadley had a very distinctive and serious voice. *** He also handled the role very well. His costume and especially his elongated mask were very beautiful and probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a small mistake. Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) addresses the San Mendelito Council because he was around 18 at the time (1824) and, although he may later be one of the greatest characters in the history of Mexico, it had not yet reached such importance. Its inclusion in the story was probably intended to take advantage of Warner Brothers' release of JUAREZ that year, starring Paul Muni in the lead role. <br /> <br /> This is not only my choice among the 5 best sound series, but also my favorite film of Zorro. <br /> <br /> * We remember the big harvest of this year's high-flying films. With GONE WITH THE WIND, M.SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE MOUSE AND THE MEN, A MILLION PEOPLE, ZENOBIE, WE WANT OUR MOMIE, were all among the products of this year. <br /> <br /> ** Once again, Juarez only reached national importance in 1850, about 25 years later. In addition, political subdivisions are called "provinces" in history. In reality, they are called "states". Just as we call ourselves the United States of America, the southerners of the border also call them the United States of Mexico, their republic. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley played an important role in some very "A" photos. in which his richly toned voice is exploited wisely. Watch and listen to his story in THE HOUSE ON 92nd Street (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
