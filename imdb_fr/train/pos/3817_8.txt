If you have experienced a tragedy in your life, whether at home or in someone around you, the stages of this woman's suffering (but, in my opinion, it could easily have been a man too) are very real. It's a film about not being able to manage your pain, not knowing what to do to get by. Obviously, it's also a film about not knowing how to help a loved one overcome their pain. It's a film that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. It's a film that could push someone beyond the limits ... which hardly sounds like a recommendation. I'm not sure to recommend someone to go see this film, especially a loved one, but for me ... it's a film that puts things in perspective, shows real pain and is very useful to be alive. It makes you realize that you or the person close to you have experienced the pain, that all the things that worry you are so unimportant
