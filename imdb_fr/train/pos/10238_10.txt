People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a film, and this film is no exception. Some movies that I like have gone bad at the box office but, I'm happy to say, this film is not part of it (more than nine million dollars, which, in my opinion, was not bad for the era). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was modern too, which is unusual for an animated film. I did not think Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Cirus" was too scary for little kids (the target audience of this movie), but I thought what had happened to the scary teacher in the end was a little too dark for a movie kid. Overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved for years.
