Every country that has an active film industry has a healthy artist (and maybe even a crazy artist) who produces movies that you can only understand perfectly when you're part of this country. I guess Hundstage is such a movie. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, disturbed, strange, hateful. But they still have enough money to buy cars and big houses to listen. And they certainly do a lot of strange things here that may seem "normal" to them because they do it all their lives. From a human point of view, you can now easily follow the film and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a good film of Austrian art films. <br /> <br /> But if you live here and you know people, you see the characters in Hundstage as the tumor of society. An increasingly crazy society day by day, creating its own rules that no one else can understand, overthrows the social system from within. And you see people. Sitting in the park, standing at the corner of the opposite street, queuing in the same line. Maybe you meet them at a bar or disco where you can go. Maybe you even work with them in your job or they live near you. You start hating them without knowing why. You will try to escape, but you can not. Maybe you will end up like them. But that seems "normal" to you because you do it now all your life ... <br /> <br /> Life is not so bright although Austria is one of the richest countries of the world. He has beautiful people ... but some are ugly too. Many hard-working people do their best ... but there are others who rise on the backs of others and destroy everything the Austrian people have built up to now. <br /> <br /> A very pessimistic film.
