Surreal black film released shortly after the "real" classics of the genre "The Maltese Falcon", "Double Indemnity" and "The postman always rings twice". Welles films should not be compared to others. He played according to different rules. In fact, he was playing. It starts where the other femme fatale films stop, so that the vaguely logical (but interesting) whodunit is enhanced with a display of Wellesian scenes (typical fast-fire style), dialogues (a lot of hard philosophy ") and unusual games (good Hayworth presumably intentionally unidimensional). For Welles, "genre" may have meant "formula", but he seemed to like using the "mysteries" as background for his "entertainment".
