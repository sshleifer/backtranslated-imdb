It's not sophisticated and nobody in the credits had a good career, but taken as a whole, because there are no famous personalities; the film seems more realistic than some big-budget and well-shot movies. <br /> <br /> A film made for a few dollars, worthy of being watched, should give hope to all those who would be filmmakers and actors to want. The problem with this film is that it was shot in the worst possible time. Television was recovering the revenues of the film industry and this film could easily have been broadcast on television. By 1950, all television rates would be eligible for the "G" rating. The film industry started producing more "adult" films that could not be shown on television at a time when television did not dare show the sex and skin of today's commercials.
