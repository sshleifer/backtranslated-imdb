I must say that I totally loved the movie. There were fun times, comforting parties, just fine. Personally, I really liked the film because it's finally something that I can understand with my childhood. In my opinion, this film is more aimed at young homosexuals. This shows how a homosexual boy would be treated if he grew up. Like all other young female boys, I will never remember all these taunts, insults and ignorance, and finally, a film that illustrates how difficult it is to grow up gay. So, I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. Probably should not really look at it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
