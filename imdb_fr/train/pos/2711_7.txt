When I think of "Women in Prison", I often think of dark Italo-Spanish productions by directors such as Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei; and although these films are often very sordid, they are also very similar and once you've seen one; you might as well have seen them all. I must admit that these types of movies are not usually my favorite; but in reality, the idea that women behind bars have been very well done on several occasions outside of Italy and Spain; and Roger Corman's New World Pictures is responsible for some of the best of them. Caged Heat is the first film by Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme, and it's a small, well-made movie with a lot of entertainment value! Naturally, the film focuses on the story of a girl who is caught committing a crime and is sent to a women's prison where she is introduced to a crowd of violent inmates. This prison is headed by Superintendent McQueen; and she takes offense at a play by the girls; leading them to prepare their escape. <br /> <br /> This film is much lighter on the film than I am used to in a film of women in prison; but that's more than offset by big action scenes and dialogues, and that's what makes Caged Heat entertain everywhere. It must be said that the plot is neither particularly original nor ambitious and that it follows a structure similar to that of many other women in the prison films that preceded it; but that's not a big problem. The film never becomes boring and is full of remarkable scenes; including an escape attempt while working in a field and a bank robbery. The film is helped by the direction assured by the man who was going to direct the masterpiece The silence of the lambs and a big distribution with many extras; including the legendary Barbara Steele as the director of the prison. Overall, Caged Heat may not leave much to the viewer by the end; but it's a brilliantly entertaining little Grindhouse movie, and anyone who appreciates this type of movie will surely want to find it.
