Obviously, not many people have seen this movie because no one has posted any other comments. This is not a film to miss. After all, he won the George Peabody Award and the Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield should have won a prize for his impressive performance in this film. Eugene Logan, co-author of this film for television, was also part of another film about humanity, or his loss, as technical advisor to Truman Capote's movie, The Glass House. This film is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I'll post another letter explaining how Eugene Logan became the technical advisor of a film from a person as extraordinary as Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this and I hope you find a way to watch these two films.
