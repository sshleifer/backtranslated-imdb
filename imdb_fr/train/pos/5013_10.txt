If people did not know who Barbra Streisand was before that, ... (is it POSSIBLE?) ... they surely knew who she was after! <br /> <br /> This show has won 5 Emmys, & stands out as one of the best things Streisand has ever achieved. <br /> <br /> It consists of 3 acts .... <br /> <br /> ACT I ... Barbra sings the standards of the room to the room filled with musicians, including a segment where she became a little girl again, ending with a splendid version of her signature song (at the time) ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... A musical tour of Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra sings songs about poverty. It's better than it sounds ... <br /> <br /> ACT III ..... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some great songs, like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again, "and a" Funny Girl "medley .... <br /> <br /> Overall, much of the history of television, made by one of the world's greatest artists !
