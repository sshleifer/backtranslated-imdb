I filmed this film around 1990 by chance and without knowing what I had to do. This may have escaped many horror fans, thinking it was a typical prison movie, and those who understood it did not like it, because that was not what it was. they wanted to see. The factors mentioned above are probably the reasons why it is poorly rated, but ignore it and give it a whirlwind if you are a fan of the genre. <br /> <br /> He has strong points in all the scenario and ambiance departments to act and the prison itself. <br /> <br /> An absolute diamond, a film that I still have on video today. Check it out.
