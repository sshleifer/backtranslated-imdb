All films made before 1912 must really be viewed with the sense of time and place. <br /> <br /> In 1894, the men of the Lumière family [father: Antoine (1840-1911), son: Auguste and Louis] owned and managed a photographic plate and paper manufacturing plant. Not a small business The factory had more than 200 employees who were receiving pensions and social security benefits - which was innovative at the time. It was located in Montplaisir, in the suburbs of Lyon, France. What led Louis Lumière to take an interest in the construction of a cinematograph in 1894 remains open to speculation. My suggestion is that the appearance of the Kinetoscope (peep-show apparatus) of the Edison organization, in Paris in the autumn of 1894, provides the catalyst. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Dickson, a staff member at Edison, invented a film camera the size of a upright piano, patented in February 1893. It was powered by electricity (powered by heavy storage batteries). This huge band of celluloid film pumping the Eastman company) in front of a lens at about 40 frames per second (fps). It was installed as an almost immobile object in "Black Maria" (essentially the first movie studio.) The machines Kinetescope presented staged presentations (less than a minute) filmed in this studio. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumière invested in the invention of a camera. He realized that, even at 16 ips celluloid film, the persistence of the vision of the human eye / brain would allow to perceive a normal movement. His camera, nicknamed the cinematograph, was about the size of a large shoebox and had a detachable film store that stowed enough film to make a camera's life and lightness. (It can be converted to a printer or projector with the addition of a projection screen) at around 16 frames per second. light source) made it portable enough to be taken anywhere to record an event (provided you had enough sunlight.) In the spring of 1895, Louis filmed: a trick led by riders; a house on fire with firefighters arriving and watering the building engulfed with water; and a number of other scenes in and around Lyon. Using a Molteni light bulb, he transformed the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists gathered in the reception room of the Revue Generales des Sciences. The images were projected on a screen five meters away from the lens. The screen was stretched in a door between two rooms. During a meeting of professional photographers, Louis photographed the delegates who arrived the same evening and showed them films of their arrival. <br /> <br /> Praised by the scientific and photographic circles, Louis decided a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year. Since each of his films would last about a minute, he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation. For one of these films, he installed his camera at the entrance of his factory, photographing the exit of the employees at the time of the quitting. <br /> <br /> The public place chosen by Antoine - who offered himself as "the huckster of the carnival" "for the Cinematograph - was the Indian Salon of the Grand Café on the Boulevard des Capucines in Paris. was a winter Saturday night, December 28, 1895. At the first hearing, they were shown a projected view of the Lumiere factory outside (with closed doors.) Some were pained to see a routine slide show of photographs of light, but then the crank of the camera / projector was turned and the movement started, Louis had an innate sense of making a film, which has a beginning, a middle and an end. people start to leave their place of work, in the middle, people flock - many trying to ignore the camera and the cameraman, because they seem happy to leave a day of work behind them.In the end, the doors of the factory are closed. <br /> <br /> And this was the first film projected to entertain the general public.
