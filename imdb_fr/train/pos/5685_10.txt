Congratulations to the director and the cast for such a realistic film. Realism, lack of glamor and despair attracted me to the film and held me back. I was really impressed by the way the dates and information were relayed in the movie. that is, newspapers, letters, etc. It made the film move so fast that I did not feel the urge to make a quick advance once. Personally, I thought all the principles were doing great work ... It was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such challenging roles. It made me want to cry sometimes. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... his performances of this nature leave me generally impressed. Overall, it's a brilliant movie not to be missed!
