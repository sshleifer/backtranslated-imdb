A MUST SEE! I saw WHIPPED during a screening in the press and it was hilarious. We are constantly talking laughing. SOMETHING ABOUT MARY looks like a sinuous drama. Amanda Peet shouts the quality of stars with her winning combination of beauty, brains and serious gaming ability. Peter Cohen, the director, has produced a cutting-edge film that shows the raw interior of male egoism in the world of dating in the city. For all this comedy, Whipped succeeds with his intelligence. Which is so rare for a first director, especially with a romantic comedy. It's a major talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber complete the cast with depth and very good performances, as far as they would be slick lady men. You have to see these guys go to work and get caught in Peet's web. Check out the trailer on whipped.com, worth the 3 minute download.
