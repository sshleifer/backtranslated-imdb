Presenting Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a cute film, but in my opinion, it could have been better. Judy Garland is great, as always, but some scenes from the movie seem out of place and the love affair between her and Van Heflin is growing too fast. <br /> <br /> I mean, one minute he's ready to fight, but the next minute he falls in love with her. I think that this production, the editing of the film and the screenplay (even if the photography was superb, the scenery was beautiful and the costumes as well) could have been a little better. It's as if the production was too hurried. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors were also good, especially little Janet Chapman as second youngest daughter, Rosie. At the age of 11, she looks very cute and it's unfortunate that she has not evolved to become a comic actress teenager. She's a lot better in this film than in her previous Warner Brothers movies in the late 1930s (except for Broadway Musketeers 1938, she's really good at it) when she tried to turn her into a Shirley hybrid Temple / Sybil Jason. Overall, this movie could be better, but in the end, Judy gave it all.
