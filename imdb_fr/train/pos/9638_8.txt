This film was rather a passage to manhood for a homosexual man and how he had to deal with everyone. His mother is depressed, her younger sister is suffering, her elder sister is accepting a little. The relationship is good with his boyfriend / exhooker and he leaves his family to try his hand at this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy looks at him and says it does not really mean anything. Our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and ends up leaving, abandoning his new lover and starting again. We have to start over and watch, without participating, happiness. So maybe things will be better for him in the future. The end was a little disappointing, but the whole movie was quite realistic. I will let this real end escape us with a high score.
