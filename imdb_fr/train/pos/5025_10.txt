Dude, some of you have to relax. This film was an artistic genius. Instead of seeking a reasoning or a message to justify it in your reality, why do not you understand that it is a fiction? A story. Entertainment, for the sake of God (no pun intended). It seems to me that too many people here are trying to criticize the cinema - and they are doing badly. I am so impressed by Bill Paxton's film and staging work that I will contact him personally to tell him. You know, if you did not try to analyze the possibility of a scenario, you could just enjoy the movie. Me and all my friends did!
