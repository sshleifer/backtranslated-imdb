Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) has spent most of her life caring for her father. Now that he's dead, she's free - but does not know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who fled a monastery to taste more of life. They meet accidentally in Algiers, fall in love and get married. But he can not leave his past behind and she can not live without him ... <br /> <br /> An exaggerated romance, full of dialogues and hysterical situations. Dietrich and Boyer do their best to give good performances, but NO ONE could get away with some of their replicas! Yet, in a way, it's a classic. It was shot in magnificent Technicolor (try to see it on DVD), where every frame is breathtaking. Dietrich is always dressed until 9 (even in the middle of the desert) and adopts hysterical postures to show his clothes and his body. Boyer simply walks around, looks shocked (no shock there). Still, I never got bored. It was wonderful to watch and the stupid, nonstop dialogue kept me in the ranks. The end almost made me fall from my chair because I laughed so hard! Now, I love nerdy love stories and give them a lot of space, but really, it's amazing! It also lasts 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a camp classic, I give him a 8. As a serious movie, a 1.
