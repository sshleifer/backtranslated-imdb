Ironically, for a piece that the film or video has not been available for so long, ARMS AND THE MAN has been quite often available on stage over the years since its inception in 1894 - largely because it's so well aged as a solid satire of nature. heroism and the affairs of war. ARMS AND THE MAN seems to be becoming more and more relevant and topical. <br /> <br /> This is the piece that Oscar has converted (leaving aside most of Shaw's best ideas) into a successful operetta. , THE SOLDIER OF CHOCOLATE (when Hollywood came here *, they left the last vestiges of Shaw aside rather than paying for the rights - he was, at that time, an Oscar himself). While Shaw's best has always been his ideas and dialogue rather than his naked intrigues, in ARMS AND THE MAN the plot is also shining and the master manages happy endings for all concerned. <br /> <br /> The young Raina (Helena Bonham Carter), daughter of an officer and the richest man in her city, is engaged to a dashing officer of the Bulgarian cavalry and everything seems to be going well. that a ruined Swiss mercenary (Pip Torrens) on the other side mounts his escape pipe fleeing the battle where his army was routed. As usual in a satire Shaw, nothing is like in the beginning, and social conventions oppose the light of a simple reason - and not so simple. There are no "good guys" or "bad guys", but people from different classes who do their best - as if life is better - and of course with Shaw, the spirit is fine refined by all concerned. The first film version (from Shaw's own script) (1932) of this satire of the most traditional and fun scene, and one of his first to make a real success of this side of the Atlantic, has long been among the missing. Shaw did not sell the screen rights to his plays - he only granted them for a period of 5 years. It appeared that with the rapid evolution of sound technology, the 1932 films appeared primitive only a few years later, Shaw did not renew the license to show it. . As a result, we are extremely indebted to the BBC for finally releasing its 1987 version in a DVD box with nine other brilliant pieces. (A little sad, PYGMALION, whom many consider Shaw's best, does not appear in this set in a production with Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers.) <br /> <br /> Even coupled, as on his DVD, with a less impressive act, A MAN OF DESTIN, ARMS AND MAN is a real treasure. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter has continued, after being cut in television roles like this one, towards a great film career that will bring many viewers to this leading role. They should not be disappointed, because Ms. Carter gives a performance that corresponds to the superimposed innocence that the public expects of her, but under the somewhat pedestrian direction of James Cellan Jones (and despite the consistently beautiful and well observed physical production of the BBC), the mischievous fire of the role (and its indignation at being underestimated in the last act) represents only 80% of its potential. <br /> <br /> The same can be said of the real star of the play, Pip Torrens, as Bluntschli the "Swiss". It's a nice, attractive performance, but not for the implied physical comedy in the early scene where the young soldier can hardly stay awake despite his mortal danger. <br /> <br /> Despite these reservations, it is a solid production of a wonderful game transferred to the small screen with aplomb. It deserves to be seen widely and, ideally, to offer a big-screen remake even more alive with the style and zest of the recent remake of Wilde's AN IDEAL HUSBAND. Virtually every arm and man must be cherished, and with luck we may even be able to see the original version of 1932. Up to one or other of the surfaces, this production will appeal to all those who like the good Shaw.
