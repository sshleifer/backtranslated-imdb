This film is not morbid or depressing. It's sad, because AIDS in the early 90s was sad. But his true message is that of love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom have a long-term relationship. Their devotion to one another is obvious right away, and as the ravages of AIDS intensify and become the lifeblood of their lives, you will find strength and commitment that make your heart so hot. <br /> <br /> When "Silverlake Life" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and healthcare, as a counselor in an HIV / AIDS clinic . The film spoke to me like no other film of its era on AIDS could do, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the experiences I saw daily in real life. I knew first-hand what it was like to watch AIDS bring down formerly vibrant, young and healthy people; Seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the movie was very similar to seeing my real friends deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still concerns me.
