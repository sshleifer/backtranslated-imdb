This is a great movie for all McCartney and Beatles fans! Splendid weather is guaranteed for all.The audience (with celebrities such as Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) is, as always, quite incredible: from little children to old They know the words of all songs by heart, and some cry when Paul breaks into "Merle" "yesterday" "All my magnets" and all the treasures of his catalog (which, with the exception of John Lennon and Dylan, can claim such a repertoire?) There are two moments particularly moving: <br /> <br /> -The double tribute to Lennon and Harrison; the first "here today" was played solo (the title appeared in "tug of war" 1982 and was his best track), then "something" when Paul uses a ukulele. <br /> <br /> - "The long and winding road" renditions, a key moment, when Paul's voice cracks, as he is transferred tears to the eyes of members of the film crew in front of the stage . <br /> <br /> I remember, in the early seventies, when people scorned Paul because he was not involved in politics, like his ex-partner. They had to change their minds because Paul is a committed artist: "Glory is a great reason to allow charity". The film shows different aspects of Paul's activities, an artist who is anything but selfish.
