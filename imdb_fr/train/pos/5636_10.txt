In "Brave New Girl", Holly comes from a small Texas town, sings "The Texas Yellow Rose" at a local competition and is admitted to a prestigious Philadelphia University of the Arts. From there, the film becomes a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this film. It was full of great songs and actors and characters that made him move at a very good pace. The acting was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were exceptional, as was Nick Roth. The work of the camera was really well done and I was very happy with the end (it seems that a suite could be considered). Congratulations to the director and all the others who participated in this production. A jewel in the film archive.
