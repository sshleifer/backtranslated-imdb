A French film Ester Williams would like. But synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a Parisian suburb who were. There is no doubt that Sciamma's sympathy lies in the fact that all boys are described as "animals" but in reality, only the three girls are in the center of attention and for the entire time, the few adults and the other teenagers are mostly in the background. Marie is a girl's stick, unattractive, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and imposes herself on Floriane (a beauty of quality Renascence by a critic) and she is also a friend of convenience for Anna: it is not unattractive, but for her, the time of the perfection of her body was short, and now she is a teenager in a woman's body. It follows a journey towards self-realization without a road map, but the three aspects are not natural: where is the gaiety and the insane chatter of youth? While the denouement was breathtaking, with the absorption of Floriane beautifully portrayed, as well as the magnificent union of Marie and Anne, it seemed abstract, the puppets of Sciamma.
