Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top ... I highly recommend this movie. In my opinion, his performance was Oscars material! The only sad fact here is that Universal has not made sure that this film is available on all video formats, whether on tape or on DVD. They ignore a very good movie. But Universal has little regard for its library on DVD, which is sad. If you have the chance to see this somewhere (you do not know why it's rarely used on a cable), see it! I will not go down in history because I think most people would rather have an opinion on the film and too many "critics" spend hours writing about the story, which is available anywhere. <br /> <br /> to 10!
