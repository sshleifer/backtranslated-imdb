Probably the best movie of the year for me. This little French film is centered on the office secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), who spends her days doing the work of other men, without credit, and being at the origin of their contemptuous conversation and conversation that 'proves too clear for her because, partially deaf, she reads the lips. A change starts when she hires Paul (Vincent Cassel) as an assistant, his new parolee. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the film. Mutual dependence, for very different reasons, binds them together. Carla becomes attracted to Paul and makes him feel attractive for what seems to be the first time. Paul does nothing to dispel his feelings because he needs his help. He owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal it that will involve Carlas's ability to read the lips. I think the main factor that drives the film above a suspense / medium drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the movie, regardless of the other characters on the screen, you can feel this amazing link between Carla and Paul. I do not remember when I witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the French Caesar for best actress). You never feel like you're watching a role, it's really Carla. The chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. It makes an unattractive character both attractive and attractive. I loved this movie because of these two people, and every time I finished watching it, I wanted to go back to the movies and start playing with them again.
