At first, I had doubts about this film (only because of the subject), but the richly drawn characters, the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt and the dramatic conclusion are worth it. At first I had trouble distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters, but as the film progressed they became more and more different. I am always haunted by the final scene.
