The final of the season sent mixed messages, I felt feelings of joy, and also feelings of being lied to and deceived. Roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire nine season was a lie because her husband, Dan, had died. She also admits that the family never won the lottery and that Season 9 was a lie, she was just what she wanted or wanted it to be. I still do not understand when she said that Becky ended up with David and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark said they were pregnant. So I think that's exactly what she wanted, but it was not. The final of the season was therefore good, but aroused mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)
