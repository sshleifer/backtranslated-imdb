Rupert Friend gives a show, like Prince Albert, which raises "The Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He is gorgeous As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark and deep depression after the death of Prince Albert. I understood in the eyes of Ruper Friend. The film does not lead us to death but to an incident that could very well have cost him his life. An act of love I believed him, or should I say, him. I thought what he felt was real. Nothing and no one approaches the finesse and depth of Friend's characterization. Emily Blunt is good but I did not believe for a minute that she was Victoria. No real sense of the period. It may not be his fault, but his prince deserved the crown.
