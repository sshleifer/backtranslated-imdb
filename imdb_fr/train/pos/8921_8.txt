I look at this page, and it seems to me to disapprove of having to listen to someone walking around and unleashing a real classic. Of course, I agree to let everyone have their opinion, but here is mine: <br /> <br /> This film should not miss any observer of classic horror, and should be seen by de many casual viewers around the world. Of course, he has lost some of his talent and greatness with age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but that's not why you should like it. <br /> <br /> You should like it because it's a scary movie. , even for today's standards. It's all about the ickyness will make you crack as much as the original audience, so do not slap a classic if you have not given him the chance. Look at it, but not with a critical attitude. Watch it for fun, as originally planned.
