A number of factors allow me to say that I still consider it to be the most important science-fiction film ever made, despite the acting, the outdated dialogue, and so on. <br /> <br /> First, there is the scale of imagination to describe the Krell, a humanoid race from the planet, now all dead, 1 million years older than humans (our planet) , and their technology, especially the 8,000 cubic mile machine. <br /> <br /> Second, there is music and sound effects, which are inseparable from each other. This creates a strange and supernatural feeling, unlike "2001", which contained traditional classical music. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, his "monster" is not only the most powerful and the deadliest ever imagined, it is also based on real science and does not violate the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, Forbidden Planet is the only movie of all time trying to succeed and, what is even more incredible, to succeed in creating an honest, intelligent and ruthless environment. logical statement about the limits or ceiling of human development (or any other biological entity), regardless of how long our species survives. <br /> <br /> In other words, she predicts our inevitable destiny.
