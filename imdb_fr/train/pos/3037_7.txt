The film "MacArthur" begins and ends at General Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata, of the American Military Academy West Point on the Hudson. We see a frail general, MacArthur, 82, making the opening speech at the 1962 promotion, describing how it is an honor to serve their country. The film then goes into a flashback of almost two hours on the brilliant and controversial career of General MacArthur which begins in the early spring of 1942, in the darkest hours of the Second World War, on the besieged island of Corregidor, in the Philippines . <br /> <They told him to leave the island for Australia before the Japanese army invaded it for the first time in his military career. General MacArthur almost disobeys the direct order of his superior, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihy. Feeling that he will abandon his men at the most urgent time, MacArthur, reluctantly, with his wife and young son, did what he was told not to let him haunt the reminder of the war. For this reason, his escape under the fire of death or the captivity of the Japanese, pushed General MacArthur to use all his influence for the FDR to launch, two years later, a major invasion of the Philippians, instead of Formosa Island, confirms its promises to the Filipino people and the thousands of American prisoners of war left behind. Let him come back and come back with the power of the US Army and Navy to make his commitment! <br /> <br /> In the two years leading up to the Philippine invasion, General MacArther defeated Japanese forces in the South Pafific in a number of successful island-to-island battles. isolated and deprived of hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers who surrendered. The general suffered much less American military casualties than any other allied commander in the war in the Pacific! <br /> <br /> It was in 1950/51, during the Korean War, that General MacArthur won his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat. After skirting the North Korean army in a brilliantly executed and perfectly executed way, the American invaders undergoing less than 100 casualties, the invasion by the back door or the left hook of Inchon, General MacArther, feeling invincible, sent US / UN forces under his command. border, along the Yalu River, Communist Red China. His subordinates told him that he was facing the threat of a massive onslaught of Chinese Communist troops, but General MacArthur insisted that the attack should materialize in the reduction of the United Nations forces. UN by ribbons. The unstoppable wave of attacks after the attack by Chinese Red troops forced US / UN forces to withdraw in the 1950 "Big Bug Out", leaving behind all their equipment, across the North Korean border, giving up even the South Korean capital of Seoul! It turned out to be one of the greatest military disasters in US history as US forces lost a record. During the Korean War, 1,000 people were killed on the first day of November. 29/30 1950 - the invasion of Communist China! <br /> <br /> Shocked and humiliated by what he let do, mainly because of his arrogance, MacArthur went on the offensive and not the advance of the Chinese Communists and North Koreans. forces, but his own commander and chief president. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, having neither the effort nor the courage to do what needs to be done: Launch a large-scale invasion of communist China with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from to invade the Korean peninsula! For Pres. Truman, who had taken about enough of General MacArthur's garbage by publicly telling him how badly he had handled the war by not getting everything, as MacArthur wanted, against the red Chinese, was the water drop! On April 11, 1951, the meadow. Truman relocated General MacArthur unceremoniously from his command as Supreme Commander of US / UN forces in Korea! Near. Truman's courageous but unpopular decision also prevented World War III from disassociating itself from the Soviet Union - the ally of Communist China - which at the time - like the United States - possessed the Atomic Bomb! Near. Truman's controversial decision to overthrow the popular general MacArthur also cost him his re-election in 1952 with so few votes in the mid-1920s that he withdrew from the US presidential campaign in March. ! <br /> <br /> General MacArthur was unhappy to be here as the political and military climate around the world was changing in the way of waging future wars. With the horrors of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, it was a reality that it was a national suicide, as General MacArthur wanted, against the Red Chinese, which could lead to a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the USSR and red China, but the whole world! It is this important reality of the future war that General MacArthur never learned, since bombs A and H were not yet invented at West Point. <br /> <br /> In 1962, we can now see that General MacArthur MacArthur, after finishing his opening speech at West Point, had become both an older and wiser soldier and, since his departure retired US Army, an old statesman in his feelings about the war and his futility. One thing that General MacArthur learned from a very early age, from his father of the Civil War, Douglas MacArthur Sr., had remained etched in his memory all his life, namely that for a soldier like him, the war should be the last resort, but not the first resort. issues between nations. In this, it is the soldiers who must fight and die. With the advent of the nuclear age, General MacArthur took a lifetime to realize how fair and wise his father was, a Congressional medalist, just like him!
