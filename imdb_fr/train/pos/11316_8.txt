(Some spoilers) I have not read James M. Cain's novel ("The Postman always rings twice") on which this movie is based. So I can not compare this version to the movie, but I saw and liked the 1946 American version (also called "Postman"). <br /> <br /> Better still, this Italian jewel, which, I read, was "mutilated" because of its excessive number of flagrant references to the fascist regime. Well, whatever? what remains is a beautiful piece of cinema, apparently the precursor of the neo-realistic movement in film production. We can certainly see why ?? Despite all that has been harshly edited, there is still a pervasive sense of society and culture, as well as personal oppression, weighing heavily on the protagonists, who must face many limits in life. <br /> <br /> Think of Gino, the youngster. a vagabond, not well educated, unemployed and sticky, stealing and driving people to escape, his only pair of shoes is so worn out that it becomes virtually useless. <br /> <br /> In Giovanna, he sees a way out, but it should have gone on, since Giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage with an older man with money, her job (working in the trattoria for her husband, fencing behind the bar and in the kitchen), and her sex. In the past, she had few options and decided to marry the owner of the restaurant / gas station (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa), knowing that it would not make her happy. She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her. <br /> <br /> Under the pretext of helping Bregana repair his car and send him to the village to buy an indispensable piece (which he actually pocketed), Gino wins the favor of Bregana (also promising to repair the broken water pump - water symbolizing life, or lack of life) and stays alone with Giovanna. They immediately begin a passionate, passionate and yet volatile love affair. <br /> <br /> Gino soon feels suffocated by the relationship and feels the need to move on when Giovanna offers to separate from her husband. Wanting no part, Gino leaves the city for a train ride he can not afford, well paid to replace him with another Gypsy-like man named Spagnolo, a fellow train. For Gino, Spagnolo represents a kind of freedom and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes the morality and consciousness of Gino), traveling and finding a job together during a carnival. Finally, Gino has a stable job. To his dismay (he still has not lost his love for Giovanna), a month passed when Bregana and his wife went to the carnival and Bregana persuaded Gino to "go home" to live and work with them again. because it is practical. having the will to resist, knowing that it will bring him and Giovanna together, Gino accepts and returns to stay with the couple. After a while, he gives in to Gina's requests to get rid of her husband. Once the damage is done, Giovanna becomes cooler than ever, seeming to have very little awareness, while guilt and shame gnaw at Gino for hurting a man who has done him no harm. As much as he wants to leave ?? it is again briefly, they are now inextricably linked and have to face the consequences. <br /> <br /> I liked how the Spagnolo character came back in Gino's life to act as judge of his misdeeds ?? it was very good and interesting, adding another dimension to the story. <br /> <br /> While the US version '46 with Lana Turner and John Garfield gets lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters, especially the cops and For the lawyers, Ossessione does well to focus much more on the psychological effects of crime on lovers alone. This adds even more power to the end result and is a powerful statement reinforcing the impotence inherent in the society in which the characters live. <br /> <br /> A small problem: the time that elapses (hardly) before the eternal love is pronounced by the lovers, what is the speed with which they kill the husband (there is no first attempt failed as in the American version); Gino's very fast relationship with the dancer / hooker ?? they quickly profess their love too, and she is willing to risk a lot for a man she has just met! ?? all rather unrealistic, is not it? I found this problem of time quite distracting ?? it made me think that I had to miss something somewhere. Otherwise, it's well worth the time of the viewer. The acting and the staging were uniformly good. Recommended.
