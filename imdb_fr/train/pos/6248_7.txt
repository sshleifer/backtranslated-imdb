Being myself Austrian, it strikes me directly in the face. Fortunately, I do not live anywhere near the place where this film takes place, but unfortunately, it describes everything the rest of Austria hates about Viennese people (or people close to this region). And it is very easy to read that it is exactly the director's intention: to let his head run into his hands and say, "Oh my god, how is that possible?" No, not with me, the uncensored swinger club scene totally exaggerated (in my opinion) is not necessary, I watch porn, of course, but in this context, I was rather disgusted than to place it in the good context. <br /> <br /> This film tells how misguided people, who suffer from a lack of education or a bad company, try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons. A girl who is treated like a whore by her super-jealous boyfriend (and keeps coming back), a teacher who discovers her masochism by endangering the life of her super cruel "lover", an old couple who has a cycle almost a mathematical daily life (she is the "official substitute" of her ex-wife), a couple who has just been divorced and whose ex-husband is the victim of the acts of his ex-wife having a relationship with his masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks the most unusual questions to his drivers and stretches their nerves by being simply super annoying. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, you feel almost nothing. You're not even shocked, sad, depressed or want to do anything ... Maybe that's why I gave 7 points, it made me react like I did never done before. If it's good or bad it's up to you!
