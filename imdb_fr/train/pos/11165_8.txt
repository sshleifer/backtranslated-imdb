Four words explain why this movie was shot - "She did it wrong". The huge commercial success of this Mae West vehicle convinced the studio's managers that the gay melodramas of the 1990s were a viable proposition. Here, we are rewarded by a fast and well written movement that perfectly targets the personality of its stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a bit difficult to take, but it's Fay Wray who steals the movie with her damsel in distress. With a strong director - as Walsh proves - Wray could carry a lot of punch, and she is quite credible as an object of the affection of Raft and Beery. <br /> <br /> A lot of atmosphere, beautifully designed, it's a forgotten movie worthy of rebirth.
