I am surprised that films like this one can still be made. I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best I have ever seen. Never thought that a 146-minute film could make me think again and again. <br /> <br /> Washington, charismatic and intense as always, plays Creasy, a former anti-terrorism officer who was taken away the bottle. Once he was charged with protecting the young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redeeming bow started in the way that only an adorable little girl can offer. Inevitably, Pita is kidnapped by thugs and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City has to pay the price for daring to remove the catalyst from his character. Yes, he has become ... a man on fire. <br /> <br /> You must see this movie.
