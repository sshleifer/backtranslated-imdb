"Before the devil knows you're dead" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time <br /> <br />. The acting of <br /> <br /> the excellent casting of the whole is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman achieves an outstanding performance and electrifies every time he goes on screen. Ethan Hawke fits him scene by scene and Albert Finney only chews the screen. Marisa Tomei is however <br /> <br /> criminally underutilized, but her appearance has been incredible for 42 years. The scenario is excellent, the story is non-linear but easy enough to follow. Sidney Lumet, although not known for his blockbuster, has become a gem with this one!
