I enjoyed the cinematic recreation of China in the 1930s in this magnificent film. The story is simple. An older artist wants to pass on his art to a young man even though he does not have a child alive. The faces of the actors are wonderful to see. The story reveals children's dedication and gratitude to those who treat them well and their desire to be treated well. The operas of the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and complex. The story here reminds me of a Dickens story about days when kids were almost out of date. The plot is a little predictable and a little too sentimental for me, but really worth the time to see for heroism, humanity and story depicted.
