This program is very entertaining and the title track is so catchy that I can not get it out of my head. As I get older, I find myself drawn to wrinkles that make things happen, and these four are great in their efforts. Some of their activities are scandalous but brilliant, considering that today, with our computer world, we could never do it in real life. I'm still learning something about shows. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy and a little crime, you'll love this show. It reminds me of Quincy, ME in a certain way and Barney Miller in another way that they work and interact with each other. They screw up a lot but they do the work, and that's what counts.
