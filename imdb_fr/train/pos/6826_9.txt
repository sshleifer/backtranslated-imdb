John Cassavetes' "Opening Night" is fantastic and fascinating. fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears of our imagination, fascinating because it never ceases to surprise us. With its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes, all those who appreciate the characters will not be able to look away from the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of an unstable actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands) trying to stage a play, fighting her demons; "Opening Night" is not just about a woman on the verge of collapse, but also about the complexity of the lives of theater actors and the theater world. All the characters of Cassavetes here are experienced people who know the world of theater; Thus, half of the film takes place on a stage, where the performers do their work, or behind the scenes, where producers, writers and directors do their work. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes is so hard with his characters that this nastiness turns to the public, but the audience to the movies. Because there is another audience, in the movie theater, who does not know what is really going on and who laughs because they think that everything is performance. And that's essentially what it is; it's just that the audience in the theater can not see behind the scenes as we do. They do not experience the exuberance of Gena Rowlands before she reaches this stage, but more importantly; they do not know why she is doing this. <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be difficult to be friends with an actor. Myrtle (Rowland) says she's an actress and that's the only thing she can do. and I imagine that if I had a professional interpreter friend, it would be really hard to tell when he was telling the truth, because I would know he's an actor and he can do anything at any moment. A lot of things that Myrtle did during the terrible experiences that the film went through: we suspect if it's real; the other characters are also suspect. <br /> <br /> There is writer Sarah (Joan Blondell) who does not understand why Myrtle does not understand the character she wrote for her. There is the director, Manny (Ben Gazzara), who can not accept the fact that his best actress may lose him; producer David (Paul Stewart) who does not know where to stand and the co-star of Myrtle Maurice (Cassavetes himself), who can not handle the love they have for each other. <br /> <br /> When she attends the death of a teenager, a fan; all this happens and affects Myrtle, but no one knows if her delusions are real. They do not say anything because they do not want to upset her, but the film enters a state of subconsciousness that only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes it can be said that everyone has had it. In these moments, Cassavetes's brilliant scenario portrays an honest frightening brutality in the words uttered by the characters in a behind-the-scenes discussion; and not just what everyone says to Myrtle, but what she tells them. <br /> <br /> Here are people who are not afraid to say what they think and who constantly change their thinking, just as Cassavetes does cinema. And in this aspect, the performances are more important here than in "Shadows", because the characters are involved in a larger image; a bigger story that comes out of the trivial. <br /> <br /> But in another aspect, the current way of making cinema, this film is no different from "Shadows". There is a beautiful thing in the way that Al Ruban's camera shoots at the characters. When someone speaks, the camera does not focus on it, it pulls on the listener. we can see how he reacts to what the other person is saying. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes devastated. <br /> <br /> The improvisation is perhaps always at the rendezvous, in spite of all these marvelous performances. Towards the end, Cassavetes and Rowlands begin to talk without stopping. Whether it's improvised or not, it's not something to ask. We just have to watch; and watch them exchange life experiences and see the words come alive in a conversation that means much more than what it shows. It does not become more natural than that.
