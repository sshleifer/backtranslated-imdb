Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is more sexy in this role than any male porn star, even if he keeps his pants. <br /> <br /> The film tore my heart, reminding me of the intensity of the great explosive love of my life. I do not think I can think of another movie, with the possible exception of Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet, which captures this dizzying joy so well. <br /> <br /> The other drawing of the film is constituted by very eccentric characters very English taking advantage of the scandal by proxy. . In this sense, it is almost the same call as Midsomer Murder or a mystery of Miss Marple, without the chaos. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent antidote to the fake horror currently in force in the United States and all relationships between different ages.
