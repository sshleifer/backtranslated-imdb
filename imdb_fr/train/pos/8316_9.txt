I watched this movie every time I had the opportunity, in the 70's, when it came out on the cable. This is my introduction to Harlem, which fascinates me (and Bill Clinton) since. I was still very young and the movie impressed me a lot. It was great to see a movie about other girls growing up, trying to decide who they wanted to be and making bad choices as well as good ones. I was dazzled by the beauty of Lonette McKee, the beautiful dresses they finally had to wear and the catchy dialogue. As a single mother, I could really relate to these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem to me almost more real than Beyonce Knowles!
