The romantic drama of the working class of director Martin Ritt is as incredible as it happens, but there are moments of pleasure due mainly to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both great). She is a widow who can not move, he is illiterate and a closet inventor - you can probably guess the rest. The adaptation of Pat Barker's novel "Union Street" (a better title!) Is so casual that it borders on blandness, and editing the film is a clutter, but it's still nice. fancy blue collar with pink hues. There is no opening to serious problems (even the angle of illiteracy is only a plot for the love story that will follow) and no real fireworks, although the characters are intentionally a little colorless and tracks are attenuated in an interesting way. The final is pure fluff - and the cynics will have trouble swallowing - although these two characters deserve a happy ending and that the photo would not be really satisfactory. *** of ****
