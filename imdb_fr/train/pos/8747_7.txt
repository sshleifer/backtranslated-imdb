* Spoilers possible * Although this was done before (and better) in 'Midnight Express' and 'Return To Paradise', Brokedown Palace still resonates with me. <br /> <br /> Here we have the story of two young girls crossing Thailand and being arrested for drug trafficking. Was it Alice of Clare Danes? Was it Kate Beckinsale's Darlene? Was it the stranger they met during their trip? None of this really matters, because it's a story of friendship and trust, with the limits to which they can expand. Add Bill Pullman as a lukewarm lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as a Thai wife (and better lawyer than him) and we have a pretty little story that gets the attention of the public. <br /> <br /> The Brokedown Palace is not extraordinary, or notorious for some reason - it's not an original concept, it does not show the sensationalist violence that drives the avant-garde crowd to talk about his "realism" or "striking truths" - it's just a good story with great performances. Bill Pullman is the weakest with his lazy language and his way of talking - I was very bored with the character. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, although decent, is not spectacular. She plays well, but it's not really a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> However, Jacqueline Kim is in great shape and creates a nice and defined character in which, in reality, there is not much to work with. <Br /> <br /> But make no mistake - it's Clare Danes' movie. I've been a fan of his work for a long time and it's not a change. She's captivating in all the scenes she's performing, and if it were not for her, the movie would probably go down. I particularly applaud her performance in the scene between her and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The film also has a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
