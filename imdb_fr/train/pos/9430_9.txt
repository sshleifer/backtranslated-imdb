I am a member of a canoe-kayak club and I can tell you the truth: Deliverance is synonymous with peace and quiet. When we put our boats in the water, banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind. This film is timeless because it shows the place that man occupies in nature and the effect of technology on the relationship of man with nature. We see it in archery. We see it in the homemade tent. There is also the disdain and the feeling of superiority of the man of the city vis-Ã -vis the "cracker" of the rural lumberjack. The fact that the Atlanta banker (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" puts him in the same rank as the loggers who also have bad teeth. In the end, the struggle of life and death replaces the assumptions of "civilized man" about "The law". This canoe trip ends too early for the spectator, but unfortunately not early enough for the characters.
