The only reason I knew Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the Top 100 AFI Critics. For a top 100, it's not a well-known movie; indeed, I needed a lot of work to find a copy, I had the DVD version at half price. Surprisingly, it was noted that M15 + (uncut version). <br /> <br /> I doubt that many people will be interested in this criticism (rather a comment), so I will make it brief. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps one of the strangest films I've ever seen, partly because of the use of montages, artistic (very artistic) shooting and the theme unusual. There are a lot of things in the movie that I still do not understand (I've seen it twice), and it's an emotionally confusing film. <br /> <br /> The shooting and the game were very good, and it is the larger than life characters that make this film memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a Texas "cowboy" who moves to New York to become a prostitute. He meets Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo, a lame crook and, of course, they become friends during the usual getaways. What makes the film interesting is that the two characters are so different. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that the film did not really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo so that the audience could have a real emotional connection, although the end is certainly quite sad and tragic . You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews, but it's pretty obvious from the start. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the film explores in a beautiful and poignant way its main themes. The deprivation of humanity (illustrated by the darkness of the streets of the city, the ruined buildings). Most of the characters in the movie exist beyond the law (a crook, giggolo.etc) and yet you can not help but love them. Joe Buck is endearing because he is so naive and upbeat, as we start to feel sorry for Ratso later in the film. <br /> <br /> I think the film received such a high rating because it was certainly very innovative for its period. At the time (and even now), it was certainly not a typical film (artistic enough). At a time when the cinema was dominated by westerns, musicals and exhausted dramas, a film on a theme as unusual as Midnight Cowboy appeared. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I have to say that the film pleased me a lot. The images conveyed a dream quality. I especially liked the party scene, the music, the pictures, etc., stay in your mind long after watching. However, as an entertainment film, it was missing a bit (not really my movie style) of thrills. It's a movie to savor and enjoy, rather than a thrilling action movie. <br /> <br /> Although I hardly consider myself qualified to analyze this film, the characters and their motivations are quite interesting. From what I understand flashbacks, his grandmother has sexually abused Joe Buck, although that still does not seem to be relevant to the story. He is a happy young stallion who eliminates his darkest memories. The religious connotations in the film are also disconcerting. Some have suggested a homosexual relationship between Buck and Ratso, although I do not see where they got the idea. The theme of homosexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation, and later in Joe Buck's encounter with a lonely old man, but this has nothing to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> Certainly from a technical point of view, one of the best films of the decade (it has more the impression of the 70s than that of the 60s) and revolutionary because it touched subjects that few films dared to do. Although the film has a simple and sentimental story (masked by a hard edge), the beauty of the film lies in its strange sequences, often psychedelic.
