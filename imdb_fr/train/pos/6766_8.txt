Perhaps the most captivating and intelligent film of the cops is Otto Preminger's "Where the Sidewalks Ends", taken from a very good Ben Hecht script based on Frank Rosenberg's novel "Night Cry" ... <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the honest and tough policeman of New York, who always has trouble with his superiors, because he loves his methods of arming, as much as he hates crooks ... When he hit someone, his fingers hurt him ... wants to hit is a nasty smooth (Gary Merrill) who points the title. 'Why are you still trying to push me into the gutter?' he asks Andrews. "I have as much right on the sidewalk as you." <br /> <br /> The obsession and neurosis of Dana Andrew are implanted in his secret and painful discovery that he is the son of a thief ... His deep hatred of criminals has led him to use their own unlawful methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice has been spoiled in private vendetta ... <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of "Laura" is united once again, and Andrews now seems to play the same detective a few years later, but more the romantic, shot by his work, by the cheap crooks ... This time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect ... The murder is accidental, the victim is worthless, and yet he knows he can break him or send him to jail ... <br /> <br /> Using his knowledge of police procedures, he hides his share in the crime, planting false clues and tries to implicate a gang leader, but can not help but investigate the affair itself e ... The double tension Leaving the affair bigger until its conclusion without getting involved in the murder, is beautifully preserved and the final solution is at once logical, satisfactory and in no way constitutes a compromise. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best crime film of the 50s, with curious moral values, also one of the best films of Preminger ... <br /> <br /> Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of weirdness to exteriorize his suspense in realism ...
