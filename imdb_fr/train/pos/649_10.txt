We do not have to lose this movie, it's one of the best I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is incredible (more than usual) and the film is one of the most unforgettable of the new vogue. Jean Eustache is no longer on this earth, all that remains is these black and white images to remind one of the greatest French directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I will never forget him. <br /> <br /> P.S .: sorry for English ...
