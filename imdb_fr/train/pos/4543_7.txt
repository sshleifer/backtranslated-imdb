Well, no, I'm telling a lie, it's not the best movie of all time, but it's a really nice movie that nobody, to my knowledge, has seen yet. <br /> <br /> It's a movie boyfriend with Jay Leno. and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi), who tells the story of a missing car engine prototype or something, but it does not matter. the reason why this film is funny is due to the interaction between the two protagonists who, at the beginning, hate each other and mistrust each other, but eventually become friends. The whole culture difference is pretty well done, it's fun to watch, it's completely ridiculous, but in a fun and old-fashioned way. The soundtrack is cool, again in the style of the 80s. It suits the movie. I've been trying to find a song for ages, but as I work from memory, I think of some of the words that I did not seem to be able to find. <br /> <br /> Another thing this movie has is the most fantastic reward of all the movies, but I will not give it away, oh no! In conclusion, I would take this film over 48 hours, most of Eddie Murphys' movies, including the Beverly Hills cop, and the boyfriend's name, Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence. If you're looking for a movie with a boyfriend and you're tired of "a white cop and a zany black cop," try it. You may be pleasantly surprised to find that this formula is completely upset by "a Japanese policeman and a zany white policeman". <br /> <br /> I give this 7. To be honest, I love it more than that. I prefer to look at this rather than many things that I would give 8. But I guess I know deep inside me that it's a kind of madness that makes me like this movie.
