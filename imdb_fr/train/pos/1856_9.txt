He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in Glory, he proved that he was not a mediocre actor of "Malcolm in the Middle" in "Malcolm X", he showed his brotherly love for playing " Philadelphia, "he shot a slam dunk in` He played ', he gave no punch and shook us like a hurricane in' The Hurricane ', he provided us with an effective education on the "Day of training ", and he has now shown that he can also lead! Antwone Fisher, the first film by Denzel Washington, is the most moving film of the year. This story of fisherman's tears has nothing to do with the breakup that hit the Miami Dolphins in the fourth quarter against the New England Patriots in the final game of the 2002 season. "In contrast to this Dolphin tragedy "Antwone Fisher" has an emotional and joyful conclusion, based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem because of his horror of childhood. Denzel plays the marine psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his anger and convinces him to find his natural mother.The first performance of Derek Luke as Antwone is the best acting I've seen by a novice actor For some time now, I've seen some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's role, as I've seen in Washington's past performances, as if Washington were saying to Luke, "Luke , I am your acting father ". Okay! I will drop Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from "Master D" himself? "Antwone Fisher" was written by Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he inserted into the storyline of his story was made of "king fisherman". I salute the chief `Mr Washington 'catching the right bait in Antwone Fisher. ***** Excellent
