Hmmm, yes, this episode is extremely underrated. <br /> <br /> Even though there are a lot of bad writings and bad roles. I think the good wins the bad. <br /> <br /> I like origami pieces and the big "twist" at the end. I love this scene when Michelle confronts Tony. It's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1. <br /> <br /> For some reason, people have always hated episodes of Reincarnation, but I've always loved them. They are not the best, in terms of writing. but the theme really interests me, <br /> <br /> I'll give it a THREE star, but if the writing was a little more coherent, I'd give it FOUR.
