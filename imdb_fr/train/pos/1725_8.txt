Playing as a kind of pre-runner of The Great Escape about 13 years later, this little British film smashing the play without any frills and dares to do too many things. The first part of the film is the organization and subsequent escape of our protagonists, while the second part focuses on their survival while they are on the run as they try to reach Sweden. The film is based on pure characters with a simple, effective and, yes, credible dialogue, to carry it out, and it achieves its objectives with brilliance. There is not much suspense that keeps the film running, and as a story of adventure, it works perfectly for the time period it respects, so it's a big thumbs up to the movie that could be the first of the kind?. <br /> 7/10
