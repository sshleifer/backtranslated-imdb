Yes, as other commentators have already said, this may not be vintage L & H, but it's far from their worst work in the stupid 20th century ... I mean Fox. This movie certainly contains all the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for boys. But it's their serious approach and determination that makes them funny. They do not play for laughter like other comedians but they take their work and their situation very seriously and this is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they face fundamental problems that each of us may encounter today, namely work-related stress. First, a doctor checked us and prescribed a well-deserved rest and perhaps a stay by the sea. This is where the surreality comes in all of this. L & H always takes a plausible set of circumstances and exaggerates it, but never to the point of being incredible, except perhaps once in a while. It makes us laugh because we can understand their own problems and their attempts at extrication. That's what makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this film, all these ingredients are presented in a deliciously clever and graceful way. This is not their best compared to their previous work, probably because it's the last film they did for Roach because he wanted to reflect the "big" studios and focus exclusively on creating feature films but also hurry to finish their contractual obligation. BIG MISTAKE! They should all have stayed together and maybe continue for another five years. What the world may have missed by not considering this as an option. Watch them, laugh and enjoy them for their last big performance.
