Some comments on IMDb have compared Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III movies of the 90s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very discouraging, this movie by Pou-Soi Cheang is not sordid enough, sensational or sensationalist win this comparison. However, it still keeps a punch that makes it worth watching, especially if you prefer aggressive action and hard edges. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen plays the role of Pang, a hit-Cambodian who goes to Hong Kong to murder the wife of a judge; Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless cop who is determined to find him, whatever the price. As Wai approaches his target, Pang stops at nothing to escape, until he meets Yue, a pretty irregular immigrant who needs his help to escape his life of violence. <br /> <br /> A ruthlessly tough Drama with excellent cinematography, breathtaking sound design, a mesmerizing score and strong performances of Chen and Lee (as well as Pei Pei, newcomer to Pang's love affair), Dog Bite Dog is intended for fans of striking Asian hyper-violence along the Vengeance trilogy of Chan-wook Park). Punching, shooting, ruthless beatings: all this happens regularly in this film and is taken without restraint by the director Cheang. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the kind of story intended to have an unfortunate end for all, and of course, almost everyone in this movie dies (rather nasty death). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in its last moments, Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in a ridiculously dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are struggling with a pregnant woman , Yue. Finally, after the three men were seriously wounded with stabbing during the fighting, an injured Pang performed a hand caesarean on Yue (now deceased), delivering their baby a few moments before he died himself. <br /> <br /> Do not be a "classic" slice of Hong Kong excess, with OTT's delirious action and stylish graphics, it's always worth looking for.
