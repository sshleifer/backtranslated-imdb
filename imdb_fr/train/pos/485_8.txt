'The Luzhin Defense' is a good movie with excellent central performances, but there is too much romance and not enough talent from the filmmaker. Throughout most of the film, the characters simply helped advance the story. Marlene Gorris may have been able to examine Luzhin's psyche rather than describe him as an innocent tortured victim, torn apart by the cruel motives of others. <br /> <br /> Adapting literature to the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This film does not go far enough in the relationship between Loujine and Natalia. The break between Natalia and her mother results from a rude disagreement on the part of the mother rather than a dramatic flash point in the film. I felt that I was suffering the torment and the tragic end of Luzhin, without having the pleasure of seeing his unusual and complex personality unveiled. However, it was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not excellent.
