My favorite movie of all time. Oscar-winning work by everyone, in front of and behind the camera. The scenario is perfect and establishes the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs quite satisfactorily, unlike the novel. The care with which the other main characters were drawn is a tribute to screenwriter Peter Barnes. The intense visual beauty should have won Oscars from director Mike Newell and filmmaker Rex Maidment. This is by far the best work of Josie Lawrence and has transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright. After watching this movie at least 50 times, I find no fault. The music of the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a marvel.
