In 1933, many cuts were made to this film because it was very exaggerated for the content of the story and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) would do everything in her power to obtain great wealth and a powerful power. Lily's father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and grew up in a steel mill in a city populated by very poor people. His father ran a secret bar that brought home all sorts of male characters who watched over Lily. . As the story progresses, Lily meets man after man and ends up finding a man who has everything to please and who is president of the playboy bank. It's a pleasure to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 years old when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not even get to the first goal with Lily, not even for lunch . A very young George Brent (Coutland Trenholm) plays the lead role with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances. This is a great 1933 film that was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and has been locked in a rift for many years and has just been shown on a big screen. This film is rather sweet compared to what we are watching on Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very ugly to watch this type of film. Enjoy
