What's great about Withnail & I is that it captures the fact that college is not far from the left and that life can go in all directions with all that is beautiful . Freebird is something for those who have probably never considered higher education and who just went to work directly at the age of 15/16. I know some of the big leaves stuck the knife in this movie when it came out in theaters, but I saw it in a packed house of Hailsham and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I grew up in the Forest of Dean, which brought me back to the mushroom and drug days (I had great friends - hate to think about what they are all now - probably at the head of the local council). I have watched it a few times on DVD and I already see the film as an old friend who will stay forever in my collection (how can I love this movie and the Dambusters - it does not seem fair to me anyway) to the second half of this film and I think that the scenes of social interaction with the inhabitants are brilliantly realized. I like the mixture of the three main characters and there is really a beautiful writing here with some lines very easy to quote and I dare say a good deal of integrity. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it was not published (too bad, because it's a corker). Someone told me it was originally a play, I did not really know how it worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespearian touches / references that seem to emerge throughout the movie (also spotted by ref Dylan Thomas) and, as with all the little jewels, there will always be little things to discover, like the final scene evoking Easyrider. they start their next trip. All in all, it's a really unpretentious movie (love it!)
