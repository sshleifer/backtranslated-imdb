It's a film by Ivan Reitman. with the rare exception, Ivan likes to entertain. His films are usually not "deep", but they are often quite entertaining. My super ex-girlfriend surprised me by saying that I laugh more than I thought. Uma Thurman is so big and I love her portraits. I also like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was a real hope. Never taking himself seriously, the film is exaggerated and yet is not really unique, it does not go where no one has ever been before .... it's a good rent and probably a good movie of date, especially if you have a headache and do not want to force your brain. It's a pleasure to escape and there is nothing wrong with that. When you get rid of the "super-girl", you still have a story about relationships, and relationships have gone bad. It's a boy meets a girl, the boy leaves the girl's thing. And in the end, the characters are looking for love. All do not take the fact of being "dropped" as well as they could ... a slice of life with a twist.
