Fever Pitch is a pretty funny movie. There are many fun moments (including an annoying hilarious shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, there is a "dead zone" in the middle where all the heavy, "she separates with me", it happens, but other than that, it continues to be funny until the end. <br /> <br /> Although the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the Red Sox, it is not overloaded with sports. You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's easy for me to say: I've been a Red Sox fan since I was a kid, too. <Br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Barky
