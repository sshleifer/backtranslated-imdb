Here's what I knew about "Atlantis" before watching it: <br /> <br /> * - This is officially Disney's first animated sci-fi adventure. I'm not sure of its accuracy (I like nitpick), but it made me curious the first time I heard it describe. <br /> <br /> * - The preview seemed, for the most part, really cool. Obviously, he was also "too encrypted" according to some critics after the fact. <br /> <br /> * - It apparently did not do that Disney said, "Fuck it, read 'Spy Kids'". <br /> <br /> So, with all that said, how's the movie going? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I'm a sucker for the animated fantasy that involves moving music and endemic special effects anyway, but "Atlantis" is doing everything possible. It's a throwback to all of CGI's clich√©s in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", to the point that it's almost the Best-Of Show of an effects animator. The characters may not be as memorable (except perhaps for the ship's doctor), and the plot is a little boring, but it's not a movie you watch for the plot. <br /> <br /> Here is a controversy that bothers me. "Failure" (as in, he "only" touched about five hundred million dollars, I know animators who would kill fifteen dollars) of this film compared to the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." was considered a proof of the death of traditional animation. I do not think that's true. How do you explain the movie "South Park"? What about "Final Fantasy"? Really, history and artistic talent are everything, not the method. I do not know what the Disney movie will look like, but I do not think they're missing.
