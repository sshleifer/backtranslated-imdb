wow, how can I even discuss this film without having tears in my eyes? This was surely the highlight of my year - no - my life. As if the raptor graphics were not surprising enough, the award-winning editors continued to use exactly the same shot throughout the movie, even when the background did not really fit the scene. Wow, what a genius. And while the movie is full of intrigue (for example, a few clips of a t-Rex type animal where a raptor should be and a key moment when Pappy finds a torture chamber, screams "Colin is a girl!" And runs out) I will never forget the genius of Raptor Planet. Thanks Sci-Fi for another classic.
