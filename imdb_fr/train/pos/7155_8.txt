More than a "children's film", "Holes" describes how past incidents affect us today, whether we know it or not. When teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day, he discovers a number of things about the camp and its personal connection to it. Thanks to flashbacks, we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize (you'll understand better when you see the movie). LeBoeuf is doing a great job, along with other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting film.
