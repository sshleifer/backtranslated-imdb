After watching the rather sloppy spying thriller of the First World War, Mrs. Lili (1969) starring Julie Andrews on television this afternoon, I suddenly thought I had seen a spy thriller well superior to the First World War. All I remembered was that it had been produced by Dino De Laurentis. It took only a short search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor. Once I recognized the title, the memories came back. For its time, it's a fairly well-constructed story that revolves around real events such as the death of Kitchener and the 1918 German offensives. There is also a spy who is much more credible than Julie Andrews! Like other critics, the first and most powerful memory is that of well-produced battle scenes and of men and horses dressed in gas masks. If you are interested in war films and especially in the First World War, it is a film that deserves to be seen if you have the opportunity.
