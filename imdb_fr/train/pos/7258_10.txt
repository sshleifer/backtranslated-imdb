I was fortunate to recently get a DVD copy of this movie and have already seen it for the second time. The first time, more than 20 years ago, the Australian television was aired late at night, but I could never forget this strange and dark movie. <br /> <br /> Few people like this film because it is so unconventional. The fact that there is almost no spoken dialogue in this movement - we hear only the thought of the characters - is only an unconventional aspect. <br /> <br /> In search of a copy of this film, I discovered that the producer was dead, the lead actor was dead, he was not in any British film or television archive, he was was never broadcast on video or DVD, television networks around the world destroyed it after their copyright was exhausted in the 80s. In Australia, during his first appearance on television, he did not there was no recordable device for consumers. <br /> <br /> During the second reading, I could understand why it was unforgettable. It is sometimes very tense and extremely claustrophobic, like a play by Harold Pinter. <br /> <br /> Again, if you would like a DVD copy of this copy, please send me an email and I am sure we can find a solution.
