I read that Jessie Matthews was approached and rejected alongside Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress. Jessie Matthews in his heyday never left his side of the pond to make American music movies. If they had joined for this film, it would have been a unique event. <br /> <br /> Too bad, because Damsel in Distress has everything for him. Fred Astaire, story and screen adaptation of P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for comedy and songs by the Gershwin brothers. In answer to the question asked by the beautiful book If you can get it, you can not ask for more for this film. <br /> <br /> Except a leading woman. Although Ginger Rogers shot several films far from Fred Astaire, Damsel in Distress is the only Astaire film made without Rogers as they formed a team. The young Joan Fontaine was chosen to play in Astaire. <br /> <br /> His character has nothing to envy to the roles of Ginger Rogers in these films. All she has to do is be gentle and modest. It does not contribute either musically. And if I had to evaluate all the partners of Fred Astaire dancing, Joan Fontaine would be in the last row. The poor woman is just awful in the number of Things Are Looking Up. <br /> <br /> When she later plays in a musical with Bing Crosby, The Emperor Waltz, it's no coincidence that Fontaine has nothing musical to do. <br /> <br /> The version I have is a color and in this case, I think it was good. The idyllic verdant green English countryside of P.G. Wodehouse is really highlighted in this VHS copy. Especially in this issue that I already mentioned with Astaire and Fontaine and that takes place in the garden. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Burns and Allen, two former vaudeville riders complete Astaire brilliantly in the Stiff Upper Lip number. The sequence of the surreal entertainment house is wonderfully staged. <br /> <br /> P.G. The aristocracy of Wodehouse covers the full range of Constance Collier with his best haughty and for once, Montagu Love, the father of Fontaine, a nice man on the film. <br /> <br /> The greatest success of A Damsel in Distress is A Foggy Day most famous song about the British capital since London Bridge Is Falling Down. Made in the simplest and most elegant way by Fred Astaire, it's one of those songs that will last as long as London lasts and even after. <br /> <br /> Overlooking the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, a young girl in distress a classic, classical score, classical dance, classic comedy. Who could ask for something more?
