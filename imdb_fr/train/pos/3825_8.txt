A young woman comes to her husband's hometown after his death, following an accident. She barely moved into this small town, but soon after, lost her grandson during a kidnapping and all her hopes ... This could give rise to all sorts of hassles in a normal movie: find a new partner and be happy finally; or depressed enough to fight and finally kill herself ... She tries to kill herself, but not after a series of fierce battles with God. She trusts God to see that God seems to forgive everyone, even the murderer. Well, I should be careful here about God, the movie does not mean anything against God. The way in which the film approaches the question is quite interesting: neither from the point of view of the woman nor from the point of view of God (in this way, there would be a lot of grass growing, flying clouds, I suppose ). It is rather from the point of view of a third, the film lets us perceive and explains nothing at all. <br /> <br /> The film would not be as interesting if it was only the woman. There is this man who is everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her, but in his own way. He's a funny guy, like a clown, I should say, who shamelessly hangs around our heroine. The combination of these two elements, the woman full of tension, crying and always vomiting, and the man, smiling and talking stupidly, leads to a good balance of emotions: nothing absurdly false or too tedious. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
