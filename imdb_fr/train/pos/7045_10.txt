This movie definitely has a boost from me. These are spiritual jokes and even stereotypical and derogatory views of Eastern Europeans who have occasionally followed me for most of the film. His plot is intelligent and 100% original and will let you guess throughout the film. The person who impressed me the most in this film was Hilary Duff. It's clear and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith out of the genre of the "girls movie" she was used to. His focus is excellent and his acting performance was surprisingly sharp and well executed. This is the best performance I have ever seen from Hilary and I have seen most of his films. His character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as "The Britney Spears of Eastern Europe" and it shows in some of his manners and in the song "I want to blow you up ... ... ...". You also feel sorry for her because her performance really grabs you. Yonica is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack made me laugh all through the movie with her sometimes awesome humor, but also her facial expressions, etc. John Cusack's spiritual dialogue will probably make you laugh all the time. I highly recommend this movie.
