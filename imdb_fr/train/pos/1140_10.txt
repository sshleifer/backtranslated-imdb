I'm a fan of this movie for years and years. Because Teri Hatchers came to the fore, I had to take the film off the set and watch it. Why did not people in 1991 see how wonderful this film was beyond me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are more than fabulous. Although I have never watched any soap operas, this movie kills me every time I watch it. The acting is unparalleled for a comedy and the writing is so smart. I strongly recommend you to look at this if you have not already done so. You'll see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher, to name but a few, all of which give great performances.
