Without education and provocative, beautiful TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is the daughter of a fisherman squatting on the land of a rich man. Bold and daring, it captures the heart of the millionaire's son, but violence, terror and sudden death will haunt his immediate future before he can claim the sweet peace of happiness. <br /> <br /> Mary Pickford is absolutely charming in this beautiful and heartbreaking movie. She saw Tess as her favorite role and filled him with all the joy and courageous enthusiasm that made her the most popular movie star in the world for years. The story contains all the essentials of a modern fairy tale, with Mary, the beautiful heroine in distress, beset by all sorts of dangerous and stressful situations. Atmospheres are first-rate, with open-air fishing village complexes being particularly well-designed. <br /> <br /> Jean Hersholt stands out as the nasty villain who tries to force Pickford to marry him. Hersholt, a very gentle soul off the screen, brilliantly manages to describe the total moral corruption of his character. <br /> <br /> It was actually the second time Pickford filmed TESS. A 1914 version had been one of his first major films, but his production values ​​were a little out of date by the standards of the 1920s (no close-ups, for example) and Mary producing her own films and powerful enough to be in 1922 film she wanted, decided for the only time in her career to redo a movie. The final result has certainly met his expectations. Both films were very popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> The influence of Christianity on Mary Pickford's life would be a fascinating study for a future film researcher. it certainly turns like a thread of gold in the silent films she produced. Although the romanticism inherent in the very nature of silent film can make these spiritual feelings a little awkward today, we are obliged to accept them as sincere reflections, by their very repetition, of Mary's sincere beliefs. In TESS, a beautiful scene stands out in this respect: Pickford learns to read with the help of the Bible. She tells Lloyd Hughes (who plays her lover) a word from the bottom of the book that she does not understand. He mimics her for her (the word is obviously 'crucified') and, with her eyes turned to the sky as the sense of sacrifice rises on her, Mary's face becomes positively beatific. <br /> <br /> A magnificent new orchestral score for TESS was provided by Jeffrey Mark Silverman, which perfectly highlights the beauty and pathos of this wonderful film.
