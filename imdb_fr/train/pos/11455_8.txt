This German documentary, in English, is dedicated to a Scottish sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art from objects he finds in nature. For example, at the beginning of the film, we see him taking pieces of ice cubes and "sticking" them with a little moisture in a serpentine form that seems to cross several times a vertical rock. <br /> <br /> Of course, the ice cubes melt, but this fugacity is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to a site and becomes aware of it, deciding intuitively what he should do that day. He talks about having a "dialogue" with the rocks and other materials he works with, trying to work with * rather than against them. It can be stones, flowers, leaves or sticks. The sculpture can last a few minutes or a few years, or even not last long enough to be completed and photographed. Work seems to be more of a process than an objective. <br /> <br /> The film and the work are beautiful, inspiring and stimulating. It moves fairly slowly, which is appropriate for the material, but you must make sure to go after a good night's sleep. But go ahead if you have the chance. <br /> <br /> Find other Andy Goldsworthy pages on the Web or read about his local sculpture at Stanford University. Several books containing photographs of his sculptures are also available. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: Ignore this part if you want to find what this film means to you independently. I remember some ideas that came to me watching the movie and that I thought I shared with those who are still reading. First, the transient nature of much of Andy Goldsworthy's work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. We are born, we live and finally we die. It's natural, and that's a natural part of Goldsworthy's art. <br /> <br /> The other idea was to be amazed by the way Goldsworthy has managed to integrate his passion and work so deeply into his life. Most of us have a job that is at best tolerated, a life to which we hardly notice life and passions that we really want to devote more time, if we even remember what they are. Andy Goldsworthy has created an amalgam of all those aspects of his life that seem to work well and that feeds him and those around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Seen the 28/08/2002.
