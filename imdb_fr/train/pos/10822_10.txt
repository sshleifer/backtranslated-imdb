I was lucky to see this movie many years ago in England. I have seen hundreds of movies since, but I have never forgotten this one. Although Sinatra played a character not very endearing, he was excellent in the role. Many people seem to think that he did not really enter his role in "From Here To Eternity", but in my opinion he was beautiful in Concho.The other role that I have in mind is William's Conrad. I had never seen or heard of him before this movie. Conrad plays a great part in this movie. I remember his grave and serious voice and he uses it beautifully to highlight the few words he utters with a threat that sets the tone of his character. I also remember of music, which presents Conrad and and seems to surround him every time he appears. An excellent film and my only disappointment was never having the opportunity to see him again. He seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I see in the titles that it is written that the film is in black and white but when I saw that it was well in color, I remember the blue shirt of Sinatra.
