I saw this film in 1976, my first year in New York. I lived there for 26 years, but I have never seen anything as delicate and beautiful as this little TV movie. If I remember correctly, it was part of a PBS series. I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, but delicate, moving, extraordinarily moving moments, full of tension and excitement, all in a conservative environment, Boston (I think) , the First World War, where women played the role of devoted wife waiting for her husband's return from war and not seeking a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is superb as a career photographer and I spent the next 30 years looking for her in equally challenging roles, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> There must be a video of this film? Of course, this should be on DVD but surely at least one video?
