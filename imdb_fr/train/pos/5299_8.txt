Once you have passed the movie title, "Pecker" is an excellent film, perhaps one of the best of John Waters. A wonderful cast, led by the performances of Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very funny and very real. Some shocking scenes are certainly not suitable for young children, but they have a purpose. Unfortunately, this film was not mass produced and the public will not have the opportunity to see it. If the opportunity arises, go see this movie.
