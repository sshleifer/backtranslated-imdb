People do not seem to be giving enough credit to Lensman. Some issues have been forgotten that are essential to understanding the Lensman experience. <br /> <br /> The Year: The year of its creation (1984), Lensman presents some of the most amazing effects I have ever seen. As a spectator of many animations in the early 1980s, Lensman uniquely uses what appears to be computer-generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive. Kim's battle against geometric cutting pods in the laser labyrinth can be an excellent example. Whenever I look, I keep telling myself that it was when it was created in 1984. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack: Lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks I've ever seen never heard, and this crazy hysterical beat pervades every corner of the film. Lensman has borrowed heavily from two Western mistakes and has managed to somewhat treat the first - the need to fill every second of silence in a movie with music and the need for a heroine. While the music is well tuned and galvanizes scenes such as the battle of motorcycles in the Thionite factory on Radelyx, the theme of the heroine fails because of the contrarian value of Chris. It's interesting to note that constant music thwarted my attempts to eliminate noise when I archived the analog-format goal in digital format - because there was not a single minute of silence to serve as a point of reference. <br /> Western Influences: Helmut - sounds like "headphones" and has about the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the Princess of SW and her name sounds strangely like Marissa Fairborn of Transformers. Assume the role of Han Solos by flying the ship and having technical expertise. Buzzkirk - a clear improvement over Chewbaka. The goal - a beautiful concrete copy of the force that appears less as a chance to preach Christianity to the audience than in the original SW. Although strength relies much more on the belief that concentration, the lens is a pure tool of concentration. Theoretically, everyone could carry the goal. The goal is much more limited than the Force - it is only a defensive / offensive weapon. <br /> <br /> Technology: The alliance of boskone has interesting sponges of meatballs. They look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of whites. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon was good if only it had been developed. The Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers (or its nickname - this 60s series where they fought the Xylons). There were not enough battles between ships for me - it's a lot better in Lensman's second movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, a note on Worzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character that continues happily with the second film. <br /> <br />
