An interesting way to see how we behave so often as humans, we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection, but sometimes we destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the question of how we tend to ignore those of us who are not so forthright and who, in doing so, may miss a great opportunity. The comedy injection also makes watching the movie enjoyable. A must see for all who are interested in a reflexive and comical look at life. I look forward to your next product. I hope you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Great job ...... Joanne
