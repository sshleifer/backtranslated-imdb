Homicide: The Movie proved to be a good summary of a well-written, well directed and well-played series. Loose ends were tied up and were not treated properly at the end of the last season. The entire series, and in particular the film, cast a realistic look at life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. My attraction to the show began well before my move to Baltimore, but once I lived here for myself, I realized how realistic it was. And the film certainly kept that spirit. I will certainly miss new original episodes of the series, but I am very grateful to NBC, the producers and the cast for giving us a last glimpse of the dark side of Charm City.
