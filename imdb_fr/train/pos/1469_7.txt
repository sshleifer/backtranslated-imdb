I recognize that creating great expectations before looking because some friends have talked about it (and they are not perverts!) As a must. And it is to see absolutely! Do not just expect to see something burst. <br /> <br /> The Freudian psychoanalyses are interesting in many parts of the film, but there is just too much perversion and it does not stick to the end. <br /> <br /> Some of the good things are Blue's analyzes of Kieslowski, most of David Lynch, some of Hitchcock and maybe a couple I missed (I just remembered .. Dogville), and in general I do not miss things except they are too obvious or cowardly in the air. <br /> <br /> In addition to the repetitive nature that makes it too long, the documentary is pleasant in that it allows to notice perversions nourished by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of most thrillers have studied and used as the basis of this theory. <br /> <br /> I really appreciated the energetic tone of the narrative and the efforts of Mr. Zizek to revive Freud's theory, too long numb, especially in North America. Again, it's way too much and I think it's not a complete waste of time, because I think most humans have a dark appreciation of death and blood.
