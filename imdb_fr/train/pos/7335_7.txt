With Ralph Bakshi, most of his films look like double-edged swords. You will get something extraordinary, but only if you stand the ridiculous and useless cheezy. The Lord of the Rings was an excellent adaptation of the story that may not always shine in the animation department. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice is a great success for Bakshi from the point of view of animation. Rotoscopy is much more detailed and animation has a dynamic aspect. You still have some of the dead cells and slightly fuzzy backgrounds, but overall, the look has improved a lot since Bakshi's last fantasy epic. The animation has an almost realistic and naturalistic style, and unlike the LOTR where this style was often in contradiction with the real content, it reinforces the unique atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film fails to create. a significant story out of its simple frame and in fact most of the motivations of the characters are pretty fuzzy. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases, but even the main villain Necron was hard to follow, not to mention That Guy with Furry Face Mask (also known as 'That Guy'). Even though most of the voice actors were appropriate, there are some quirks in the audio department and Tigra seems particularly terrible every time she screams. <br /> <br /> However, I think that the intrinsic value of the film outweighs its useless value. stupid execution of the plot. You'll never be able to forget the skinny character, but it helps to remind you that this movie may not even be taken seriously. It's always a cool hella and really funny.
