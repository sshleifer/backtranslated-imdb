I saw "The Grudge" yesterday and wow ... I was really scared, it's a good thing. I love horror movies and I liked it a lot. There were so many "surprise" scenes (what's the English word?) That made you jump for you. However, too much screaming from the audience made it hard not to laugh. I think the most frightening scene was ... on the bus, when the face is flashing near the window or when Yoko is walking without her chin. Makeup is also very good. Sometimes you could really see that it was there, but it still added a weird look to the scene. The boy was really very good, so cute without makeup and so terribly scary. The next time I hear a crack, I'll probably be very scared ...
