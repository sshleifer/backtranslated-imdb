The reason people say that this film scared them is because it did it !! This means that the purpose of the film was felt by some who saw it. When I first saw this film, it scared me and made me think about life and religion. It's not a bloody, bloody type movie, but you might think it might be possible for things to go the way the movie was written. Of course, non-believers will say that this is just a sci-fi movie. The truth is that this movie is a must for your thriller collection, even if it has a religious vision. If you're a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc), this is one of them and it's a must. I have never seen the sequel (Distant Thunder), but I think it ends where the film ends.
