I just watched the movie for the 3rd time and enjoy Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast as much as before. It keeps getting better. You just have to marvel at the carefully measured speech style, the slow, deliberate action, everything is perfectly in place. <br /> <br /> Really one of the best and really my favorite of all time !!!
