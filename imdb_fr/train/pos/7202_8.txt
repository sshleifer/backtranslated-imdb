Well before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years ago), "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two men kissing passionately on the screen and, frankly, I was shocked. I understood it in terms of plot and it did not really upset my sensitivity (not much), but it was the first time I saw it, at least in a film "mainstream". I thought it was a reckless move for his time and I took the courage to try it, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his term as a PG-rated Superman. The "male bisexuality" on the screen may have hit "Brokeback", but it is interesting to note this much earlier incarnation.
