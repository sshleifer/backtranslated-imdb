I was not quite sure that this is another idiotic nightly soap opera that seems to clutter the prime time, but it is actually a very good show (thanks to the talent of the cast). Four friends from different backgrounds meet and share the weekly events of their love life. The one-hour program follows them separately through their often-messed-up quests to find love and do it without being boring or banal. Sharon Small's "Trudi" is the housewife (who would be widowed after September 11th), who becomes a little preached and annoying to her friends (who tend to be a little looser and more creative). It's great to see Small come back on TV because she was great in "Inspector Lynley Mysteries". The chick can act. The character of Orla Brady (Siobhan, lawyer) is perhaps the most wounded but always very friendly women, because it struggles with her husband, Hari child with her, whatever his needs. The last two members of the cast are Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child sleeping with everyone, regardless of sex, and Katie (Sarah Parrish), a dark doctor who maintains relationships with a patient AND His son has put his career and his love life out of control. That being said, I am now addicted and I hope that the BBC will continue to launch this series because it is good, different and has an excellent distribution.
