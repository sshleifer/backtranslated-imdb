I have seen the trailer of this movie several times, and I must say that Ned Kelly seems to be a wonderful movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not look away (it certainly caught my eye). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, who is seen for a split second, looks fantastic. I think this film will be a success and that we will see again and again my many people.
