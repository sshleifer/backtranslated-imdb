It's actually a fun series, made in a scary way, much like a Tim Burton movie. This is worth a look because it is much more creative than most shows this season. Better yet, it's not a "reality show". I wonder why viewers are so willing to accept programs like this (which lack creativity) and to ignore such wonderful shows that have a creative meaning. <br /> <br /> While some people decry the premises, I think it's really unusual. Much nicer than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest thing of the tube since "My name is Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, and the narration and the music are wonderful. If you like shows a little off the beaten path, I would recommend it. It's not as strange as Twin Peaks, but it has a serious drawback.
