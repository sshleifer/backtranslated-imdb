I was surprised to see how a film could be both cheesy and excellent. The Frisbee's flying saucer was senseless beyond comprehension, especially during the landing, but the special effects of the Krell attack were impressive for a film shot over half a century ago! Living in the Middle East, JJ Adams suggested Alta to dress more modestly. As an engineer, he was amazed by the imagination of the "futuristic" gadgets, imagined by the accessories department. In total, an hour and a half entertaining, the first time I saw Walter Pidgeon and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a "young" man
