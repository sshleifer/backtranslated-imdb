We rarely see such short comments by IMDb viewers. Maybe that's because this little black comedy is entertaining and pleasing without depth, or are we forgetting something? I would look again if I had some incentive. <br /> <br /> So, what's going on? To the French it is "The Butterfly Wings Beat" Serendipity? Sort? Maybe it's an event that is the culmination of a series of random events. We have all had them (this is called life) but when we look at them in this way, we begin to feel that "chance" might look more like "destiny". <br /> <br /> An "event" in this film could be as minor as dropping some lettuce leaves in the back of a truck or as serious as basing a major life decision on accuracy throwing a stranger from a pebble. All these incidents cause other events that ... you understand correctly? Dominos. Multiply them by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you really have to be imaginative to accept the low chances that this scenario will happen. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like that. But it's the magic world of cinema. <br /> <br /> We admit that it's amusing to see how the writer / director associates these unrelated events with a story that mixes the lives of these French citizens. If you have a few hours and are looking for a whimsical escape, here is the place to do it. Or if you are recovering from an operation and you are not going anywhere anyway, it will engage you while your stitches are healing. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" will not be considered a laureate, but it should spark a cult. Stranger things have happened. <br /> <br /> Soren Kierkegaard is credited with saying: "Life can only be understood in the opposite direction, but it must be lived in the future." If you looked in detail at many of your life's experiences (meeting your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last car accident), you would discover a series of seemingly random events that led to it. <br /> <br /> That's the answer! I forgot to bring an existentialist to explain to me "Happenstance".
