It's a story that could have happened anywhere, given the circumstances. Street entertainer attracting the attention of the famous star of the opera and the friendship that results from it. The aging artist finds / buys a male child to transmit his art. From there, we follow them in the rigors of their difficult but free lives along the river. Traveling from city to city, it happens and has a certain notoriety. Despite the moments and the influences, the man is kind and good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances are first-rate, especially Xu Zhu, who represents the street show. The child (Renying Zhou) is handsome and strong, and resists prejudices. The two protagonists, accompanied by the help of the kind opera singer, Master Liang (an interesting androgynous Zhao Zhigang), portray a very interesting story of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some mentioned the distant similarities of this film with BA WANG BIE JI (ADIEU MA CONCUBINE); however, this film does not easily stand alone. Any resemblance is, at best, far away. <br /> <br /> My only problem with the King of Masks is the end. It was weak, clich√© and about as subtle as a hammer. The public was already immersed in history, what was the use of useless manipulation? Too bad. Bring a beautiful movie as far as that, only to get to an emotional (and nerdy) pathos like that. Frankly, it made a good movie, instead of the classic, it should have been. That said, the KING OF MASKS is always worth your trouble. I was happy to see that the Shaw Brothers still produce good movies. Highly recommended.
