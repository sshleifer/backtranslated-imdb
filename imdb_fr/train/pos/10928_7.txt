A dying Kung Fu master sends his last student to retrace what happened to the five previous students who were members of the banned Poison clan. He must see if they are acting for the good and if it is his responsibility to prevent them, he also wants the student to find another member of the clan who fled with the clan money that the master wants to use to good advisedly. The first students were all taught in a different style: snake, centipede, scorpion, lizard, toad, while the last student learned a little in each style. All students end up in a city looking for the old man with all the money, and soon everyone is fighting to get it. <br /> <br /> A classic martial arts film has the title of many non-fans to know. I talked to a few casual fans and it's this film that stays in their minds. It's a very good movie, although I do not really know why this film stays with people when, for my money, there are other movies that are better from the Shaw studio (One Armed Swordmen or Brave Archer series). , for example). It's not to sell the short film, it's not, since the film is structured like a mystery, our hero has no idea whoever and the Venoms themselves only know at best who is two of the others. We are given the identity of four but we still have to determine who is the fifth. The film is also strange in that for a movie about martial arts, apart from an early training sequence and the killing of the old man and his family for the price, there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes. It's daring to do it, but it's paying off as the plot and the performances catch your eye. (The film is also strange in that it's the first martial arts movie I think I've ever seen if there were no women, I do not think we have a voice and I'm pretty sure there's none in the background, it's a good little solid film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles, but which is still a very good film with which you can sit on your couch. About 7 out of 10.
