Kells' Secret is an independent animated feature film that gives us one of the legendary legends surrounding the Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript of the Middle Ages featuring the four New Testament gospels. I did not know that this book really existed, but knowledge now makes my interpretation and analysis easier. A few stories and ideas circulate about the book's creation, its author, and how it has survived for over 1,000 years. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to Brendan, an orphan living at Kells Abbey in Ireland with his uncle, Father Cellach (voiced by Brendan Gleeson). Father Cellach is building a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks. Brendan does not like the wall and the other monks either. They focus more on reading and writing, which Father Cellach no longer has the time to do. He fears the "men of the North", those who plunder and leave cities and villages empty and burned. <br /> <br /> One day, a traveler arrives from the island of Iona, near Scotland. It's Brother Aidan, a very wise man with a special book that's not finished yet. Father Cellach gives him permission to stay and Brendan gets up with him. Aidan has special projects for Brendan. He first needs ink for the book, but he needs specific berries. The only way to get them is to venture out of the walls and into the forest, a no-go area in Brendan. Seeing that he is the only chance for Aidan to continue his work, he decides to sneak up and come back with the berries before his uncle notices his absence. <br /> <br /> In the forest, Brendan meets Ashley, the protector of the forest. She passes Brendan to the bays and, along the way, becomes like his company. She warns him of the imminent danger in the darkness and not to foil it. There are worse things than the Vikings. From there, Brendan encounters new challenges with the book and the imminent certainty of an invasion. <br /> <br /> I like history a lot now that I know what she's talking about. Knowing now what the Book of Kells is and what it contains, animation makes perfect sense. I'm sure you've seen pictures or copies of ancient texts from hundreds of years ago, with frilly borders, colorful images and extravagant patterns, creatures and writings adorning the pages. Just like the opening frames of Disney's Disney Sword. The animation here contains a lot of similar designs. This creates a unique viewing experience where story and animation almost try to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> I could not leave the eyes of the incredible detail. This is one of the best 2D animations I've seen in years. It's dynamic, challenging and full of life. The characters are constantly surrounded by drawings, doodles and patterns in the trees, on the walls and in the floating airs. This enhances the film. <br /> <br /> The story is satisfactory, although I think the end could have extended a little more. With a run time of only 75 minutes, I think there could have been something special in the final act. This does not give much information nor does it allude to the meaning of the book. We are reminded of its importance but we never completely understand. We are told that it gives hope, but never why or how. It was really the only missing part of the movie. Otherwise, I found the story interesting, but completely overwhelmed by the animation. <br /> <br /> I guess it's going to a certain extent. The animation can lead a movie so far before it falls short. The story lacks some elements, but it's an interesting interpretation of a fascinating piece of history. I would recommend looking briefly at the Book of Kells just to get an idea of ​​what I and this movie are talking about. I think this will help your viewing experience a lot more. It is a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film not to be missed.
