I did not know what to expect from this movie. I love watching Brosnan in all the movies, he's always good, but it was totally different. He is messy and plays very well. In fact, he reminded me a few times at the university :) So yes, there is not much violence, there is not much action, but the dialogue breaks, the acting is superb and very refreshing, and it's pretty funny. Also :) I do not think you'll go out of the movies saying "Wow, I was blown away," but you'll come out smiling after watching a good movie. You can not ask for more than that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, a moron will put the ads in the wrong and you'll be reversed, upside down, inverted (with an inverted sound) Ads !! Brilliant. Nothing like watching an advertisement by Jack Daniels where the drink is put back in the bottle with an American commentary "Twin Peaks" :)
