Gena Rowlands plays an actress who loses her grip on reality when she witnesses the death of one of her fans. She becomes more and more deceived by reality and, as a result, her emotional turmoil interferes with her work as an actress. In the sense that it breaks all the rules of the acting game and improvises everything, while managing to engage its audience, the film is interesting (although a little important in itself) as a parallel to Cassavettes' own struggles. as a filmmaker. There are so many ideas circulating, and the result is a little confusing (I'm still thinking about the relationship between the deceased fan and Rowlands, among others), but the way they are presented, in the rough, in makes a film always interesting and stimulating. Would be good on a double bill with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
