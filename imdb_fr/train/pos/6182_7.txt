This mystery of murder with musical numbers is long on atmosphere and character but rather short on suspense and verisimilitude. Based on a play by Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, it combines a spooky plot with a behind-the-scenes vibe (a homicide investigation takes place at the opening night at the theater where a magazine musical is staged). <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive and varied: Victor McLaglen, the police officer who leads the investigation and who never fails to look idiotically, whatever the show he has in view; Jack Oakie (the pre-war Jack Lemmon or Jack Lemmon was he the post-war Jack Oakie?) As a harried director who was to coordinate the staged performance as well as the chaos behind the scenes; Jessie Ralph, always so welcoming, as a wardrobe mistress with deep and dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who has a beautiful monologue in close-up towards the end, as a trembling lady madly in love with the main male role; Carl Brisson, the Danish star, as a very masculine, directs the classic "Cocktails for Two" not once but twice; Kitty Carlisle, delivering in an operational way "Where are they coming from and where are they going?" And other Johnston-Coslow songs; the glorious Gertrude Michael, who has separated too soon from us, like a petty girl whose love for Brisson is despised; Toby Wing, usually ridiculous, which is at least the center of a fun joke. <br /> <br /> When the complications of the plot become uncontrollable, there is always an interesting performer or a fun and melodious musical number to distract. the spectator. The most famous sequence of the film is the number "Marahuana", directed by Michaels, but apart from its controversial history, it is really one of the least important musical offers. All the songs presented here are staged as if they could have fit into a standard proscenium theatrical space, as opposed to the fantastic Busby Berkeley style cinematic setup.
