Vertigo co-stars Stewart (in his last tour as a romantic leader) and Novak raise this other Stewart's "Christmas film" above the average level of entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars gives a rather moving experience and new revelations can be drawn from the film if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for private grief that impedes the relationships of many people. Overall, a nice diversion with legendary stars, 7/10.
