If Jean Renoir's first film, "Whirlpool of Fate", first takes us into the world of the countryside, rivers, peasant life that he will continue to explore, it seems logical that his second film deals in a big way. part of the rich and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to climb the ladder. Gather the characters from the first two movies and you have the seeds of his great "Grand Illusion" and "Rules of the Game". The film is beautifully filmed. The worried camera takes full advantage of the incredible apartments and backstage that dominate the inside of the film. The actors, although often overworked, also offer great moments, especially those of Werner Krauss' Muffat. But glamor and sensual Miss Hessling, who at first sight seems to be able to give Louise Brooks the courage to sail on her money, never goes beyond a single-note portrait of selfish prostitution. This may be partly a problem with the scenario, which seems to be mostly about strong points and outraged emotions; having not read the novel, I do not really know if the choices were well done or not. <br /> <br /> However, the differences between Nana's suitors are well drawn, and I particularly liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean-Ange's Vandeuvres - the tragic understandings that everyone seems to have of his ultimate destiny and their sympathy to each other, especially in the scene at the foot of the huge staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we wonder if the violence will break out - this and other gleanings on the ridiculous wealth lazy help to give the film the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Away from his greatest achievement, and for me probably a little shy overall, "Whirlpool of Fate" is always worth seeing for fans of Renoir or those interested in silent cinema in general.
