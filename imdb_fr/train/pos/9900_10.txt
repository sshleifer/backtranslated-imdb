it's movies like that that make you wish you'd never picked the nerd growing up in school. If you liked this movie, then I suggest you watch Valentine. I just discovered today that the guy who played Marty (Simon) committed suicide a little after the release of the film, which is a shame because he did a good job. I wonder if it's because of the role he played in the film. It starts when Carol pushes him to go to the girls' bathroom to pretend they're about to do it. When he changed in the shower, Carols's popular friends slipped into the bathroom and prepared everything, camera, electric shock, boom. When Marty opened the naked curtain, he realized he was being fooled. He tries to cover the shower, but the kids open it, catch Marty and start being mean to him while the camera rolls. They grabbed him, dipped his head in the toliet during the draw, and electrified him (slightly). When the children are in detention, given by the coach, 2 of the boys give Marty a joint that will make him vomit. Skip breaks one of the windows in the gym using a brick for the teacher to excuse. While Marty throws up in the bathroom, Skip sneaks into the science lab and mixes content that looks like cocaine but is not sure what it was. The laboratory explodes, disfiguring it badly. Five years later, the children who tormented him that day were invited to a five-year meeting at the old school that had been burned on the day of the explosion. One by one, people are killed. I do not understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. she could have gotten up after Marty left. She almost came out the first time.
