I saw this movie on the cable, it was really funny, the police chief stereotyped to the stereotype of the big bad guys, Jay Leno and Mr Mayagi of the star of karate in this good comedy about a prototype car part. I compare this film to "RUSH HOUR" in which a local policeman has to partner with an Asian police officer to solve a case. The farmer's market hunt in downtown Detroit brings memories back to life. Sounds nice, good script, I give it 10/10.
