This is one of the best crime drama movies of the late 90s. There was a big cast, a powerful story, and a lot of players involved gave great performances. Pacino was great; he should have been named for something. John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer did not care about his Louuu-siana accent. It may seem annoying if you can not stand this dialect. The way Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was both credible, dramatic and slightly comical. Danny Aiello was superb as always. David Paymer has been great in a supportive role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too much. It may take a second visit to remember, "which Zapatti was which?" After so many referrals, we must stop and think to summarize. The end did not have a lot of sting. It was built for so long and was then a little disappointing. It was one of the few problems with the movie. Since the film was not presented as a big hit on the big screen, it made it forget that this film even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the lack of "splash" in movie theaters may have motivated no appointment. It has been semi-successful in the domestic market and viewers are still learning that this title already exists. Made in 1996, it still exists today and will remain popular for many years. <br /> <br /> So get some lemon pudding (you'll see) and watch this movie!
