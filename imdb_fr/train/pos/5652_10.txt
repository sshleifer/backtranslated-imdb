I love the series! Many stereotypes portraying southerners as idiots are very obvious, but such people exist too often. Southern government representation is just as true, but the likeable characters are reminiscent of one of the many advantages of the South. Some things never change and we see the "good old boys" every day! There's a Lucas Buck in every southern city that just has to make a phone call to get things moving, and the "white trash" storybook is all too familiar. Aside from the supernatural elements, everything else could very well happen in the modern South! I think in a way that Trinity, SC must be in Barnwell County!
