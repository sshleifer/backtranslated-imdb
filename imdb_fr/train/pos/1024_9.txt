I have not always been a fan, but the series has grown with me. It was only after season 5 that I started to see the richness of the show. They eventually put an end to Daniel Jackson's search for his wife and most of the lords of the system were killed by rival lords, SG-1 or others. <br /> <br /> By season 5, Stargate SG-1 was becoming bland. With the new writers and the great attention of the producer Peter Deleuise, the series becomes more and more solid. <br /> <br /> The characters have also become obsolete. Colonel Jack O'Neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. After his son, Charlie, was killed in a shooting accident with O'Neill's weapon, he decided to end his life by going to Abydos in order to confront the RA of Go ' ould. The character offers little growth to an actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play it directly, raising emotional barriers to protect himself. allowing only close friends to enter. <br /> <br /> Amanda Tapping joins the cast as captain Samantha Carter. She was a feminist at the limit, ready to face any man who doubted his ability to do his job. Although this character has little to develop, Tapping did a great job focusing on Carter's strengths. She took the time to understand some of the things Carter is talking about so that she can present the character intelligently. <br /> <br /> Christopher Judge joined the cast while playing abroad Teal'c. Teal'c was an alien called Jaffa. The baby Go'ould (creature resembling a snake) would sink into the Jaffa until it reached the point where it would be inserted into another form of life. Jaffa would die. Teal'c was the first of Apophis's army. Knowing that Apophis was not a god like Go'ould might believe, he realized the genocide their armies had inflicted on the galaxy. Finally, having enough, Jack O'Neill and he released their team with some innocents. After arriving on Earth, he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for, which would help him fight the Go'ould. Christopher Judge did a lot of things with a limited character. Teal'c is a savvy warrior, most of whom was learned by his teacher, Master Bra'tac. The show would not be complete without Master Bra'tac performed by Tony Amandola. He is also a rock. In the end, he became an advisor to most SG-1 members, especially Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Don S. Davil was there from the beginning to play Major General George Hammand. Davis did an amazing job with Hammond, making him nice and normal. He does his job, has a wife, sons, daughters and grandchildren. You can really say that he is the anchor of the base. Simply, I would die for this man. If his superiors do not allow him to provide troops to support teams outside the world. He will go himself. He left no one behind. <br /> <br /> I saved Dr. Daniel Jackson for last, because this character, I think, has grown over the last ten or eleven years. In choosing Shanks, I do not think the producer understands how powerful Shanks is. Now, when people talk about Jackson, they do not talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks. In the early years, Jackson's character started crying. That's why I was probably not a fan. As the seasons go by, the character has become stronger. This gave him confidence. At the end of season 10, Jackson's character has matured to the point of becoming a self-sacrificing hero. He always monitors the group's ethics. He is always responsible for providing information that can advance a mission. Akeology, history, culture and exploration are part of its very being. He is determined. Although the man of peace, he has matured to the point that the use of his weapons may be the only way to resolve a dispute. <br /> <br /> Other characters include, more recently: Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder), new head of SG-1. Both actors belong to a series called Farscape and the reason they were assembled is obvious. I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton (Farscape character). The character of Black is simply out of the ordinary. Definitely different from his soldier as the character Arin Soon.
