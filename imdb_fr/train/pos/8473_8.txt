This charming and tender sequel to the famous hit "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is just a sequel. Stories abound in a sleepy and isolated fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called "Big Bay Ty" that resides at the bottom of Boggy Creek's unattractive swamps. Two bratty brothers and their older and more reasonable tomboy sister (a sweet and cheeky performance of the future star of the "Different Strokes" sitcom, Dana Plato) head to the traitorous swamp to see if the creature of the local legend is really living. The trio is desperately lost in a violent storm and the hairy Sasquatch, looking like a bear, gigantic, but very kind and caring, comes to the rescue of the children. <br /> <br /> Tom Moore's casual, unadorned direction tells a simple story at a leisurely pace, minutely capturing the working details of the rural town of the rural city, drawing the country's characters with lots of warmth and affection, and happily developing the feeling in an organic, sober and non-forced manner, which never degenerates into a sticky feeling. -sappy mush. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island") gives a passionate and brave portrayal of the loving single-parent mother of the working class, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer pleasantly irascible support as two haystacked boobies . The sunny and powerful cinematography of Robert Bethard shows the wooded setting in all its sumptuously tranquil, painfully pure and fragile, untouched by the splendor of civilization. Darrell Deck's score brilliantly combines the thrill of the synthesizer and banjo banjo bluegrass to form a melodious sound. In addition, this image deserves special praise for the way it is strangely predicting fashion vogue Bigfoot for children of the 90's almost 15 years in advance.
