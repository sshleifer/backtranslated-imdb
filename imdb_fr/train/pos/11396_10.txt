Released two years before my birth, this Oscar-winning film has it all: gorgeous costumes and costumes in Technicolor, breathtaking cinematography, superb Gershwin music from one wall to another, high-quality choreography, lighter scenario that looks and great performances of Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guetary and Caron. Hollywood does not do that anymore. It's certainly my favorite movie of all time, a standard by which I judge every other movie. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!
