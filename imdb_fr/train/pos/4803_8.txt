It's hard to find a real historical drama based on the lives of many British monarchs. Just take a respected British or Australian actor, make things more beautiful and get a formula that allows you to win Oscars. <br /> <br /> The Young Victoria is no exception. and beautiful, with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics. Featuring Emily Blunt in a role in which she can finally ride, the film begins with Victoria's 18th birthday and discusses the intrigue and issues surrounding her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). As young Victoria laments herself, she is moved by several parties like a chess pawn, as she finds her place and voice among the most influential leaders in Britain. <br /> <br /> rather typical territory, it is the development of the relations between Victoria and Albert which makes the film a little more interesting. I admit: I have a history degree with a specialization in the Victorian era, so I'm a little attached to these numbers. Despite their many flaws as leaders, Victoria and Albert were among the first leaders dedicated to improving the civilization of their people. They left their legacy in the arts, public health and education, as well as in Victoria's conservative views and mourning culture after Albert's death. But these things are only briefly mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> It is fairly well established that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love, but had a level of mutual respect that is not usually seen between monarchs. in arranged marriages. Even if it happened behind the scenes, theirs was certainly one of the best known. Blunt and Friend have just the right kind of chemistry to do justice to the famous couple, the appropriate mixture of restraint and despair. It's a different love, not usually shown on the screen, especially in this kind of movie. It is encouraging to finally see a relationship in which men and women are on an equal footing. <br /> <br /> But we do not see this love enough. While filmmakers are trying to get the business into the trap of politics, it does not really create the kind of momentum needed to keep the tension at a high level. Plus, without going into the more advanced public works of the couple, things feel a little limbo, superficial instead of intimate, and sometimes confusing. It's not such a big issue during the movie, but then the effects fade away quite quickly and you try to remember what you just watched, despite the great performances of the main actors, including Blunt, who even captures the expressions of the famous monarch. <br /> <br /> As far as she tries, Victoria succeeds in many ways but lacks the spark that would make it go from solid to classic.
