Back in '74, Eric Monte shot Good Times, T.V. JJ's classic show has always been my favorite, and I love to watch reruns on T.V Land. Jimmie Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther Rolle. John Amos most of the time felt a little jealous of Jimmie Walker's popularity, saving millions of fans time to sit down and watch Good Times. The show would have been dead if JJ would not have been there to rescue him with his always Kool Aid attitude. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing in the series. I was 3 when he came out and 8 when it ended. Instead of 1974-1979, it should have been longer, as in the 1980s, when I was just growing up.
