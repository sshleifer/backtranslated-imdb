Yes, it sounds awkward and does not sound as funny as many big-budget comedies, but this film is really hilarious if you really watch it. Tim Meadows always seemed funny to me outside of Saturday Night Live. Whenever he would make this character in the series, I would laugh. So, after seeing that it was going to play on Comedy Central one night, I decided to check. Overall, this movie was very impressed because it does not feature any Oscars or comedy of the year, but entertained Saturday Night Live fans who love the character of Ladies Man. This film is also packed with some highly quoted lines that can be recited for years to come.
