I was a little afraid to watch this movie because of its rates. But to live in Italy like titles like this one has never been approached and I like step so much that I decided to try it. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance film I've seen recently, with a deeper meaning than "winning". It is touching and well written and well directed. Raya is such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubts, she is so mature and focused and CONSCIOUS of her TALENT (and the talent that Rutina Wesley has, my jaw dropped into the final dance scene) . The way she pursues her dream and refuses to leave everything to stop it is, honestly, inspiring. In addition, the fact that she is not the super hot girl (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes it really attractive and real. Seriously, why is this movie so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good job. Really good actually. I even cried at the end of the film. And the dance routines are just sick.
