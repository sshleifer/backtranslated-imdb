This is apparently the second remake of this film, having already been shot in 1911 and 1918. It reminds me in many ways of the latest film, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films are about a provocative hard blow that happens in one of the best schools in the world and both show, in the end, the hard blow, a slow learning of teamwork and decency. In this movie, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And Jack Pickford, still in the role of Mary's brother, is also seconded. Of these three players, Pickford is the best, as a friendly loser who becomes Tom's buddy. It actually has some decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the classic clich√©s are there and the film, because it has been done so many times before and since, offers few surprises. However, it's a nice movie and enjoyable viewing. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, for a better silent college film, try Harold Lloyd's THE FRESHMAN - his football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is much more likeable. and friendly than the boring Tom Brown. THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find of the time. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is less striking is that William Haines played essentially the same unfathomable and inconceivable character with the same storyline over and over again (as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, among others) - and if you 're J I saw one of these movies, you've seen them all. Well done, but certainly not original! And, since this is just a rehearsal of his other films, it is highly recommended to anyone who awards the film a score of 10 to see these other films. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and see This little movie was the highest rated movie on IMDb of the 1920s !! Talk about overestimated! There are dozens and dozens of best films - how did this film become No. 1?
