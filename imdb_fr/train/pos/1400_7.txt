Bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed it. Shore Leave is truly TOS's first attempt at light science fiction (which they would later perfect with the classic Trouble with Tribbles). This gave the crew of the Enterprise and its viewers the necessary respite from the universe, threatening for example the consequences of the Corbomite Manouever. <br /> <br /> In search of a place to relax a moment, the Enterprise performs on a seemingly idyllic M-class planet and sends an exploratory team to take a closer look. Soon, all kinds of nonsense begin to happen - some seemingly perilous - but all of this seems to be a jumble of human emotional extremes unfolding in a strange mix of fantasy mystery (McCoy went through the mirror), psychological thriller (Kirk is followed by an indefatigable tyrant of his past) and a romantic comedy (without comment). <br /> <br /> TOS was the least serialized of all the series of the Trek franchise, so it's easy to forget the number of episodes The first season was focused on a heavy and potentially disastrous hand drama. Unlike later series franchise writers, the TOS production team is not afraid to literally go where no television series has gone before. And Shore Leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (especially Shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor) did not seem to know how to handle this new ride on ST's themes. The last scene is perhaps one of the worst scenes in the entire TOS series that I can remember, both in terms of composition and acting. <br /> <br /> 'Nuff says. My recommendation - see it while watching the first season as it was supposed to be seen - it's the order.
