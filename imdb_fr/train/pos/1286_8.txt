This familiar story of an older man / younger woman is surprisingly hard. Bikers, hippies, free love and prison bait blend together surprisingly well in this forgotten indie effort in black and white. Leading actress Patricia Wymer, as "Candy" holder, gives the best performance of her career (covering all 3 epics of drive-in). Wymer was early and attractive in THE YOUNG GRADUATES (1971), but gave a more serious performance in THE BABYSITTER. Occasional violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising, but well managed by the director. Wymer and George E. Carey, leaders, sell the romance of May / December in a credible way. There are enough similarities between THE BABYSITTER and THE YOUNG GRADUATES that one might wonder if the same director directed the latter film as well. Patricia Wymer, where are you? <br /> <br /> Originally from Seattle, Washington, Miss Wymer appeared as a dancer on the rock and roll TV show MALIBU U, before making the cover (as well as an eighth page) of August 1968 issue of "Best For Men", a tasteful adult magazine. She also appeared as a legendary witch in THE WITCHMAKER, the famous cult movie buff in 1969. <br /> <br /> THE BABYSITTER finally made her home video debut as part of the BCI DRIVE-in set of eight movies. CULT CLASSICS vol. 3, available on Amazon.com and in some retail stores such as Best Buy.
