This is my fourth short film by Joe McDoakes that I have seen and so far the funniest. In this one, Joe draws voice lessons from a CD imitating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for instructions that baffle them. He then meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes), who speaks in a more normal voice that is not very far from his future Geroge Jetson and arrives on the set where he automatically annoys the director. I'm going to stop here and say just how funny I was, and I was fascinated by the movie star cameos towards the end. The final scene was particularly fun so go on YouTube if you want to watch So You Wanna Be in Picutres!
