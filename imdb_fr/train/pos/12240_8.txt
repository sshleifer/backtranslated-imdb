If you're the type of person looking for a realistic movie or movie with a strong and credible plot, then this movie is not for you. No, you'll hate him. However, for those who like soft and light comedies, then you will have a good time watching this light film. <br /> <br /> Tony Randall works for the IRS and he's investigating a very good farmer who never realized he needed to file a tax return. Despite all his efforts to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, all members of the family are delighted to have company. They treat him and treat him as a member of the family, and intend to have him attached to their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's really all the conspiracy that exists. But the film gets high marks for a fun scenario and a decent acting game. A very nice little curiosity of the late 1950s.
