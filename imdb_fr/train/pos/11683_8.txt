I really enjoyed this episode, which was a big surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have gained. From the point of view of pure writing, "The 16mm Sanctuary" is an absolute treat, with fantastic dialogues and a typical Sterling character analysis. In particular, I really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode, addressing themes of existence and reality, while balancing them with more psychological topics such as denial, pride and desire. "The Sixteen-millimeter Sanctuary" is an episode on how these ideas based on the refusal to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the world in constant evolution. It's also a fantastic example of Twilight Cerebral Zone; one that explores the mind rather than the outside world. These elements come together very nicely to create a stimulating and extremely interesting reflection of 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> The episode is not without flaws, however, mainly in Lupino and Leisen shoes. Ironically, I felt that Lupino was unconvincing, with only a few scenes that could count as memorable. Of course, this is a shame considering how Sterling wrote his character. In addition, Leisen did not seem to know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes leaving them on the board doing nothing - which probably explains why they accepted Lupino's poor performance half the time. Fortunately, Balsam conceals many weaknesses and at least helps to interpret the show from the point of view of the game. <br /> <br /> As I said before, if you're a fan of classic film and science- cerebral fiction, this should not be as serious as sometimes claimed. In addition to the writing I mentioned above, the episode also includes some fantastic photographs (it always surprises me to see that the series is as beautiful almost fifty years later!) And decor decent enough. Overall, "the sanctuary of 16 millimeters" is a big episode and especially an event to make you think.
