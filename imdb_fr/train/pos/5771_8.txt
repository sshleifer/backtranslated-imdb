It's one of those movies you see when you surf a channel on a Saturday afternoon, where you train and end up watching it all. I thought it was well played and it made me really feel the characters. Although it's a bit slow, focusing on the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it's never been boring. We do not really see much of all the robberies for which they were so legendary, and most shootings occur when they are ambushed by the police. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, had really done a good job with her character. Moving from a nice country girl to a cold-blooded murderer is hard to describe, and I appreciated the subtlety she brought to the role. <br /> <br /> Overall, an above average effort, especially if it does for the TV movie.
