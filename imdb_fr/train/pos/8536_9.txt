I recently had the chance to see "The Waterdance" and enjoyed it. I do not really understand why this is so called because there is not really any dance there, except perhaps for the dance at the strip club towards the end. We meet the main characters throughout the film, invalids in a hospital. The story shows a love story between a physically disabled man and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you can not see such films today. I'm not "stuck in time", I'm not saying that everything in the 80s and early 90s was better than today, but I really think that the film industry is deteriorating and that there is a lot to learn from old movies - by old movies, I mean nothing from 1920-1998.
