Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) purse Candy's wallet (Jean Peters) contains a large microfiche for the communist cause. She is followed by two federal agents who are waiting to leap once she has handed over the microfiche to her contact. However, Skip steals the purse in the subway under the nose of everyone and begins to hunt down both by the police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy who want to recover the microfiche. Skip can only be found by Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information about criminals. It is clear to Skip that what he stole is important and that both parties want the film, but he intends to hold on to good prices. This leads Joey to chase and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to hand over the microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> It's a well-played movie and a good start that gets you involved right away. It's a bit unrealistic to see how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this is necessary because otherwise, why would she hold on to Joey later. It's a good movie.
