Why do not more (mostly American) movies look more like Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I am accused of "electric ecstasy" after choosing "Meatball Machine" as my first activity. This is a criticism, so I will try to stick to simple reflections and emotions. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is a creative work, even if it is clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO! So what if it's not all original? I own both of these films and although Tetsuo is a strange son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is far superior and can be seated without the keen desire to indulge in a dose of psychotropic drugs to clarify the meaning of the film. Meatball Machine is as elaborate in its history as in its high influx of blood and blood. Thank you Jesus for Japanese cinema! <br /> <br /> In simple terms, the last time my dreams were overwhelmed by horror visions occurred after watching Nightmare on Elm Street at the age of about seven. I could imagine in my dreams a language coming out of a phone for weeks. This time (at age 31), my dreams were pleasantly impressive. <br /> <br /> In this film, the human bodies welcome aliens whose sole purpose is to try to satisfy their eternal satisfaction in matters of flesh and blood. Humans become carnivorous cyborgs !!! There is more!!! Battle scenes !! Good music!! Beautiful shots! Decent acting by Cyborg woman (at least better than her male counterpart). The fight seen at the end deserves to be observed ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention that it's a love story! Wow, I hate love stories, but I'm fine! <br /> <br /> I can not wait to have friends to watch this movie one more time, just to see the reaction on their faces. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review because I'm afraid most friends and family members do not understand Meatball Machine. The truth is that America as a whole is not prepared for Meatball Machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, my wife came in as I watched the decisive fight scene at the end and she was speechless. Normally, she says something like, "why are you looking at this junk?" This time she had nothing to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> This is not undesirable. It's not fair SPLATTER (splashing for splashing is also great). It's Art my friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
