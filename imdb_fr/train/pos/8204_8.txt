Suddenly Impact was overall better than The Enforcer in my opinion. It was becoming a good movie, but then I saw the villain (s) and was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The sudden impact was different from the previous ones. The plot has taken a different direction in this movie, Dirty Harry is not adopting the approach of the police this time around. We will not see the bad guys until later, which means less time on the screen, which is better for all of us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood steals the spotlight again as Dirty Harry, says enough. Pat Hingle was nice as Chef Jannings, Harry's new assigned chef. Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name and became Captain Briggs. Anyway, he was no different. Michael Currie is honest as Lieutenant Donnelly, Harry's boring superior. I personally enjoyed Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, the young punk who is organizing a vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was excellent as Horace, Harry's boyfriend. Audrie J. Neenan played Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian of the city. Jack Thibeau has been described as Kruger, a pervert. Now for the very bad part. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's long-time lover, was horribly misinterpreted by Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was just horrible as Mick. <br /> <br /> The film would have been so much better if it were not for better writing and playing on certain parts. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
