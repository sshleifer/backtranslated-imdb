The film begins very slowly, with the lifestyle of Wallace Napalm, a photo station attendant. His wife was confined to her home with an ankle bracelet after being convicted of arson. Wallace is a member of the Volunteer Fire Department and takes firefighting seriously. <br /> <br /> As we watch Wallace's boring life, suddenly something new and shocking comes up: a street carnival comes to town. Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother, is one of his stars. He's a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> <br /> Like Wallace. They are both pyrokinetics or "pyrotics", people who can light fires with mental energy. Wallace keeps his secret powers; Wilder lets his knowledge know what he can do. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Some of their differences go back to an incident in their childhood where they inadvertently caused the death of a tramp. Wallace refrains from using his powers; Wilder wants to go public on national television. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, Wilder wants Wallace's wife, with whom they have been dating years together. She becomes a bone of contention and becomes one of the reasons why the two brothers finally have a literal foot fight. <br /> <br /> The film is fun, but not funny. I think about it enough to have a copy in my library. It's a good, offbeat movie.
