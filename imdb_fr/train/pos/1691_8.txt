This movie is funny and suitable for all ages. It's really a family-type entertainment. Distribution plays very well in the city of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we must assume that nothing ever happens since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and unique) exit ramp of the Interstate. The location appeals as boring and totally improbable for the invasion of the land by the Martians. But these Martians are totally incompetent, although they are well equipped with an arsenal of properly horrible and lethal weapons ... including one that aims to eradicate the Martians! The Martians unveil their lines and throw the necessary accents so that the spectators and the locals wish to help them ... leave the Earth. J. J. Anderson playing the very young Halloween carnivorous duck just has big lines. Watch this movie to laugh and entertain you. it's not stimulating. But it's subtle and pleasant.
