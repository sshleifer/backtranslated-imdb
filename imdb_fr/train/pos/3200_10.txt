It's an excellent series of Canadian comedies. The film tells how stars Jean Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the main screenwriter of the series as well as his friends Rickie and Bubbles play the main role in what is a real satirical look at the trailer parks and the inhabitants of these crazies. The film will tell you why Rickie and Julian are beginning to make their forwards forwards into the world of crime. WHY and the reasons behind everything would be a spoiler so I will not give the real reasons behind their brighter getaways. Their friend and partner often (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The entire series is brilliant and the absence of the film will not affect your vision of sit-com. It's a comedy with a capital C and a brilliant satire about life in trailer parks and little crooks with small-time ideas but big dreams. If you have the opportunity to watch - buy - steal this program, grab it. You will be glad to have done it. And to my American friends --- it's going to break you too. 10 of 9. Brilliant. TV how television should be.
