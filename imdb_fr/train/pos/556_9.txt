Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their flock from Seattle to Alaska to Canada to claim. Once there, they will face an attractive and whimsical businesswoman, Ruth Roman, and a villain, James McIntire, mean and creepy. <br /> <br /> John Wayne may be more of a talk about him, but his good friend Stewart has some excellent hard-edged westerns as well, some with great director Anthony Mann. Frankly, I think that, with its robust action sequences and beautiful melodrama, we're shooting every day in northern Alaska! <br /> <br /> The Far Country offers breathtaking landscapes and cinematography that should have been shot on the big screen. <br /> <br /> In addition, Brennan, Roman (who is great), always very reliable, Corrine Calvet, incredibly cute, and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types of villain, the kind that does not take not too seriously. <br /> <br /> That would make an excellent bill with another highly recommended Mann / Stewart, located northwest of the west, Bend Of The River.
