A GOOD DAMN FILM! One who is seriously underestimated. The songs that the children sing in the film gave me an idea of ​​their pain, but also of their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg makes a good performance here, but the best performance of the whole film is that of the actress who plays the main character. I wish it was in more movies. <br /> <br /> This film should have a higher rating. I give him a 10/10.
