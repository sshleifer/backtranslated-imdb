First things first! This is not an action movie although there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! Where a team of very bad players succeeds the unthinkable, winning a match or tournament beyond expectations! In this case, it is not football or baseball, but Taekwondo! At first, these thugs seem to be useless! But soon, we will discover that they do not want to be thugs and that they really succeed something in life! It's good to see them struggle and train! I was surprised how funny this movie was! From beginning to end, you'll laugh in your pants! The young Korean actors are very convincing! Go see this wonderful movie feel good!
