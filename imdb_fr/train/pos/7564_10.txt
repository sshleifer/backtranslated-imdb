In my work, I am sometimes contacted by independent filmmakers who try to make their film known. When I can, I watch these low budget movies and often make me think that the future of Hollywood is going to the dogs. From time to time, however, there is a film born of pure passion and desire, as if it were created to remind the film industry that good films are still possible. The short film BROKEN, directed by Alex Ferrari, is a real surprise and deserves a second glance. <br /> <br /> Barely 20 minutes away, BROKEN tries to tell a fascinating (but surreal) story with almost no story back. The public is immersed in the middle of the action without any idea of ​​what is happening. A young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) wakes up after a dream of hearing a shot and is then removed to her home. When she wakes up, she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs who seem to be at home in a comic strip. These naughty guys and girls are bigger than life. They are all rifles and knives. There is no escape. <br /> <br /> The bottom line here is that even though it's a low budget movie, it does not play like a movie. From the beginning, the feeling is that B R O K E N has been shot, edited and produced by professionals. It seems that Quentin Tarantino could have done something in his free time while training with the Wachowski brothers. The film is clean and cool, looks good and feels like something big. <br /> <br /> The acting is much better than what I usually see in these little movies. Polay and Paul Gordon (who plays the main killer, Duncan) were well chosen. As two of the few speaking roles in the film, it's up to them to wear the film. No special effect, as good as it may be, would have saved this film from the bad acting of the actors. Fortunately, Polay manages to express a real fear and Gordon manages to become a true psychopath. Some of the more limited roles seem to be occupied by lesser talents, but this is hardly seen. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of B R O K E N is that it lasts only 20 minutes. The story ends with a twist of Twilight Zone that seems a little artificial and is hardly subtle. Looking at this, I felt like I was supposed to have an epiphany, but there was only the feeling that it was much more commonplace than I had hoped. The film tries to be part of these riddles that let the public speak for hours at the local coffee shop, but that is unsatisfactory. I still think it's the first 20 minutes of a longer movie. <br /> <br /> MY COAST: 8 out of 10.
