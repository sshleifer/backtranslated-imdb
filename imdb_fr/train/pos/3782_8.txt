When I was a kid, I really loved Bill and Ted Movies. The other night, Bogus Journey was running and as it was at least 5 years since I last saw the movie, I decided to give the radio. This movie is always funny after all these years. "Excellent adventure" is better, but it rocks anyway. Of course, some of the performances are a little lame, but hey, this whole movie is nerdy in a cool way. In addition, it presents the coolest character of death ever seen in a movie! Concluding: Totally, like a non-fictional guy! Way Excellent! STATION!!!
