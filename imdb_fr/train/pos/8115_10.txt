The first two parts seek to reduce to absurd the rise of useless wars and to govern nationalist barbarians. Part 3 speculates that progress and exploration to the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring meaningful use of talent and human resources. There are speeches that some viewers reject as naive or narcotic, but that make others shudder. It depicts a rifle / space launcher and a helicopter, as well as innovative mass communication devices, lifts, flat screens and wireless intercoms. It is probably incorrect to talk about windowless buildings in the future. But it depicts a childish vision of an endless scientific / technological investigation. <br /> <br /> For me, this sounds like a film about a group of rational-minded thinkers guided by a morality similar to Spinozean's in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through progress scientists and a unified world government. Progressive characters (like the two cabals) think that humanity could "live forever" preserving our experiences and our progress for future generations, always standing on our humanity as on the shoulders of giants. <br /> <br /> Arthur C. Clarke (author of 2001: A Space Odyssey) suggested this film to Stanley Kubrick as an example of an excellent SF film. Kubrick hated it and said he would never look at another film based on Clarke's suggestions (source: Clarke's special introduction to his 2001 novel). Although the late Clarke continued to suggest it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him what were the best SF movies. It has a beautiful Menzies artistic design, but mediocre special effects (especially toy tanks). <br /> <br /> Personally, I loved it and I think it perfectly captures the spirit of modernity. He is a little naive about the possibility of creating a crime-free society for an extended period. It also seems unlikely that progress is inevitable. It seems to me that we could as well go back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we would kill ourselves by overpopulation or by our inability to escape a next major natural disaster. But this shows the importance of taking risks against the scandal of the public and nannies face the potential threats of accidents and deaths in space. This challenges us to choose the side of progress over small desires for safety, comfort or happiness: <br /> <br /> CABALE: "Too much!" And too early, we call it the but for MAN no rest and no end He must continue - the conquest beyond conquest.This little planet, its winds and its ways, and all the laws of the mind and matter that hold it back Then the planets around him, and finally through the immensity towards the stars And when he has conquered all the depths of space and all the mysteries of time, he will always begin. "<br /> </ br> > CABALE: "If we are only animals, we must take our little bits of happiness, and live and suffer and pass, without further concern, than all other animals - or did." {It shows the stars.} "That's it - or that - the whole universe - or nothingness ..." (quotes from the script). <br /> <br /> If this sounds like a rationalization consecrating the entire society to progress, the (world government) board members will then appear as technocrats. But in reality, these "technocrats" allow their citizens to become artisans or freely pursue other passions, and they should be repressed by government bans, laws against science and experimentation, as well as by other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants. . <br /> <br /> In fact, a large group of conspiracy rebels feel belittled by all the scientific and technological advances of the council. They are therefore trying to stop progress and put an end to the freedom of the council to experiment. The progress-oriented council will not suppress the rebels' freedom of speech, but will prepare its "gas of peace" in case of emergency and will simply want the freedom and space to continue its progress. <br /> <br /> history about the freedom to do science, as much as about the wonders of progress. Many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic assumptions, except in the case of social bias (many want to ban cloning, for example) or naturalism (some do not want us to progress freely, and would prefer simply extinguished in due time while being slave to the earth) or by fear / reason (some think we are not ready for advanced science / technology because we risk destroying ourselves). But Cabal (the president of the council) has an answer to the problem of danger: "Our (scientific) revolution has not abolished death or danger, it has simply valorized death and danger" (scenario).
