I can only echo the praise of other critics here. It is a delicious film with a factor of well-being that he achieves without colliding with a soppy sentimentality. Naturally sweet - no added sugar. <br /> <br /> A small point: it seems to me that the moderate objections raised about the character of Ustinov, Pendelton, who can enter and defeat the security of the system ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / scientist to that sort of thing. Yes, the film was rather illiterate in computer science, but it showed that Pendelton was "computer-savvy" in his apartment, and I think that would probably imply that his donations allowed him to just swallow the whole thing almost overnight. <br /> <br /> There were some strange moments when he appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff. I do not know if we were supposed to believe that Pendelton was doing a good job of getting out of this situation, or if he knew enough to pass the tests - it was a little fuzzy. <br /> <br /> Certainly, he had to know enough to set up fictitious accounts. Presumably, Wallach and Ustinov relied on their own rather vague notion of how computers worked at the time, and to understand in detail what they were looking for, it is necessary to know exactly what their concept was. They knew that there was something important in the "procedures"; they thought that "intelligent light" could really control security, rather than simply state its state; they thought that the user terminal features (stupid) would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself - even if, apart from graphics features, I do not see it myself. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, I think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as much as they could, and they did it pretty well. By allowing them a bit of artistic license, I do not think their efforts have any notable flaws. <br /> <br /> CD
