Since musicals are both outmoded and incredibly expensive to produce without all the talent needed to make a contract with a studio, I doubt we'll ever have a real story of Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if all else was in place, it was no coincidence that no Hollywood studio had attempted to do it before Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had a contract with Mario Lanza . No one else could have done it. I doubt that it is done again. <br /> <br /> And why would he do it? I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been pleased with the way his song was portrayed on screen. For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on earth. <br /> <br /> To say that liberties were taken with one's life is to be modest. Caruso, like the man who represented him, was a man of big appetite, but with much more self-discipline. He has had many relationships with several women and has spawned two non-marital sons that are not included in this film. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the record industry is seen almost as an afterthought. He is shown in a recording studio once late in his life. In fact, he began recording around the turn of the last century, and with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA, Victor made the recording industry what it became. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were up to them, you almost had to inherit a ticket to see one or the other play live. But many Italian and Irish immigrant families had a phonograph and a record or three of these men. This is the reason why both have become the legend they are. <br /> <br /> The film contains some opera arias superbly directed by Mario Lanza. A foretaste of what he could have become if he had become the discipline of a Caruso. stick to the opera. The Grand Caruso has won an Oscar for sound recording and nominations for costume and set design. <br /> <br /> Mario himself helped popularize the film with a RCA Red Seal album composed of songs from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately, because of contractual obligations, we could not get an album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna as well. <br /> <br /> Although Blyth sang it in the movie, Lanza had recorded a hit from The Most Beautiful Night of the Year helped popularize The Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, that's not it. If you're looking for a great singing artist at the peak of his career, do not miss The Great Caruso.
