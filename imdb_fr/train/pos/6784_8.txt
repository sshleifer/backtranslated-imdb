I love my frisky and debonair Ronald Colman style, the one you see in movies like If I Were King and Kismet. I love it as the embodiment of civilization as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. Colman is not one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> But in A Double Life precisely because his role as an actor Anthony John is so quirky for him, Colman was awarded an Oscar for Best Actor for 1947. He became his role on better known. <br /> <br /> Colman is an actor who takes the Method very seriously. He has just finished a successful series in a comedy of good manners and is rather jovial. To change the pace now that this match ended on Broadway, Colman revives Othello in New York. <br /> <br /> His main lady is his ex-wife Signe Hasso who loves him very much, but can not bear his mood change when he is at work. Colman likes him a lot too and wants to get her back. But he is heading for a mental depression when he begins to merge with the jealous Moor Othello and Hasso with his role as Desdemona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters as a poor waitress a depressed Colman picks up gets in her way from her madness and she ends up as poor Desdemona in the room. Killed in the same way and now, the case of the police officer responsible for the homicide, Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Colman's performance is so good that one wonders if it's a professional risk with actors? I would shudder to think that if there were unsolved homicides in or around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, then they tried Othello. <br /> <br /> I could never really buy the story for that reason, but I certainly applaud Ronald Colman and what he did with the role. I'm sure there was a hint of regret in his Oscar win, as one of the other nominees was his good friend William Powell for Life With Father. That year, Gregory Peck for Gentlemen's Agreement, John Garfield for Body and Soul and Michael Redgrave for Mourning became Electra. <br /> <br /> Colman is supported by the rest of the cast, including Edmond O '. Brien who is in the unwanted part of Cassio in the jealous fantasy of Colman. You will not find an equivalent Iago in A Double Life, no one pushing jealousy, everything is in his mind. <br /> <br /> And that of one of the most cultured and civilized minds of the last century.
