I appreciated the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal among them. The gorilla looks just great, and his eyes were particularly realistic. It's even a little scary sometimes and children should be slightly frightened without going beyond. Ren√© Russo plays his role wonderfully feminine. Usually, these types of Hollywood movies that have taken place in the past feel the need to create an evil strawman, but the only opponent is the gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close certain animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions as us, but how we really can not treat them like men because they are not. not. Few films venture into this territory and it is interesting to see if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity.
