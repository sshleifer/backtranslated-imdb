What can I say about the very first movie? <br /> <br /> You can not judge because it's not supposed to be entertaining. But if you have to rate it, you should give it a 10. It's amazing to see moving images from the year 1895. It was one of the most important movies in history. I wonder how it was to be one of those who saw the very first movie! <br /> <br />
