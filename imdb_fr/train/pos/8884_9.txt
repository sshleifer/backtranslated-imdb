I really enjoyed the 60's. Not being of this generation (I'm waiting for the '80s'), it was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for that time. <br /> <br /> A major problem of the film, however, lay in the imbalance the film was in the representation of families. According to the promos I saw for the movie on NBC, it was basically two families struggling with problems in America in the 1960s. I may have missed something, but I think we we learned more about the white family than about the African-American family. <br /> <br /> I really think that the 60s use music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue coming out of the mouth of the actors (all very talented.) This is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours) of the mini-series. <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
