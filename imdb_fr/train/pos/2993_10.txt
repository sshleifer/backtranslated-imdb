Apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallette as a gruff police detective, Jack La Rue in Italian "swarthy" and of course, James Lee as "The Chinese cook", this film is THE great mystery of a murder in a locked room. For a film from the early 1930s, this "mystery peeling stage" is similar to the COLUMBO series, except that in this movie you do not have the benefit of knowing who the killer was in advance.
