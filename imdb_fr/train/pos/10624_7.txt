I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. The film is not great, but it contains a lot of interesting elements. The lighting and the scenes with the work of the camera are excellent. The story is slow and weak, but entertaining. The acting is bad, but not worse than what you'll find on the SyFy channel. The music is pretty good and the gore is good. He has the big leather face in the film and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the movie in its entirety and although generally predictable, it was always nice. The women are quite attractive and the main actor does a good job of broody and goose bumps. The film was remarkably clean with modern film and violence appropriate for children 13 and older. There were no sex scenes. I gave 7 out of 10 and I think that's right. I would watch it again if I had nothing better to do. The angel with the gay sound was the most annoying aspect of the film, the devil is pretty scary.
