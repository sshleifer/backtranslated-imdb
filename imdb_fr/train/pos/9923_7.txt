I read several mixed reviews and many of them have outright destroyed the movie. This project originally interested me because it was directed by Tony Scott and his work interests me a lot after Man On Fire had such a profound impact on me. Before starting my review, let me first say this ... it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary way, but the writers and Scott chose a different approach. <br /> <br /> Terrain: <br /> <br /> Simply put, it's not boring. Most Hollywood movies provide "proven" intrigue that they believe will connect with people, often ensuring public acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit. This plot is one of the most interesting that I've seen in a while. Just for reference, I recently watched 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War', and although I would say that these films are excellent, I have both loved them immensely. The intrigues of these films are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be informed. They are not at risk, and they are extremely predictable after watching a lot of American movies. The plot of Domino is both interesting and told in a way that makes you think "oh man, they're screwed now". And I think that is lacking in many recent movies. In my opinion, it has a lot of depth and gives you a lot of questions to ask while you look at it. Overall, that's what interested me so much in the movie. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I thought the characters were accurate. Knightley did a wonderful job in describing a beautiful woman, who was anything but inside and wanted to be considered what she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and that she was taking all the means she had to do it. Choco was also very credible, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to Domino's lack of affection, as well as his problems with jealousy within the team ... they all seemed loyal to me , which made me feel that his character was much more realistic. <br /> <br /> Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it always sounded true to me. He seemed like an ordinary guy, trying to make ends meet. I hope that's what the filmmakers tried to accomplish with him, because that's what I drew. He did a very good job of showing Ed in a mean way that Joe had made mistakes, but was still trying to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I believe they provided the "necessary heart". to history. They were not just people who were looking for money to buy a Bentley, they were real people who had a real problem and they were looking for other ways to achieve that goal. You could empathize with them because, for them, this child's illness was a problem without any other solution. These characters were supposed to show real people less fortunate who ended up in this mess because they needed help. <br /> <br /> Gangsters: They made the story sinister in a way that only the crowd can. And I really liked this part. They also enriched the story with small subtleties that made the plot even more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 Guys: <br /> <br /> They provided comic relief in an otherwise serious movie. Clumsy Walken statements with endless references to 90210 types being has-beens. Their involvement in the film made the film even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes .... cinematography. This is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans. But in my opinion, I thought it was great, using the camera to translate the atmosphere of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion. I considered this a well-implemented method that can always be improved, just like anything else. I applaud and congratulate Scott, the publisher, the director of photography and the director of photography for taking real risks with this film. Not only did they go far and above his presentation, but they went much further. The use of extremely light and dark colors gave the film a sinister and dirty look that accurately portrays the lives of the crowd, the bounty hunters and the less fortunate, so as to show that their lives is not as fishing or "clean" as everyone else. If you notice that in times of stress or conflict, there were very few camera turns, if any. This shows that Scott and his team were trying to achieve something with this look and were not doing it just for the devil. I realize that most people who watched this movie did not expect it and that many of them were referred to this movie, but I think it was great that Scott took this approach. Hollywood movies have become predictable and bland. Most of them are shot in the same way with the same twists. And I'm glad Scott tried to do something different. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is not for everyone, but to say that it is screwed and that it has nothing to offer is the essential. I really enjoyed this movie and I'm happy to have spent money on it. I would recommend this to everyone, but I'm sure it will only affect one of them. I have to agree with a previous poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the "MTV sphere" will not appreciate this movie, but I think a lot of people will like it. We should all try to enjoy it because Scott and co. took risks and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. And with that in mind, I think he has been enormously successful.
