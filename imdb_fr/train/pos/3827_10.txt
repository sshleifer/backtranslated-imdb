I have no idea what the other critic is talking about - it was a wonderful film and gave an idea of ​​the time that looks like a trip back in time. The characters are really young, Mary is a good partner for Byron, Claire is juvenile and a little annoying, Polidori is a sycophant shot convincing ... all are beautiful, curious and decadent ... not the scary wrecks they are in Gothic. <br /> <br /> The Gothic is an independent piece of shock movie, and I loved it for different reasons, but it works like a movie Merchant and Ivory, and it was from my readings the best capture of this that summer must have felt like. Romantic, certainly, but completely revives my interest in the life of Shelley and Byron every time I think of the film. One of my favorites of all time.
