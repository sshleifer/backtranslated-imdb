This film is beautiful. It has always been always. I really mean the best of a housekeeper who falls in love. Walt really did it here. And the music! A dream is a wish that your heart makes is beautiful! What else can you say that awesome! I can not wait for the special edition to be published, it will be so great! I can not wait to hear all the songs deleted! This movie is so beautiful and smart! It is adorable. What about cute mice too! I know that I keep repeating the same things again and again but hey, it's a great movie! Woods was great in this beautiful beautiful movie
