When I was 17, my high school staged Bye Bye Birdie - which is not a big surprise, because it's perfect for high school and is considered the most staged music in the world. . <br /> <br /> I was a student music and kept strong memories of the production and its songs, as well as a persistent disregard for the Dick Van Dyke movie version that (deliberately) obscured the references to Elvis and had it encamped in front of an oscillating audience in the 60's. <br /> <br /> So when the 1995 version starring Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen, I was pleased with what I saw. Alexander achieves an outstanding performance as Albert, a performance that contrasts sharply with his best-known character from a certain television series. Other members of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips may be the only one not to look at her, supposed to be a naive and innocent schoolgirl). <br /> <br /> But best of all, the musical the familiar numbers of the show are all preserved in this film and interpreted as theatrical songs, which should (taking into account the absence of scene) . <br /> <br /> So, if you know the musical (and little), then watch this movie. The scene shows justice in a way that probably can not be improved, which is enough for me. What better than to make the work of a writer faithfully, with colors and style?
