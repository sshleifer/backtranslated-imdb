Ranked E <br /> <br /> I have never owned a Nintendo 64, but I have played it many times. In my opinion, with Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64. I have played this game many times and it's good every time. If you have an N64 and do not have this game, you should try to find it. The original games of Super Mario Bros. were side-scrolling video games, but Super Mario 64 a Mario 3D game in a nice 3D environment. The game is a bit weird, but you can do a lot of things in the game. Play as Super Mario and once again you have to rescue Princess and the 120 powerful stars of Bowzer.Now you Super Mario 64 is a game N64 very funny and very good, and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
