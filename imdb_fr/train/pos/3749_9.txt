I laughed a lot while watching this. It's a fun short film with a fun musical and a lot of craziness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the stylization of humor. The dialogue is funny and often unexpected and, from the first to the last line, everything seems to flow perfectly. There is Max, who has apparently led a horrible life. And there's Edward, who does not know what life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's crazy boss. Tom has a short but memorable role. Highly recommended for those who love silly humor. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all of Jason's cartoons and I can not wait to see what he's doing with it.
