I watched this movie on Sundance on cable one late afternoon. You could say that "Who Loves the Sun" is the perfect hobby of a story, why not. You can go out with the trio: Lukas Haas is Will (who comes back after suddenly leaving everyone years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we learn that she is really part of the Bloom family), and Adam Scott is Daniel (is he friend or foe or fianc√©), by picturesque Lake Falcon, Manitoba, Canada, captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in bright summer colors against the sun and shadows. Two other family members are part of the revealing mix: Wendy Crewson, mom Mary Bloom, and R.H. Thomson, dad Arthur Bloom. Screenwriter-director Matt Bissonnette has delivered an ingenious development of history and its various sprawling links - do not worry, Haas may have an "apathetic" face, but humor will come when Parker and Scott enter the circle of friends together, smiles ironic Break and know delights stir. The dialogues can be concise, or even nil, but we would have the flavor of what is cooking, be it perplexity or curiosity. <br /> <br /> Yes, "Who loves the sun" can very well be classified in the category of gemstones. The chemistry between the five principles guarantees gels and "combustes", giving an energetic overall performance. After all, everything is in the family and the movie does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> It looks like the official website is still available on "wholovesthesun.com" and information is on Mac McCaughan's soundtrack (Portastatic with guitar tunes and strings) where excerpts scores are played and production notes behind the scenes, interview of director-director-director Bissonnette about the origins of the film and the concept, casting, etc. Always enjoyed Molly Parker since her horrifying and hypnotizing performance in 1996 in Lynne Stopkewich's "Kissed", and she is married to Bissonnette, who "wrote the role of Maggie for Molly".
