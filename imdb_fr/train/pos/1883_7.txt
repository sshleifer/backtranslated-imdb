Excellent comedy starring Dudley Moore, supported by Liza Minnelli and John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man belonging to a multimillionaire family, who was about to get $ 750 million, provided he married a woman (Susan) belonging to another multimillionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but he finally refused when he met the kind and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was a parasite because he did not work, he only enjoyed drinking and having fun with prostitutes. After several serious reflections in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan just a few minutes before their wedding. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur, although he knows that his life will change in the years to come. This comedy is a good life lesson for everyone. Rich people are generally not happy with their lifestyles.
