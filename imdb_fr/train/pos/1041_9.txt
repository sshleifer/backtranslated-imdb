Watch On the Rhine began as a play by Lillian Hellman on Broadway, who saw it and opened it on Broadway, at a time when the Soviet Union was still tied to Nazi Germany by the infamous non-aggression pact signed in August 1939. for the fact that Hellman simply echoed the line of the Communist Party, the line changed only a few months later. Lillian was actually months ahead of her work with this work. <br /> <br /> Watch On The Rhine was presented from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances. Five players came from Broadway to replicate their roles the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson in the family matriarch and especially the villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas. <br /> <br /> Lukas completed a hat trick in 1943, winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had existed, he would have won too. The Oscar is even more remarkable when one thinks of whom he fought, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in Pour qui sonle l'glas, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Each of his competitors had a bigger box office name than him. The appointment of Lukas is usually the one the Academy gives to complete a field. <br /> <br /> Jack Warner knew why Mady Christians did not repeat his role on Broadway and Bette Davis gave Lukas' wife a role. Davis played the role not because it was a particularly remarkable role for her, but because she believed in the image and just wanted to be associated with it. That's the same reason she played The Man Who Came To Dinner, a game much lighter than this one. <br /> <br /> Davis is the daughter of a late US Supreme Court justice who married a German national at the time of Weimar. . After being vagrant for many years on the European continent, Davis Lukas and their three children travel to America, a country that has not yet entered the European war. They are welcomed by Lucile Watson who is naturally delighted to finally meet her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> The fly in this ointment is another of the guests of the house, a friend of Davis from the past, Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also a Romanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris, originally from 'Europe. Coulouris is a wasteful and a spendthrift and he feels an opportunity to play a double job when he suspects Lukas' anti-fascist past. <br /> <br /> His suspicions are quite justified, that's why the family was the vagrants she became. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family supports him loyally in all the decisions he makes. These decisions affect all other members of the distribution. <br /> <br /> Dashiell Hammett, Lillian Hellman's other major actor, added a lot to the Broadway play. Coulouris' colors at the German embassy were a Hammett creation with characters as disgusting as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever created to display as a Runmanian account without an account. He was a metaphor for his own country that had embraced the Nazis with enthusiasm and had also repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Lucile Watson was nominated for the best actress in a supporting role in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou for whom the bell toll. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for the best-adapted screenplay and the film itself was declared best film by this other anti-fascist film, Casablanca. <br /> <br /> Although it is an element firmly anchored in these specific moments, Watch On The Rhine retains a strong anti-fascist message that deserves to be repeated indefinitely.
