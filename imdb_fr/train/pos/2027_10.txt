What can be said about the convincing performance of Tara Fitzgerald? She is quite credible as a hurt, hardened, hardworking, hardworking, and yet passionate Graham, without losing the passionate attention of Mr. Markham. Toby Stephens is a master of his character through all the mischievous looks and all the whiffs of anger, every lightening of discernment in his eyes and the expression of his face. He is the force of passion and hope that will restore Helen's hurt spirit. Graves' Huntingdon is a perfect representation of the irreformable thief. Yet despite all that he has done, his refusal to play the hypocrite in the end is undeniable. he is at least aware of his own failures and the way in which they brought his ruin. Helen's attempt to save her soul - after leaving her and taking their child at a time when it was unheard - is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the value of all life and all human soul, however mistaken it may be, it may be guilty. Markham's constancy can then be regarded as the reward of his faith and inflexible moral character. Although the moral ideas so strongly presented in Tenant seem out of step with today's standards, the narrative is full of integrity, passion and conviction that always have an impact. Tenant is much more believable than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is an adaptation that makes the new justice. I highly recommend watching it!
