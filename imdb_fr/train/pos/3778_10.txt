The first film had little ambition, so nothing sticks to the screen. It was a bad version of 'Back to the Future' without charm. Once accepted that Bill and Ted are naive, the joke can only be hammered in front of the public so long before it breaks. <br /> <br /> It's a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> According to current standards, it's more fun. This was avoided during publication, sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time. We have the photographer of 'Face / Off', the editor of 'Fugitive', a designer of Burton's early production, and the sound designer of 'Matrix'. <br /> <br /> The screenwriters have made up for their superficial first outing with something deep. As this was rejected by the fanbase and the audience, the director probably decided that the style was too extreme. It's not, it's the material. Like "Death Becomes" and "Catch-22", it dares to be clever, but we like our "simple" movies, so we do not buy them. Probably since it dared to be different, that's why it took 12 producers to succeed. What is so good? <br /> <br /> - A beautiful reference to Keanu; from airhead to Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> --Joss hates his creations as much as his counterparts, he creates his own hate. Evil B & T and "good usses" have the same vocabulary as their originals: reduced copies and depreciation of the language. <br /> <br /> --The "duality" motif. Nowhere is this more evident than in photography styles, many high and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith's "Total Recall" to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - The "choice" motif. I do not know where it started in the genre (maybe "Ghostbusters"), but it's pretty well used here. That boils down even to the 7 games against death - Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> - Filming the reference to oneself, even in the game against Death (Clue). It's smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Notice the cover of the magazine Premier at the end: "Bill and Ted: the film". Ironic also that Death and Nomolos were villains in the 'Die Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon' suites. <br /> <br /> I have some small nits left, but nothing compared to the original. Music and film are different media, so it is incomprehensible that many texts revolve around the first, especially in the teen market. Carlin is an excellent comedian, but in these movies he is wasted. Also, despite all the daring efforts that this effort shows, even making gay jokes, they can not kill a cat? <br /> <br /> So, even if it looks like a Nickelodeon production, it's incredibly interesting. From this movie we have Beavis and Butt-Head. "We are in heaven and we have just assaulted three people." <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Mid-range material
