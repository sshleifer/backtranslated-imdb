Released in December 1957, Sayonara earned 8 Oscar nominations and won 4 victories. Red Buttons won Best Supporting Actor Joe Kelly, who fell in love with a Japanese woman while he was in Kobe during the Korean War. Oscar nominated for Best Leading Actor, Marlon Brando plays Major Lloyd Gruver, a Korean War ace transferred to Japan, who strongly supports the military's opposition to the marriage between US troops and Japanese women and unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade his friend Joe Kelly to get married. Ironically, the character of Marlon Brandos soon finds the love of him in a woman of Japanese origin. This film highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of that time. Filmed in beautiful colors and with stunning backgrounds, this film deserves to be watched only by these effects. Good movie, give me more ... GimmeClassics
