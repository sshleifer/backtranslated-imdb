I really liked this movie, it was good and the actors were great! Leon Robinson, who played Richard, and many other classical singers, is very good at his work, when you see him in a musical movie, you know it's going to be good! I would suggest that people watch this heartwarming, sad and special film, if they want to know more about Richard! Exceptional! Fresh!
