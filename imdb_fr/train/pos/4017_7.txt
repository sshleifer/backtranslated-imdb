This is a very memorable spaghetti western. He has a beautiful story, interesting characters and very good actors, especially Rosalba Neri. His role of wicked villain in this movie is really classic. She steals every scene she's in and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not talking. His performance is very credible. She manages to be quite hypnotic without being exaggerated (not that there is anything wrong with being exaggerated). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. <br /> <br /> The score is excellent, and the theme is the one that will stay in your head for days after seeing the movie, whether you like it or not. There are some very fun things. I particularly like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot. There are also many shooting games that are smooth and very well done. <br /> <br /> I probably would have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if there were not two things. The first is a silly bar room brawl that lasts about 25 minutes after the movie starts. This is one of the most ridiculous fights I have ever seen in a movie. It is very badly choreographed and looks more like a dance number of a bad musical than a real fight. Maybe we could forget that if it was a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy, but it's a more serious western, and the fight really had to be more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this film is Yuma's Mexican sidekick. I guess he was supposed to be comical, or something, but the character was just stupid and useless in a movie like this, and he was not at all funny. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /> <br /> All that being said, I want to assure all those who read that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western, despite the mistakes I mentioned, and that all fans of the genre need to see this movie.
