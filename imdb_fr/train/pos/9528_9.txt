Frankly, this film has gone beyond the heads of most critics. <br /> <br /> The reverse of perdition (to be lost) is salvation (to be saved) and this film is one of the few to deal with those with two concepts. The film also explores the love and disappointments that accompany the father-son relationship. It should be noted from the outset that none of these themes are currently in fashion. <br /> <br /> The assumption is that fathers on the move, hit-man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his judicial police chief, John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their sons and will do their best to protect them. But Rooney's son, Connor, is even more perverse than the others. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to hide his own flights from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son, Michael, has witnessed it, he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence the witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides he wants revenge at all costs, even at very high altitudes. price of perdition. Rooney, who in a scene curses the day Connor was born, refuses to give his son Connor to Sullivan and hires a contract killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. Rooney joins his son Connor on the road to perdition. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film, accompanied by his surviving son, the young Michael, Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney on the road to perdition and Maguire sues Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a basement of the church and asks him to abandon Connor because Connor murdered his family, Rooney says, "Michael, there are only murderers in this room, .., and there is only one guarantee, none of us will see Paradise. " At the end of the film, in a predictable way, a character is saved and a character repents. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but he comes out of the character to play convincingly the hit killer Sullivan, giving a subtle and laconic performance. Newman does well as an old Rooney Irish gangster, showing a hard face, hard features, eyes haunted by Connor's misdeeds. Jude Law plays Maguire in a rather frightening way. Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael naturally and without affectation. <br /> <br /> Cinematography constantly plays on the light of darkness, echoing the themes of salvation and perdition. The camera has tapped into a palette of greens and grays. Gray belonged to the fathers and urban landscapes of the Depression era, Illinois. The greens belonged to the youngest sons and rural plains of this state. The lush, loud and haunting music of Thomas Newman had a weak Irish connotation and was played in Copland arrangements. The sets were authentic urban cities in the center-west: factories, churches. The houses shone with sparkling woodwork. <br /> <br /> The excellence of the film lies in the generation of a unique feeling composed of deep themes, a distinctive stage play, an enveloping music and cinematograph. The only negative was a slight anti-gun message slipped into the y scenario, the only sign of the film to be politically correct. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a10 out of 10; with time, it will be recognized as a great movie.
