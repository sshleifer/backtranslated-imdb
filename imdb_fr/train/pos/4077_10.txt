I saw it for the first time in the early 90s on British television. I liked it at the time, but I missed the opportunity to record. Many years have passed, but the film has always stuck me and I lost hope to see it again, the main thing. the part of the castle hole that really touched me, it's easy to watch, has a nice story, good music, the list goes on and on, that's ok, I say how much it's is good but everyone goes The best moments with them once they have seen, yes the animation is top and beautiful to watch, it shows its age in very few games but it is now part of the beauty, I'm so happy that it was released on DVD because it's one of my top 10 movies of all time. Buy it or rent it, it's better to watch the evening alone with drink and food at hand so you do not have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
