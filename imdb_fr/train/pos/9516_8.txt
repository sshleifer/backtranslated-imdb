Tom Hanks like you've never seen before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death". He is a jack of all trades for his substitute father, John Rooney (Paul Newman), a former head of the Irish Mafia. Sullivan's young son (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses his father's life and both are on the road for seven weeks robbing the banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and son. Enter Jude Law as a journalist / photographer ready to kill Sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of dead gangster photos. Filmed admirably capturing the drama of life in the '30s. Sometimes the pace slows down, but a burst of graphic violence sustains the story. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and bringing together a secret man and his young son. Other notable members of the cast are Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks is again excellent in a memorable movie. Make room for some Oscars!
