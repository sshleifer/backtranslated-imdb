I rented this film for the first time many years ago and I was completely captivated by it. Recently, feeling the strange need to see some of the very rare films I've enjoyed so much in my life, I decided to give "Erendira" another look. And I'm glad I did, because I quickly discovered that even the passing of time has not tarnished the film's brilliance at all. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a teenager (Erendira, played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in some ways, she looks like Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burned down the manor of her grandmother -mother, after which the grandmother, unconditionally hypnotized by Irene Papas, forced the girl to prostitute herself on the path of repayment of damages. <br /> <br /> The viewing is both fascinating and compelling - although, despite the basic premise, which deals with prostitution, it is devoid of free and tormented sexual content. The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact during their stay - which, by the way, is very difficult in rural Mexico. <Br /> <br /> The film is very atmospheric, enigmatically striking and decidedly dreamlike. It sometimes borders on the strange, but not so much as to make a film of David Lynch, for example. It should also be mentioned that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments of previous viewers below ... <br /> <br /> Often, in the background, you hear the sound of a accordion solitary, silent and melancholic, good musical accents to showcase the Mexican setting. The cinematography of rural places, many of which are in the desert, is rather superb. <br /> <br /> The film is moving at a good pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after each scene, I had the feeling that I had to rewind the tape and re-read it, simply because it makes you want to do it. For me anyway, it's really convincing. <br /> <br /> I hope you will see the film in its Spanish version, with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school and college and was happy to be able to understand a good part of the dialogue. For example: "The world without exception is a great way of thinking". ("The world is not as big as I thought", that is, it's a small world.) <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of somehow falling on an old dusty bottle of vintage wine that, while drinking, immensely satisfying, however, you find yourself with some sadness in realizing that there are no more bottles like this.
