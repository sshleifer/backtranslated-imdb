This impossible story is that of a witch pursuing a mortal man in a mortal world. Her "community" is open among her members, but she hides her sorcery from mortals. Hmmmm ... it's starting to sound familiar. LOL. This is not your typical movie. The very "campy" performances of Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs prevent things from getting bored. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I found his association with James Stewart unusual (but not fatal to the story). <br /> <br /> With a renewed interest in all that is dark and sorcerer, this film deserves to be discovered and rediscovered by the old and the new public ...... IT'S ALWAYS A HOT !
