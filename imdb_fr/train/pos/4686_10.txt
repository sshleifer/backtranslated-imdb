This is by far my favorite movie of all time. This is mainly because he is not afraid to delve into very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submission) that other mainstream movies are simply too shy to be tackled. Nothing seems to be forbidden in this film since the director freely develops the story without worrying about offending the viewer. However, I do not think anything has been done here solely for the purpose of deliberately offending or offending anyone. Sean Young achieves an excellent and courageous performance. Most traditional actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for major changes to the script before accepting it. The other members of the cast also do a good job. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed that this movie does not appear on the pay channels since a brief passage a year after its release in theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just does not fit the current political atmosphere. It seems ironic to me that some premium channels now offer softcore porn (which is getting closer to hardcore), but will not release a mainstream movie like "Love Crimes". Unfortunately, even though this film is only 11 years old, it probably could not be shot today. <br /> <br />
