I feel a bit protective about this movie because it was my introduction to the American verse. The year was 1972, and I.T.V. ran the eight feature films in a single pass (followed by reruns of "The Persuaders" with Tony Curtis and Roger Moore) on Saturday night. 'The Karate Killers' was chosen to open the season. It started with a casual action sequence when Solo and Kuryakin's sports car were attacked by a squadron of THRUSH miners. From that moment, I was a fan of life. <br /> <br /> After the main credits (it's good to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of slowing down the action sequences), we go to Dr. Simon True's lab. (Jim Boles), inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater. True's wife, Amanda (Joan Crawford), had an affair with THRUSH's agent, Randolph (Herbert Lom ). In fact, he kills both the doctor and his wife before looking for the formula. True has prepared for the event. He divided it into five parts, each written on a picture of himself, and sent it to his five daughters, who are all scattered around the world. <br /> <br /> Solo and Kuryakin began by getting the formula in the first place, leading to a series of episodes in different places and cameos of personalities like Telly Savalas (as an Italian count in a tight fist) , Terry-Thomas and Curt Jurgens. One of Dr.True's daughters - Sandy (Kim Darby) - accompanies U.N.C.L.E. boys in their global quest. <br /> <br /> After having assembled the formula, THRUSH arrives and gives them to them, before taking them to their secret base at the North Pole ... <br /> <br /> Of all the UNCLE feature films This is it should have been produced especially for the cinema. It hurts being a TV product, even a bit more expensive than usual. No filming was shot and the different segments appear to be repetitive, usually resulting in a fall between U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH. Joan Crawford is remarkably talented in her small role and Curt Jurgens is misguided like a sugar dad. As a London bobby, Terry-Thomas is always so charming and Herbert Lom is good as the chief villain. Kim Darby calls "Sandy". We should have told him to stay home. <br /> <br /> What is amazing is that the film manages to be more fun and entertaining than many official movie releases of the time, including "In Like Flint", "Casino Royale" and " The Embuscers' I would like to know how Solo and his company escaped THRUSH HQ after Randolph's death though.
