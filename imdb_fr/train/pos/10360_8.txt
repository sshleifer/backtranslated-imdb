This is a docudrama story about the Lindy Chamberlain case and a look at its impact on Australian society. In particular, it addresses the problem of insinuations, gossip and expectations when dealing with real dramas. <br /> <br /> One of the problems in history is the way people are expected to react in the same way to situations. Not everyone enters a wild melodramatic hysteria with every major crisis. This is not a reason for movie and television characters to do this. This is particularly suited to journalists and news editors who seem to be looking for the big scene of sobs that will pull the ratings. This is a problem that needs to be constantly addressed. <br /> <br /> The main characters play the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are ably supported by a broad cast that plays all of them based on facts. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that most of the actors in this story are better known people in Australia as comic actors. This reinforces the idea that comic book actors are among the best supporters in dramas because they know how to create fast impressions of individuals. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal here; in the sense that I am actually a former Adventist who was an active member in Australia at the time this incident occurred; so I have a slightly different impression of the story. I think he is treated with incredible creativity and personality, as well as an emotional heart. I think the best scene is where the couple is hunted by the new helicopters. He brilliantly captured the themes of the story. <br /> <br /> In an interview, I once heard Fred Schepsi say that he asked actors to "play the best possible role for their character". Although this is particularly appropriate for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should apply to all actors.
