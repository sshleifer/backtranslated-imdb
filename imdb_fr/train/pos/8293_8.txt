As a 90-minute experience, she is not up to "Drive" because the actors have clearly learned their craft at "Who Am I?" academy, while the action sequences are usually not better than those of the superb Mark Dacascos beat 'em-up. However, those who liked "Drive" (and I thought it was wonderful!) Will probably appreciate that too. You will certainly not come back at the beginning and will not look at it anymore, but you will surely come back to some action scenes for a long time. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to see that the quality combat choreography is still practiced, even in Hong Kong, and I'd like to see what these guys could do with the budgets, the time and the respect accorded to the likes of Yuen Woo-ping and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you sit for the first half hour and the awful dialogue does not make you crazy, then you will enjoy. Bosch is beautiful and can really move with beautiful acrobatics, kicks and simple acts of bravery. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to be within 500 km of a copy, then find it and watch it. It's not Shakespeare. In fact, it is less clear than Coolio in "China Strike Force", but you will be impressed by both the movements displayed and the pain felt by the stunt team - (I'm pretty sure it will not there is no sure way to land the head directly, or be forced to head a wooden roof by a car at high speed !?). <br /> <br />
