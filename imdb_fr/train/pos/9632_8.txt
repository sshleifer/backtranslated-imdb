The idea of ​​giving Laurel & Hardy the role of chimney sweep is surprisingly hilarious. This ensures fun situations and stupid antics, from Stan Laurel of course, as usual. <br /> <br /> The film also has a secondary plot with a silly teacher who works on a rejuvenation formula. This does not really sound like a logical mix of stories and incoherence, but the two intrigues fit perfectly into the memorable ending. It's still a little odd but it's still funny, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> The secondary distribution of the film is surprisingly good. Sam Adams is good as a stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield will delightfully exaggerate as a silly teacher. <br /> <br /> The film is packed with great timed and hilarious built-up sequences, all of which are pretty predictable, but hilarious to watch, however, because of the way they are all executed. This helps make "Dirty Work" one of the best Laurel & Hardy shorts. <br /> <br /> 8/10
