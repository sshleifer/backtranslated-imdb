I watched this movie by chance, become curious by the trailer on TV. I like when I discover movies like this one, small tender stories about ordinary people. Even though the ending is tragic, "The Man of the Moon" has fun moments, especially in Dani's first characterization, with his innocent and pure love story with Court. It's really a beautiful and touching love story with 3 highlights: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, who has kept his promises in the world of cinema, the beautiful cinematography of "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and the fantastic score of James Newton Howard, is really the soul of the movie. Her themes (which deserved an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have turned the screenplay into music.
