This film looks like a movie project. As if the filmmakers had selected a representative group of the inexperienced society and got to work. The characters are a bit uninvolved and naive. Despite this amateur feeling, the film is effective. It's like a sample of life where neighborhood kids are trying to achieve or maintain their honest sexual feelings.

What is probably the most enjoyable is the way the main character has grown up a bit in his romantic relationship, realizing a greater depth of sexual feelings. A good watch but nothing moves ....
