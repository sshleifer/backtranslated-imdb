Very often, a group will meet for a re-union concert only to find that it is simply impossible to bring it together. Not so here. This concert is just a burst of shear from start to finish. These three musicians obviously came together in advance and planned and planned what was needed to make sure it was not just a nostalgic party to satisfy someone's ego. It's obvious from the beginning, even before they go on stage. Many faces in the crowd were not even born when these guys played for the first time. From the first song, they capture this old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no fuss. Clapton, by his own admission, said he had to stretch for this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers, etc. so that we can see it at its best. Ginger Baker shows why so many drummers talk about him as a kind of battery guru. Jack Bruce is just great. They really managed to create a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years. This one is a 10 for me.
