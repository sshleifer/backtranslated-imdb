I was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work, honestly. Some people were looking for a plot ??? OK, when this video was released over ten years ago, I watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. It has no plot, nor a central scenario. It is a rather artistic anthology composed mainly of long videos, all intelligently or creatively. Michael Jackson can be considered a monster nowadays, but, after all, it's the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many to be the greatest video clip of all time) and defined the trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took up his music and dances to create highly entertaining works, incorporating clay music, special effects, and performance sequences. direct and even autodic parody (the sequence "Badder"). And for those who wonder what Joe Pesci was doing there, this video came out a bit before becoming a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on the film. And, in my humble opinion, I think Smooth Criminal (the choreographed section) beats everything Michael Jackson has done so far!
