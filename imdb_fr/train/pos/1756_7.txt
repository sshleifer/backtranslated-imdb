'' The Virgin of 40 '' 'made me laugh a lot. I do not care if it's considered a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed a lot of jokes and scenes in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as a virgin nerdy Andy Stitzer and I think of the scene where Andy gets the wax bristles, one of the coolest, especially because it's real. A large number of actors and actresses present in this film are also known or already famous. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. It is a bit strange and collects a lot of toys, but seems harmless. One day, while playing poker with his friends at work, they discover that Andy is actually ... a virgin! And he is already 40 years old! After this amazing revelation, all his friends are trying to make Andy sleep with a woman ... the problem is the confusion in which Andy interferes, especially now that he really begins to love Trish, a woman he met while she was buying a DVD player in the store where he works.
