I saw this film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005 and, of the 14 films I watched, I would say this is my movie No. 3. Initially, I had the interest of see this being of Swedish origin myself, with many of my ancestors from the Norrland region of Sweden, where it was filmed. I also grew up in a rural area of ​​the northern US, where many small towns looked a lot like the movie. It is nice to see more movies using rural scenery like Så som ihmmelen. It was a very good film and I'm sure it's a very difficult film to bring closer to the mass market, but the director Kay Pollock really succeeded after an absence of more than two decades of the staging. Helen Sjoholm in her film debut as an actress has been fantastic and I would look forward to seeing her bigger on a big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist at the head of this well-rounded cast. I highly recommend this film and give it a score of 9.0 on a scale of 10.
