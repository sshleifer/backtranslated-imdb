"Hate of the minute" is a film of haunting beauty. A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare of the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a must for any film student or horror lover. The reality of the story and the human side of Eric separate this film from other psycho-killer films. Some thanks to the producer of the film, Bruce Campbell, as well as the movie "The Evil Dead" add humor to those who know the genre.
