Spanish films are in a golden age, if not gold. Pi√©dras is another example of a film that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although the feelings are strong or almost at the level of life or death, they are still not really melodramatic. It could happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories here, which become connected. One is about the retarded girl, who does not dare to go to the next block. One is about the middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetishist. Another concerns the girl struggling with drug problems and her lover leaves her. Yet another concerns the madam of a brothel who finds (almost) true love. <br /> <br /> Must see. It is in Spain that filmmakers take women seriously.
