I loved the good time with the rest of you. I love to read INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL comments. The writers on this show were fantastic and the actors were beyond TALENTED. To respond to Strawberry22 (the sharpest comment on the other positive and superior comment) ... What happened is that James was killed in an accident (I think I remember it was a trucking accident or car accident) and that was the saddest episode (when it was first aired and I was just a little thing ... it was so sad for me. Florida and the children are withdrawing from their projects and even becoming neighbors with Willona (Wilnona) and that is how the last show ended. <br /> <br /> ALL children have realized their dreams and have found a chance in each of their dreams. It was a wonderful ending and I cried because I was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that I really believed in their destiny. I hope this kind of ending sounds true to many. <br /> <br /> A great show and many other great shows followed, including Benson and The Jeffersons. It was a fantastic time for African-American television and the best writers were great at that time. TV LAND is great for memories and I just love it because I can not stand the junk we are watching today. SOMEONE ... quickly find the 1970s and 1980s ... your smart viewers are an endangered species and we need better materials. <br /> <br /> Love, an original TV LAND sitcom junkie from the 70s and 80s (as they sing in "ALL in the Family" ... it was the days ......
