"A really nice story with a moral about brotherly love" describes this strange film by David Lynch. It was particularly "strange" because it was not the kind of movie Lynch had produced in the last 15 to 20 years. They were dark and shocking movies (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and the opposite. I know that has disappointed a lot of his fans. Others were delighted. Count me as one of these and I also own these three "dark" movies. <br /> <br /> This is another supposedly true story of life, detailing here the journey of an elderly man in a lawnmower seated from Iowa west to Wisconsin to see his sick brother with whom he has not spoken for years but wants to see before his death. Well, I guess that principle - an old man driving a 400-kilometer lawnmower - still makes it a "strange" movie, so Lynch stays in the character! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays the lead role. He is the type of guy, in the face, the voice, the discreet character that everyone loves. The wrinkles on his face tell a lot of stories. It was really sad to hear what happened to him in real life one year after the release of this movie. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this movie do not have much to offer, and are not always pleasant to watch. The character's child, adult and mentally handicapped (Sissy Spacek), and his tragic past, but once Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his journey, the story begins again. I played this for several friends and they thought that the film had never been taken back, but I am more generous with this film. I think it's a hidden gem. For them, it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I found her trip quite fascinating, but you have to know in advance that this is NOT going to be a crime story with Lynch. It's slow and if you feel like it, you might like this. The charm comes into play in some of the people Alvin encounters along the way, such as a runaway girl who runs away and friendly locals who help the old man out when he gets in trouble. (Henry Cada in the role of "Daniel Riordan, is remarkable in this regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets the third bill, but it's a joke: it's only in the last minutes of the movie! <br /> < Iowa's landscape It's nice, I've lived here for a few years and I can testify to the hills and the rich soil.It's a beautiful state with nice people .... like this movie.
