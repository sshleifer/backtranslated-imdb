It's a VERY entertaining film. Some of the reviews I read on this forum were written by people who apparently think the film was a dramatic effort. THIS IS NOT DONE THAT. This is an extremely enjoyable film, played with a tongue in your cheeks. All actors obviously have fun while entertaining us. The fight sequences are lively, lively and above all not free. The so-called "Green Death", used a few times, is not, as I read in a review, "horrible". Some critics have been very critical about the fight between Doc and Seas for the martial arts towards the end of the film. Hey, lighten up ... Again, I remind everyone that this is a fun movie. Each phase of this "fight" was subtitled, which added to the fun aspect. The actors were not trying to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of those martial arts movies. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another interesting touch is the unique way in which the ultimate fate of the "villain" (Seas) is dealt with. I promise you that if you do not try to take this movie very seriously and watch it only for entertainment, you'll spend 100 minutes in the most enjoyable way.
