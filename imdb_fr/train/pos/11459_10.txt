At one level, this film can bring out the child in us who only wants to build sandcastles and toss things just to see him fall again. At a deeper level, however, he explores a deep desire to reconnect with the earth. I felt great empathy for the artist when he said, "When I'm not alone for a while, I do not feel racy." . I know his work mainly from his coffee table books and some art gallery installations. But seeing his work in motion, perfectly captured through the lens of Riedelsheimer, was a revelation. Not frozen in time, Goldsworthy's creations come alive, swirl, fly, dissolve, crumble, crush. <br /> <br /> And that's what he's talking about: Time. The process of creation and destruction. Emergence and disappearance. To come out of emptiness and become the universe, and return. He has a shamanic quality at home, on the edge of madness. You have the feeling, looking at him at work, that his art is a life force for him, that if he did not do it, he would go where he would perish. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the medium of photography. Otherwise, with the exception of a few cairns and walls, they would only exist for one person.
