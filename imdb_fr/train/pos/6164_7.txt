Are we really doing "bad videos"? In the form of a widescreen digital remake of 8MM widescreen, it's a whole ride. Unfortunately, there is a bit too much history and this sometimes becomes a travelogue while our heroine searches the most devious places in Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am rather rude to "depraved" scenes, including all kinds of things, hot wax, lashes and brutal sex drowning, beheading, etc. These scenes are immaculate and it is a shame that Bruno and his budget can not stretch to ensure that all the many creatures of character introduced become more than just caricatures.
