I have often wondered how CASPER was intended for children ... considering all the problems related to his identity (in this film, we are led to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, because his house is a cemetery plot), as well as the disturbing message of this film. Perhaps Casper was more considered a moral game, or Famous Studios felt like a pioneer in "reality" cartoons. <br /> <br /> THE GO'S BOOD TONIGHT is a lively project - without a doubt. But the development of the plot involving the fox (who becomes Casper's friend but meets a tragic end) is a concern. <br /> <br /> Give a credit to Famous Studios - they tackle death with respect ... but The image of Casper's grief is rather graphic and disturbing for the children (although the outcome offers a happy end, but I will not give the end), and the violence is rather steep, even for the 1940 standards. <br /> <br /> It may be a good cartoon to use to help parents to explain death to children - but I would not put it in the VCR for a cartoon break.
