FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry into the genre nunsploit - equal parts, feminist journey and "story" as we follow Flavia in her strange journey. <br /> <br /> We leave with Flavia in a convent .. She is not too happy because she does not believe in all the "rules" and machismo of the world around her and escapes from the convent with his Jewish friend Abraham. They are both finally caught and Flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another "unbelieving" nun to speed up a Muslim invasion. Flavia hangs out with the Muslims who take the convent and are "busy" with the nuns in a strange series of scenes. Finally, the Muslims throw themselves and Flavia is punished as a traitor to Christianity in another singularly brutal scene ... <br /> <br /> It contains pretty much everything I like to see in a movie. Exploitation of the 70s - a little gore, including a nipple removal, and a beautiful leg stripping scene, some decent nudity - including the required mat, as well as a decent scenario. I will say that it was somehow dragged into some points, but not enough to get really fed up. I would definitely recommend this one to fans of Nunsploit / 70's ... 8/10
