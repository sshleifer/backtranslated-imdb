Dog Days is one of the most accurate movies I have ever seen describing life in modern cities. It is very hard and cruel at times and unfortunately it is very close to reality. Isolation, despair, deep emotional impasses, problems, perversion, complexes, madness. All the things that are present in today's big advanced cities. Once again we realize the state of pity in which people have governed society. <br /> <br /> The negative side of city life has never been so well represented on screen. I only wish it to be a lie. Unfortunately, it is not. So ... 10/10.
