New York supermodel Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents a room in an old brownstone where she meets some odd neighbors and experiences frightening hallucinations. While the lawyer's boyfriend Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) investigates herself, she strives to maintain her mental health (not to mention her willingness to live) because her experiences are detrimental to her physical, mental health and emotional. <BR /> <br /> I do not want to spoil the best moments of this psychological horror movie for those who do not know it. The story is interesting and fun, but the film does not offer much in terms of real fear. Or, by the way, any atmosphere. It's kind of quietly sinister, but it's not like the traditional horror movie. It's more of a story about a struggling woman's attempts to deal with the growing unreality in her life. At this level, it works, but it is not powerful enough. <br /> <br /> What "The Sentinel" * offers *, you'll find catchy sets (especially the fascinating, the fabulously scary climax, and there's a scene with Beverly D'Angelo that has to be see to be believed). There is also gore to see, but not much. A sinister partition of Gil Melle adds to the threat. <br /> <br /> No criticism of this film would be complete without an evaluation made by the filmmakers who gathered actors as excellent for its actors. Some can not do too much, but seeing them all together is impressive. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make the biggest impressions as an uncompromising detective and caring neighbor. Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner are other legendary names. Future stars such as D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger and Jeff Goldblum make brief appearances, and other familiar faces include Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. Whoever directed the cast of this film deserves a prize. <br /> <br /> Written for the screen by director Michael Winner, probably best known for the "Death Wish" series with Charles Bronson, from Jeffrey Konvitz's novel. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this a true horror thriller, but it has its moments and is reasonably entertaining. <br /> 7/10
