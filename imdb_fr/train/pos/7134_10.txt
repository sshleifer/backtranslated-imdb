John Thaw is an excellent actor. I must admit that I was impressed by his rank in the role of an old crusty curmuffin who grudgingly accepts a person evacuated from the streets of London (World War II era). <br /> <br /> That said, the film is also excellent. A very moving story with a satisfying end. Some characters are a little underdeveloped (the teacher in particular), but none of them is essential to the plot. Basically, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the movie does not need anything else.
