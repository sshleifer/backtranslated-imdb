Kurosawa weaves a story with a host of characters as diverse as any Shakespearian drama, and the acting is true to the story, with each star playing a role in a larger narrative. It's touching, fun and intriguing in all areas. The development of the character is almost perfect, the cinematography is alive and attractive, and the story draws you. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the "samurai monsters" and those who are obsessed with the dynasties of the late 18th and the 19th century The tales of Japan could forget this film as the best work of Kurosawa . Maybe not his best, but even worse, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is so based on the elevation of the mundane life of ordinary people at a time of great change, that it is timeless, although it is in the not-so-distant past. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. to all moviegoers, especially those who are likely to continue reading the novel on which the film is based.
