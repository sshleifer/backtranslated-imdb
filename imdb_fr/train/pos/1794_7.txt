Halfway through Lajos Koltai's "Evening", a woman on her deathbed asks a character in her hallucination: "Can you tell me where my life went?" The replica could be embarrassing theatrical, but the woman who speaks it is Vanessa Redgrave, who presents it with extreme simplicity, and the question tears your heart. <br /> <br /> Time and time again, the film based on Susan Minot's romantic skirts sentimentality and banality, it holds the attention, offers admirable performances and engenders an emotional implication like few recent movies l 'did. Only six months after the end of the year, there are now two memorable, meaningful, and useful films in theaters, the other being, of course, Sara Polley's film "Away From Her". Hollywood may have turned "Evening" into an elegant celebrity vehicle with her two real-life couples of mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, as well as Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is the daughter of Redgrave in the film (with a sister played by Tony Collette), and Gummer plays the young Streep character, while Redgrave's young incarnation is Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson and a big cast - yes, it could have become a multi-star platform. Instead, Koltai - the brilliant director of Hungarian photography of "Mephisto" and director of "Fateless" - has created a subtle overall work at the "Continental sensation", the story taking place in a social environment of Newport in the days preceding a marriage fraught with pitfalls. <br /> <br /> The missed connections, the bad choices and the scrupulous respect of the social and family pressures constitute a real soap opera, but the quality of the writing, the direction of Koltai and its altruistic increase "Evening" well above this level, in the rarefied air of English, French (and some American) family sagas dating from the previous century, its contemporary setting. <br /> <br /> Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle, meet clearly, understandably, captivating. Individual melodies are woven into a symphony. <br /> <br /> And yet, with all the previous emphasis on ensemble and selfless representations, the stars of "Evening" still shine, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (a new discovery, vaguely resembling his mother, but to a very different actress), the Danes carry most of the load - until Streep appears in the last moments and, of course, steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are well worth the price of entry. <br /> <br /> As with "Far from it", the "evening" stays with you for a long time, inviting you to rethink its history and characters, and experience the emotions it raises. At two o'clock, the film is a little long, but the way it stays with you afterwards is welcome among the many movies that cool well before your popcorn.
