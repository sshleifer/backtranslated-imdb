DO NOT judge this production with the 2-hour version that was released on VHS in the US, which is a messy and incomprehensible mess. I had the pleasure of watching the full 6-hour version available on DVD from the UK. The deliberate rhythm and the growing sense of threat are fascinating, as is the astonishing visual and auditory landscape; It is an ancient Rome that we have never seen before, and much more authentic than most others. <br /> <br /> Director Franco Rossi was rightly celebrated for his 1968 Odyssey mini-series, and this mini-series is just as powerful. Just as Bekim Fehmiu has become the best Ulysses on the screen, Klaus Maria Brandauer is perhaps the best Nero on the screen. Now, I hope to see one day Rossi's version of The Aeneid (Eneide), which was broadcast on Italian television in 1971. <br /> <br /> I do not know which version of QUO VADIS is the most powerful, this one or the Polish mini-series of 2001; each has different virtues, and in many ways they complement each other. Certainly, one or the other dominates the camp-Hollywood riot starring Peter Ustinov.
