TCM keeps me awake all the time ... they continue to offer movies I've never heard of ... Senso .... now Ossessione ... a very young Visconti movie !! ... wow ... the Italian version of the postman always sounds twice ... great !! Beautifully played and directed ... Never heard of any of the great chefs who have been excellent, Clara Calamai, as Giovanna, and most importantly, Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone on the screen in 1943 !!! His look was ahead of his time ... many 1950s male stars probably inspired him ... he should have been a major world star !! The film is way better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and less brilliant than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner do you remember that white outfit? who can forget .... This Italian version is different .. more realistic and with a very different end ... see it look at it ... I will buy it !!
