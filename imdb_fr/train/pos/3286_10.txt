In simple terms, this film is terrifying. <br /> <br /> He's just starting to look like a study of a rebellious girl and becomes a horror movie of great beauty. <br /> <br /> Do not expect gores or zombies. It's psychological, and as it would also Candyman, Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that we do not believe. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, you know more about what's going on, and the interconnectedness of the two worlds of this movie. <br /> <br /> The drawings have never been so scary.
