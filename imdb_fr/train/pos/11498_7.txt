"Kolchak: the Night Stalker" is an extremely entertaining television series in which an insidious and sarcastic reporter in his forties is repeatedly involved in a deadly fight with supernatural (and sometimes extraterrestrial) forces. Based on a very popular pair of TV movies featuring the character of Kolchak, this series died quickly in the mid-1970s due to weak ratings, but still retains a strong cult today. But will the average modern viewer be able to dig with Kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead? <br /> <br /> It's actually a difficult question to answer fairly. Critics of this series tend to argue that it is a formula and desperately dated. On the other hand, fans say that it is smartly written, well played and sometimes truly scary. And me? I have one foot in both camps. I had a great time watching Kolchak DVDs on DVD of the 20 episodes recently, although I can clearly see that the series has major flaws. <br /> <br /> I will address the Kolchak issue as a fictional fiction first. Now, I think we can all agree that most TV shows have formulas - just about every episode of Columbo goes on the same pattern, for example. Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; In fact, critics have long recognized that the public often enjoys and actively seeks out repetitive entertainment. However, the problem with Kolchak is that his formula is too TOO rigid - it is too repetitive, even by the most generous standards. <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates a murder and discovers it has been committed. by a form of monster. He tries to publish an article about the monster, but his publisher, Vincenzo, blocks it, still on the grounds that Kolchak does not have enough evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work. And, alas, Kolchak is also obstructed by the police. So, in the end, Kolchak does independent research on the monster, finds a way to kill him ... and then kills him. No ceremony, no reward, no big story writing about it. <br /> <br /> You can see where this formula so strict can become boring, right? I am particularly mystified by Vincenzo - if Kolchak still loves monsters and Vincenzo never believes him ... well, then why does not Vincenzo dismiss Kolchak or commit it? That's what any normal boss would do. But the series avoids such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchak as comic antagonists. As a result, many of their scenes together are deeply incredible - though they are also very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The best episodes of Kolchak manage to overcome the limits of this formula, but usually because they contain a kind of unexpected twist. These selected episodes are good enough that I think they are largely immune to the typical critics of the series. Some of my favorites include: <br /> <br /> Horror in the Heights - an episode that deserves to be messy, inventive and socially conscious. Kolchak's dialogue has an unusually sharp and cynical edge. Although he adheres closely to Kolchak's formula, the script (written by veteran Hammer Studios, Jimmy Sangster) is remarkably literate and plunges into the heart of the monster's backstory. <br /> <br /> The Devil's Platform - an inspiration for Movies "Omen", this episode is striking to me because the villain - a very young Tom Skerritt - tries Kolchak with a satanic contract filled with good things (and so reveals a lot about the journalist's character.) <br /> <br /> Firefall - this episode seems to have a bad reputation among the fans, but I appreciated it because it has an excellent red herring and a really scary monster, with almost unstoppable appearance. <br /> <br /> Although I 'After distinguishing these three episodes, I would say that most stories are amusing to say the least. For my money, there are only two complete turkeys in the series of 20 episodes: Primal Scream, which talks about the ape men who rage in Chicago, and The Sentry, which contains the most stupid makeup in the history of filmed entertainment (and this evaluation comes from a fan of a lifetime, Doctor Who and Godzilla!) <br /> <br /> All in all, here is a good series. A little repetitive, a little cheesy perhaps, but it has elements of grandeur. Even during the weakest episodes, Darren McGavin's superb performance as a caustic Kolchak, tired of the world and infinitely funny really shines. He wears the series effortlessly, in a way that, for example, Sarah Michelle Gellar never managed to "Buffy". McGavin was a great actor and this series is worth watching alone.
