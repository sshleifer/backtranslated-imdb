Japanese cyber-punk movies have never really done much for me, but from the handle I've seen, most have been at least visually interesting and at least mainly entertaining. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a kind of parasites that seize human hosts, take control of their bodies, turn them into "necroborgs" and incite them to fight each other . the sole purpose of eating - apparently as a "game" for the pleasure of the said parasites. The film revolves mainly around a shy guy and a girl who clash, but whose love influence is interrupted by infection parasites and are forced to fight. It becomes a test of human will against the control of the parasite on their physical body ... <br /> <br /> MEATBALL MACHINE will be invariably compared to TETSUO (as most cyber-punk movies are), and for good reason . There are certainly some thematic parallels, although the films are clearly different. MEATBALL MACHINE is full of fun and fun moments, and the FX creature / borg is definitely the highlight - a mix of TETSUO-meets-GWAR that's both elaborate and inventive. Depending on your taste for these types of films, MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing. If you like hyper-kinetic cyberpunk movies with a good dose of splashing, here's what you need ... 7/10
