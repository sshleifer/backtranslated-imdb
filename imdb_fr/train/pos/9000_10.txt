I saw BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI for the first time at the Hawaii International Film Festival. WOW! The blood has simply carried us with its pure verve, its gore, its vitality, its excitement, its excitement, its gaiety, its total enthusiasm, and even more gore, and all this in such pleasure! Especially for those who love all these Japanese samurai and ninja Japanese chambara movies, YOU MUST DEFINITELY SEE THE BLOOD!
