Three scumbags find their just desert after having spoiled their lives in greed, drugs, ego and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; This style of film always makes me wonder where the reality stops and where the imagination takes over. Even though these people were the scum of the earth, I always found myself pitying them. They have never really been very lucky.
