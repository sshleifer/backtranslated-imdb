I'm going to stand on one leg and actually defend "Shades of Gray" as a good episode of the series of clips, which plunged into the fight for the life and death of Commander William Thomas Riker who was fighting a deadly disease in phase terminal. <Br /> <br /> The scenes of the flashback sequences were very well implemented, in the mood of Riker, when he relived his romantic episodes such as "11001001", "Angel One" and " Up the Long Ladder ". Tragic moments have been brought to light, such as Tasha's death in "Skin of Evil", as well as elements of danger throbbing in "Heart of Glory", "Conspiracy" and the previous "Skin of Evil". Riker also showed courage under fire by telling humorous jokes such as "One of my ancestors was bitten by a rattlesnake once ... after 3 days of intense pain, the snake died." This episode brought to light Will Riker's psychological test under extreme stress. And, YES, I'm biased in my opinion by proclaiming "Shades of Gray" as a solid episode, because at the time of its initial release, my face was covered in sweat and I wondered if Riker would come out alive and alive. to see other great extra-galactic adventures beyond the final frontier ... <br /> <br /> Of course, it seems to me that in the following years, I made a singular opinion about this episode in particular ... The award should go for "the best episode of the television show in the history of television", so I think this episode should be highly regarded in this regard.
