Elegantly directed, brilliantly photographed and brilliantly played ?? The interpretation of Crosby seems quite right, Hardwicke has its best role of all time, while Bendix is ​​a treat too ?? The call of this Yankee is universal and irresistible. <br /> <br /> One of the main joys of the film, of course, are the songs. As expected, Bing is beautiful. And although Hardwicke's solo was cut, we still hear him singing with all his heart as he happily dances with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty issue, "Busy Doing Nothing". It is also a pleasure to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she has had a long career as a singer on stage and in concerts, has rarely had the chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a beautiful voice that fits more than her lovely look - and she looks really good in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes. <br /> <br /> Director Tay Garnett makes the most of his lavish budget, using all the resources at his disposal to present each fabulous scene as efficiently as possible. (Maybe the eclipse looks a bit too artificial, but who's complaining?) <br /> <br /> In short, as the trailer describes, an entertainment delight from start to finish end.
