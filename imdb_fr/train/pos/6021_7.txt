Although it's not necessarily a "classic" film by today's standards, it's still worth seeing. The main reason is that after having the chance to experience this film, you have the impression that you have also experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the '60s, whether good or bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this by chance film in a course of English literature at SUNY Geneseo, and although it initially seems to be only an insignificant composition of icons from the 60s, the film is far from being simply "thrown together". <br /> <br /> If you leave the film with a feeling of dissatisfaction and confusion, the film did its job: it sends you a sorry vision of the future that leaves you uncomfortable and uncomfortable. anger. This is perhaps the same feeling that the film sought to explore among the young people he was an example of. <br /> <br /> As such, "Zabriskie Point" might not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters can be one-sided and predictable. However, it also translates so well that kind of clich√© and rebellious desire to come out of existence that Mark and Daria have to share. Even anti-establishment students are as inauthentic as the government they are rebelling against.
