This first film has its flaws - a predictable plot and a few long scenes of dubious relevance - but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. He is also one of the most expressionist of his films stylistically; note, for example, the strange distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of the title and plot in the imagery. <br /> <br /> His heart remains however the last match, which makes more exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Even if you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite credible that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his, motivating the final payment of the plot, is very closely tied to the progress of the encounter. The chronometer inserts do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking sound (even if it's a silent movie, the visual effects often have a surprisingly auditive feel). The pace becomes surprisingly fast and the viewer is drawn into the excitement and brutality of the match and the sexual jealousy that underlies it. <br /> <br /> The only DVD I know is Laserlight, a public domain company. As with every Hitchcock silence they have published, they have combined various musical selections, mostly orchestral, into action. The sound editing is often sloppy and the quality of the sound varies a lot, but most of the choices seem to have been given special attention, and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here. <br /> <br /> It's a much more impressive film than its current darkness suggests. He deserves an honorable place in the Hitchcock canon and in the slender list of interesting boxing films.
