Slaughter High is talking about a boy named Marty. He was harassed and harassed in high school. A group of children made several jokes about him, and these jokes were really bad. The last joke ended tragically. <br /> <br /> 5 years later. The group of children meet for a meeting. One of them installed him in the old high school. The school is now abandoned and they must burst. For some reason, the concierge is still there, but he tells them to continue and have fun, as they give him a beer. <br /> <br /> They start to party and watch their old lockers, and they see something from Marty. A girl feels sorry for Marty, but another guy calms her down. <br /> <br /> Once the killings begin, it's great. Every murder is creative and bloody. We see a figure in a jester mask, chasing them one by one into the school. It seems that Marty is back to take his revenge. After the death of the first person, they discover that they are locked in school. They start looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> Now, there are a number of illogical things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has been meeting for 5 years. Second, after the death of the first child, a girl is covered with blood. They all run away in panic. Yet she runs to the bathroom and finds a bathtub. Her friend has just been killed and decides to take a bath !? More importantly, why is there a bathtub in the bathroom of a school? Anyway, the tub does not really seem to work ... and she dies of a horrible death. It's an 80's movie. It's a horror slasher. Who cares if she has illogical parts. For my part, I do not do it. This movie really has a lot of deaths. The end .... there is a twist. Having recently seen High Voltage, I can compare both. The only thing that makes them similar is that there is a twist, which left me disappointed ..... THEN just after the twist, there is a big, if not the best killing, in the movie . <br /> <br /> After the last murder, the killer looks at the screen and does something crazy, and it was the perfect way to end the movie. He made me "wow ..."
