This film made for television is brilliant. This is probably the best and the favorite role of John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse), winner of the BAFTA Award. Tom Oakley (Thaw), a widower, has lived in a single village for some time now that his wife and son have died. He is now disembarked with an evacuee called Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). By getting to know this child, he begins to develop a friendship. Until Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants to get it back. Once Tom worries that William does not contact him, he goes to London to find him. In the end, Willaim finds his home in a loving family (or dad). During the Second World War, it is an excellent film. He was named BAFTA Lew Grade Award and won the National Television Award for the most popular drama. John Thaw was number 3 of the 50 biggest TV stars. Very well!
