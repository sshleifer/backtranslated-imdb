Before Cujo, there was Lucky the devil dog. In 1978, the night of the Halloween party, the movie "The devil's dog, the dog of hell" was introduced. A family tells the story of a new puppy (a farmer who sells fruits and vegetables in the neighborhood) because his dog, Skipper, was killed. Coincidence? Everyone loves the new dog, but he has something strange. <br /> <br /> It will not be long before Father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to notice him.Her woman, Betty (Yvette Mimieux, Where are the boys, Jackson Prison, Snowbeast ) his children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and the teacher, Hello Larry, Tuff-Turf) have also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? He is determined to discover and do all that is necessary to save his family. <br /> <br /> This film is great because Ike and Kim play a darker role than we saw in these movies on the mountain of witches. This is one of the many horror movies made for television in the '70s and really scary for a horror movie designed for television. The music was scary and even the end that I will not tell you made you think. <br /> <br /> This film is also played by Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and RG Armstrong (who could not stay away from the movies of the devil remembers "Running with the devil"?) <br /> <br /> This is worth watching.
