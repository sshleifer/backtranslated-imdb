We often see movies about adverse events in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". In a role for which he was born, Al Pacino plays the role of the mayor of New York, who faces the murder of a boy. But it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect. In this film, the characters are as serious as one would expect from anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust a politician, you may have doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not name a specific example of what this film describes, but that's not the point. If we had idealistic impressions of those at the top, this film destroys such ideas. Certainly one that I encourage you to see. With John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
