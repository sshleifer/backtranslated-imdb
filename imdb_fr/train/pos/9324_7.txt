I've read some of the reviews and I'm a little sad that much of the story seems to have been overlooked. It's easy to do because it's not a book, it's a movie and everything you can do in a movie - American or Canadian - or anywhere. "F @ g-Hag", like me, does a great job playing not only the gay man from the "friendly neighborhood", but being sick. I mean, the man really can not get much paler! However, you may never know it in the aisles near ... well, fine. <br /> <br /> If you need decrepit, there are some SKing movies you might like. <br /> <br /> Being the daughter of a recovering Alchoholic, the drugged man's brother {David Cubitt} was the thing for me. I'll give him credit, he grew up fast and believe me, that's good. And, as a budding writer, I can dig a lot of his ideas and insights. But I am more prosaic than poetic. <br /> <br /> I can be easy to please, but I appreciated. A beautiful story quite well done by Canadians, what a surprise. Just at the end of the "Film of the Week" line, he misses because of not being so drawn, GREATLY appreciated. And it was skillfully described.
