With 'Twelve Monkeys' you have to be careful, but if you do that, you will probably have a lot to enjoy. I know I did. The story is interesting and deals with the journey in time. A virus killed a lot of people in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) was fired in 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990, he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who is probably related to the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who does not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the psychiatric hospital while chained and locked in a room and reappears in 1996, Kathryn begins to believe the stories of Cole. The film plays constantly with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996. It is picked up in the future and "they" send someone. For Cole that someone appears only a few seconds after the phone call. This kind of thing happens throughout the movie and so you have to keep the attention. You can ask a few questions, but since you can not get an answer, it's better to agree with the movie. <br /> <br /> "Twelve Monkeys" works like a science fiction, with some great pictures and a dark atmosphere and it works like a thriller. You're never sure what's going to happen next and that helps the movie. The story may have flaws, but since this is a fictional thing like time travel, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy it. It was the easy part for me.
