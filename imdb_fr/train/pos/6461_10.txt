I was initially caught off guard by the initial lyricism of the film, then became totally enchanted by the story unfolding and absorbed by the brilliant staging. The characters were all fully developed, no larger than life, but like the people with whom we live all over the world, in Sweden, Turkey or America, all of them completely credible human beings with weaknesses and nobility. Hollywood could learn a lot from this beautiful movie. This shows that it is not necessary to go into great detail to bring out the theme as a whole, and it shows the brilliance of the director! Many thanks to Kay Pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treat !!
