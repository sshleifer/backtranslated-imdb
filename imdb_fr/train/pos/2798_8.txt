Jess is 18, she is very smart and wants nothing more than playing football. When she joins a local team, she has to lie to her parents again and again. a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook. <br /> <br /> Bend it Like Beckham is a very fun movie that does not have to be deep and complex, it's just fine. The actors are very good and play very well their roles, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the scenario is very realistic and very fun. <br /> <br /> An excellent family film 8/10
