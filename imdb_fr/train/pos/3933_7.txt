The problem with the portrait of a real person is that the performance can be good, but still does not work if the audience does not believe that the actor represents the person. This is the main problem of "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gives an extraordinary performance, but I had a hard time believing that Abraham Lincoln was as sweet as the Fonda represents him. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a drama in the courtroom with a young Abraham Licoln in the foreground. I do not know if it was a true story or not, but if not, why tell it using Lincoln as a central character? Never mind. In the film, Lincoln defends two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> There is really not much in the film and, as a result, it seems rather empty. I wanted more story and character development. The film lasts 100 minutes, but it does not feel like that. There are some small scenes featuring Lincoln and the flourishing relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, but as I said, Fonda's performance works like a character, but not Abraham Lincoln. I just do not think the real Lincoln was so sweet. Of course, he has a great voice when he needs to, for example when he persuades a crowd of drunken lynchotes to let the accused appear in court, but Fonda describes Lincoln too humbly. Other performances are strong, including Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the accused's mother. She is a nice lady who can really feel good. Simple and uneducated, but very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help him. <br /> <br /> John Ford seems to think that this film is an epic and that it was probably at the time of its release. But even in this case, there is simply not enough material to present it as such. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful watch, but not a classic one.
