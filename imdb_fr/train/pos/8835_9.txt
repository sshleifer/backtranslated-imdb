This film is a sharp political commentary postulating a story of transition to adulthood. The problem is that it works effectively at both levels. This is not supposed but it is. This story of four boys and one girl growing up in 1953, Communist Belgrade, is warmer to the heart. This is what gentlemen call classical cinema. Obviously, Belgrade in 1953 is not a dictatorial and fascist environment as severe as Communist society is often described. One can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs played is the song "Hey Babu Riba", the title of the film. But you can not buy jeans or certain drugs that are illegal to own. Unlike a harsh criticism of a communist society, this film does this by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who consider themselves to be four of us. The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is waiting for a passport for her mother and she travels to join him, the piano removed from the communion of one of the boys, the sudden gift of your house and your home to your new comrades because they need it. Boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is clear that they despise fascism created by communism as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who tattooed Stalin on his hands. All this leads to the actions they will undertake later and the memory of a time that fades, since this film was released in 1986 at the twilight of the Soviet empire. A great movie to see again and again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but it is not anyone's friend."
