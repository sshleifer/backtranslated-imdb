"House of Games" is a perfectly constructed film, and one of the few films I saw left me speechless, stunned at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ended. I had seen it for the first time a few years ago in a video after reading the review of Roger Ebert, who proclaimed it the best film of 1987. I had doubts, mainly because this film is not also known as the other films of this year. Boy, was I in a surprise. It was one of the smartest and best-written movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The scenario is a rather complex job, not only in terms of scenario (which goes around in circles and pulls the carpet just when you think you have understood everything), but also in terms of character development . During my second viewing, I began to realize that Mamet's screenplay was not only successful as a smart suspense movie, but that each development of the plot contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The height of the film is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable. This follows naturally from what we know about the characters, so it's more than just a final twist. The performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add a lot to the film. I can not imagine any other actor than Mantegna playing Mike, and Crouse plays her role with enough restraint to suggest a repressed state of mind. Their work and the extraordinary scenario of Mamet combine to create one of the greatest movies of the 1980s. It is really a must.
