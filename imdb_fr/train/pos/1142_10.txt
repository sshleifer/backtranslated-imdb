until HBO starts rerunning it this month. I remember laughing aloud at the theater in 1991 and now in my living room. If I see it's on, I have to watch it. There is no doubt. It's so much more fun for me than other more popular periodos such as Airplane! (which I like a lot, BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes like "Speech suddenly! The last symptoms of brain fever! It could blow at any time!" put me on the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg has not been so funny since Jumpin 'Jack Flash. Kevin Klein, Sally Field and Robert Downey Jr. all perform well as expected. I started giving 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for the type of film that it is supposed to be, there is not one thing I would change or improve. So it is. I have to get this on DVD, that's all there is to it.
