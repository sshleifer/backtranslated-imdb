I have not seen this mini-series for a long time and I am happy to say that its merits have stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most of the components of "A Perfect Spy", the adaptation of the most beautiful novel of LeCarré, are, in my opinion, very useful. Highlights are the musical score and masterful script, written by Arthur Hopcraft who was also, I believe, the screenwriter of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' with Alec Guinness a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The actors are mostly very good, some great, like Alan Howard's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally's Ricky Pym. Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes at every angle of the camera. The passage of time and the effects on the physical appearance of the characters are most likely accomplished. So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming. The only jolt comes after Magnus Pym's character has gone from the handsome hands of a young actor by the name of Benedict Taylor to those of an over-aged Peter Egan, who has just come out of Oxford. But this is a minor stitch and unimportant overall. <br /> <br /> Egan has a hard time convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and must be emotionally "upset", that is, crying. None of the actors are very comfortable with these moments, apart from the wonderful Frances Tomelty, who plays Peggy Wentworth as she pleases and easily steals the episode. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is annoying like Mary Pym. She has a part of the character under her skin, but often displays an amateur petulance that reduces her to the rank of housewife diplomat, like Mary Pym. Rüdiger Weigang is splendid as Axel, amusing, ironic and brilliant. I also enjoyed Sarah Badel's tour as a baroness. <br /> <br /> The British vision of the Americans is strikingly rendered in some dry and hilarious scenes. When the Yanks came abroad to be confused with Bo Brammell (MI6 leader), the American contingent is described as an empty jester who seems to have memorized many long words in the dictionary and spiced them with jargon American and psychological gibberish. , to the great contempt of the English. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness are subtly mixed. LeCarré has the gift of mixing disparate elements in his stories and Hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy, but melancholy, atmosphere of the original. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect production (what is it?) And yet the best Adaptations LeCarré to reach the film or television so far. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to all espionage-thriller lovers and especially to those who love LeCarré. DVD available at Acorn.
