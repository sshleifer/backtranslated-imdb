Road to Perdition, an unjustly neglected film that year, Oscars is the second work by Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who, three years ago, won the Oscar for his famous American movie American Beauty. It's a fantastic film, both poignant and sad. <br /> <br /> The story of a relatively affluent and happy family, who made their appearance during the difficult times of the Depression, when Michael Sullivan, father of two, played by the great Tom Hanks ( I am not his admirer, but it must be said) is a hit-man for the head of the local mafia, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen-year-old boy, Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly interpreted by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of pure ignorance, discovers his father's work and the money spent by their family. Driven by his curiosity and his desire to know the truth, he accidentally becomes the witness of a murder committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss. Such a discovery strikes an innocent soul and provoked many events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the time, all the sets and sets are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost perfect while the story is well written. But the main line of the film, the moments and the most important points of the film and the key factor of the success of the film are the difficult father-son relations in the difficult moments. They are shown so deeply, strong and credible. Tom Hanks does a great job and has one of the best performances of his career in a role quite unusual for him and it is superb to act in all areas. Finally, it is worth mentioning a beautiful score by Paul Newman and as a result, we get an exceptional job from all the people involved in the realization of this magnificent masterpiece (but again sad). I believe Road to Perdition is one of the greatest film achievements of this decade and arguably one of the best movies of the year. <br /> <br /> My 10th year out of 10
