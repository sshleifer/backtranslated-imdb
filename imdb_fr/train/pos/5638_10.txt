I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is a great role model for teens and should be more appreciated. This movie aims to follow your dreams and never give up, no matter what people might say or do to discourage you and criticize you. Holly realizes her dreams, just like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are moments in everyone's life where people judge them for what they are not who they are. As you watch this film, you will understand that you are special in your own way and that you must follow your dreams no matter what happens. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. She will never know how much it means to me. Well done Britney. You are the best!!!
