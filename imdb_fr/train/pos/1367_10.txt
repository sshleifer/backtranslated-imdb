This movie was such an explosion! It has that feeling of well-being, but totally in your face that attracts me to a movie. There is a good message (the party girl decides that she needs a real job) but she does not completely lose any sense of pleasure. I recommend this film to anyone who needs humor, but is also a thinker! :)
