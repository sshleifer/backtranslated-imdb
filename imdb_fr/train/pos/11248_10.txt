Stemming from a complex and that may seem history absurd and vain personal, whatever it may be; and yet I am fascinated by the mechanism of betrayal and loyalty, the raw material of all relationships, from the personnel to the social; After, many years ago, I was able to finish the book, it was a revelation! At first, I was so bored, if not for the surprising style of writing (I really started to worship Le Carr√© after this novel). The main character does not weaken at all: he has chosen to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith in friendship and love, is not it? After this novel, you can clearly understand the darker version of Green's "Our Man in Havana" written by LeCarre with "The Panama Tailor"; there is no game left, it ends either in a tragedy, or in a grotesque comic style, or in both cases. There is no Smiley here to defend decent human qualities in "service", or at least there is no point in presenting it in this case. The BBC has done a great job with these series of novels LeCarre: the actors are excellent, as well as places and sets; of course, the script here is brilliantly adapted. Be warned though, even though someone may find it laughable, the aftertaste is bitter.
