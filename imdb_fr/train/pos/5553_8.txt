Slow but beautifully climbed history of the American Revolution. Griffith's story seems much lighter than in his previous historical epics and his paintings work is fully integrated into the action. Lionel Barrymore is a real pig, Neil Hamilton is poor but dapper and Carol Dempster is .... well, Carol Dempster is most of what's wrong with Griffith at this time, but she does not show up often enough to slow down and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that the quiz of this movie indicates that it was imported a little more than 2 hours at its release, but that there is no break of more than 90 minutes. However, the release of the DVD was presented at a slower pace, which increases the tension and brings it back to just over two hours. <br /> <br /> Much better in terms of narration than sound versions, such as LE PATRIOTE. Although not in Griffith's best league, such as WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, is a great way to spend a few hours.
