A sober and thoughtful piece, a small miniature that blossoms into a magnificent human pictorial sequence that goes beyond a simple staging for the screen. This little quiet story will enchant you - if you do not have too many problems with the various Spanish accents ranging from Mexican to Peruvian, and the more authentic use of Marisa Paredes in the Iberian Peninsula! Garcíadiego perfectly adapted the novel: even the great master García Márquez should be proud of his superb work. And hat to Arturo Ripstein who has so well reconciled all this effort to make a jewel, a ruby, and a refined wine, elegant and sensitive, so touching, so touching ..... <br /> El Coronel - Fernando Luján - waiting to receive his pension, while he continues to live in his dilapidated timber located in the heart of the Colombian jungle (filmed elsewhere, NOT in Colombia) with his cock and his wife (in this order?). And that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> But, oh, much more ... This film is a rhapsody. <br /> <br /> I have to see this little poetic piece as soon as possible. Worth the high side of 8 out of 10, which is very high on my scale. <br /> <br /> This is not a light commercial Hollywood affair.
