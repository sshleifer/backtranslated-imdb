A solid film B. <br /> <br /> I love Jake Weber. Its discreet delivery is refreshing at a time of exceptional performance. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked the family dynamics. The Wendigo looks silly, but it's a representation of the child's toy and dead deer. It's a fusion like, you see? This is a psychological story, not an instant gratification movie of Freddy slash em up. Look at it and think about your inner child and what the film could tell you and everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> Nice work.
