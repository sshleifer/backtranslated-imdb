With incomparable visual landscapes and a story of divine proportions, Legend of Zu continues to surprise its audience with its majesty. This film is beautifully crafted through the use of CGI's advanced technology, which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life. The acting is perfect for this type of movie; if you were an immortal with supernatural powers, I would think you would keep more for yourself. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the comments of many, the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a fast pace that adds a sense of urgency. Anyone who can not follow the different characters simply does not have to pay attention to it, or is used to levels of sophistication such as titanic. The plot is attractive and superimposed on themes so epic that they will leave you breathless. Legend of Zu is at such a high level of magnitude that maybe many people are shocked by his greatness. Allow yourself to be completely engulfed in his fantastic vision and you will fall in love with this movie.
