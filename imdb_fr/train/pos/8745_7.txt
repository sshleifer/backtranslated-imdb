After finishing high school, best friends Alice and Darlene decide to take a trip to Thailand. During their stay, they meet a lovely Australian named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks them if they want to spend a weekend in Hong Kong with him. They agree. At the airport, however, they get caught for drug trafficking and then sentenced to 33 years in prison in a Thai prison for something they say they did not do. Not really knowing what to do, they end up contacting Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. Rumor has it that if you have the money, he can help you. Things are starting well, but they still can not come out. <br /> <br /> The film is really good because it does not show what will happen and it is interesting all the time. I could not believe the end though. It's one of those endings where you do not know the truth 100%, but you still know what really happened with Nick and the drug dealing because of "taking possession," and so on. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both perform very well here. Beckinsales' performance, however, was a little weak. The friendship between the two Danes and Beckinsales is good but could seem stronger. Paul Walker even has a small uncredited role here. ;) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I gave it a 7/10.
