I will not go into the details of the plot of this film because other critics have covered the same subject. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I really liked the movie. The performance of Peter Falk alone is reason enough to watch the film. <br /> <br /> A short road trip with Falk & Paul Reiser in upstate New York in the fall is the perfect setting for most of the film's actions. . <br /> <br /> Very well written with an adult target audience in mind. A lot of reality-based humor and well-played dramas give the film the feeling that it might be your own family. <br /> <br /> I really can not say enough about this film, except that it's a shame that a beautiful movie as if it does not get more visibility than other unwanted trash. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to see Falk again with a great leading role and make the most of it. This proves that his famous friend and writer / director John Casavettes was right to include Falk in many of his innovative films of the 60s and 70s.
