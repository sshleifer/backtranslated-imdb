The robber of Baghdad is a treasure. First and foremost, it's a good story. Although the main exhibition of my four children to this story, the most famous story of the Arabian Nights, comes from the Disney Corporation, the thief of Baghdad has held their interest to the end. The story is moving at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduces predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, is also measured by all the teenage actors currently on appeal, judging by the number of times I heard my eldest daughter say, "He is here!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects. Today, of course, these effects seem very dated ("Look, it's Barbie flying in the air," said my daughter at the sight of flying genius). Yet they fit well into the story. After all, the film is over 60 years old. The effects correspond to the script. In addition, what we see in The Thief of Baghdad has remained at the forefront of technology for the next twenty-five years. Just compare the opening montage of a 1967 Star Trek episode to see that. In that, it was quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> This is a family film, although some stab wounds were fired towards the end. The acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloody that scenes almost as artificial as the animation. <br /> <br /> In the end, a fun movie to watch, whether for an evening of pure entertainment or for the historical value of the effects. I recommand it.
