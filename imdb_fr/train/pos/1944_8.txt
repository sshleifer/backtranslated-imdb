This is an excellent movie about the characters of an adult swimming lesson, their problems, their relationships and their interactions. He should have handled a wider cast because he's way better than similar movies from big studios at the same time. <br /> <br /> The swimming instructor is an almost Olympian athlete, reduced to teaching elementary lessons to adults, and often horndogging target of his students. He tries, more or less, to repel them, with varying results. <br /> <br /> The characters of the students are U.S.A American characters; teachers, police officers, students and retirees who have not learned to swim for any reason. The film covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests during their journey. Several secondary intrigues provide fun fodder, including a divorcing teacher, high school students making a documentary and a girl only in class to meet men. <br /> <br /> This is a good rendezvous movie, or just to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with shades of reality.
