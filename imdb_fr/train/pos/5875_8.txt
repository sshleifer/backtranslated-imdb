This is one of the movies that does not require brain or thought, it's a very fun time you've forgotten in the next hour or so. I was really surprised by the play of John Abraham: he usually plays the character of gangster with a face without emotion, so to play the opposite and to do it successfully, succeeding to shine among the comic geniuses such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also quite surprised by the 3 girls of Akshaye because their roles do not require a lot of talent but especially that I moan about the disappearance of Akshaye (towards the other girls), I was surprised It's a good thing, most of the songs are good, they are colorful and fun, so a boring Sunday night will lighten your mood.
