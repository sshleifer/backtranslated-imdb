Forget about Neo and Bourne and all those half-cooked heroes that make up modern heroes. They are only 12 years old to please the wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Since they can not be Rambo, McClane, or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood has licensed a series of fake beardless fakes, while satisfying teenagers' desires to see something that looks a lot like an action movie. <br /> <br /> However, their "action scenes" are simply painful to watch and any girl can question their masculinity without question. This explains the recrudescence of old on our silver screens in recent years. For the best (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, get ready ... does not have a beard !!) <br /> <br /> I say he is It's time for a new hero to come on stage and put an end to their reign. This movie "Largo Winch" is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least Tomer Sisley has delivered a very promising performance as a hero of action. And the only time he was weakened is when Melanie Thierry shaved his beard! I leave my case. <br /> <br /> I did not know it when I walked into the movie theater, but maybe that's the movie I've been waiting for for a decade. For the first time in France since Belmondo, a film can be both well designed and rooted in genre B without blushing its performance. In the meantime, all we had to chew was either a huge pile of dung, or something too small to reach a wider audience ... In other words, it was "The Wolf Pact" or "Doberman "(I like) ... I think" Largo Winch "has what it takes to be a popular and quality film. <br /> <br /> I came out of the theater room very happy and greedy more and more.
