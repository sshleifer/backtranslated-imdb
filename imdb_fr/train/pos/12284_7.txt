I did not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it was necessary to display a disconcerting accent, pronounced with the clenched teeth and the back of the throat. In fact, it rather spoiled the film for me and distracted me from what was probably a good performance from him (very irritating). No other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent, and although I've always considered Jeremy Irons a good actor, I would not rank this film as one of the best. The film, however, fueled my appetite, as did some of the other comments made about this film, which I found very interesting, and which I now intend to read.
