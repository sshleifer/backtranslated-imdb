Has Al Pacino ever played in a bad movie? His name seems to be a imprimatur for first-rate cinema. It's as good a performance he has ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And it's a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys or bad guys. But the system has an inexorable effect on people who think of managing it. Pacino's performance is not only convincing - the funeral eulogy of the deceased child's funeral is incredibly powerful - the film has a quick, gritty realism that enhances beautiful performance without resorting to gadgets. This remarkable portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of great film without looking at excessive violence, overheated sex or gutter language. There is a murder. There are bad guys. But they meet effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood. I do not grant many tens. This one deserves it amply!
