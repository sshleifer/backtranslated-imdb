A river that runs through is one of those films that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography is really appreciated. The acting is wonderful and discreet, each gesture, each smile and each sign of the head having a meaning. Brad Pitt gives a radiant performance and Tom Skerrit is powerful as a preacher. The film moves like a river, you must be ready to follow it through ebb and flow, but it's worth it in the end.
