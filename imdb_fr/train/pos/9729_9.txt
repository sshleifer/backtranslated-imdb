Low start, solid background, fantastic finish. It's my impression of this film, anyway. I liked Simon Pegg in both movies in which I saw him in --- Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, however, took a completely different turn. He shows his acting skills, but nevertheless I did not really like the character as it was described at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of humor that I call "comedy of frustration". His supposed "jokes" and his mind are actually painful and uncomfortable moments. Just like Bean's character, Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are a number of other comic actors who also describe similar characters. I do not want to hit them here, so I will not do it. <br /> <br /> But be aware that if you're like me and you do not like scary and stammering idiots, Pegg shows such characteristics for the first time. third of this film. This is better though. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. May be. The film's story has stopped being boring and has become a kind of triumph of the "little guy" in the last third. I do not need all the movies to be sweet and light - but as luck would have it, as the movie improved, it also began to become more and more a happy ending. <br /> <br /> It was also a pleasure to see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, play a role so masterfully. I liked "Iron Man", but I was saddened by the fact that Bridges was a bad guy. A purely personal taste, of course, because his acting in this movie was superb. Nevertheless, he was a marvel here as a vision man Bigger Than Life, publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role that I could really appreciate. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked it! I would have liked to have arrived 40 minutes late and missed the start.
