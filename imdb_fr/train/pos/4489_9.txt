This movie is NOT about a cat-and-mouse fight, as shown in the other comment. This is a cat that has consumed 8 of his 9 lives and now fears losing his last. The cat is nervous and is afraid to die all the time, hence the name "scary cat". The previous lives of Fraidy Cat haunt him as ghosts of different eras and are constantly trying to kill him, but he fears the ninth life more, represented by a cloud in the form of number 9 and illuminating the lighting. bolts. very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you get a copy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie almost every day as a child: o)
