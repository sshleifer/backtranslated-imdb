This film has several objectives. It's a story of "well-being". The characters and actors are friendly, realistic and show great performances. The most important thing, in my opinion, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to hold and throw a baseball. Robert Redford seemed to throw and hit a bat in "The Natural", as well as Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham". In "Major League", Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen seemed to know what. they did it, but many others did not, and this picture was pure nonsense - and not very funny. <br /> <br /> So many previous films on baseball, even where the stories might be interesting, have such a lack In "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command", Jimmy Stewart was as believable as a player Professional baseball, just like your overweight, non-athletic, old uncle in the softball match at the family reunion. Other virile and sturdy stars (Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also demonstrated some end-game baseball skill while "choosing" for a Sunday picnic party (even if she was a student and even if your uncle was involved). <br /> <br /> The scenes of Quaid's high school team he coached, the ones he saw at the Devil Rays, and the ones with him playing in two minor leagues and in the American Hockey League , are all true. The participants are credible and capable. In addition, he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate description (with the exception, to a certain extent, of his "delusional" scenes and his forced accent in his rendition of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he's really in the game here, and this movie is a "9", as good, or better, than any other movie of this genre, except "The Natural".
