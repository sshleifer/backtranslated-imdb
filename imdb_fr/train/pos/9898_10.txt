My 10/10 rating is simply for the fun factor and assumes you have decided that you liked "Slaughter High" before even looking. Yes, it's the typical story of a revenge many years after a dirty joke, but how not to like some of the stuff they shoot here ?! I could not have predicted this bathtub scene in a million years. <br /> <br /> OK, so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie does not offer anything new. Well, he does not pretend. This is the kind of movie that the characters of "Scream" probably watched, and that contributed to their rules on how to survive a horror movie. After all, who does not like watching people suffer for doing these things? Obviously, it has a reactionary connotation, because people are punished for doing what the 60's defended. But still, you have to like this stuff! So, with all my apologies to Don McLean, this jester did not sing for the King and Queen!
