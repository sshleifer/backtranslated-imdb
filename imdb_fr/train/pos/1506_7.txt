Before movies like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Suspiria" and "Halloween" never change the vision of horror, there was a more gothic and far less violent era in the genre. Movies like the Hammer Horror series and "Rosemary's Baby" were what frightened and delighted audiences throughout the '60s and early' 70s. I can not tell you how many times I've rented this movie during my childhood, but I did it because there was something about it. I did not want to limit myself to the slasher and zombie movies of the '70s and' 80s and to movies like this famous production, but unfortunately gone, the Amicus movie company was a good start. <br /> <br /> A strange music score. Strong performance of a stellar cast. Bright cinematography. Many chills and shivers in the old, especially in the first and last vignettes. Moments and haunting images. Moves at a slow but steady pace. The house is a sinister and oppressive home. A superb production set and a set decoration that gives the film a real sensation of Gothic horror. Depends more on mood and chills without blood than gore and gratuitous nudity for his thrills. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Some stimulation problems in the first half. Apart from "The Cloak", the rest of the stories give the impression of having been done before. Clich√©s galore. The second story, "Waxworks," has good roles and moments, but is the weakest of the four in terms of fear and suspense. The small budget sometimes shows up. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: After seeing this movie for the first time in many years, I can understand why I praised it so often. It is certainly not a masterpiece, but it is a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. Look at this one with the lights off. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
