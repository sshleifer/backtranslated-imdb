George Lopez never caught my interest in his humor and he still does not understand it. But this show is a work of art. It's never indicated where jokes make you laugh every time you remember (and jokes that are memorable to that). This show just looks optimistic and the characters range from a drunken old man running to a dyslexic teenager. I do not know who writes this series but this person does a great job. If they had just continued the series, I am sure that would provoke a positive reaction from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good traditional comedy, then George Lopez is for you! The only bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine that the new prince of Bel-Air is "Will Smith". Go dude! But otherwise, this show is great! 10/10
