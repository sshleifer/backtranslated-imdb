Jay Chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school, but dismissed by a corrupt director after fighting with a gang of thugs in the employ of an infamous villain. He meets Eric Tsang, the unlucky trickster, who immediately sees a monetary potential in the skills of the young. Basketball is the preferred avenue of wealth and Tsang seeks to make him a part of a university team and promote it in the media. The overall success leads to a basketball championship and a very bad rival team led by the same mean villain. <br /> <br /> It's a bit Shaolin Soccer I guess, but not so weird or ridiculous - the plot remains pretty close to the sports film conventions, and provides all the elements that the crowd expects from the setting square. You've seen everything before, but that's the kind of thing that's never bad to see when things are good. Fortunately, everything is going well here (some would say "surprisingly", with Chu Yen-Ping as president ... I guess he had good "assistants") - the script is respected and the presentation is elegant and stylish. Jay Chou remains practically without expression, but that is his style, and when he passes an emotion, it can become a very good comic effect. Eric Tsang compensates with a larger than life character that he has played many times (in real life, for example) and who enjoys the most moving moments of the film. <br /> <br /> Since the movie revolves around basketball, it is good that the scenes of basketball matches are sufficiently catchy. The actors show real talent, including Chou, and some well-crafted do-it-yourself projects and CGI add that hyper-real kung-fu talent element that makes the scenes even more fun (assuming you like that kind of thing) and justifies the plot / existence of the film. <br /> <br /> There is only one major fighting scene in the film, but it's a doozy in the "one against many" style. Jay Chou seems to be doing a lot of his own moves and is quite impressive - he's clearly strong enough and fast for real, and Ching Siu-Tung's choreography makes him look like a true martial artist. I wish there were more, but at least it's a long fight. <br /> <br /> The kind of Chinese New Year's blockbuster, I hoped it would come from the trailer, and the viewing recommended!
