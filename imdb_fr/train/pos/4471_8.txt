Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi play in "Achor Anchors", directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two sailors on leave in Hollywood. They meet a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and bring him home, they meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls in love with her. She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi. They try to help, but there is confusion. <br /> <br /> It's a very energetic musical, with beautiful dances and songs by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly will dance with Jerry the Mouse in a delightful sequence. Grayson sings Jealousy and my heart sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but she's doing well. Iturbi's piano work is magnificent. <br /> <br /> Sinatra shows her versatility and explains why the girls fainted around him, with his big blue eyes and childlike face. For Kelly, it was an important break for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film, very buoyant.
