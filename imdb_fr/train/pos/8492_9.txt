Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never tire of watching. Michael Keaton has always been one of my favorites and he is absolutely hilarious in this film. Gedde Watanabe corresponds to him. Both work wonderfully together. Although this film is a comedy, I also like the way it shows Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) struggling in their roles as leaders of their respective groups. They both try so hard to keep the peace, then they argue (which is hysterical to watch). First, they are both on the floor. Then Hunt jumps on a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the desk. Hunt jumps on the desk with him. The fight then takes place from the office to the factory. I love that after being separated by the workers, you can say that they both feel uncomfortable letting things get out of control. There is also a scene where you can see Hunt's influence on Kazihiro. He is at home and his Japanese boss arrives and says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow, not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is locked and we can not find the key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can not imagine Michael Keaton saying something like that! <br /> <br /> I guess I really like this movie because it's really funny, and also shows how radically different people can not only learn from each other, but also become good friends.
