In this sinister melodrama, Barbara Stanwyck plays the eldest of the three rich sisters who became orphaned when their father died in France. Threatened with losing the opulent family home, Big Sister makes a big sacrifice and secretly marries a real estate developer to be able to inherit her aunt's fortune. A few years later, she learns that he is after the family estate and wants to demolish it, so she leaves him and tries to stop him. More time passes and the husband ends up taking him to court when he learns that she gave him a son without telling him. The role of "Gig Young" was played by actor Byron Barr, who took the name before becoming famous. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in purchasing a copy informs me by email at the following address: iamaseal2 @ yahoo. com
