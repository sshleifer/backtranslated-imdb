This story had a good story ... it had a good rhythm and all the characters were well developed. <br /> <br /> I watched a lot of movies in the last two weeks and it must have been the best. I saw it during the two weeks. <br /> <br /> Jason Bigg's character was the best. <br /> <br /> Even though he was small, he was cleverly crafted from the start. <BR/> <br /> It may be a romantic comedy and I do not like it much, but writing, directing, sound, design as a whole have been very well thought out. <br /> <br /> This movie got a pretty high score among all the movies I saw recently - and the rest was big budget or better advertised. <br /> <br /> Good work of writing.
