A highly anticipated film of the year 2002. After three and a half years of hibernation, Rajini played in this film. The hype of this film was too high. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical film of Rajini, in this film he also gives spiritual messages. But it also includes Rajini's typical actions, style, songs, etc. It's a good entertaining film and also gives good messages. <br /> <br /> I will describe this film as good to excellent thanks to the script. It's a movie to watch absolutely. Do not miss this!
