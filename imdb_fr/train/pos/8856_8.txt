BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT YOU ARE MORTAL begins in a promising way, by setting up a simple flight that goes wrong, and that takes place under different angles (in the RASHOMON style). Around the hour, Sidney Lumet turns this film into something more than the sum of its parts; it ends up turning into a multi-faceted family drama, exploring the whole realm of emotions / human relationships, as the story approaches its climax. <br /> <br /> As is the case with Lumet, he manages to seduce in an exceptional way. performance out of his starry cast, without any notion of over-action or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often dwarf, Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother, Hank. This does not mean that Hawke is not bad; In fact, he is quite above the right, in a troubled role that suits his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she discovers her flesh adds to that). The character of Albert Finney (the father of Andy and Hank) is the most intriguing and, in my opinion, he deserved a little more time in front of the screen. Amy Ryan is also doing her job properly. <br /> <br /> BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU ARE DEAD, the film is not exceptional, but it proves that Lumet is still at the top of his game at the (apparent) twilight of an illustrious career. Many of its features and trademarks appear here, including the use of its characters. Infused with a killer script (no pun intended), intelligent dialogue, and decent cadence, before the devil realizes you're dead, it's a must. A jewel really underestimated. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should just enter my Top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.
