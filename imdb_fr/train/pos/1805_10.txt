I just saw this movie, I saw it for the first time at the age of 7 and I remembered the end. so I looked at it like 10 minutes ago, and (I may look like a baby since I'm 12, ah, ah), I started crying at the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was especially sad for Anne-Marie because she said, "I love you Charlie" and also, "I'm going to miss you, Charlie," it really made me cry ha ha ha. it must be one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a movie worth watching. LOOK IT ha ha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but, I love this movie, it's a real classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
