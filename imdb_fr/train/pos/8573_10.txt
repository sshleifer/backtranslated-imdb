In "101 Dalmatians", in 1996, Cruella De Vil was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police (God bless him) for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies - Dalmatians. Covered with mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in the "tin can". Four years later, she was unfortunately released from prison. I say, it's been around 28 years - in the dog years !!!!! <br /> <br /> So in 2000, Disney decided to release a sequel to the hit version of the classic live-action movie that is hereby nicknamed "102 Dalmatians". There is a 102nd Dalmatian added to the family (Oddball is the name, I think, I should know since it was shown on TV recently), and the puppy had no spots !!!!! Also, although Cruella (again interpreted by Glenn Close) escaped again, she wanted a bigger and better coat - again made from puppies !!!!! I'm sure everyone likes the song "Atomic Dog" from the 70's or so. And now, we hear a little in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is such a great film that I keep asking myself: WHEN WILL A "103 DALMATIENS?" ??? "LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
