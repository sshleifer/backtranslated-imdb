I'm a fan of TV movies in general and it was one of the good ones. The performances of the actors were quite strong and there were twists that I had not seen before each advertisement. For me, it was a bit like if Medium and CSI met. <br /> <br /> Did anyone else think that in some ways his daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in one way or another? I would certainly watch this movie for rent or rent it if it ever came to the video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was great. I did not see her in many things and she did her job very convincingly. <br /> <br /> If you like police movies on TV, watch this one if you have the opportunity.
