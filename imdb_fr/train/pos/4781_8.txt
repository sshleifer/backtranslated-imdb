MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He's a modern genius because he's not just a filmmaker. His stories and his style have a spell that crosses the screen. Thus, THE STRAIGHT STORY was a surprise for me, with its easy-to-follow storyline and sunny scenery. Still, Lynch is there and, even if he is far from his best, it is a film not to be missed. The performance of the late Richard Farnsworth is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
