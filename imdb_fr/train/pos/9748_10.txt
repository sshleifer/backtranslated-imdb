I saw this film when it was released when I was 17 years old and I started in classical rock ... <br /> <br /> I had never liked the opera before because I hate the soprano voice, but it changed everything. He was adorable in the movie and had an incredible voice. <br /> <br /> On CNN, I heard that he died tonight at home from pancreatic cancer. We will miss him. He definitely left his mark on this world. <br /> <br /> I hope to buy this movie if I can find it, watch and enjoy. * smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and have a look before it runs out.
