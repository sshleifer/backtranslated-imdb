This is the best dub I've ever heard of Disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever recorded on soundtrack, themes, characters and dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This one has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation of the common heroine. This one has the hero and the heroine (although I do not really support the use of the hero and the heroine here, since Miyazaki came out of the stereotype and the common theme). As usual, after being introduced by Spirited away, amazed by Mononoke, troubled by Grave of Fireflies and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin, this one begins with a little doubt on my part. You wonder if this will be the first failure of Ghibi. Well, in the end, just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving 10 points. I would give a score of 9.8, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER I see this as a sad film, people die in this one, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and it ends in destruction. It's as if humanity can not really live with too much power. The falling scene gave me end-of-town spots. It's just sad somehow. The plot is apparent in most critics and the soundtrack rules too (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to the Uematsu, Kanno and Williams calibres. People who can give life to a movie, a game, an event, or even a moment of dizzying composition. <br /> <br /> It's a nice feeling. film that was part of American cinema in the classical era (it's a wonderful life, etc.). Well, things are changing ....
