The rating is only a 5 because it is a movie that could have used a better interpretation and direction (or at least music!). However, for Walt Whitman's accomplishments, he deserves a 10. A previous poster calls the cheesy movie, however, I think it's a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees. Filmmakers were apparently more interested in the release of the story than in a Hollywood feature film. And for that, I applaud them - the fact that it's non-current also reflects Whitman's life. This film is more documentary than for acting. To be fascinated by a story like this, when you rarely hear about these stories that shape mental health today, is the most important thing. I found the story very pleasant.
