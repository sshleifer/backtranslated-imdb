I found this movie very funny, I loved the way he was doing politics of modern sports. This movie is not as funny as South Park but it's pretty funny. And since I'm a sports fan, I love how they made fun of some of the most ridiculous things in the sport. This film is also suitable for non-sports fans, probably better because they have to live all their lives wondering why people follow the sport so tightly when there are so many insane rules and subtleties in the sport and that it means absolutely nothing. I also found the game they created interesting, it's a bit like a horse with bases and outs psyche (for the shooter). Overall, I strongly recommend you to watch this movie and believe that you will end up loving this movie. However, if this style of comedy is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (but it's with any humor movie)
