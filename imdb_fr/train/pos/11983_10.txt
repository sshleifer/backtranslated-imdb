This show has a beautiful story! It is very believable! A man's wife dies and he can not take care of his children alone, so he calls his brother-in-law his best friend and many more come later in the series. Like Rebeecca Donaldson, the adorable but powerful dog Comet, Nikki and Alex, whom you can discover for yourself (I do not want to spoil it for you) and to force Kimmy Gibler! (The DJ's boyfriend) but the kids are wonderful too. It's Mary Kate and Ashley have taken off! And also, you may know Candace Cameron Bure from shows like St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and it's really a raven! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph, the middle child who likes to feel excluded. Really it's a very good show!
