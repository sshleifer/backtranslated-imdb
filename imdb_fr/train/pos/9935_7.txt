My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP} My-my-my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Reading} <br /> <br /> I've never seen a director take as much flack for his style before. Now, it's obvious that most people do not like Tony Scott's unstable, flashy and dizzying editing technique. If I have to choose between loving and hating him, I would say that I love him. It was sometimes embarrassing, but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a creative director with his style and a certain originality (even if he borrow a lot from MTV videos). <br /> <br /> This stylistic trend is evident when Keira Knightley plays the role of bold bounty hunter Domass Harvey and even his dialogue seems strangely chopped. Otherwise, she plays it badly because I hated her character and did not sympathize with her at all, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino throughout her life as she joins fellow bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew gets tangled up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality TV deal with Christopher Walken's TV production company (by the way, what's he doing in each movie?). I guess it's a smart movie technique because Tony Scott is now free to use as many flashy editing sequences as he likes. It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture at this stage. <br /> <br /> It follows that the story is told at an astonishing speed, with a lot of strong language and armed violence. There are funny jokes; everything is both modern and surreal. It's a mess, but it's a pretty nice mess. It is ultimately flawed in many ways (actors try too hard to make their characters "cool", for example) but it works. I give it a weak 7/10 that may seem generous compared to the general consensus of moviegoers who have classified this film ?? but I think he had some good ideas and he did it well. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
