Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) is broken, her lover misses her; she is not able to overcome her love for him, lost in the past. She hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives her a list of her mistakes with solutions. But time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for pain is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first thing that impresses in "The Cure" is the elegant cinematography that alternates black and white with color. The concise and precise scenario is capable of developing a tragic and dark love story with an unexpected intrigue in the end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a bit strong and linked to the fact that English is not my first language, it took me at times to repeat a few words whispered by the narrator. The unknown lead actress has a magnificent performance and is extremely beautiful. I hope I have the opportunity to see her on screen again. Last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
