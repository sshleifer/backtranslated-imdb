I rented that a few years ago, the video store only had VHS at the time. In video, things were going well (you know, the covers of the box use the same font and the same color scheme as the blockbuster movies). The first thing I thought about watching was "what's wrong with the sound?" - Obviously, there was no dubbing dialogue. The words rang out, so I stopped nibbling everything that came to hand - there is no Shakespeare here, just a simple conversation. The story is quite simple, boy meets girl, etc. What seemed funny and sincere to me was that the characters in the movie did not seem to be caricatures written in the story, but rather non-actors temporarily removed from their real jobs (uniforms). included). All the while, you start to feel what the filmmaker wants, then you see that there is no attempt at cheap humor if they had a larger budget, it was better, what I am sure they took it into account every day, but they took the lead and that's what was done. "Indy", is launched as if it was a genre..Ha! .. it's funny!
