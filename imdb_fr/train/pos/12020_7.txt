The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn, an outlaw doing a long sentence to free himself from a gang. He and his friends are heading to the Mexican border since their prison and their security. No, they do not because Coburn has a mission of revenge. Kill the peace officer who brought him and, in so doing, killed his wife. <br /> <br /> This peace officer is Charlton Heston, who is now retired and who knows what Coburn wants. As he explains to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn locked himself in a cabin and was involved in a Waco impasse. His Indian wife was killed in the rain of bullets fired. It's not something he's proud of, he's an indirect victim in a manhunt. <br /> <br /> Lest we feel sorry for Coburn, he lets us know what a nasty man he really is. Heston is his usual hero, but the honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He turns off all the others when he is on. <br /> <br /> Coburn has the brilliant idea of ​​making sure Heston traps him by kidnapping Hershey and taking him to an Indian reserve where the white authorities can not touch him. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then. <br /> <br /> Coburn's band includes Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum who is his son-in-law. <br /> <br /> The Last Hard Men is a nasty and brutal Westerner. Andrew McLaglen directed it and I think it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. This shows its influence on the liberal use of idling to accentuate violence. Which there are many. <br /> <br /> For a bit of Peckinpaugh Lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
