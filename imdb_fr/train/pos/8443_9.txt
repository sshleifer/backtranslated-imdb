My favorite crime series of all time is a TV movie. Does it work? Yes. Gee runs for the mayor and gets shot. The "pantheon of homicide" has arrived. Pembleton and almost all the cops who have already played in this series. Many flashbacks help those who have not seen the TV series, but who also entertain fans. The last five minutes solve another murder and in the end, even two of the dead policemen show up. And a brief appearance of my favorite coroner, Juliana Cox. It's a good movie.
