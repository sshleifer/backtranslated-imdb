"Ardh Satya" is one of the best films ever made in Indian cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this film is the most successful of the parallel films, which has also been a commercial success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration to all major Indian directors. <br /> <br /> The film tells the real-life scenario of the Mumbai police in the 1970s. Unlike the police in other cities in India, the Mumbai police have a totally different system. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical expense with a concrete approach to the police environment of Mumbai. <br /> <br /> Among various police officers and colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young policeman with hot blood from a poor family country. His father is a tough police officer. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies and his father's atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach to immediate action against crime is an inert desire for his own job satisfaction. The film is shot in a scenario where Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his elders. This leads to frustrations because he can not get the desired job satisfaction. Because of his frustration, his anger is expressed by excessive violence in the remand rooms and bars, also turning him into an alcoholic. <br /> <br /> The spirit in him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He knows the subway system, where police and politicians are inertly associated from a distance. His commitment to unethical practice is negative. Finally, he is suspended. <br /> <br /> Management is a centerpiece and a hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand burst into the house of Underworld gangster, Rama Shetty, to stop him, followed by a brief conversation, which is fantastic. On many scenes, the film has ruffled moments. <br /> <br /> The practical approach of the script is a real punch. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, disappointment are all part of the Mumbai police, even today. These aspects are treated brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film belongs to One Man Show, Om Puri, who represents Anand Velankar and brilliantly crosses all his emotions.
