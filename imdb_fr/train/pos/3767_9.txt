Return to page ten of this review section and go back up. Go forward; I will wait. <br /> <br /> Done? Well, then you probably noticed the same trend as me. You could nibble all day about lame jokes, timing and plot and shtick points obviously derived from 'Bogus', but this movie seems to be one of those who hate me now, loves me later. <br /> <The biggest problem with Bill and Ted was that the original attracted children in the '80s who followed trends and considered themselves at the cutting edge of fashion, which worked well for the original, but was bombed in 1991, when no loafer would get caught dead wearing anything but flannel or admitting he liked anything from the 80s. As Ted would say, "Dude, it's a hole You want to play 20 questions? "<br /> <br /> They say that nostalgia takes place every 20 years, and that seems to be the case here. Here in 2010, those who grew up with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth start looking back to enjoy some of those pivotal movies that (whether we like it or not) have created us. If you are one of those who look at Bogus as if it were an old-fashioned scam ("Fa gs!"), Then you miss the point and have probably spent six years cultivating hair on the face, to wear the flannel and make you feel like you're out of bed. <br /> <br /> Referring to his own origins (the episode of Star Trek "and traveling with a phone booth), B & T does not hide the love of its creators for tributes Quentin Tarantino, I do not say that "Bogus" is "True Love", but I think it must be appreciated for what it is: a fun clich√© of our society in an era prior to the psychology of the world. children, Ritalin, antitobacco ads, terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of media terror. <br /> <br /> So, for all B & T's enemies, turn off your Screaming Trees CD, get those hair out of your face, go to the beach and illuminate yourself.Narcissistic depression and intellectual boredom are so corporate.
