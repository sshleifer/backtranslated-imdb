I totally agree that "Nothing" is a fantastic movie! I have not laughed so much at watching a movie for ages! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic! they work really well together! This film may not please some people (I can not say why without spoiling!), But in turn! I loved it and highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The staging is excellent and some of the shots are very clever. Looks like they may have had a lot of fun filming them! <br /> <br /> Although there are really only two main characters in the film and there are not a lot of props, the actors manage to remove it and make the film enjoyable watch.
