"The Odd Couple" is one of those films that far surpasses its reputation. People all know it, they hum the theme, they complain about living with a sloppy "Oscar" or a tedious "Felix" ... but they sell the film without knowing it. It's not just about a good guy who lives with a neglected guy; it is the portrait of two friends who help each other in the agony of divorce. It's as funny as it is from start to finish, but it's the kind of comedy that comes out of realistic, stressful and simply awful situations. Thus, some viewers found the film a bit uncomfortable, but I think its likelihood is its strength. In addition, the face of bulldog Matthau makes me crack! My favorite comedy, by thousand of countries.
