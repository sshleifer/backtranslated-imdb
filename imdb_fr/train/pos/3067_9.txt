What a surprising treat on late television. If I had only read a short story on a television list before seeing the movie, I would have succeeded. The idea of ​​a film about a successful man, who sees, who shrinks, who wants to leave the company and who falls in love, seems banal. But the movie works. From the beginning of the film, it is clear that the man carries a weight on his shoulders, even before he says a word. The look and feel of the film are perfect. dark, but not odiously. <br /> <br /> Apart from the family aspect of the hit-man, which brings a touch of surrealism, the character of Macy struggles with his marriage and control of his father. Macy shows repressed sadness and her bedtime conversations with her young son are astonishing. The boy shows acting skills well beyond his age and the interaction between father and son is so natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. and I can not believe I accidentally discovered it on TV late at night.
