Everyone should see this movie because each of us is broken in one way or another and this can help us understand 1) My life is not as bad as I thought and 2) The importance of to adopt a child in need. There are so many outside. To think that the film was really based on a real person made us think of life in depth and how the world has been and always will be. Corrupted, but this corruption must not reach your house. We all have a choice! I highly recommend this one ... and while you're there, I'd like to add "The Color Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life.
