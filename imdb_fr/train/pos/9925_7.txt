When I rented Domino, I expected it to be very silly. I hate films whose editing and cinematography are really showy and Domino has also received very bad reviews. The only reason I looked at it is that I like having loved Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott on other occasions. I also enjoy just adventure stories based on facts. Yes, editing and cinematography were frenzied, the story was weak and the acting was mediocre, but I still loved it for a strange reason. Domino was very, very entertaining and often very entertaining. I think it was horribly misunderstood when it was released because everyone wanted to live a more emotional journey than Scotts' latest film, Man on Fire, instead of receiving wonderful entertainment. I actually understand why everyone hated Domino so much, even though I loved and recommended him.
