"It was not me, it was my twin brother Rupert!" Bobby tells Dugan to be confronted with being at Sally's. I've used this line dozens of times over the years (no one has to believe it yet). <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best of all time for pure pleasure and disbelief. Steven Oliver was perfect for Dugan's role, so much so that he was in "Malibu Beach" in 1978 as the same character (but not so much time on the screen, though). <br /> <br /> "No one says Dugan is a shit!" is another line for ages. This classic movie was really worth the price of entry.
