seriously, I loved this movie..I was starting to read the book and I loved it ... the way everything was organized and everything had a purpose ... I think this film worked so well because Louis Sachar write the script. .and of course, Andrew Davis realized it ... Shia Lebouf gives an excellent performance for his first film ... the screenplay is very cool and interesting ... there is humor, heart and soul intensity ... it looks a lot like the book .. I find that this film is not at all boring ... I absolutely loved it ... and I encourage all those who read it to read..the everything in this film is very well mounted and carefully designed ... two congratulations for me in every way
