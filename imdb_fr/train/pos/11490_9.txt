I watched this film many years ago and have been looking for it since, in my opinion, even if it is very raw, it is very informative about the future, I enjoyed the film and at this day, I rate it very high sorry for all those who do not agree but a film should always be judged as belonging to everyone and, in my opinion, as an excellent test with all cloning babies and test tube that happen today and that should allow us to judge this film, this may be a dramatized event to become but there you go. All the horrors of today are so far, even though I laughed, but that's what makes me think and it scares me as a mother. If I was desperate, after watching this movie, I would think twice sorry, but I like the movie and make up your own mind. Do not watch the movie, just acknowledge the story and ask yourself how far would you go for a child?
