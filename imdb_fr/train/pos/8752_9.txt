I have been waiting for some time already for such an original image. Brokedown Palace has this aspect "hard to believe", however, with ingenious direction and scenario, ?? <br /> <br /> I never really liked watching Claire Danes in any of her films, but I'll tell you what, she really changed her mind with this one. Kate Beckinsale joins the Danes on holiday in Thailand where they meet a young man who convinces them to take a trip to Hong Kong with him. However, he neglected to inform them that they would carry an obscene amount of narcotics for him. In the end, they get caught and end up in a prison in Thailand. I know, I know, how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can get away with it, you will find a very well written and played story. Recently, I found myself immersed in the intrigues of the movies I watch and develop a personal feeling for the characters I watch. This film is no different. At the end of the movie, I felt more interested in her than all the other characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays the role of Hank Green, a lawyer resident in Thailand and specialized in international relations. As always, Pullman delivers an excellent performance and beautifully links the film. <br /> <br /> There are some twists that will make you cry at the end of the film. This is one of those movies that you probably used to search for this movie to watch at home. In my opinion, during the next visit to the video store, do not leave this one.
