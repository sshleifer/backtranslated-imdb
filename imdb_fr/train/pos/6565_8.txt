I know the snobs of the movie sniff. But if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride in the jungle of movie B, try "Jake Speed". <br /> <br /> A little thin sometimes, but its one-liners and location are more than makeup artists for that. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to be enjoying himself as an ultra-devilish white slave. The nemesis of Crawfords, Jake Speed. He adds a dimension to the film that only a professional like Hurt could provide. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes's buddy) are a good team, even if they wonder why they both win. However, together, Crawford and Christopher represent such a fun team that if you can rely on yourself. For a moment, you can end up playing like a child in situations and the inherent suspense they provide. The delicious Karen Kopins does an excellent job as a damsel in distress who cares more about the motivations of her savior than her executioner. <br /> <br /> I have not yet found such a fun movie without being preached, or bogged down by trying too hard. All movies do not have to be the last "Citizen Kane". And believe me, Wells was an original. So remember that sometimes the movies are for fun. No social commentary or attempt to politically influence the public. But just for the pure pleasure of living and living at a time when our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
