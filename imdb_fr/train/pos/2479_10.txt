(Sorry for my faulty language, I'm not a native speaker ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a film that almost requires an overwhelming reaction. Personally, I agree on all the superlatives that exist. But I will not use this rather semi-empty way of describing the film here myself. Because these "perfect! The one and only! Best-ever!" - comments make some people turn away (including me). <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for another "Hamlet" that has the potential to compete with a lot of theatrics and all cutscenes - so do not miss this one, if you find it anywhere. (Unfortunately, not many people will have the chance to see it, there seems to be no DVD, and the German version - which is rather well done - is not available in any format.) <br /> <br /> Just in case you decide to get a copy: Save this shortened version of two hours (or more) of this movie. It is useless, is not fun and gives a false impression of a film that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture. And its size also reduces to 4: 3. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
