This film deeply moved me in many ways. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious little thing! Such a pretty little girl. His game was superb too. Faithful to life and very human. Although I do not like the part where she had to smoke; I hope it was just a fake accessory. Anyway, she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving. I found myself immersed in the story and its character. <br /> <br /> It's pretty interesting to see how I discovered this movie. I was walking in the blockbuster and I noticed his pretty smile on the cover as I passed by. Fortunately, I took a look in the direction where this movie was! I thought, 'Awe, look at her!' So I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as a wonderful thing like "A little gem". I read the plot on the back and then thought, well, maybe I'll watch it first on IMDb, then I'll come back and rent it later. I'm glad I did not do it because I certainly would have missed my chance. After looking for a movie with my friend, I knew I would regret not having rented this movie. So I went back to the place where I found it and took a picture of it. <br /> <br /> It's been a week since I started working on my dresser, since the school started for me this week and I really did not have the time to watch it, but tonight was the opportunity ideal. I jumped in and stuck to the beautiful cinematography, the beautiful score and the touching intrigue from beginning to end. I was so captivated and have to say that some parts almost moved me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would also like to make a special mention for the young boy of this movie, Juan Jose Ballesta. He was remarkable. Also the actor who played Carol's father, whose name is unfortunately not listed on the site. Her voice was so loving and sweet that I could really feel her love for Carol. Although his appearance is not visible, I really felt the presence of his character. <br /> <br /> It's really a beautiful movie. If you are a person who is moved by the light, but by emotional films, then it is definitely for you.
