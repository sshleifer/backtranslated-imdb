I saw the last half of this movie about a year ago and I was very happy to finally find it available on DVD. Recently, I watched several reality shows on PBS about ranching and so on. None of them has nearly told this story as much as this movie. Based on REAL reality, not fists, dark, happy, tragic and enlightening, this film should be shown to students or anyone interested in the youth of life at the border. Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell are doing well by adding a well done script. The opening credit indicates that this has been done with funds provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities. If it's the kind of product tax we could get, I'd be happy to see more. I highly recommend it and encourage people to talk to a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the movie.
