it was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only problem I had with that was that I did not like Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and made Jane look so timid. in the book, Jane seemed to be a much stronger character. I was really bored by this portrait of her. the part where Rochester asks him to marry her the next morning and she runs to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. I think they made a bad choice by flowing it. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre worthy of interest. Another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of the movie. I know it was made in the eighties for television. if it had been a feature film, and of better quality, it would have been perfect. My main complaint, however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
