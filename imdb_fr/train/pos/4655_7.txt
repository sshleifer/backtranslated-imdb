Peter Ustinov plays a hijacker who gets out of jail at the beginning of the film. As soon as he walks through the doors, he immediately starts working on a ploy to replenish his burden by flying, although this time he's staring at him. This is actually one of the weak points of the film, because it apparently knows nothing about computers (few people did it in 1968) but manages to become a computer genius literally overnight! Yes indeed. Anyway, he proposes a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and get a job in a big American company to divert a ton of money. Considering that his knowledge of computers is rudimentary, it is amazing to see how he implements a brilliant plan AND manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses. But, it's a movie after all, so I was able to suspend disbelief. At the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) are able to save themselves with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> In the end, it gets very very confusing and Smith announces she has managed to accumulate more than two million dollars by investing wisely in the companies created by Ustinov (although she did not realize that they were all fake societies). This should mean that these actions she bought were ultimately worthless. What they seem to imply (and I suppose it is false) is that Usinov and his new partners quickly cashed the shares before this became known and the shares would then become worthless. Anyway, the movie seems to have a magical ending: no one can be hurt and everyone is happy - and that just does not make sense. It's a shame, because the acting and most of the writings have been great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just fantastic. <br /> <br /> If I seem to have interpreted the end, let me know, because the movie seemed very vague in the details at the end.
