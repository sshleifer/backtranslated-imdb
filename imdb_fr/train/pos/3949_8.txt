Like many people on this site, I only saw this film once, when it was first televised in 1971. Some scenes remain etched in my memory and a general feeling of worry is the way which I remember touching him. I would be fascinated to see him again, if he was ever available for the personal video. <br /> <br /> Spoiler possible: I wonder if anyone else would accept that the basic configuration of the plot and the characters could have been derived from a 1960s British film, entitled City of the Dead, retires Horror Hotel for the US release? Some similarities also exist with a newer British film, The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> It remains a detail that remains to me years after having seen the film. It's a small but significant moment towards the beginning of the film. If I remember correctly, a minister and his wife stopped to help some people by the side of the road, around 1870, somewhere in the west. Ray Milland introduces himself with his (his daughter?), Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young mute woman. While the preacher is helping Ray Milland with the wagon, a rattlesnake slips into view and winds up in a threatening manner, not observed by any of the characters except Yvette Mimieux. She does not look scared at all, but looks at the snake with silent concentration until it goes away. With this strange little moment, we already realize that these seemingly normal people have something very unusual, even though the possible danger for the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time. <br /> <br /> This little scene stays with me in a vivid way after all these years, with many others. The film has a haunting quality that does not give up and it is not surprising that people remember it so well. Someone should make this available for home video!
