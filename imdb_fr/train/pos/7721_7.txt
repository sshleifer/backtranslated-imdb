A flying saucer piloted (literally) by a crew of about 20 space explorers traveled hundreds of millions of light-years from Earth to a colony founded about 25 years ago on a planet. forbidden planet ". What they discover is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially incompetent young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of ancient civilization in which he immersed himself. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this story is a mystery murder scifi. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but this is an extension and, in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. Stripped of what makes it a scifi movie, of course, is The Storm, but how many hundreds of movies can you say something similar? <br /> <br /> Below is an edifying account of progress and technology, as well as the social evolution necessary for its proper and safe use. Still, the film continues to work with all the hope for our future as we expect shows like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason why this movie is best described as beautiful. The special effects and even the aesthetics of the backgrounds are powerful enough to make the staging uninspired and the game uneven almost imperceptible. If it was not for the science fiction props of the 1950s, you might think you were watching a 1960s piece. <br /> <br /> This is a classic of this very particular subgenre. science-fiction I like to call the science fiction of the 1950s, and, although it is not, in my opinion, the best, it is certainly a must for anyone interested in sci-fi and special effects. The clever plot, made banal by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space and even Farscape, deserves to be studied and will support the interest of most scifi fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film that seem to have inspired the themes of the original Star Trek series aired about 12 years later, although they may be disappointed by the (relatively moderate) sexism of the 1950s and the absence of any type of film. racial integration. Although I do not want to master, the lack of social progress evident in this film was the main problem I encountered. <br /> <br /> Some will probably see this film just to see the young and beautiful Leslie Nielsen in one of his leading roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performances are only average and sometimes mediocre (especially at the peak of the film). Walter Pigeon, although excellent in other films, also plays his part. Mrs. Francis, Earl Holliman and the incredible Robby the Robot are the most outstanding actors in this crowd, though, overall, the character actors in the ensemble do a good job. I think that the problems with the performances presented are as much the fault of the director and the publisher as anything else. Although they have certainly obtained most of the film quite well.
