OK here is how I do that. I note movies on 10 components. Each component will start with 5 points. He can then lose or gain 5 points out of 10 or 0. <br /> <br /> Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points. There was a perfect balance of the five aspects. The action was fun and exciting. The novel was not exaggerated, but always very emotional and moving. I laughed a lot during the whole film and I remained captivated by the fantastic drama and the captivating suspense. <br /> <br /> Intrigue - I give this component 10 points. I thought all the good fairy tales had already been told. I found myself sitting in the theater, I came back in my childhood and, at that moment, I once again believed in unicorns, bad witches and shooting stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Cinema Photography - I give this component 8 points. Although the film captured the story very well in most angles, I found myself more than once trying to figure out what had happened right in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give 10 points to this component. I like that they used C.G.I. with parsimony. The epic scenes were credible. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. Overall, less is more, and all that is over! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names or experienced actors, the distribution was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully naughty, Charlie Cox gave life to Tristan, Claire Danes gave emotion to the stars and I will never look at Robert De Niro again in the same way. <br /> <br /> Interpretation - I give this component 10 points. Even novice actors have played their roles to perfection. Once again, I will never look at Robert De Niro again. <br /> <br /> Character Development - I give this component 9 points. It seemed a little rushed and I think that if the film had been a little longer, they could have done better justice to the characters. <br /> <br /> Dialogue - I give 10 points to this component. The dialogue was intelligent, witty, fun ?? even the porridge had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Score - I give 7 points to this component. Honestly, I only remember one piece of music from the whole movie. I do not complain beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable. <br /> <br /> End - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect end! I think that some aspects of the end should have been more pronounced, while others might have been more moderate, but no subject was left untied. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES! See at the theater? Certainly! Bottom Line: Excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I highly recommend seeing it at the theater, I know I'll be back for a few seconds!
