"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the most hilarious dialogues of recent memory. Watching this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us perhaps of another film that we had seen in the past, but as we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to discover What reminded us of the Italian movie "Big Deal on Madonna Street" of 1958, directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The Russo brothers have assembled a beautiful cast to represent all the characters in the film. Nothing with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, can not be bad. Since this is an ensemble piece, all characters have the opportunity to shine. <br /> <br /> The film presents a group of inanimate and safe crackers. Nobody could think that these men could do a job similar to the one they undertake. All that could go wrong, and more, is what they managed to do. George Clooney makes a small appearance as a master cracker who pretends to be a rabbi, but the band members who come out of Cossimo's funeral confuse him with a priest. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy The movie is to sit back and relax, and let all those little crooks do their thing. Let their funny lines make you laugh, because everyone can see that this gang is doomed from beginning to end!
