I saw this film at the 2007 Adelaide Film Festival and was intrigued for 106 minutes. I like documentaries, but I often find them 25 minutes from the end. Forbidden Lie $ however, fueled, never losing sight of my interest. <br /> <br /> The subject of the movie is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical story of sorts about one of her Muslim friends who was murdered by his family for having a relationship with a Christian man. A few years later, some journalists began digging holes in the story, suggesting to the public that it was a fraud. The film covers this quickly but thoroughly in the beginning, and from there we spend most of our time in the company of Norma who tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction. <br /> <br /> Director Anna Broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study, and she's conducting endless interviews with Khoury as she searches for the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears for her life, worried about violent reactions to the gloomy portrait of her new paintings of Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to return to Jordan and show us the facts. Broinowski, however, is not discouraged and slowly puts the pieces in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible look in the mind of a crook. Of course, what we find there is meaningless and extremely difficult to follow, and in the end we do not know whether to believe Norma or not. She is either an unjust woman trying to survive or a fantastic single. The web of lies, truths and half-truths she revealed in the film is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film uses a lot of interviews, as well as dramatizations to tell its story, and Broinowski uses these dramatizations to show us why people like Norma can exist: we want to be deceived. We go to the movies every day and allow ourselves to believe that what is happening on the screen is real. Maybe it was just me who read a little too much, it was not addressed in the question-and-answer session with Brionowski after the film, but that's what I got out of it. <br /> <br /> This is a great Australian film, and must receive an international release, and a rewards swag if you ask me. Certainly the best movie I saw at AFF07. <br /> <br /> Go see it, if you have the opportunity.
