It's an incredible movie with all the film in six or seven colors. When he was released more than 15 years ago, he amazed the audience with his color scheme so different from anything filmed before. These colors, at least for me, make it an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes that I wish I could freeze and convert somehow into painting to study for their works of art. <br /> <br /> The characters and the story do not match the size of the photograph, but they are all on top, especially the bad guys. The famous actors who played here must have a lot of fun on the board playing "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles", etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good like Dick Tracey and his girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and sweet as her name. Charlie Korsmo is another good addition to young offender Dick and Tess. The other colorful characters are performed by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you will be amazed. <br /> <br /> The only drawbacks I've found are Pacino's voice squeaking after a while, Madonna's voice and the fact that the movie was better dressed about 10 minutes. These "flaws" are all minor, because all in all, it's a fun movie .... a comic book that comes alive in an incredibly colorful way ... like you've never seen it before.
