I have never seen four hours go by as fast as when I saw this movie. This film gives Hamlet the power and art he was always supposed to have. Even these famous speeches are pronounced in a new and inventive way. And the cast is amazing, Brannagh the brightest star. It is his charisma, his power and his mastery of the role that defines the film. What makes it a complete and complete version fills so many gaps and allows a new appreciation of the tragedy despite its length. Where we wait for the dark and gloomy clich√© castle, we are treated like a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The only sadness comes from Hamlet himself, as it should be. It's worth your time, every four hours.
