Kurosawa, full of color, loses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing version of the slums of Tokyo. Kurosawa stretches out a style that, in my opinion, was his antithesis, that is to say, I have the impression that Kurosawa wants to create an Ozu image. Badly paced, poorly designed, this film is a rare misfire in this set of excellent work author. While worldly and depressing, Ikiru was always interesting and rhythmic, and while Stray Dog described the slums and social poverty of Japan without being too heavy or boring, the desu ka den has all the darkness that one could be happy with, without the redeeming qualities of Kurosawa's previous images. <br /> <br /> Be warned, this is not a film that should make Kurosawa judge.
