Let me just say that I am a big fan of zombies and I do not make statements like this lightly. Secondly, let me tell you that this is an Italian zombie movie and that Fulci only managed 15 minutes before handing over to Bruno (Rats, Night Of Terror) Mattei. They are not people from the Dawn of the Dead. <br /> <br /> That said, it's easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully horrible. Just consult the two scientists who are trying to find an antidote ("Let's try to combine these two molecules"). <br /> <br /> Zombies are all varieties. From moaning brewers to manic maniacs to birds! <br /> <br /> The gore is abundant. The legs are bitten, the arms amputated, the stomachs open. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast, from one zombie attack to another. <br /> <br /> Then there is the head in the refrigerator. Oh, my head in the fridge! One of the greatest horror moments since Ash got hold of Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You should already know if you are the kind of person who will like this kind of movie. Get some friends and beer and you'll have an entertaining evening. <br /> <br /> Did I mention the head in the fridge?!?!?
