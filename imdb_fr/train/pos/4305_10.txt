The Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. It is a very unique urban piece, where the story of the whole plot would fail. <br /> <br /> This is the central theme that seems to be the uncertainty inherent in the lives of people of all races, origins and resorts. But to proclaim that THE theme of the film would be to horribly underestimate its significance. Similarly, it is useless to classify it in a particular genre. <br /> <br /> The film has volumes to say, although probably different for each viewer, and says it so unpromising in so many angles In the end, I can not even define his message central to myself. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, he does business with such laser precision; each accessory, line of dialogue and background music bar contributing to his ubiquitous mood and his powerful message, I am pleasantly surprised and come back very thoughtful after each viewing. It still does not seem stuffy. A sparkling film with excellent distribution and everything works.
