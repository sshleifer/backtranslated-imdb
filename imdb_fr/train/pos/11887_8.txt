It is projected that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely of AIDS. The projected balance is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where an additional 55 million deaths can be expected. Beyond sinister statistics, there are personal stories that we rarely hear about. Christophe Honoré describes one of the most moving films of Close to Leo, a film produced for French television as part of a series devoted to the problems of young people. Although fictitious, it is a situation that is unfortunately all too common: the effect of an HIV diagnosis on a united and loving family. <br /> <br /> When Léo (Pierre Mignard), 21, his parents and his two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) he has AIDS, his family is devastated . Concerned about his youth, they decided not to disclose this information to his youngest brother, Marcel (Yannis Lespert), aged 12, but he heard the conversation and began sulking and acting erratically. When Leo goes to Paris to heal, he takes Marcel with him, but the boy confronts him and asks him to know the truth. Leo tells him that he is sick and that Marcel is sad but accepts. When he brings Marcel with old homosexual friends, the tension between them tends to surface, opening the way to a fascinating conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although the scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers make me feel uncomfortable, I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the brilliant performances of Lespert and Mignard tip the scales in his favor. Seeing the events unfold from the boy's point of view gives the film an authenticity that reminds me of the Quebec film Leolo and The 400 Blows by Truffaut. Unlike some American movies that revolve around the anguish of AIDS, Close to Leo states a harsh truth but does so in a tender and wonderfully real way.
