Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an ordinary man who feels that God is disrupting his life. God confronts him and shows Bruce the error of his manners. Of course, giving someone the powers of God could get worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always. Morgan Freeman is first class and seems to be at home, because God and distribution bring the plot together. The jokes are almost always targeted, though sometimes they are a little too much of Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the film actually described God, not only that, but also as a black man. I thought so very well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for example, others miss a little the objective but remain a good film. 6/7 of 10
