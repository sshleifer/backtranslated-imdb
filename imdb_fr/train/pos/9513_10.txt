Sam Mendes made this beautiful movie showing another father-son fellowship. The brilliant cast of stars with Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) did a great job. He was an actor again. He is a legend of the game-test. also acting from Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig.The cast is too beautiful.The plot is quite good.You will enjoy the film.A superb portrait of the gangster of the 1930s.Configured in the 1930s, it will surely remain remarkable As the zenith of all the gangster movies of that time. Soundtrack is a very good movie lover. A great movie in the whole showing what a father does to protect his son. Is underestimated for my taste. Fully deserved 10.
