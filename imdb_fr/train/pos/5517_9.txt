Che: The first part is a fascinating experience, which not only tells a very interesting story, but also tries to do something different with the genre "biopic". The second part is the excellent culmination of this experience. <br /> <br /> This film offers all the same attributes of the first film, extraordinary performances (especially Benicio del Toro) to the brilliant direction of Steven Soderbergh, not to mention his intention to break with the conventional rules of biopics. what I admire about Soderbergh's experiences ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and they do it most of the time. <br /> <br /> The last message of this film is perfect and includes everything we have. I was told about Che Guervara's life. The only failure I found on Che: the second part is that some parts seemed a bit out of place. <br /> <br /> In summary, I give Che: the second part a very enthusiastic recommendation because, like the first, it is a brave and fascinating experience iment that challenges the viewer and lets us think.
