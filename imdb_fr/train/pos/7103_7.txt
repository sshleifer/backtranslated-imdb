I was quite surprised by this movie. Even if their budget was obviously absent, you must be impressed by the fact that it took 7 years for this film to achieve it and that it is always good. The acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me. The only complaint I would make is that the end was really a little too abrupt for my taste. But hey, if your audience wants more than this movie was successful. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend to everyone in Hollywood to look for Antonella Ríos who is an excellent Spanish talent (something difficult to find now the bad novela on acting). Antonella Ríos is really a star on the rise.
