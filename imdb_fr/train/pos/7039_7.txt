War Inc. is a funny but strange movie. The actors are nice, the film is nice too, but I do not know how to describe the plot. I'll go into the plot later. This is a movie with strange casting choices. In addition to John Cusack as a hit-man, what we saw years ago at Blank Grosse Point that I liked. <br /> <br /> Here, Hilary Duff plays a Russian pop star, named Yonica Babyya, or something like that. His character is strange. There is a scene where she sticks a scorpion in her pants. And hits on Hauser (Cusack). There is a twist at the end involving both characters. It's logic. <br /> <br /> This is the only casting choice I go to. Because it's just strange. The whole movie is strange. But sometimes incredibly funny and I never got bored. Here we have some of the best actors. Excluding Miss Duff. She's not great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. You see what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is the story of a hitman named Hauser (Cusack). He is sent to a Middle Eastern city to hit a oilman named Omar Sheriif (not the actor). While trying to solve his personal problems, he must help the wedding of a popstar (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a journalist (played by Marisa Tomeii). However, there is one thing about the popstar. Hauser is disgusted by her. There is a scene where she sings a song for him and then he vomits. <br /> <br /> The turn at the end of the film reveals somehow the reason. The thing about the twist is that I saw it coming. But it does not matter. It's a strange comedy, fun and funny. I like most actors. So really, how could I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
