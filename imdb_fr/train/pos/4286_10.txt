I saw this film (its title in English is "Who's Singing Over There?") At the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival. It won accolades then ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It's awesome. Sublime, ridiculous, sad and extremely funny. The script is a work of art. It's been 19 years and I have seen a handful of comedies (or any other genre, for that matter) that can match its originality.
