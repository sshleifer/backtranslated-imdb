The fascist mistress Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, led by expert photographer Dean Cundy as if she was ten feet tall) intends to turn her top straight up. Complications ensue that defy this goal in the charming rock'n'roll Riff Randell (PJ Soles that illuminates the screen - she also has a hot body) who is an obsessive fan of the punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose big rimmed glasses and nerdy role can not hide her beautiful beauty) joins Riff to put an end to the so-called crisis of the rock'n'roll slaughter which is the desired mission from Togar. <Br /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has a hilarious role as Tom Roberts, a success in all areas, but is discreet. Kate is crazy about Tom ... If only he could get his head out of the sand and see it. Clint Howard steals the film almost (honestly, who can steal this movie from Soles?) As Eaglebauer, "the supplier", who can almost offer everything to everyone. His office is located in the boy's bathroom! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff when he enjoys a THE RAMONES concert. <br /> <br /> A high school frenzy that defies all the rules of normalcy ... and I loved it. It's like someone just saying, "Let's have a fun life for an hour and a half." The film is really anarchy ... a chaos without intrigue fondly adoring THE RAMONES with all his heart (even if they are horrible actors, they have the opportunity to win new audiences with this film). <br /> <br /> This conclusion sums up pretty well the film as a whole. Riff and his classmates take charge of high school and a big party begins. To be honest, I did not want the party to end! Not at all conventional, this film drops a frenzy. Accompanied by an excellent rock soundtrack featuring some of the best songs from THE RAMONES, this film allows the viewer to accept a moment in life when the war was not in the headlines and people were having a good time . Those, I guess were the days.
