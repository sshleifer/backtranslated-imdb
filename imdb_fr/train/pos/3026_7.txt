Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish and he came to London to buy charcoal in "Confidential Agent", a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone wants to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he is accused of murder, but he is determined to get coal for his people so he can fight the fascists. <br /> <br /> This film has its advantages and disadvantages. It gives a high rating for atmosphere and suspense, and it is very entertaining. Bacall is incredibly handsome, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is naughty, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix suitably pathetic and Seymour is incredibly wonderful. <br /> <br /> Negatives: Bacall is supposed to be English and Boyer Spanish. . Uh no. Boyer is terrific in his role even with the bad accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not of the British upper class. Both do not have chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is a little miscast. His game is not up to par; she is better in other films. But it's a woman with an amazing look, and many things can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost over the spot and is obnoxious. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire movie as a hotel guest who studies human nature. It's a good part and its performance is perfect, while the direction of the other actors is not so good. It was definitely a case without small parts, but only small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> To see, even with its faults.
