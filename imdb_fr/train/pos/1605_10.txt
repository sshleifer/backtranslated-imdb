"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies of all time. I own this movie on DVD! The film is about a widow from New York (Cher) who falls in love with the angry brother of her boyfriend (Danny Aiello) (Nicholas Cage) who works in a bakery. I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for this movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are very good too. The management of Norman Jewison (who directed "Fiddler On The Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie that everyone can see and laugh. A must see! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
