I lived at that time and I think the program touched the heart of the time. I think that should have been more about the African-American issue, but I think that covers a lot in the program. It was frightening to watch the riots on T V hoping they would not go as far as your family's home and that it would not be burned. I thought Jerry O'Connell had done a great job in describing a veterinarian returning from the war. I went to school with guys who came back. Some had changed more than others and others less. It bothers me when someone comments that a topic was not sufficiently covered or that it was not entertaining enough. Live it and then make comments. I thought the movie was good and everyone was doing a great job. Thank you for a trip (sad and good) in the past.
