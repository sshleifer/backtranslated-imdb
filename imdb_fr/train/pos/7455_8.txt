Goldeneye will always remain one of the most legendary games in VG's history. Their no doubt about it. But this game, although very different, could very well be the champion of the bonds of our time. <br /> <br /> It was not a bond game based on material from another medium. It was completely new. scripted game. Who even had his own theme song! (It would not be a link without that, haha!) The gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of links games or movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Unlike most games, these cast members represented their characters themselves, as opposed to fictitious creations for the game. This gives it that cinematic feel. With a very captivating plot, you have the feeling of being in the game as much as losing yourself in a movie. <br /> <br /> A pleasure in all aspects, from beginning to end. Even after defeating the match, there is still much to be done. With the ranking system and goals to unlock, as well as its multi-player missions, it's a remarkable game. Despite being old enough now, in the years of video games. It's always a good game you can play when you feel the need to create a little more Bond in your life. Even now, just thinking about it, I have the theme song in mind. Such a scenario and a well written scenario. <br /> <br /> The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were in front of you, and is just as entertaining as the game itself. Superbly done, the way of the real ones. Which can only be called awesome, completely awesome. <br /> <br /> I have to go now. If you have not played it yet, you will miss it!
