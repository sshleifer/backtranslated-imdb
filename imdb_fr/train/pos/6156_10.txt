This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then on 21/11/01, I saw the 30th year of this movie DVD. WOW, I remembered why I loved this movie. The DVD is so great, it has 30 minutes more than the original did not have. I did not know it when I started to look. The movie has done a lot more since. The music they cut should have been left behind. You did not see this movie until you saw the full 131 min version. Many people say that music is forgotten. I remember every song in this movie by heart, each song has its own charm and looks like a hole. I remember when I was younger, I had the song "Eglantine" stuck in my head for days. As well as "Briny Sea" (this song was meant to marry poppens but was cut from the movie) Please Please watch the new 30th aniversy movie uncut and vote again for this movie. the 10 he is really.
