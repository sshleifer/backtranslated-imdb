Chuck Jones' "Hare Conditioned" is a fast-paced and often hilarious cartoon. Pitting Bunny bugs against a strange yellow-skinned apartment store manager who wants him stuffed. Hare Conditioned takes full advantage of its versatile framework. The lawsuit leads Bugs and his pursuer into various departments, which leads them to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing the clothes associated with that part of the store. This big gag is however dominated by a sequence really inspired by lifts in which Bugs, disguised as an elevator, encourages the manager of the store to go up and down relentlessly to the lifts at the wrong time. This is a brilliant and decisive piece that unfortunately leaves room for a last gag not very funny. At that time, however, "Hare Conditioned" became one of the great hunting movies, bursting with wild energy. While Bugs became more and more refined in some of the cartoons of this period, "Hare Conditioned" showed that he could still be as attractive as a more anarchic character.
