I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult film without jargon, without sex and without violence. You might think it's "the ultimate girls movie," but I bet there are one or two bright men who like it too. Do not invite children, though. This film is very discreet. <br /> <br /> See "April enchanted" is a very soothing experience. The soundtrack and the magnificent landscapes, as well as the gentle manners of the ladies, evoke the peace and beauty of a Pre-Raphaelite painting. <br /> <br /> I'll paraphrase a phrase I once heard in "Saturday Night Live" and say that my two favorite movies are "The Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April".
