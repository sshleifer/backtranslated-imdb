The only reason I give 8/10 stars to this movie, and not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is awful and 2) the love interest of Kelly's character leaves a lot to be desired (IMHO). Do you like that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is the little boy. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I have ever seen. Tom and Jerry are always my favorites and those of my daughter. I am 28 years old and she is 4 years old. Although the character is less emblematic than Mickey, he is still the favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly is as always captivating, her eyes full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. It's no wonder that Paula Abdul has "sampled" Kelly's movements. I would also mention Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the twentieth century. If you only watched part of it, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
