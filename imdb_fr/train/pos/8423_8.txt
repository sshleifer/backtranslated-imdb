Thats My Bush is above all a very entertaining show of Parker and Stone, I thought. It's often very funny, and it's quite subversive and crazy. South Park fans would surely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the value of production here. We had to invest a lot of money in this project, and it shows. Many small, expensive details. It's not a small show. And Comedy Central is not an extremely rich channel, but they have obviously invested a lot in this show. In a way, I understand that it was also the end of the series, way too expensive. It surely could have been cheaper and going on the will was there. <br /> <br /> Critics liked it, and its small fan base seduced, but it failed to win a large audience. As we know, the series stopped after 8 episodes, which corresponds to almost a season. <br /> <br /> As I really liked the show, it has its faults. The problem with the series is that he does not really know what he wants to be. It's like she's trying to be a sitcom AND a parody of a sitcom at the same time. The actors do a good job, and some of them are well melted, but in my opinion, they do not always seem to receive 100% the odd humor they are supposed to present. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the show needs more down-to-earth characters for the show to work. In South Park, you have Kyle and Stan, who are a kind of realistic touch in the looney universe. I think that's a bit of what makes South Park work. You need healthy characters that you can relate to realistically, making crazy things even more interesting because it requires you to take them seriously on a certain level. If everything is archetypes and stereotypes, it's hard to get emotionally included in the series, which is really the biggest problem of Thats My Bush. Kyle and Stan are characters from South Park who give meaning to the madness of the series. We have nothing like it here, and this series suffers. <br /> <br /> Another anchor is Parker and Stones flirting with the Republicans. It's the only thing about them, I do not really understand what they're trying to do. Not portraying Bush as an adorable and sympathetic character of Homer Simpsons IS rather subversive in a world where many people can not stand him and think he is the worst president since Nixon, and the world of the parallel comedy of Letterman and so on that just satirizes his every move ... but it's hard to understand if Parker and Stone really want to say anything. It's as if the joke was on us, but one way or another, it did not hit. It sounds odd, because it does not remind you of the real Bush at all. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found the show very pleasant. Some of the jokes here are hilarious. The pro-life supporter who was a surviving aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes by them in all series. And the show is packed with a lot of material, and is sometimes incredibly funny if you use your head a bit by looking at it.
