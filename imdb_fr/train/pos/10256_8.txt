The first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as a snuff film discovered by the producers and installed as an amateur camcorder tape, with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. He presents a woman kidnapped by a gang of men dressed in black who tortured her for several days before finally killing her. The unfortunate victim is savagely beaten and beaten with raw meat before being scratched with nippers, his hand is broken with a hammer, his eye is pierced with a needle, and so on. <br /> <br /> scene, the woman's captors burn her with hot water and lay live worms in the burns. The series received a lot of publicity when the American actor Charlie Sheen, considering that the series contained a real murder, tried to prohibit its diffusion in the United States. An FBI investigation found that the movies were just what they seemed to be for most viewers - sick recreations using vicious but obvious special effects. Directed horribly by the famous Japanese cartoonist Hideshi Hino, who also made the third and fourth episodes, this film is a sure way to clean all the pieces, except the most tolerant. But greyhounds will probably not find anything special.
