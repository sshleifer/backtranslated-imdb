It's a beautiful story of obsession inspired by guilt. <br /> <br /> Matiss, on an isolated night walk in Riga (?), walks past a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He passes without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a call for help encourages him to act. And while too little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film tells about her efforts to find out more about the woman. On a troll of local bars, he finds his wallet. He shares more and more of his life together. His "look" changes as his obsession grows. He must do things well. In a wonderfully filmed dialogue with "the bastard ex-boyfriend", he forces Alexej to face the guilt felt by both of them. <br /> <br /> A long captivating band, a rough soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, dogs that bark. Footprint. Beautiful black film with a beautiful twist. A good independent end.
