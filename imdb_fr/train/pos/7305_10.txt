In 1978, a phenomenon began. The release of John Carpenter's "Halloween" has prompted people to line up around the block to see the evil that is Michael Meyers. The critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated and is considered one of the greatest movies in cinematographic history. <br /> <br /> The scenario: 15 years after the murder, four friends (all females) babysit (and have it with their boyfriend) on Halloween night. After escaping from the hospital the previous night, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to track down these people. He murders 3 of them in silence and subtlety. He does not speak. He walks slowly. He is hiding .... <br /> <br /> Only one of the friends escapes, having been saved by Dr. Loomis (the pursuer and Michael's doctor) <br /> <br /> There is a reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he's killing and he's scary. These are the only reasons we are afraid. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter wrote the film and realized it. It creates an unbearable tension throughout the story and is so scary that sometimes we can not watch. And the climax is really striking. <br /> <br /> As a horror, it's essential. It's terrifying and well done. It's also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human. An undeniable strength. <br /> <br /> The suites have focused too much on Michael and his "story". This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. That may be why this thing is a masterpiece.
