The weather was not soft with this film. Once a controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, this film now looks like a mere mainstream version of your typical spookfest. Macabre touches aside (especially this crazy on the end), it's basically a glossy horror movie for those who do not care much about the genre. There is an extraordinary cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Meredith Burgess, Christopher Walken and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive distribution to convince the public that this is so. This is not your average lowbrow film (the disaster film producers of the 70s had a similar idea). I liked to see the familiar faces, but the story is very silly, and no matter what class the movie claims, it works at the level of your average 70s movie (it's not a complete thing bad, though). Still, it's a nice movie, especially for viewers who like to watch the stars. As usual, the dull work of Albert Whitlock is remarkable. Overall, quite entertaining.
