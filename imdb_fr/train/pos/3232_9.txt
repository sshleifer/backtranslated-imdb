I went to see this Finnish film and I must say that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year. The plot is composed of 5 or 6 different stories, all taking place the same day in a small Finnish town. The stories come together very well at the end, perhaps reminding a bit of how Tarantino's films are shot. Most of the actors played very well, which is certainly necessary in realistic dramas of this type. I especially enjoyed the acting Sanna Hietala, the lead actress, and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed that IMDB got wrong information about Sanna. His name, as you may have noticed in my account;), is NOT Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
