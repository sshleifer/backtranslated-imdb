OK, so the Oscars seem to get a little more excited each year. And I was looking for "Gosford Park" to win (well, Robert Altman deserved an Oscar for years!). That said, I guess it was high time for an African American to win the Best Actress award. Contrary to the previous comment, the role of Halle Berry in "Monster's Ball" was much more original than that of Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; I never thought I'd name it for anything, especially in a year that saw "Dr. Mulholland". <br /> <br /> Among the things I predicted, there was the content of the 9/11 attacks; I knew they were going to say something about freedom. Yeah yeah. Robert Redford should know better. But contrary to the previous comment, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (one of the previous hosts was Bob Hope, for whom I have no respect); I really liked his shot against John Ashcroft. <br /> <br /> So, even though I would not have given the best movie "A Beautiful Mind", "The 74th Annual Oscars" have always pleased me (I must admit, I enjoy the Oscars more than my own birthday). And the next day, while my parents and I were walking through the homes of Bandalier, New Mexico - it was Spring Break - I thought that when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, most viewers were wondering " Jim who ?! "I wonder if Woody Allen will attend the Oscars again.
