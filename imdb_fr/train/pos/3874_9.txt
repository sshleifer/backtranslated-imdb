And I absolutely love Isabelle Blais! She was so cute in this movie and very different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal" where she looked more like a man-eater. I think she should have been nominated for a Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was far superior, IMO. Pelletier did a good job on his first outing, and I noticed that he had attracted two of his friends from Rock and Beautiful Ears, Guy A. LePage and Andr√© Ducharme. It was fun to see them that way. I did not know they were going to appear. <br /> <br /> I do not think I saw a romantic comedy from Quebec that I did not like, and this one is as good as everyone I've had the pleasure to see. And if you're in the United States wondering how to get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca gave it to me in less than a week.
