You must see it to believe it! The directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield did something really great, it's a 10 out of 10, so I can not believe another user of this site had such a poor score, unless they do not expect to see a normal movie, with people, love scenes, etc. I am also convinced that this type of documentary is a great way to wake up to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary film "An Inconvenient Truth", composed mainly of long monologues, painfully and "truths" not always accurate, as many scientists have already pointed out. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do on earth is not to miss Earth.
