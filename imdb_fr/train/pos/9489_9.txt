I'm not tired of saying it's one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story unfolds in a fictitious state, but it's obviously about Kennedy's murder. An honest and honest prosecutor (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single Daslow (= Oswald) and, although all other officials want to close the case, he continues to investigate with his team. The scenario is written tight and fast and keeps the tension until the end. The part that deals with Milgram's experience of the authorities is (albeit not without interest) a little misplaced. The final sequence - explaining who is really Icarus - shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
