<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt guarded, as if someone kept an eye on each of your movements? Remember that the FBI will always be there before deciding to break the law. At least, that's what you feel after watching the dreadful but slightly fluffy crime drama, the FBI's story. It traces the roots of the organization of a small office to one of the most modern institutions in the world (in 1959), telling the story through the eyes of one of his agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> <br /> Chip has been part of the FBI since day one and he willingly puts his work on top of everyone, sometimes even his family. The FBI's story recounts his life by describing what he does as an agent and how it affects his personal life. The film does a spectacular job in showing what kind of cases the FBI deals with and how it deals with them. The public can see Chip put an end to the Ku Klux Klan riots, take cover to solve a scandal of murders and inheritance in India, put fugitives in detention, rescue hostages and participate in combat during the Second World War. He even helped to bring Communist spies to justice. <br /> <br /> Stewart, in a vaguely complex performance, is stellar (as always) as a slightly neurotic agent who may like his work a little too much. One of the best aspects of this film is that we see the inner workings of Chip's family life and work. We see him suffering until the death of his best friend and then of his son. We also notice that his wife had a miscarriage and that her marriage had a hard time. Most of his personal problems are caused by the love of his work. Vera Miles gives an uneven performance, but nevertheless very convincing. She has never been a brilliant actress, but there was always something very attractive and seductive about her. Well maybe it's just me? Unfortunately, none of the other performances deserve to be mentioned, but the captivating story has managed to keep me extremely interested. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of this film was impressive, especially the scenes in the South American jungle. The colors all have a texture that really defines the atmosphere of the film. Most of this film was perhaps the fabulous direction of Mervyn Leroy. Each scene was so smooth that they just gathered to tell a brilliant story. It is full of ingenious camera shots, some with a very hitchcockian feel. <br /> <br /> In total, The FBI Story is a spectacular film, but neglected. At two-thirty, some viewers may be intimidated, but if you have the opportunity, I recommend jumping into it. I enjoyed Jimmy Stewart's spectacular performance and captivating story.
