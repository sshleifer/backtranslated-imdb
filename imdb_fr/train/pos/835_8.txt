Pierce Brosnan, the newest but no longer James Bond, is a murderer. He is very very good at what he does, but he is getting older and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as a straight and narrow businessman. Now, when the story begins, the film shows these two people in their respective lives. Then one night, they drink in a bar and start talking. Then suddenly, you find these two people gathering in a series of events. The story is great, the acting is great, and the humor is hilarious, I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be so funny, but it really is and I must say that this film is to see absolutely .
