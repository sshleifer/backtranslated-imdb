Before I see this movie, I see a lot of comments, everyone has an excellent view of the film, good or bad ... <br /> <br /> What I really want to emphasize is the role played by Woody Harrelson In the name, it may not appear in many parts of the film, but when it appears or even in the intro, Will Smith and Woody Harrelson surprise me with the "message" that they tried to create and maybe drag the entire plot to the end to really understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> I'm not a very sentimental person, I think a good deed should not cause remorse or pity. But an act to show redemption, there are not many movies that in my view can show that. This is one of them who can. <br /> <br /> I agree with someone who commented that this movie showing "suicide" is a failure, but I do not think it's the "message" of the film. try to send, but "sacrifice". A bit to the extreme, but this is the message in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This film has potential. The acting is worth it, the scenario is incredible. a person who does not like watching dramatic movies ... If you like drama, it's a must to watch.
