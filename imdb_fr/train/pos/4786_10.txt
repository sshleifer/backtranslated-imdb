The Straight Story tells the story of an old man who decided to visit his sick brother, who lives on the other side of the border. He decides to ride with his mower, because he can not drive and he wants to fend for himself. The film nicely describes his career and the lives he lived on the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth performs well, as does the rest of the cast, including Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as her daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but critically important role. . <br /> <br /> At first, I felt that the story of an old trip across the country would be boring, but I soon discovered that Lynch, with all his knowledge of the life of man, makes it a movie that I would recommend to everyone.
