The women's room waiting for a big hospital, with its joys and sorrows, is where LIFE begins. <br /> <br /> This almost forgotten drama is a good little drama filled with comedy and tragedy. , all related to the lives of maternity staff and their patients. The frankness with which the subject dealt with underlines the status of before the film code. <br /> <br /> The wonderful Aline MacMahon, as a friendly Chief Nurse, is the calm center of the film, the rock around which the currents flow. Able to handle any crisis or emergency, she is the best friend, sometimes the last, of the mother. MacMahon is surrounded by excellent characters: Loretta Young, a convicted murderer, released from prison long enough to have a child; Eric Linden as his scared young husband; Glenda Farrell as a lady who hates children; Sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother for her sixth birth; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as caring and compassionate doctors and Frank McHugh as future comic and frantic father. <br /> <br /> The characters of the film will recognize Bobs Watson as a little jerk eager to see the stork; Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a "little soldier"; Gilbert Roland as a distraught Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as a pensive doctor's wife wanting to adopt Farrell's son - all uncredited. <br /> <br /> There are some nonsense in the plot - some of the mothers are obviously way too old; Farrell is blatantly drunk in the room but no staff member seems to notice him. a clearly psychotic patient can walk around as much as he likes - but that only reinforces the film's unusual entertainment value and prevents things from getting too serious.
