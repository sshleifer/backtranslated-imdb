I really enjoyed this film. Tobey Maguire gives a fantastic performance as Jake. He must be one of the best actors I've seen. And I was surprised that there are so many humorous lines in the film. He was extremely talented in this field, even though I had never seen him deliver a comic before. The movie will involve you in the characters and will really make you wonder what they will become. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance but I think she did pretty well. Many exciting scenes. A very good ride. I am absolutely a fan of Maguire. Consult the rules of the cider house. One of the best of all time.
