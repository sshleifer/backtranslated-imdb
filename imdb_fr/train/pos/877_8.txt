The career of Jean-Jacques began with his essay in response to an essential question: civilization makes us evil. This intelligent and exciting film supports this argument. In this sense, it takes up a theme common to French films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here, the idea is treated to the letter. The two main characters meet, and each other, only when they break the rules. This discovery may well be true in France; in any case, it's pretty romantic.
