This film contains one of the greatest performances of Richard Dreyfuss, as an actor who plays the role of a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor. Also, this movie is funny, but also has a serious side. What is particularly intriguing in this film is the character of Madonna, who is the mistress of the dictator, but who ends up becoming the leader of the country. Madonna's evolution as chief mistress of politics has greatly added to the quality of the story and the entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who at the beginning of the film is a troubled actor and a jester, is also evolving and at the end of the film commands respect. I liked this film.
