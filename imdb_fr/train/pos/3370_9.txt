Having just finished Cronicles of the Heroic Knight just a few minutes ago, I find myself extremely satisfied, but questions still dominate me. Although it seems that the first 7 or more episodes are actually a transcript of the events of the first Record of Lodoss War, the truth is that they are not really. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different vision of the end of the original (and this is perhaps why the first 7 episodes occur), but I do not think that is the case. CotHK says it starts 5 years after the hero war, of which Parn was a part. I think the director made the first 5 episodes look so much like a recap of the original, just to give the viewer a little reminder and an introduction to the characters and their actions, as they appear much less after the beginning of the series in the history of Spark. Now, once the series enters the Spark role, we end up another 10 years (15 years now since the hero war). In some cases, Spark and his team look like Parn and his team once the journey has started, especially the love story between Spark and Neese. I have also thought many times in CotHK that I had cast the original series and if there had not been the long blue hair of Spark, I would probably have pressed more than once for me. ensure that the correct disk is inserted correctly. Consider these major setbacks however, the writers did a great job creating credible characters and a remarkable story. The only thing that hurts me is that Ashram and Wagnard come back. Ummmm ... how ??? Do not get me wrong, both of them are big bad guys, even if the only bad thing about Ashram is that he supports the Marmo. I may have missed something in the series of the series that explained this part. Regarding the suites, I highly recommend CotHK. I place both CotHK and, even more, the original story of the Lodoss War well above the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both are more epic than anything I have ever seen or read. I highly recommend it.
