Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is the adulterous wife of a great businessman who inherits a million-dollar life insurance policy when her husband is killed in a plane crash while traveling on a business trip. 'business. At first, she is suspected of being responsible, as her husband will have recently. Peter Lynch (George Hilton), an insurance investigator, and an Interpol agent stand in line to make sure. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece, to cash his inheritance, but insists on keeping it in cash ... a dangerous twist. Lynumer, whose identity is now known to Baumer, tries to protect her against a lover of her husband, Lara Florakis, who tries nevertheless, with his henchman, Sharif to kill them both for a share of the money which it considers to be entitled. And this is where our masked murderer begins his brutal murders. Lynch, as is customary with our hero, is first suspected by the Greek police and is invited not to leave Athens by police inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli, a familiar face at Giallo and Spaghettis). Lynch is then helped by the magnificent journalist Cl√©o Dupont (Anita Strindberg) who helped him to investigate the murders. To say more, this could ruin the movie for anyone who has not seen it, so just say that there is enough to be plausible to satisfy the fans of Mystery / Thriller in this story guided by Giallo.The DVD No Shame has a superb transfer with an English and Italian soundtrack. It also has a very catchy score, just for the good measure of Bruno Nicolai, who will stay in your head for a while ... all in all, a top-notch Giallo.
