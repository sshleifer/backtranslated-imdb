Harem Suare is the best film I saw in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Shot sensually and superbly portrayed, Harem Suare is a daring film that addresses interracial romance, which is a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors populate the film. Cut off from the outside world, women are entertained by telling stories of intrigue, rivalry and jealousy in their ranks.
