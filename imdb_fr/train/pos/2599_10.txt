Having enjoyed Joyce's complex novel so much, I was ready to be disappointed by the script of Joseph Strick and Fred Haines, given the fabulous complexity of the original text. However, the film turned out to be very well done and a good translation of the tone, naturalism and lightness of the book. <br /> <br /> It is certainly useful to have read the original text before watching the film. I imagine that the latter seems disjointed, with very strange episodes seemingly assembled randomly, without a prior reading of the text to help capture the plot. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how much the film is "dirty", it was shot in Dublin in 1967. Finally, Irish censorship did not finally ban the Irish public in 2000 (He was shown to a restricted audience in a private film club, the Irish Film Theater, the late 1970s). The eroticism of Joyce is not just naturalistic and torrid, it offers many episodes "perverse". It did not matter that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still totally taboo during the making of the film in 1967. <br /> <br /> It is amazing and encouraging to watch the cream of the day. the Irish Actor's Profession of the 1960s, all respected players dared to utter and interpret Joyce's highly transgressive text brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
