I went to see this film hoping for a nice relaxing moment at the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I had to really control myself to convince her that I was not afraid. In many ways, this remains a story of children, but with a scenario that has a lot of potential. This could have been one of the scariest films if planned for another audience.
