The beautiful sisters will be released in cinemas on March 24 in Sweden. A good opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was presented in Gothenburg with a retrospective devoted to Kim Longinotto, "director" of the festival. She gave a very popular master class explaining her method of documentary and informing the public of the particular circumstances that led her to turn two sisters-in-law: the first version was definitely lost, a second shoot was organized and the film turned out different at the end. In this case, a pretty terrible problem has occurred to create the possibility of a very strong movie.
