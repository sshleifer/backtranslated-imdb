After finding it for a year and a half, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> This is not a disappointment because I am one of those hard-working SMAP fans who need to see all their works. finally had the right to see the so-called hot film of Goro. But I could not believe that Goro was forced to make a movie as such. From his respectable self now, I'm sure he thinks he made this film. Nevertheless, they found the ideal person to look embarrassed, uncomfortable and half depressed most of the time. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe he made this movie ... I had to cover my eyes hidden in many places not believing that he really made such a film .... hahahaha .... <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I watched it. Thank God he grew up ...
