Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with THE GODFATHER, add some Roman mythology and a lot of humorous comedy, and you have THE SOPRANOS, a clan of the crowds operating in northern New Jersey. It's almost as entertaining as professional wrestling. I'm not the biggest fan of this series, but I admire the very complicated Tony Soprano of James Gandolfini, a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience. I also came to admire the contributions of people like Dom Chianese, gritty, who embodies the perplexing but deadly uncle, Tony Sirico, silver-haired, who puzzled Paulie and the very beautiful, Edie Falco, who embodies the brunette and daring Carmela Soprano . The violence is sudden and graphic, the number of bodies increases gradually each season, but it is often the small moments that matter most here. Watch Christopher, Tony's nephew (Michael Imperioli at the end of LAW & ORDER) get lost in the Pine Barrens and spend an icy night in an abandoned truck, both convinced to have him.
