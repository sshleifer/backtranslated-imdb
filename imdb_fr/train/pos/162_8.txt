For a film "without budget" this thing rocks. I do not know if the United States will like it, but we laugh all the time. Really funny stuff. Really not Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Actors and music have rocked. Cars and gags and even the least in your face made us crack. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I have already seen some actors, but never in a film like this, one or two of them, I think to have seen in advertisements or elsewhere. Basically, it rocked! Fortunately, I could see a copy of a friend of one of the actors.
