Let me solve the problem first. James Hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to reproduce his descriptions of what was happening during the training of the rookies and the events of the day. It's really a cruel contract with other firefighters with no ambition to act that are natural in their delivery. <br /> <br /> That said, it's an amazing film that you can not look at without having tears in your eyes. I am an English native from London, but I love New York and have been to many places before and after 9/11. It's a second home for me and I can not help feeling devastated by the loss of life, but also by the destruction of a part of such a beautiful city. This is the real problem, that firefighters have collapsed. I'm so happy that the movie exists to show people how it was. It's unfortunate that they did not use any images of people jumping out of the buildings because friends who were there tell me that this is such an important part of their memory that they should be included to show future generations to how terrible it was <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way.
