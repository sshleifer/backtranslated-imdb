This is an interesting series that takes real characters (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc ..) ... and staged part of their real story with a character in the series that continues to take part in this story. Railway detective "Matt Clark" - plays a role in the search for famous outlaws of the Old West in stories based at least in part on true stories. In this sense, it is almost a series of anthologies and, as another person has pointed out, this strange structure poses scheduling problems with actual events, but it's a fun series with lots of action to satisfy a thirsty western 1950s audience - and it still resists pretty well 55 years later. Clark plays a powerful role in his western gear as he faces some of the bad guys in history. And his girlfriend Frankie is quite a dish. If you are a Western fan, be sure to check if you have the opportunity.
