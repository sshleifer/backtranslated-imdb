I'm a fan of Pushing Daisies since the very beginning. It's wonderfully thought out, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how much television needed a creative and original show like Pushing Daisies. It's a huge relief to see a show, unlike the rest, where, if you compare it to some of the new shows, such as Scrubs and House, you'll see similarities, and that becomes tedious sometimes. see programs so close to identity. <br /> <br /> With a beautiful cast, a beautiful storyline and a hilarity in every episode, Pushing Daisies is by far one of the most remarkable shows on your television.
