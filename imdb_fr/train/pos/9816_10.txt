Outrage is a very good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the film and was perfect for the game! It's hard to believe it's a true story, but what can you do? When I looked at it, I wondered why they had to do all these things. It's not fair but they learned the lesson when they chose the wrong man! Anyway, if you see this movie on TV, watch it, because it's a good movie!
