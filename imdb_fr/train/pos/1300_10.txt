I saw for the first time a piece of this DVD during a hi-fi show in November 2006 in London (I was not really in the cream until now!). and I'll tell you that this is by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever watched. Cream's performance at their age was simply breathtaking and the sound quality is the best I've heard on a DVD It does not matter what type of music you like, this one will certainly grow on you. It's the pure brilliance of their performance that will make you look at it again and again. Even new musicians do not cut mustard these days, as these old rockers do.
