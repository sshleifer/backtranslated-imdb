Well, I'll be honest: it's not exactly a Sholay. But you can not get a Sholay every week. In fact, you can see separate signatures of "not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, as most "inspired" films do, this one was well inspired, well managed and well done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to exaggerate her hysterics, but all others are commendable. Dipti Naval: I saw her after a long time, but she has not lost her grace. In fact, she performed much better than during my last visit. Another of the Bollywood stars who seem to become more and more beautiful as they get older? <br /> <br /> In total, a beautiful watch.
