The great Vincent Price has produced many fantastic horror films, some of which are among the greatest genre gems of all time. Price's greatest achievements are undoubtedly his 60s films, including Roger Corman's brilliant cycle of Poe (still the biggest horror cycle of all time), Michael Reeves' "Witchfinder General" (1968). ) or "The Last Man" by Ubaldo Ragona. on Earth "(1964) marking the culminating points of this brilliant man's career.The films that made this man famous and made him the immortal icon of the horror he is, however, go back to the 50's , with "House of Wax" (1953) marking his rise to stardom. "The Crazy Magician" of 1954 follows a plot very similar to that of his predecessor.This does not mean that this film is not a jewel original, deliciously macabre and absolutely wonderful.As suggested by the lines above, Vincent Price is my favorite actor and, although I do not personally allow myself to miss what this man has been, none of my fellow fans of this man can not miss this gem. <br /> <br /> Star prizes like Don Galico (aka Galico the Great), an underrated magician master and inventor of magic devices, whose boss, a shady businessman , stole his wife (Eva Gabor). one of Galico's ingenious inventions is taken away and entrusted to his rival The Great Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico cracks and a wave of murderous revenge begins ... <br /> <br /> Do not love us Vincent Price when he wants revenge? Some of his most famous and famous films such as "The Abominable Dr. Phibes" (1971) or "Theater of Blood" (1973) dealt with absurd and deliciously macabre revenge killings. This previous film of his career in Horror is further proof that no one is taking revenge like Vincent Price. This film provides a wonderfully eccentric role for Price, which, as always, delivers brilliant performance and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre entertainment to all Horror fans. Another must for my fellow Price fans.
