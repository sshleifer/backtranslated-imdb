The most amazing, spiritually edifying film about the restoration of the Gospel. Much better than any other film or film made to date on the restoration. If you have not seen it, fly to Salt Lake and watch it now. You will not regret it! You really have an idea of ​​what the first saints had to face, putting all their trust in their prophet, Joseph Smith.

If you have any questions about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our modest beginnings, just watch this movie, it will make sense afterwards.
