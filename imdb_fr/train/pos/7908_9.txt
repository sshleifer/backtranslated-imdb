I recently found a copy for $ 5 in a video store and I looked forward to it. Although the music and (obviously) the graphics are not up to my favorite of the series, Beyond the Mind's Eye, I'm still fascinated by a segment: <br /> <br /> Stanley and Stella in "Breaking the ice cream ". The music is brilliant and the emotions are real. The clip on the Odyssey website has unfortunately neither history nor music.
