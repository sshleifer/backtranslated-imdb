I participated in a mini-production of this film when I was about 8 years old at school and my mother bought me the video. I love it since !! When I was younger, it was the songs and the spectacular dance sequences that I enjoyed, but since I watched them when I grew older, I enjoy the fantastic game and the character game. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can not imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis Nancy is the best character for me. She has endured so much for these boys, I think she is such a strong character and her final scene when ... Well, you know ... always makes me cry! Best musical in my opinion of all time. It lasts since all this time, it will last many years! 11/10 !!
