This film is hilarious! I watched it with my friend and it only remained to see him again. This film is not for you, moviegoers, who will only watch the Oscar nominated movies (you know who you are.) I will not recap it because you have seen it by all critics. <br /> <br /> "Whipped" is a light comedy that made me laugh all the way through. It does not take too seriously and should be watched with your friends, not your girlfriend. He will not win any prize, but just watch to be appreciated. Certainly, some of the jokes are toilet humor, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use it sometimes. Some people need to lighten up and see "Whipped" for what it is, not what it is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 on *****.
