This film is exciting, daring and the music is very good.The film Moonwalker was to coincide with the album Bad (1987) .I have Bad.It is excellent (*****). The film begins with Michael Jackson's "Man In The Mirror" on stage. Then, he traces the story of Michael, since his debut in the Jackson 5 until the Bad era. Oh, and Badder is good too (Badder is a parody of the Bad the single video clip). He then shows the video of Speed ​​Demon. The song and the clip are really very good. Even to leave me alone, which appears after. Then he shows the film Moonwalker.After a few minutes, he plays a good criminal in a club called club 30s.Love him when he is lean. Anyway, nice to see you goodbye.
