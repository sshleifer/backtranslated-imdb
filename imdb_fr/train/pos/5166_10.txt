Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it funny, comforting and I loved it! Anyone who has gone camping in his childhood and who wishes at times to be able to return to the "good time of Ole" for a brief moment really needs to see this one! It starts like 20 years later, a group of old campers come back for a "meeting". I will not comment on the plot anymore because you have to see it yourself. The actors were great, and it contains a cast of stars. Everyone played a great role. You actually feel like watching the movie. Alan Arkin was particularly talented in his role as Uncle Lou. He plays the kind of guy everyone wants to have in his life. It's also a good family movie for the most part. I would suggest this one to anyone in a heartbeat! Highly recommended!
