It is a story of Siberian villagers from the beginning of the 20th century until the 60s. It is about passion and feelings, Russian soul and very romantic. This film is NOT packed with action, it flows slowly. In the second part, we can find beautiful songs - Russian romances. It's a lot better than Dr. Jivago. The director of this film moved to the United States and created Runaway Train, for example.
