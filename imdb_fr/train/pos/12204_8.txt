One can imagine that the film that Mr. Welles could have ended without the interference of the studio! This film is a flawed Welles, but it is worth it because you can see the greatness of the best American director of all time! <br /> <br /> We can see the record he caused to Orson Welles, the filming of this film. The story has many holes, perhaps because of requests from studio directors who did not trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compare Orson Welles to the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski or even Woody Allen, while it is all directors who must be considered as followers. of the great master himself. No one in the history of American cinema has been as original and creative as Mr. Welles. We are fortunate to still have his legacy in retrospective looks like the one just finished at the Film Forum in New York or in movies on tape or on DVD. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth has never been photographed with so much love. only here. If she was a beauty with her red hair, as a blonde, she is too beautiful for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have made this film another masterpiece to add to Orson Welles's body of work is its own appearance. If he had focused on the staging and if another actor had performed Michael O'Hara, a different film might have been made. Orson Welles may have to be credited for perhaps being a pioneer in removing the camera from the studio on the street. The visuals in this film are so incredible that we leave the theater after seeing this film really impressed by the work, the vision and the talent it has given us.
