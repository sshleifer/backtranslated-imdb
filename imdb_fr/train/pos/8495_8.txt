Well into the 1980s, long before NAFTA was written and companies began to lose their national identity, the United States and Japan were one against the throat in the global race to manufacture. Do not forget phrases like "Union Yes!", "Japanese take over the country" and "Americans are lazy?" <br /> <br /> At the end of the Reagan era and the transition of businesses to a global market, director Ron Howard made one of many trips in the genre of comedy with his success "Gung Ho 'of 1986, which brought in more than $ 36 million in US box office revenue. Although dated in many ways, Howard's insane story about the collision of cultures in the workplace still offers a harsh truth to today's industrial life. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), the representative of the car manufacturers union of Hadleyville, a depressed little town at the foot of Pennsylvania. Stevenson was asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (similar to the real Toyota), which is considering a deal in the United States at the empty factory in the city. Assan decides to settle down and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between the company's managers and the assembly line workers. <br /> <br /> The 112 minutes of 'Gung Ho' is a humorous look at these two sides, their strengths and weaknesses are also taken into account: on the one hand, a US workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and unionism; On the other hand, Japanese workers who are extremely dedicated to their work but lack personal satisfaction and self-confidence. In Stevenson, we find a figure of the American working class with a medium intelligence and the ability to chat with people through misunderstandings. With the survival of his worker jobs and most of Hadleyville on the line, Stevenson is a friendly guy who wants nothing more than a reasonable chance, although his intelligence will plunge him into serious trouble. In addition to responding to Assan's head, we are witnessing a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and his fellow union members, with whom he grew up with most. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro) and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother). <br /> <br /> The Japanese cast is directed by Gedde Watanabe, also known for "Sixteen Candles" and "Volunteers." Watanabe embodies Kazihiro, the plant director who has lost his chance and is beginning to feel sympathy for the American way of life, and is constantly followed by Saito (Sab Shimono), the nephew of Assan's CEO, who is desperate to Although they are slightly touched, these characters are very likely to convey ideas about the Japanese work culture. <br /> <br /> With Hunt Stevenson dominating the screenplay, Michael Keaton must give a solid performance for this film to work. "Gung Ho" is indeed a total success for Keaton, who also teamed up with Ron Howard in "The Paper" in 1994. He made this film during a series of lighter roles including "Mr. Mom," "Beetle Juice" and "The Dream Team" before embarking on "Batman", "One Good Cop" and "My Life." It's also hard not to like the performance of Gedde Watanabe as a weird man , who first wears shades of Japanese shame before teaming with Stevenson to make the car plant a coherent unit. <br /> <br /> notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono and Soh Yamamura as CEO of Assan, Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers provides a romantic interest to Audrey, Hunt's girlfriend. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel teamed up for Gung Ho's strong writing. The incidental music, which received a BMI Film Music Award, was composed by Thomas Newman. The songs from Gung Ho's soundtrack cover the 80s, including "Do not get me wrong", "Tuff Enuff" and "Worker of the working class". <br /> <br /> The success of "Gung Ho" actually led to a short TV series about ABC. Although it's more impressive than a social comment twenty years ago, Ron Howard's movie still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount widescreen collection and is slightly modified. Audio options are available in English 5.1 Surround, English Dolby Surround and French "copy", but the subtitles are in English only. There are no extras, not even the theatrical trailer. On the positive side, the Paramount digital transfer is pretty good, with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound. Some extras would have been helpful - especially since "Gung Ho" was a box office hit - there is not much to complain about the movie itself. <br /> <br /> *** out of 4
