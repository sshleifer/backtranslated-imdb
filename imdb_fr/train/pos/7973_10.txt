Maybe I'm a sap but these are the sweetest movies ever! I saw him for the first time around the age of 4 or 5 and I cried. Between yesterday and today (embarrassed at 15), I saw him more than 25 times and I sobbed each one of them. Do not worry, they are tears of happiness! And all is not sap! There is also a lot of humor and comedy. Usually, talking about everything that happens with an animal can be a drag, but in this movie, it's not the case. My only advice: even if you like it, you do not see the aftermath ... eyes! I suggest everyone check this out ... you will not regret it, no matter how old you are!
