For starters, as this movie is a remake of a classic, it must already lower the note. Since this version features Viggo Mortensen in the lead role of Kowalski, this helps. <br /> <br /> Is there not however like the US government to terrorize one of its own citizens? It looks like Jason Priestley's character from the movie! But it's the truth, the government would do everything possible to destroy the life of a man who would try to bring his wife home. A woman who gives birth no less and who can not fend for herself. <br /> <br /> "There was a time in this country where the police escorted a man to his pregnant wife." The words of the disc jockey. <br /> <br /> This film contains beautiful scenery scenes, great car chases and lots of spirituality. After careful consideration, I gave this film a 7.
