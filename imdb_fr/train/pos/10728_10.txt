The fantasy film of the perfect space. a group of children accidentally climb into space and have to go back down, but do they do it? It would not be a family film if they all died. Then everything will be sad. You do not want Kate Capsaw, the main woman gives a performance at the Golden Globe, but unfortunately she and Lea Thompson have not won one. It's really bad. I can not say enough, this movie is really great, Lea Thompson-lord, a perfect girl for this movie. This film is the best for sure. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so overrated and the space camp was so underrated. This should be the opposite <br /> <br /> excellent 10/10 - maybe 11/10. I'm not good at math
