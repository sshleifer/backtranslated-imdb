Seeing "Moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how funny and sensational it was at first appearance. Who knew that Cher could act? Who has ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage marks the beginning of his career. Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello are not famous for their comedy talents, nor is Norman Jewison the director. <br /> <br /> The only really flat note of this magnificent work is "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza, it's Amore", song that is sung too many times in the film (once, it's already too much) and that has long lived in popular music. <br /> <br /> Dear, forgive me, is sensational with Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married and does not need to be in love with her husband. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliges by proposing, by offering him his pinkie ring, to replace an engagement ring, then to flee to Sicily to find his dying mother. He instructs Loretta to ensure that his brother, Ronny, attended the ceremony, attends the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, his father (Vincent Gardenia) cheats on his mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites him to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> Everything is going well, as it should be in movies like this. Meanwhile, all actors perform admirably and the audience has fun. In his own way, "Moonstruck" is the way Hollywood was at its best: entertaining entertainment without any social significance. If they had only lost "It's Amore" along the way, it would have been perfect.
