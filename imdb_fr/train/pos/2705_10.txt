Ed Wood worked for 10 years on this scenario to try to achieve it. Aris Iliopulos finally had the chutzpah to film a scenario that Wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other more ephemeral valuables. <br /> <br /> This is a film without dialogue, which some describe stupidly as dumb. In fact, it's a pretty noisy movie, without the insane chatter of most movies. In the hands of these filmmakers, music and sound effects offer a rich audio experience that works better than almost any Hollywood scripting rumor, especially the silly movie where Billy Zane was released ('Attention!', ' Oh no! - J. Cameron .... ick ...) I will take Zane's wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts every day in this empty dialogue. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane leads a team of players who really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci is radiant as always, and the gods shine when you can put the names of Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy on the same poster. <br /> <br /> The design is perfect, the pyramid set exquisite, and the bestial performance of Ron Perlman is simply stunning. All in all, it's a chaotic, visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of Ed Wood Jr., author and cinenephile. A must see for all those who really like cinema as Iliopulos and its actors obviously do. A movie to make you wish you did it yourself.
