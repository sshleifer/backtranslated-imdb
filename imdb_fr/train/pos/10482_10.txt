I like this film. It's one of those I can watch over and over again. It is well played by a good cast that does not look too much to be a star. <br /> <br /> The hypothesis of a widow recently widowed homemaker who turns to the sale of pot to make ends meet could have been transformed into an Americanized shit of a film or a thriller action. One or the other would have completely killed the movie. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds like an Ealing comedy with an incredible wellness factor throughout. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching for the stage with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes ... (no it's not a spoiler!)
