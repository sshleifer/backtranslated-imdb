This has just been broadcast on BBC and I am absolutely delighted to have seen it. At the time of the credits, only the casting ensured that I was going to try the shot. In just five minutes, I was completely immersed in this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was a predictable formula, but it contributed to its charm. The flashbacks of the forties were beautifully placed and captured a feeling equal to that of few productions. <br /> <br /> A true film of well-being, punctuated with exceptional music. When he comes out, I'll buy it!
