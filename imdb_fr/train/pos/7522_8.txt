"The Notorious Bettie Page" tells the story of a woman who has always wanted to be an actress but who has become one of the most famous pin-up girls in American history. Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first icons of sex in America. The type of model Bettie Page was involved in included the nudity and slavery that led to a US Senate inquiry in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> When I came out of the movie, all I could think of was how far we have been advancing pornography terms since the 1950s. You can now go on the internet and find some of the most disturbing and shocking images ever taken, that the film questioned in "The Notorious Bettie Page" seems almost childish and innocent. Most of the images that included slavery did not include nudity when Bettie Page was involved, but today we have sick pictures showing women having sex with animals. I find that the envelope may have been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because, with regard to pornography today, this film was made with great taste. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was pretty impressed. "The Notorious Bettie Page", I found the film very well done and interesting. The movie is exactly what the trailer suggests and it will be a very interesting look at one of the first female icons in America. Gretchen Mol looks like Bettie Page and gives a very good performance. I also thought that since the film was shot in black and white, the film seemed realistic because it gave the audience the feeling of watching a movie created in the late 50's. <br /> <br /> My only reproach for the movie It was time to run, there seemed to be some scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been. I looked at the situation and it seems that 10 minutes have been removed from the film since it was first screened at the Toronto Film Festival. In addition, the end was quite tame and I was expecting a little more or maybe a few paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the public more about the life of Bettie Page where the film stopped. These are my only two complaints about the film, apart from the fact that the staging is solid, the acting of excellent actors, especially Gretchen, and writing, good. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron, who directed "American Psycho", which is one of my favorite films, is the director and screenwriter of "The Notorious Bettie Page". I think Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a set and create beautiful character-based movies because, like "Psycho", Bettie Page is a very interesting character study. Harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease, as well as all the characters. She is a very talented director who, I hope, will stay in the years to come. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is really worth the detour. It's a very interesting story that shows how much America, as well as the world, has come in terms of pornography. The film also features a great performance by Gretchen Mol that literally describes Bettie Page's role on the head. And crown it all with a talented director who has captured the look and feel of an earlier era and you have a good film in your hands. Unfortunately, this movie will probably fail because few other people who grew up at the time are interested in the film, but I think it's worth checking out. <br /> <br /> MovieManMenzel's final score for "The Notorious Bettie Page" is an 8/10. This is an interesting character study on one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in American history.
