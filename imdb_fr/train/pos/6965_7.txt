This film answers the question: how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is co-dependent, sticky, needy, jealous ... and has powers and abilities far beyond those of the deadly women? <br /> <br /> Without spoiling the film can assure you that this is not the case, but you will have a lot of fun to have fun along the way. Uma Thurman is perfect as a super-heroin mercurial, a super-heroine, mysteriously named G-Girl, who, unlike most of her siblings, is not * always * dedicated to the truth, to justice and American fashion. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also credible as a completely stupid conservative, but somehow always go for it, conservative Jenny. When she is dropped for a less talented rival but more emotionally secure and well adjusted, G-Girl becomes ballistic and the following is not good. It's funny, but it's not pretty. <br /> <br /> It's an enchanting place, hell has no fury like a scorned superheroine, and the people involved do not quite kidnap it, but it has its moments, and I think I will get the DVD. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie ..
