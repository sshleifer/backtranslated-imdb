The Ghost Train is a treat for those who appreciate the typical 1940s humor. It incorporates the intrigue of World War II into the plot, but not as much as I originally thought. The characters are a unique mix that plays pretty well their roles. Askey, playing the role of Tommy Gander, is what illuminates the story for the parts that could have been described as boring or "dragging". <br /> <br /> The history of the haunted station is actually scary even for the present day standards. It's unique and the way the characters communicate with each other is fantastic to animate the mystery that is The Ghost Train. Gander is basically a nuisance for all other members while the rest gets along pretty well. He is always in the center of attention and can be described as boring, but it is those who do not appreciate the humor of the 1940s. His humor is innocent and childish, which makes him pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> If it was not Askey / Gander, this movie would have been shorter in the action, the enjoyment and the result would be less effective. My opinion.
