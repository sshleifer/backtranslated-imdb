Like the characters in this series, I was also a teenager in the 70s. The producers have really understood all the zeitgeist, to be a suburban teenager in the 70s. The fashion of the 70s, cars, Furnishing accessories, foods and fashions are all very authentic in this show. <br /> <br /> The show is composed of a troupe of very talented musicians who fit very well in front of the camera. I really like the unique movie sequences, psychedelic style. No other show does camera tours like this one. These state-of-the-art movie sequences really help to express the campy intensity that characterized the era of the '70s. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very funny sitcom. What disturbs me in this series is that we laugh at the cruel humor to generate laughter. In this way, I think this show is trying to look like Married With Children too. Although Married with Children is an excellent full-fledged sitcom, it is doubtful that the creators of That 70s show that they continue to try to emulate it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show of the 70s, mainly because of its nostalgia factor. It could be an even better show if the scriptwriters relied more on a spiritual dialogue, rather than jokes and stupid jokes and tasteless.
