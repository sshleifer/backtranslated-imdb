I had the privilege of seeing this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $ 200,000 low-budget movie about a father and his 2 sons. The father has a traditional bathing establishment somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where men, mainly elderly men, come to relax and go swimming. The father's son is a "retarded" son who lives with him and a son who lives in a large modern city and visits him. For this son, the traditional village, the public baths and his "belated" brother seem strange and embarrassing, but it changes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem old-fashioned or clich√©d, it is not. With very good performances, especially the father and the son 'delayed' (sorry, I do not know their names) and a beautiful story, the film was both touching and fun. <br /> <br /> If you had the chance to see this movie do it. It's a great alternative to traditional Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br />
