Notable because of its notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous Maruschka Detmers takes the penis of her young lover from her pants and into her mouth. Even without this moment, the film is a beautiful, exciting and incredibly sexy ride. Detmers achieves a superb performance as an insatiable delight, disturbed in part, wandering around his flat nude. Dressed, partially dressed and naked, she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me, the last two get lost a bit and the end is more confusing when his fiance is released, while his fellow terrorists are released. She seems uncertain about who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in her exams than anything else while she cries, beautifully of course!
