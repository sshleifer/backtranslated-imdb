If this film had been shot a few years later, I would have got a lower score. However, for 1909, it was a little dandy movie and still stands pretty well today. Just do not try to compare this dumb movie to later silent movies: the industry has changed so much that shorts from the first decade of the twentieth century do not look like movies made in the 1910s and beyond . <br /> <br /> This film lasts 11 minutes (the average of most movies at the time) and is a variation of Edgar Allen Poe's story, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO. Although many know the story, I will not elaborate further because I do not want to ruin the film. Suffice to say that it is very scary !!
