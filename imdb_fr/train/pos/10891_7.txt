You can survive surviving Christmas. I thought the TV version was a little modified. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, an adult with no family, ready to pay strangers. The Valcos with James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara in the role of parents and Christina Applegate in the role of Lisa Valco, the girl. Drew is alone during the holidays because he does not have a family of his own. He rents a family in the suburbs of Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, whom I remember best for playing Maude's husband, Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the situation collapses, the truth can be painful. The Valcos family is crumbling in the face of Drew's situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can not buy what you want! The acting and writing are mediocre, but the leading cast pulls him to the final stage.
