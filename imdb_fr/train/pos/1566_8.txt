Leslie Charteris' series of novels about the adventures of Simon Templar ("The Saint"), a little suspicious, was presented on screen in the late 1930s, with George Sanders in the annals as Templar. It was a wise choice - Sanders generally played villains with occasional "nice roles" (ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, the title hero in Harry's Strange Case, Robert Montgomery's "best friend" framed in RAGE IN HEAVEN) . Here, his will to circumvent the rules and break a law briefly corresponded to his "heavy character", while his beauty and his suave behavior made Templar a goofy hero worthy of "Boston Blackie" of Chester Morris and (in a some extent) from Peter Lorre "Mr. Moto". <br /> <br /> Movies are not the best series of mysterious movie series, but they are useful. Like the Rathbone Holmes series or the Oland's Chan series, the series often had actors rehearing or playing new roles (the anti-heroine in the film here was interpreted by Wendy Barrie, who would appear in a second film of the series). This somewhat familiar set of films makes the series a comfortable experience for viewers, who hear the buzz of dialogue (still showing Sanders' brain while staying one step ahead of the bad guys), without noticing the obvious flaws intrigue. All these mysteries have flaws because even the best writers of the genre can not help repeating, over and over, old ideas. <br /> <br /> Here is the moment when it happened when one of the actors admitted his affection for Barrie, which she had been aware for a long time. Shortly after, he tries to protect her from the police. But since the film was about the identity of a criminal brain, it became clear that this person was noble enough to deserve to be the mysterious brain (the scenario disguised him as the least likely suspect). <br /> <Barrie is after proof that his father (who died in prison) was charged by the real criminals in a robbery robbery. She is assisted by several people - cups like William Gargan - and the brain gives her advice on planning embarrassing burglaries that can not be blamed on her. The D.A. who sentenced his father (Jerome Cowan) is determined to get Barrie and his band. The only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is Jonathan Hale, who watches over Sanders but works reluctantly with him. <br /> <br /> The distribution presents good moments in the scenario - Hale (currently on a special diet) is tempted to eat a rich lobster meal prepared for Sanders by Willie Best. As a result, he has a very bad stomach, which allowed Sanders and Barrie to flee his apartment. The best is to remind him (when he feels better) to go to a place where Sanders told him to go at some point. <br /> <br /> Gilbert Emery also has an interesting role to play. Usually playing honest people (like the abused husband in BETWEEN WORKDS), he plays here a socially dominant weak - whose demise recalls that of a character in a Bogart film. <br /> <br /> Overall, a film made for the second half of a movie night in 1939. It will entertain you even if it does not stay in your memory.
