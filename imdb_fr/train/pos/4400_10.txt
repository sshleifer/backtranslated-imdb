The star of this film is the script. Attention to detail for the period in dress, language, social mores (we do not hurt women) and politics are remarkable. This is a reminder of Kosovo today. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb. Maybe this film is too close to reality to deserve the support it should have received. It's like a staircase of increasing violence with pauses of peace and serenity punctuated between each stage. A great movie ....
