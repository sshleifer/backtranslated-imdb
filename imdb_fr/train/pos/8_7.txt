Very good drama although there seems to be some blank areas leaving the viewers to fill the action for themselves. I can imagine that life is like this for someone who can not read or write. This film simply smelled of the real world: the woman who is suddenly the only support, the living parents and their quarrels, the troubled child who is put on the carpet, then, as a rule, abandons school, a foolish husband who takes nest and buys beer with her. 2 bravo.
