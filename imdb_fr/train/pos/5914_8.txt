MPAA: R rated for violence, language, nudity and addiction. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Note Home Video: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today. This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After watching Fritz The Cat, I wanted to see more Bashki movies. I saw Cool World and found it mediocre. I saw that. As soon as it was released, the film was very controversial. He was considered racist and Al Sharpton wanted the film to be banned. He even staged demonstrations in front of the theater where he was The film was released only on VHS under the title "Street Fight" .It is now considered a cult classic film. African-American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and rap group The Wu-Tang Clan are I personally thought that Fritz The Cat was a much better movie, but it's also very nice. Also interesting to watch for fans of Bashki or Blaxploitation. The film mixes real action and animation much like the movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit.I would have preferred it in full animation but The film begins with a reverend and another man running to save two of their friends from prison . While the prisoners wait, the oldest tells the story of three men he knew. The film then goes to animation, we see three Black men who sold their home to this man.They decide to make a name for Harlem.So the leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in Harlem and he basically becomes a great shooter. the mafia involves the godfather, his three sons who are gay and an Italian clown. Coonskin is an entertaining animated film that is worth watching if you can find it.
