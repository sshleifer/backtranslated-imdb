I saw this film at the cinema when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved it at the time and I recently acquired a VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year olds love this movie and ask me again and again to watch it. <br /> <br /> I also liked to watch it. Although I have to admit that it is not as good on a small television. <br /> <br /> I do not have any older children, so I do not know what they would think. <br /> <br /> The songs are very cute. My daughter continues to sing them again and again. <br /> <br /> I hope this will help you.
