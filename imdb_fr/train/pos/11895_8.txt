Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer, who is going through a bad divorce. She wants her freedom but it has a cost. She wants to legitimize photography but is hired to work in the tabloids as a paparazzi. His boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was well written most of the time. TEA's Nora was starting to become a memorable character, but the network simply did not support comedy and they still do not. Even when they brought George Wendt from Cheers, they made useless changes to the cast and characters. At first, the show was good and the audience got used to it, but the network messed it up like bad plastic surgery.
