This film is extremely rhythmic, you never need to wait for a belly laugh to come more than a minute and there is much more than the initial premise of the film. Throughout this one, there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy kind of boys-made-well-surmounted-adversaries of which this parody is made. Do not let anyone tell you that they are trying to have cheap laughs by simply using obscenities - of course, there are many, but it's quite contextual, not free. I loved this movie and it only cost me Â£ 2.99 on DVD, making it the best movie I've ever seen this year.
