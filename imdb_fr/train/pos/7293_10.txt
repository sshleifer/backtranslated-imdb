What do I say about an absolutely beautiful film? I saw this in Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon considering it's my main city. I am a big fan of science fiction and I like action movies. I stayed up all night and was about to call him one day when I noticed that this movie was broadcast in the morning. It's not an action movie or science fiction of any kind. Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of Witchblade or Eric Etebari, having watched a few episodes (his performance in it seemed fictional and robotic). But he managed to really convince me in this performance. I really mean to win. Having seen Cellular, I did not think there was much to do for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was simply amazing. He was extremely convincing as an evil demon. But there were so many details in depth in this character that I was absolutely surprised. I then searched online and found out that Eric won the Best Actor Award, which is well deserved, since it's the best of his career and he earned my respect. Now, I continue to read about the effect of this and the production of this project and let me just say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry Brian). It was fine, but I was even more impressed by the story - which, I think, was even more his goal (See movies like Godzilla with huge effects really disgusts me). I could not sleep after this movie by thinking it over and over in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never easy. I showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her to have lived with abuse. It is a film that I constantly think about and highly recommend.
