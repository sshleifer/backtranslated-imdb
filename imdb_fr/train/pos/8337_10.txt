Being a big fan of the genre of romantic comedy, and having seen so many of these films, it is rare that I seem totally unique. Moreover, it is just as rare that I hold my breath through the bursts of laughter during several scenes. The love story is a bit thin on the ground, but I would say it's probably for the better, because this romantic comedy strongly insists on "comedy" and, in any case, it spreads a little more credibility I like most Roma coms to do. The four scientists provided some of the funniest moments, not just in this movie, but in all the movies I've seen for a long time. I hesitated a few moments before finally choosing a "10" against a "9", because I feel that too many people use it indiscriminately, so that the maximum rating loses part of its impact. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan, which helps, but it's one of the few movies I've seen in which I'd say it's completely eclipsed. She and Tim Robbins are the main actors, but for me, I am the second violin of the silly idiots. A real laugh-strong-fort movie.
