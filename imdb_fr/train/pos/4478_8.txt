All in all, it's a delightful romantic and cheerful musical comedy. I suppose a small case could be made for the film to be too long. But I'm not sure what you would dismiss. What are Kelly and Sinatra doing? Kelly's fabulous dance? No. How long does the film take to develop the plot and develop the relationships between the characters? No (this seems to be a frequent complaint many times that newer movies do not develop the characters). <br /> <br /> Some comment that Iturbi did not bring much to the film but that gives us a chance to see and hear a great talent of the 1040s. And if he was not an actor? It was an important part of the film because the basic plot was to audition Grayson. <br /> <br /> Originally, Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer took her to the MGM for an on-screen test including an air. During her audition in the film, there is a picture of MGM's brass shaking her head and smiling. You can just imagine it was like that when she did her real screen test years ago. <br /> <br /> This film is so full of life that it is difficult to achieve all the strengths. The color and lighting were widely used throughout the film. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he made. A good counter-point in the movie is how Sinatra (a women's man then) played the role of just wanting to find a date during her leave. You will feel good after watching this movie. 7/10
