I bought this game on an impulsive purchase from Walmart. I'm glad I did it. It was very fun to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I thought the graphics were the best I've ever seen in a movie / game remake. The bonus levels were very difficult! The sniper I found too hard made me so frustrated that I did not play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide or life to handle. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was the upgrade system. I did not notice any difference between un-upgraded hardware and upgraded product, for example, buying an armor upgrade did not seem to make the armor tougher or fuller on my meter of life. I really liked the helicopter Q. I think the developers did a good job.
