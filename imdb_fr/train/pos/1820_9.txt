I remember this movie when I was little, I loved it then and I still do it now. I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and I was delighted because I found it so hard to find it before and it was only rented when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he is learning to be a good dog. The film is full of fun songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the voices of the characters are perfect. This film has always been a tearful to me, but I think that if I had not seen it when I was little, I would not find it as bright and fascinating as me, even if I still believe that I will love it again because I'm really in animation.
