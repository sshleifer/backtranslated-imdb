I just saw him at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's a good story, told convincingly. The approach of the portable camera for action scenes has added to the intensity of these scenes (in a documentary style, not in a Blair Witch style). Joel Schumacher shows that he does not need a big budget to produce a captivating film. <br /> <br /> The actors were strong, especially the actor playing the main role in the events of the film, Boz.
