Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters literally run through the entire film, continuing because of strange circumstances and comical coincidences. As they run, we see what's going on in their minds and how they got where they are. Running is a metaphor for the lives of those unlucky. In a way, what they are looking for in reality is not what they originally wanted, but to make sense of their lives and to escape their personal problems and broken dreams. Running allows them to really feel alive. The great, life-threatening running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally find themselves in the middle of something big, violent and so absurd that it's funny, smart. One of my favorite movies of all time by genius director Sabu.
