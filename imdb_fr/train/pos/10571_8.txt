James Cagney is best known for his tough characters and gangster roles, but he has also played quite a few "sweet" characters in his career. This musical is one of them and it's the first film, but not the last. Cagney will even be a little sung and danced. And it must be said that it was not bad in this area. He plays the role with a lot of confidence. He had apparently had dance jobs in his early days before his acting career began to take off, so it's not a strange thing that he also played in musical roles during his career . He obviously feels equally at home in this kind totally different from the one most people are used to. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, who was perhaps one of the best directors of the genre. . His early musicals of the 1930s defined the musical genre and he was also responsible for genre films such as "42nd Street". His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comical than anything else. The musicals of the 30's never really covered his singing. It was something that appeared more in the 1940s and later, musicals, mostly MGM studios. <br /> <br /> As usual, a simple and light story takes place in In the musical world, this is of course also predictable and progresses according to a formula. It's nevertheless a fun and simple story that also makes it an entertaining movie to watch. It's the same for the characters and the actors who describe them. It's a bit odd that the film's total screenplay is somehow abandoned towards the end of the film, when the film only begins to consist of musical number routines. <br /> <br /> The musical moments towards the end of the film is also fun and well done, although I'm not a big fan of the genre itself. Once again, the musical numbers also include a young Billy Barty. he has often played in little boys / babies / mice and more at the beginning of his career, including in the musical "Gold Diggers of 1933" of the previous year. <br /> <br /> A first genre film to recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
