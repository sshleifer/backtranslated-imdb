I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorite actors and one of the cutest of all time. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I saw most of his films, but all those of Jeremy Jordan. The thing I do not like about Twisted Desire is when "Nick" is arrested and "Jennifer" demolishes him. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is The Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
