I saw the film a few days back on a videotape and although it was difficult to swallow it at once (because of its length and its story), I liked it a lot. I was impressed first by the script, then by the realization of this script. The movie takes you on a tour, but it's not an easy and joyful ride; it crosses time and different political regimes and shows its influence on the lives of ordinary people. What I liked was the inner logic followed by the film. logic, which, just like logic in life, was rather illogical and confusing sometimes but finally, when I thought about it, all the events and twists had meaning. It makes no sense to try to retell the story that is spreading in more than 50 years. I also really liked the character of Nikita Mikhalkov, Aleksei, and the way he interpreted it, as some critics would say, with restless abandon. What I did not like was that I think he later played characters that reminded me of Aleksei in such films as "Cruel Romance" (The Romans of Zhestokij, which I like a lot) and, in to a certain extent, in "Insults and the wounded". ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "Sibiriada" shows, I think, what was a great filmmaker, Andrei Konchalovski, before going to Hollywood and making forgettable films such as "Tango and Cash" and less forgettable as "Runaway train". I would prefer "Kurochka Ryaba" to them ...
