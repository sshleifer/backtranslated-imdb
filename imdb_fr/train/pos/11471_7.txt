I'm a big movie fan and I saw this movie because I heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say that it was very interesting. The two main actors are great, the film is not boring and the concept behind it (although inspired by the murders of Columbine and the movies at the house of the assassins) is really interesting. There are certain weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes that really ruin the realism of the first hour and the end really does not make sense. The shaky camera can sometimes be a distraction, but in the cinema, it's a given. But I still think that the film is very well done and that the director Ben Coccio deserves a little credit.
