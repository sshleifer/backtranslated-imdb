A Bugs Life is a very good movie, intended not only for children, but also for adults. The story unfolds around a colony of ants and their fight against the devilish Grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food (A mirror of the seven beautiful). There is a great computer animation and the voices are excellent too. You will love it !! 8 out of 10
