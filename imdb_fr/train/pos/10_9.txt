I am not a man but a feminine film, but it's really a well done story. I have no personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but she does a great job, while DeNiro is her usual super. Everything is so well done: actor, director, visual, settings, photography, casting. If you can enjoy a story of real people and true love, it's a winner.
