This is one of the less profound episodes in which the plot really seemed like an excuse to have fun. BUT, I enjoyed this light approach and it's really one of the best episodes to see at a level of pure pleasure. Think about it. The crew met the White Rabbit and Wonderland Alice, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight on horseback who kills McCoy, and a host of other seemingly strange events that make no sense at all. until the end. Despite all the danger, you can not take everything very seriously - it's too much fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's great.
