As a person who has never practiced sport, it seems difficult to enter football (or as the Americans inexplicably call it, football) with the theme "Bend It Like Beckham". But I must say it was a cool movie! Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her friend WASP, Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I'll tell the British and international) and love footballer David Beckham. But traditional Sikh parents of Jesminder do not approve (his mother offers a really delirious description of football at the beginning of the film). Ok, so maybe it was a bit of a clich√© in that sense, but you have to love this movie! And if like me, you go in this film without knowing the definition of "turn" in football ... do not worry, the film explains (I had never heard of David Beckham before this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley hit hard: a few months after "BILB" was released in the United States, she played in the no less cool "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl".
