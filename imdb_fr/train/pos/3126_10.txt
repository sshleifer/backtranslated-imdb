I do not easily give ten stars. A movie must really impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum went well beyond that. In addition, this trilogy has come together so well that I think it's one of the greatest film trilogies of our time. Although the three films can no longer be different from Ludlum's novels, they are still a powerful marker of cinematic success. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the show was over, but I could not stop smiling for hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment the opening title appeared, I knew that we would find ourselves walking. Paul Greengrass did it again. All we liked about previous Bourne films is back here: the action, the dialogues and, of course, the shaky camera. However for me, it has never been a problem. I think that adds to the suspense. <br /> <br /> I will come back to see this film several times before it's released on DVD, simply because it's a genius. This is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and one that should stand the test of time as a fantastic film and, in all, an unforgettable trilogy.
