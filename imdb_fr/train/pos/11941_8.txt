Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell of "His Girl Friday" do not joke either the witty detective William Powell and the sassy lady Myrna Loy of Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are astonishingly charming as scoop amateur detectives. Their distribution is more postmodern than post-depressive, Allen's writing is full of ironic disgust and New York anxiety. The nuances of the old spirit rarely occur, as when, as Sid, the magician of the Great Splendini, tells his past: "I was born in Hebrew persuasion, but with age, I converted to narcissism." Johansson, fresh out of Allen's Match Point as a bad girl, becomes a relatively good, sometimes sordid, journalism student, caught in a murder-killing mystery in London: a serial killer. The plot is a redesign of his matchpoint London thriller, which runs until then, to the sins of the upper classes and the "accident" of the "American Tragedy" / Place in the Sun. In fact, Allen is reworking Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo to name just a few examples. I do not care if he works again; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the original and, alas, it only reflects its greater size. <br /> <br /> Allen as a director and actor does not hide his love for the actress, as he could not for Diane Keaton, and so takes a mediocre comedy in a proper place of the Allen gun, not great but amusing, sometimes brilliantly satirical: About the alleged killer of the upper classes, Sid (Allen) "I would be very surprised if he killed a person." This is Allen's vintage humor. Although there are hardly brilliant literary allusions as in most of his films, he insists in Scoop with music by Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss, to let us know that Woodman has not lost his class.
