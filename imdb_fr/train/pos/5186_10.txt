I was delighted to finally see the DVD release of Amazing Stories the first season. I had forgotten which group of actors and stellar directors were working on this series. For a very long time, the only way to see this remarkable series was with the VHS 2 or 3 episode collections or when Sci-Fi was re-launching the episodes. However, when Sci-Fi organized the reruns, they usually stuck to the same episodes. There have been some notable episodes of season 1, like The Mission, which they have not repeated. Does anyone know exactly how long this series has lasted? Here, IMDb indicates that 1985 to 1987 is at the top, but I thought it would last more than two years. If you liked Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
