Joan Fontaine plays the role of the villain in this film of the Victorian era. She convincingly embodies the role of the married woman who has a lover side and also turns to a rich man, Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is good enough like Miles. Miss Fontaine played her role perfectly: she was at once cunning, calculating, innocent, frightened, and charming. It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to succeed that. Joan Fontaine was absolutely beautiful in the elegant costumes of Travis Banton. Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine, plays Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.
