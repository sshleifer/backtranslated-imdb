Reviewed at the world premiere on September 9, 2006, at the Isabel Bader Theater at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> This had an interesting principle, but seemed to last too long with too many shots. piles of electronic waste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables, etc. shipped by the ton in China, then sorted and reconfigured into new products for resale) and other desolations. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers have tried to get more interviews with people to strengthen the human element, but they have often been prevented from doing so because of Chinese censorship. Yet what was there was interesting. The pieces of an upscale real estate agent from Shanghai who lamented and strutted to show off his luxurious mansion and his gardens, interspersed with scenes from those living in medieval conditions, were particularly striking. The first 480m traveling shot of the factory was equally interesting. Scenes from the Three Gorges Dam project activity also complemented Jia Khang-je's films at TIFF (the feature film Still Life / Sanxia Haoren and the documentary Dong) that were also designed around this topic. <br /> <br /> Director Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick de Pencier, filmmaker Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all on the scene for a question-and-answer session following the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced by the public and was thanked as the most important person who contributed to the field access in China itself.
