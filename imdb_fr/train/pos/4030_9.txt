This film was absolutely beautiful. The time and culture before the score were recreated beautifully. Urmila gave another brilliant performance. What I really admire in this film is that it does not resort to the Pakistani crackdown on movies like Gadar and LOC. With the score in the background, the film does not focus on political issues or violence or what is right or wrong. The film is still centered on the tragic story of Urmila's life. His fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai has been very well described. The film actually shows how the people, Hindu and Muslim, suffered from this partition. The theme that there is only one religion is really predominant in this film.
