Once again, Stacy Peralta is first and foremost true for people who have lived through history. By letting the people involved in the genesis of the big wave surf tell us their stories, how they felt and what they thought, we feel we've been there. The film transports you from the fifties to the present, focusing on three major architects contributing to the evolution and development of the sport. The candid "home movies", like videos of themselves and their contemporaries, take you further into their world. The layers of music, culture, technical information, a pure view of the participant's athleticism and fabulous images with big waves give you a complete perspective of this aspect of surfing. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit.
