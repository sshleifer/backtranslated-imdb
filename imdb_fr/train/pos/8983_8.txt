Shot in the vehicle from the windshield, someone plays his last song to someone else, someone else did not react, according to the voiceover. I'm just wondering how that was done. There were too many scenes in this movie and I wondered why there was a camera. If the filmed scenes where the Warhols descended on a party after BJM are true, then it was an inexcusable exploitation to the maximum, otherwise it was a total fabrication, anyway it made me feel uncomfortable, if was the goal? Throughout this film, I always wondered how the film was born. Taken literally, it is a beautiful portrait of the (tortured) genius that we all believe.
