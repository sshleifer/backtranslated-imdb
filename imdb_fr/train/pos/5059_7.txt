We watched the VCR and found it fascinating. Knowing nothing of this true story, I thought, "Oh, no, P.Brosnan as an American Indian (Indian" red "in the movie), what a bad choice" until I discover the truth about Gray Owl: The film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these Aboriginal people and undermining the racist myths about them, and Annie Galipeau, WOW, how beautiful, and very convincing as an Indian (I think she is Canadian) she is definitely returning to the well-known discourse of this genre.) In spite of Brosnan's detached and grumbling style, he finally convinces as a passionate and devoted man.The plot is a little weak in the demonstration of his conversion from trapper to conservative animal Good film, highly recommended.
