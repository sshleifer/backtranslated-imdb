The first season was amazing, the idea that they adapted to the island while mysteries were explored (and seen) was phenomenal. filled with suspense, tons of cliffhangers, and an incredible plot. I love the idea of ​​seeing them get used to the island. And then seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my eye. From there, I became addicted. The second season was tied with the first season, but a little better. I really loved the idea of ​​traps and the DHARMA initiative. The plot and sequences of Season 2 were mysterious, scary and exciting. I loved all the suspense surrounding others on the island, but the story of DHARMA really made the season 2 amazing. <br /> <br /> Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but still, great. I loved seeing the stories of others, seeing their camp and seeing the mysteries further explored. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, though less successful, was breathtaking and fun, but most of all exciting! Now the 4th season. I had hope for this season and the first two episodes are good, but it really started to get boring and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY scorn the new "rescuers" like Miles and Daniel. The plot has aged after the first episodes ... and most of ... Season 4 was stripped of something that made LOST a perfect series: mystery, suspense, mixed comedy (Charlie is gone) and the general excitement. In addition, some of my favorite characters are gone.
