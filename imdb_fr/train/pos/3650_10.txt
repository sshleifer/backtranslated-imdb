Sometimes, luck smiles on me. Originally, I had copied and copied a VHS tape from this wonderful TV show. My heart broke when I realized what I had done since I could not get a copy anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Recently, I subscribed to digital cable and, while looking in future movies, The Surprise was a scheduled show of the movie. However, this time, I made a copy on DVD, so there was no chance of repeating my mistake. <br /> <br /> I finally found it after eight years. It was as exciting and tense as when I saw it for the first time. There is a bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with "Pandora's Clock" came with a live reading of the book on public radio. I happened to tune in the radio station on my way home for lunch and from the first payment, I became hooked. Every day, I was looking forward to reading the next chapter. <br /> <br /> When I learned a few months later that the book was going to be shown on television as a film, I made sure to clear my calendar for this event. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the film was very faithful to the book, contrary to what another critic had said. This in itself is a rare achievement for TV movies. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others on the casting. I could not imagine a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film could have crashed and be engraved without the proper distribution of this essential role. Anderson has never been so good, and it's a pity we have not seen him more often. In fact, everyone in the cast did a great job. <br /> <br /> My only criticism of the film - and the book - was the interjection of the "terrorist plot" to arm a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and its pilot to fly and shoot down the struck plane. . Basically, we are talking about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this, and people are just not realistic at all considering all the players involved. It was also unrealistic for the airliner to be affected by having had a first plane and then two engines turned off. <br /> <br /> With beef aside, I enjoyed the suspense of construction and found that the reaction of foreign governments were described in the film, as well as ours. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do it absolutely.
