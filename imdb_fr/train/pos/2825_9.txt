This film was a surprise. To be honest, I was not expecting much. The first Hollywood movie of Greta Garbo? So what? Probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated contortions of arms and face that low quality dumb movies show so often. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo just had to shock the people of the studio as much as she did to me, because this movie made her a star, and rightly so. She instinctively understood the power to stand still, or simply hold a meaningful expression for a long moment, so that its effect was noticeable and not simply seen. I kept thinking about myself, how did this modern actress get into a silent, squeaky movie? She was just years and years ahead of her time. <br /> <br /> The story is not so interesting, it's the usual story of lost and found love. It is only the performance of Garbo as Leonora, the poor village girl who succeeds in the big city and then comes back for the escaped man, who gives him life. The co-star Ricardo Cortez is useful, but his character is never really developed and he is always humiliated by the scenario. At one point, he is forced to wear Garbo's clothes, to leave in a breath, then to return and make them ignominiously. And do not even talk about his horrible final scenes with Garbo and his wife. Too ordinary, he did not have much career after that and I can understand why. But it is enough as a somewhat mystifying object of Leonora's obsession. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely fantastic phrase in this film that says it all. "Leonora, you become visible." Yes, it is noticeable. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it's all about without seeing the whole movie, just look at the last 30 seconds or so - Garbo's gaze as she sits alone in his luxury car indicates everything. "She must be so happy, she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face speaks volumes. I have to see this one again, Garbo is just amazing.
