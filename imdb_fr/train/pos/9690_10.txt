Paulie was cute, cool, nice and rather fulfilling. I went to this film hoping to see a typical "family" film, a film that would find me in a moment unconscious and drooling on the ground. My mind changed immediately when I was quickly captivated by the safety of the film. It is rare for you to find a complete family movie that can be described as "healthy". Most are made, written and produced cheaply only to attract young family members, who then drag the unfortunate elders into an anesthetic state of mind that gives 65 minutes of gags and conspiracies overused. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Paulie had a lot. He told the story of a young girl (Marie) and her best friend, Paulie the parrot, who could talk incredibly and often talked to her often. Marie's father, Marie's idiot, found this incredible and thought Paulie was detrimental to the mental health of her 4-year-old daughter. He quickly tore them up. We follow Paulie's adventures (and mishaps) as he tries to get together with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters along the way. Oh yes, Paulie could really (intelligently) speak and had a quick New Jersey accent. Cool. The plot held thick and entertaining throughout, keeping me attracted. Paulie is the best family film I've ever seen and loved. Already. Seriously. Take a copy and get comfortable to watch a family movie, with the whole family. Not sleeping. I promise.
