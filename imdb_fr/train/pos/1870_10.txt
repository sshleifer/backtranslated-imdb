This movie is great! It touched my cold stone heart. I can not tell you about Antwone's racial discrimination because I live in my own country. I guess it's really hard to be discriminated against. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie during our sociology class at New Era University, and I did not know it was a true story, I thought it had just been created by an intellectual who wants to bring a new breath into the industry. It is very good. <br /> <br /> What shocked me was when Nadine sexually abused Antwone (who was only six). If I were in his place, I could have jumped into a ten-storey building. I salute him for his vigor! <br /> <br /> The scene that touched me is where Antwone finally saw her mother Eva face to face. He did not piss him off or anything, instead, he talked about the successes he's had in the long years that they've been separated. (I think I'll do it when I have the opportunity to trace my roots.)
