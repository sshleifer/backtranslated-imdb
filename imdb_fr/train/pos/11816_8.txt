It was very fun! I have never read these comics of Chester-Gould, but you do not need to know them. Perhaps there have been inner jokes that I did not understand, but what the eye does not see, the heart can not cry. It's a film so ironic and colorful that the actors are in a good mood together. The setting is similar to that of movies ?? Batman`, but not so dark and gray. The story is not so original, but there is a plot (which is not obvious) and a more or less surprising end. <br /> <br /> With this movie, you could play an interesting game, if you look at it with friends. Do not look at the credits at the beginning, then find out who is the fastest to know who the famous actors are under their makeup!
