As far as the movies are concerned, I can be quite difficult and I will complain about everything that is badly done. Although each film has its flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low number. <br /> <br /> If you read the last article (it was difficult, because half was written in capital letters and contained no information the film), you may have been led to believe that this film was not not too well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines in this same review, you discover the disdain motive of the poster: he / she does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes crack ... apparently). <So, despite the fact that I never wrote a critic, I thought that this film deserved one based on its merits, and not on the sexual orientation of its director. Let's first look at a quick checklist: 1. Big conspiracy? Absolutely. I will not reveal, but the plot is very convincing and does not correspond to what you would expect from the ads. It's a thriller, not a horror, and you have to approach it as such. The story will really surprise you, especially since it's true (and the plot has remained very faithful to current events). <br /> <br /> 2. Wonderful game? Oh yes. A long time ago, Robin Williams freed himself from the chains of comedy distribution. Since then, he has flourished into serious roles for which many people would have dismissed him just ten years ago. He once again fulfills his role in The Night Listener, in a role of radio presenter more and more troubled and entangled in a matter of ... well, I let you see for yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent direction? Certainly. Now, unlike the other poster I referred to, I know something about the direction. It's been 3 years since I master the art of leadership at school. Of course, I really do not think it makes a difference (the only thing that matters is that YOU love the direction), but I thought that I should simply establish once more that I base my opinions here on something substantial and serious. relevant ... for example: not the director's sexual orientation (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL). <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner's orientation was dark and dark, and he left the angles and lighting to help create those much-desired feelings of "tension and release" rather than messy camera work and fast and the fast cuts that we suffer so often today. Some people can really show you a story through their camera, while others feel compelled to make history with the camera. I really appreciate that someone today has the courage to use the camera as if it were meant to be used, which is an eye through which we can all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, cinematography and editing? Great all around. I have already written a lot and I could talk about these last three things for ten more paragraphs. I will finish. <br /> <br /> In short, go see this movie. Do not listen to people who have other reasons to criticize it, especially if they are so stupid that they unconsciously reveal this motive a quarter of their way. Enjoy the show! -Ben
