I went to see Hamlet because I was in between jobs. I thought 4 hours would be great, I was a fan of Branagh; Dead Again, Henry V. I was completely upset by the staging, the staging, the cinematography that this film captured. Like other critics, the 4 hours pass quickly. Branagh does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for that. When I watch this film, I constantly look for faults, I look at the blunders and I did not notice them. How he could move the camera in and out of the room with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This film was shot in 70 mil. It's unfortunate that Columbia did not release a widescreen version of VHS. I have a DVD player and I will come back to Titanic any day. So Columbia, if you listen, put this film as it should! And I do not know what happened at the Oscars. This should have swept best film, best actor, best director, best cinematography. What movies did they watch? I felt sorry for Branagh at the Oscars when he paid tribute to Shakespeare on screen. They should have paid tribute to Branagh for bringing us one of the greatest movies of all time.
