A second installment axellent who manages to be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, the cast is beautiful. I like the fact that the first and second episodes have nothing in common except the mind and the intelligence. <br /> <br /> The second episode is just funny, very ridiculous and very nice. This is the very first Christmas episode about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer disguised as Santa after killing her own husband. Just like the first episode; karma. <br /> <br /> The most humorous scene is a link between the murder of her husband and his phone call, first simulating his fear until it becomes real.
