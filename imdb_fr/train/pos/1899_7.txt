Arthur Bach needs to grow, but unfortunately it's not the only thing to do. According to his extremely wealthy father, Arthur must marry a wealthy Susan Johnson or he is cut off from the family's money (for $ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur does not like Susan (although I hear that she makes good chicken) and has just fallen in love with the waitress and the saleswoman Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting guy. It's really a big kid, born in wealth with at least one person watching him every second of every day. Working just rubs Arthur in the wrong way - he likes to have fun, be a woman and of course, drink. Drinking gives Arthur a kind of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; and even if it puts in all kinds of problems, it's absolutely hilarious to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is very much here in this film as Arthur, winner of an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe for his performance. Moore is fantastic with the comic aspects of the film, transforming the already funny replicas into unforgettable comic gold, but he is also good at bringing Arthur back to a comparable level and making the character friendly. Moore gets help in co-stars department - Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, a keen person Arthur can not get enough of, and John Gielgud is great as Arthur Hobson's butler. Gielgud won the Best Supporting Actor for his performance in this film, and there is no reason to doubt it. Hobson has a quick wit and a hard mind, but he's still looking for Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordon's 1981 film Arthur is short and simple but offers lots of laughs.
