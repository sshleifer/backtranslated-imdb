TIllman Jr.'s drama about the first African-American Navy diver (Gooding Jr.), who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite an extremely bitter coach. The scenario is not bad, sometimes a little extreme, but the staging and the acting are excellent, and this film is a source of inspiration and realizes what it is supposed to do. I loved DeNiro in mind, even if it is not up to his masterpieces (taxi driver, godfather, etc.), it's as good as his other good performances as King of Comedy or Angel Heart . DeNiro is always convincing and credible here, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, definitely one of his best performances. --- IMDb rating: 6.6, my grade: 9/10
