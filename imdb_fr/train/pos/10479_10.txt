It's a movie that was recommended to me by my dentist and I'm glad he did it! The mix of British humor (should I say, humor?) And the reality of a lost middle-aged widow who was trying to maintain her lifestyle was a real delusion. Add to that the reality of what it takes to grow pot (these plants under the shrubs would NOT succeed without the tlc they received), and it's a really hilarious but touching film. I laugh whenever I evoke the vision of all the customers of the bar sitting in their garden chairs with sunglasses counting the lights! Maybe it's just my blood from Mendocino County, but the British have definitely got that right !! 10/10
