EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the enthusiasm that should have come from the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago. This film is really unique and a work of genius. The editing and editing are brilliant and, combined with the alienation narrative tropes used in the film, create a disturbing and unforgettable cinematographic experience. <br /> <br /> Barbara Suwkowa's participation in Eddie Constantine is two guilty pleasures that must be seen and appreciated. Max Von Sydow provides his superb voice as a narrator. <br /> <br /> A unique film of its kind! Four stars (highest ranking).
