This film is one of the few Indian films not to disappear with time or its appeal that would bind, even if Indian cinema turns into an abyss of artificial style pop culture while extras to enhance the PT cinematographic songs of style. <br /> <br /> The cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of Josef Werching which accentuate the monumental and cinematographic effect of the film in its entirety. <br /> <br /> Gone are the days of the great cinema, where each scene had to be cut several times and taken again before finalizing it, while meticulous attention was paid to the creation and editing of scenes. Some of her poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity, as in the case where Meena Kumari refuses to say "YES" as an endorsement of Nikah (conjugal bond) and goes down the hill while she is crazy about traumatic frenzy. At present, Raj Kumar is following her and a violent wind is blowing Kumari's veil on Kumar's legs ........ <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi will always be remembered with words from gold in the annals of the history of Indian cinema for trying to finish this film in a 12-year record. He had to shoot some of the most important songs without the close-ups of Meena, as Meena Kumari, the woman who played the leading role, was terminally ill and struggling for her life in early 1971.
