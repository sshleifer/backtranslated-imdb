I saw this movie last night after having waited until it was distributed here in Canada (still in limited version). It was worth the wait and then some. I am a very passionate reader of Margaret Laurence and was pleased to see that this novel was becoming a film. In fact, I ended up loving the movie better than the novel. I liked that Bram Shipley's character is a little less hard and there seems to be more romance between Hagar and Bram, making the scenes at the end of Bram's life even more touching. . The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was no nicer in the film than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in that role. She was Hagar through and through. Christine Horne has been brilliant and still has a lot of beautiful things in front of her. His scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could go on and on, overall, a 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and can not wait for it to come out on DVD, a must for my collection!
