It is a film about deep and unexpressed human relationships. <br /> <br /> They end up being spoken, but is there a chance to change the situation? <br /> <br /> Initially manufactured in Shanghai in 1948 and very free of propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai family. The story of the family still has weight. The story usually has weight in Chinese literature and serious movies. <br /> <br /> A young married couple - Liyan, an invalid, and his wife, Yuwen, live in a large family complex that was once in ruins. <br /> <A striking contrast is Liyan's younger sister who can not really remember the family's past but who accepts everything in a natural way. His mind is as bright as the other two are reserved. <br /> <br /> In this seemingly stable world, an unexpected visitor comes along ... <br /> <br /> I end up feeling pretty sad - but definitely a top movie.
