This is one of the most daring and important films of what are known as "Pre-Code" movies shot in Hollywood during the 1930s. Unlike some pre-code movies that sometimes covered topics that would never have been allowed after 1934-1925, this movie was completely immersed in a very sordid but entertaining plot from start to finish. The conventional morality of the late '30s and forties was certainly not evident in this film, as it was essentially a woman accomplice sleeping to the top - no apology. This "wide" likes both sex and use it on all men who could help him get rich - something you would never have seen in movies shot two or three years later. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Barbara Stanwyck works in her father's speakeasy. In addition to being his boss, he is also his pimp and encourages him to sleep with a local government official to allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity. Although this is not particularly clear here, it seems that Daddy "praises" his daughter's body for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, after almost being raped and attacked this man by breaking a bottle of beer his skull, Barbara has enough and goes to the big city. It did not hurt that the victim had even exploded and killed her father, but she had the feeling that she was indulging herself and that she had nothing to show, as that seemed to be the momentum necessary to move. <br /> <br /> Despite the depression. Barbara uses sex to find a job in a huge mega-bank. As an archive clerk, she starts a nice little job, but in the space of just a few weeks, she goes from one job to another - until she sleeps with the bank manager. . and his future son-in-law !!! All this ends in a tragedy, but Babs does not seem upset by the death of these two men. In fact, a little later, she manages to creep into the life of the NEW CEO and, once again, she is at the top (perhaps in more ways than one). <br /> <br /> wonderful movie because he was so hard and unrepentant. Barbara played a 100% sociopath - a woman without morals or conscience - just the desire to make the most of her life, no matter who is injured. However, courageous writers and producers have "deflated" and have found it important to aim for a redemptive end. Considering that this woman was so mean and so accomplice, her change of heart at the end was a great disappointment and strongly detracted from the film. In many ways, it reminded me of the end of JEZEBEL - again, a perverse person "sees the light" and changes to the not-so-convincing conclusion. <br /> <br /> My advice is to: try to look at the woman with red head and down. RED-HEADED WOMAN looks a lot like BABY FACE, but does not involve any magical transformation at the end. The main woman is really a skunk! In DOWNSTAIRS, a film very similar to RED-HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed and a man (John Gilbert) plays a similar connivance character. Both are classics and are a bit better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is an astonishing curio of a brief period of Hollywood films, often ultra-sleazy and, in this perspective, it is worth seeing by Cinephiles. In addition, fans of The Duke take note - John Wayne plays a very small role in the film and it is very unusual to see a very young Wayne play such a conventional role.
