The mother is one of those movies you know is good, maybe even awesome, but it's like eating vegetables or doing math homework, it's for a kid - too much work and a lot of pain for him invest. <br /> <br /> The story is potentially unpleasant in many ways: the death of a character in the first half-hour, the romance of December-May, the idea of ​​a man cheating on his wife and then deceiving her lover with her mother, the collection of weak, rather unpleasant, thirty-year-old characters, the apparent indifference of adults to children in their lives. This film was shot in 2002 or 2003, but is a throwback to a collection of British movies (usually made for television) of the late 1980s - it has a moral severity that never lets go, which produces a enveloping throbbing anguish. . <br /> <br /> The mother is flawless, but that's part of the problem; if a film dealing with so many sensitive subjects has flaws - inconsistencies in the scenario, lesser actors - it has a little perverted, but if such a film is as perfect, the viewing is crude and painful. Even the technical qualities - lighting, editing, etc. - hurts the viewer; London in this film is bright and open, filled with raw and sharp light. <br /> <br /> If you are tough, or if you are one of those super sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with guts. sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy the mother. Anyone comes in, drops or be ready to squirm. And be warned: as difficult as the movie is from start to finish, the worst is yet to come. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to come to terms. for that (for sleeping with her boyfriend), and the girl said calmly that she thought about it and would like to hit her. The mother agrees, the two get up and - instead of a slap well prepared - the girl closes her fist and carries the blow of the boxer. Argh !!!
