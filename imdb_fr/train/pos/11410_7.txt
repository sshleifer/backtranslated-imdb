EDMUND LOWE (who reminds me a little Warren William) is leading the cast of an interesting little mystery that advances at a steady pace and runs a little over an hour. <br /> <br /> Douglas Walton plays the unfortunate jockey who seems to want his own demise (hypnotism, whoever?), and among the suspects are a lot of characters - all from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. As a bonus, Nat Pendleton is a low-intensity detective - and also benefit from this decoration of art deco decorations for the luxurious interiors of an affluent home. This is surely a setting that has been used in many subsequent films. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with the reasonable assurance of not being too confused. All of this is suddenly clear to the detective Philo Vance - and he then has a final confrontation with the murderer who gives the film five minutes of unmixed suspense. <br /> <br /> Nicely done and spends time in a fun way.
