THE BLOB is a great horror movie, not only because of the extremely horrible images of its almost unstoppable title persona, which dissolves the flesh, but also because it contains a true social message. It is, in many ways, a "horror film of well-being". The intelligent story is helped by the solid performance of the entire cast. The two romantic leaders, Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut, bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings. They are young people who are poorly understood but very well intentioned, and it is very easy to take root for them. <br /> <br /> It's a pro-society film, and its delinquent juvenile characters cause problems mainly through boredom, not by a malicious flaw. Steve McQueen's rival of drag racing seems almost an enemy at the beginning of the process, but quickly joins McQueen's campaign to save the city from the invading invader as soon as he sees McQueen's seriousness. In this way, a character situation that initially seems caricatural suddenly develops depth and human realism. <br /> <br /> The initial skepticism of the authorities about the wild demands of children is wrong - and as soon as the threat is recognized by all, all conflicts in society disappear. This unification of objectives and the validation of "disturbing" teenagers become official when Aneta Corsaut's father breaks into the school to obtain the extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob. Another day, entering the school would be considered a vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent - that day, it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure. At this crucial stage, it is clear that there are no dividing lines between young and old. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual film in that it recognizes the perception of a "generation gap" but suggests that it is more imaginary than real, and that in the event of a real crisis, people will naturally come together to restore order. "The Blob" is a perfect tonic for the type of depression that usually accompanies watching "The Night of the Living Dead" (1968). <br /> <br /> We talked a lot about the cheap but innovative film (and effective!) visual effects. They are undeniably intelligent. Most of the gravity-defying tricks we see Blob perform were made with miniature sets designed to be rotated. The camera was usually fixed to the sets in a very "locked" position (the lights had to be fixed in the same way, so that the light remained stable when the piece was turned in one direction or the other). These scenes were often photographed one image at a time while the piece was spinning slowly - the drop of silicone oozed very slowly and its action had to be accelerated. In a way, it looked like stopping animated photography, but using a drop of silicone rather than an articulated puppet. Even today, the effects are striking and bizarre. <br /> <br /> A very good movie with the exploiting title, THE BLOB is a must.
