I would just say that this can be biased, since I'm a producer on the film. However, I will maintain a certain sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> The star of the film, Oscar Ovies, dramatically portrays the role of Jeff Grinderlin, a nebulous hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living. He brings a certain touch to his character that really allows the audience to communicate with him, often asserting his wit and with a sense of hard comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is the constant support beam, without which he would collapse. His friends also participate in Jeff's life, often making choices for him rather than letting him use his free will ... which he often neglects anyway. <br /> <br /> The writing is superb and the conversations unfold like scenes from a Kevin Smith movie, with half as many Ben Affleck boo-hoo shows. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is a bit of poor quality at times, and the sound could also use a boost, however the performance will stand out minor details. He is also supported by a beautiful soundtrack with local talent and an exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a treat. A rare jewel, among many jewels.
