"Party Girl" takes advantage of the extraordinary charm of Parker Posey. In fact, sometimes the film seems to be a vehicle in which Mrs. Posey is allowed to play herself, as she is normally in real life. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a treat for Ms. Posey's fans. Mrs. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild trip to Lower Manhattan to show us that soulless soul whose life is dedicated to having fun in the various clubs she constantly attends. This is an era even more naive than what has become of this region and the adjacent districts of the meat market. At least the films are not pretentious and we see realistically that people live normally, if we can call them that. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes an incredible Mary. It's because of Parker Posey that we love the movie more than if another actress would have played Mary. She is the whole picture. The rest of the cast is good.
