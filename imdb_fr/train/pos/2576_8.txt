I'm part of "Christopher Reeve Generation", it's fair to say he was the best actor to play Superman for now, but that does not stop me from enjoying other actors in the role, and George Reeves tries rather well to hit Chris at the top, although he barely falls. This does not prevent me from enjoying this movie, it has a lot. It has everything a film needs, a plot with beginning, middle and end, plus all these parts are intelligently written. The film is both cinematic and script, a film noir but with tights. The story is both exciting and meaningful, it is a film with a message that is not too pretentious. I'm always amazed that it was shot in 12 days, oh days of Hollywood glory, when we did not have to wait 5 years to see if the film would fall into development ... The film is polished and realized from expertly, directed by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, known for his fast and efficient direction. He never lets the constraints of technology slow him down. In fact, some creative actions were taken to create the flying effect, including placing a camera on an arrow in a truck, taking a high photo and going fast to give the impression that we are seeing the point of Superman view, close-up shots of George during work and a long shot of an animated Superman. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as an additional feature for the first season of the George Reeves television series. A DVD that is worth buying, the inclusion of the film as a whole is the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give your blood today God bless!
