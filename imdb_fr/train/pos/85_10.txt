I saw this film at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was shown in combination with the red balloon. Both films are similar in their dream quality. Most of the film involves a fish swimming happily in its bowl while its new owner, a little boy, is absent from school. A cat enters the room where the fish and its bowl are and begins to track down its "prey" with caution. The boy begins to walk away from school and the viewer wonders if he will arrive in time to save his fish friend. The fish becomes agitated by the presence of the cat and ends up jumping out of the bowl! The cat moves quickly towards the fish, takes it gently with his paws and brings it back to his bowl. The boy happily returns to his fish without knowing it. <br /> <br /> The end is amazing both by its irony and its technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director could have achieved the technical feat of 1959 - it seems like a trick for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, look at it - you will not do it being dissapointed! And if you find it, let me know so I can get a copy too!
