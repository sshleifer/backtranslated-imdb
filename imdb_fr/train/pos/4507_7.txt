I was really stunned to see how much a film over 60 could impress me. It's been almost two hours, there is absolutely no star, there are subtitles but it's still interesting and exciting to watch. What impressed me most was the realism of the film. You could almost feel the cold of the ice, because you could see that the storms are real. It's a relief in a CGI world like today's. I wondered how much work it had to be for Van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. Now, who wants to talk about 'Titanic' anymore? It's a good movie with a good message and I would recommend it to future filmmakers to see how realistic movies can be realistic if they are only realistic, instead of visual effects.
