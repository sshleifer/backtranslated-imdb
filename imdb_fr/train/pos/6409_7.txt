I had never heard of Brashear before watching this. This is the story of him and the man who trained him, who helped him become the first diver of the US-African Navy. A story of will. The plot is well written and develops well throughout. This seems to be the typical thing for outsiders, and it does not have too many surprises. It's also pretty Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the real man, maybe it's close to how it happened. Nevertheless, the work is done, with dramatic scenes and hardships, and it's a source of inspiration for anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can not" be talked about his dream. The acting performances are all excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. shine every time they are on the screen. Rapaport is also wonderful. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. This is well edited and includes a good cinematography. The production values ​​are high and that brings us back quite well in the 50s. This is the only film that this director and the writer have seen, although I can now consider looking more at their responsibility. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise no offensive material. I recommend it to anyone who finds the subject interesting and / or fans of those who created it. 7/10
