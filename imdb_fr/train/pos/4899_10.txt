I'm so glad I saw this video at the store. I was looking for happy movies and this one turned out to be a real gem. I loved the fact that the film, a kind of love story, does not talk about beautiful women in their twenties; it is rather the story of sixty beautiful women of about sixty who were twenty years old. It's a good story, well written and beautifully performed, with fabulous WWII band music. Lovers of Scottish castles will also find a pleasant surprise. It left me smiling and ready to watch it again, which I did several times before returning it. I highly recommend it.
