I must say that the worst of the movie was the first half hour. I was really confused about who was who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket. Then, when all the men arrived at the camp, it appeared that there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson, but who was not. I said where is Bill Paxson? Then there was a guy with his girlfriend. He said she was 21 years old. It was supposed to be a 20-year meeting of the camp director (Alan Arkin) most memorable. Later, this same girl had exchanges and talked about her experiences in the camp. It does not make sense. She would have been one. That said, the film turned out pretty good. Kevin Pollak was the cool guy who was always teased. One guy was a complete narcissist and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as a former camp director, who admits he has become disconnected from modern youth. The best part was that none of the adult campers was a success in life. None of them had very great careers. It seemed like real life. The film was compared to The Big Chill. In some ways, it was not as exciting as the Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So, even if the beginning is not promising, the film has turned into a very good film.
