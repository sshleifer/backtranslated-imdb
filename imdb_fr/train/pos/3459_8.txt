With Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was an iconic villain of Columbo. The first "clean" episode of Columbo, after two independent pilots, "Murder By The Book" is not far from the classic status. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, half of a partnership to write a mystery murder. His partner Jim is the talented, while Ken has no other talent than the gift of the gab and a skill to promote books. As soon as Jim decides that he no longer needs Ken's marketing skills, Ken decrypts a plot to kill Jim. Except it's not a new conspiracy, it's actually the actual implementation of a murder scenario originally intended for one of their books. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for Columbo to understand that Ken is the murderer, although, unfortunately, another murder is committed (Ken romance then kills a key witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to get a conviction. <br /> <br /> Nothing wrong with "Murder By The Book", but it's pretty upmarket. I would just like to give the benefit to "Publish Gold Perish": both episodes feature Jack Cassidy and the publishing world, but "Publish Gold Perish" is a bit more tense and unpredictable. But it's still a good episode.
