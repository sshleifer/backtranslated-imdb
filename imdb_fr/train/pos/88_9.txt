It was one of the best movies I saw. The film is about real life and how CAN drugs play a major role. Although this film seems to have been produced on a small budget, I found it exhilarating to watch. <br /> <br /> Some people may not like the story and say that the scenario lacks direction. However, when a person takes drugs as much as these characters, life no longer has orientation. I think this film is an accurate representation of what could happen to a person if they were facing extreme temptations. <br /> <br /> Most players are new to the industry. However, they all did very well. Everyone seemed to be doing their job well and putting themselves in the skin of the character appropriately. <br /> <br /> I think this film could be a good tool to use when dealing with someone or a loved one who is involved in drugs and seems to be angry. out of control. This film could scare them enough to change their habits.
