This film is one for the ages. First, I must say that after seeing this once, it became one of my favorite movies of all time. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (screenwriter, director) has produced a true work of art. While 99.9% of the films are purely entertainment, the director Ben Coccio tells us the truth, gives us the reality, provides us with a learning tool to know why this happened. Traditional media are spinning and spinning, but Ben Coccio is watching school shootings, able to go where no other form of media has ever gone, in the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their comrades . Although it is surely graphic and horrible, how could it be otherwise? The gloves come off, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters are spread and we end up in a place where we can find the truth about what happened. Sometimes it's not just a loophole as everyone wants, no, sometimes hate and isolation are deeper, more human, we are shown that these boys are us and ourselves. Society has left them behind and the consequences are terrible and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your neighbor. A lesson we should all learn: Thank you very much for making this film, Mr. Coccio. I very much hope that you will continue your career as a filmmaker.
