It's the work of Neil Simon that has received a lot of praise! "The Odd Couple" is a unique jewel of its kind. You have Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac, a neat maniac and a big thorn in the side of his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); a total slob. These men have great jobs though. Felix is ​​a journalist and Oscar is a sports journalist. These two men are divorced, Felix's wife is nearby, while Oscar's is on the other side of the United States (west coast). Well, what can you say? Two men living together under the same roof without going mad are impossible and improbable. It's a lot of laughter and fun. I enjoyed the moment when these two British neighbors talking to the two men and after Oscar had chased Felix, he was lucky and lived with them when he refused to dine with them the night before. It was time Felix needed to lighten up. I guess all the models are treated to lighten up. They can be difficult, but they should also be patient. A very funny movie and a nuevo classic. "The Odd Couple" by Neil Simon is a classic movie to see absolutely. 5 STARS!
