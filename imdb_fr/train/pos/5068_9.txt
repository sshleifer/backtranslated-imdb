This film is a wonderful film based on the life of a man named Gray Owl in the 1930s in Canada. I found it as seductive and sincere as "Rudy" and "Awakenings". The film begins late in Gray Owl's life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential period. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a Canadian Indian trapper who is promoting Beaver's fate. It also predicts the depletion of natural lands and overexploitation of the Earth's resources. It is a scandalous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well-known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan's casting seems rather strange, but not outrageous. Anyone who wants to argue on this point must first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan provides a wonderful performance just like Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place alongside Brosnan is refreshing and natural compared to the forced couplings of Bond's recent films. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful landscapes or ecological causes. It's also a film for families, but children under 10 (depending on their maturity) would have trouble following the plot.
