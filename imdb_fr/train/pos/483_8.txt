very few chess movies have been made in recent years, but this one is more than a chess movie, it's a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it, John Toturro plays a psychologically challenged man, nothing matters to him to accept 64 squares and 32 pieces, the game validates him as a person, when he loses a game, he loses the only thing that makes sense to him and John Torturro expresses that in a beautiful way, even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence. One wonders if there are other Luzon obsessed with the game, I'm sure they are, if you are a chess enthusiast, there will be no harm in watching it.It is intelligent to well-organized and well executed, he achieves his goals; unfortunately, I doubt the result.
