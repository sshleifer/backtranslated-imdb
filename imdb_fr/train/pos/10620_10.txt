During the first viewing, I found this story at least less annoying than the other Cannon Movie stories. After many others, I think it's one of the best. Some of the songs are pretty bad, especially the love song, but there are two things that make the movie worthy of even singing. One is the artistic direction. Like the other Cannon Movie Tales, this is a period piece beautifully decorated; each piece of cloth and each jewel (both of which have an important part in the plot of this film) look fresh and new and contrast with the ordinary clothes of the peasants. Even during the love song, I find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess, wonderfully worked. The other thing is the comic timing. Much of the film is old-fashioned, but the Emperor's vanity (and his finesse mocking himself), the suspicious guard, the guard pursuing Nicholas and the stupid prince were all pretty funny and seemed ridiculous enough voluntarily. And the sequence of the song Weave-O compensates for songs that were not so good.
