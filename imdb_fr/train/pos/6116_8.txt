This film is like the pot. You like it or you hate it. If you go in this movie hoping for a good movie with decent production values, a good plot and great characters, you'll hate it. If you go in this movie hoping for a small budget, you will probably hate it. <br /> <br /> If you go in this movie hoping to see one of the most disturbed characters ever staged in the form of Harry Russo you will love it. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his exhilarating rendition of the mad killer demon coke. <br /> <br /> The special effects are at best catastrophic, but who cares? If you're the type of person who is ready to watch a film Schizophreniac: The Whore Mangler, you've probably seen a host of horror movies full of gore. With the budget that this movie was made, even if they had tried, it would probably have been mediocre at best. I would much rather be able to laugh at something lamentable than not be affected by the mediocre. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, you'll probably hate this movie, but if you're one of the few to decide to see it anyway it'll become the best thing since sliced ​​bread # 2 I hate pot .
