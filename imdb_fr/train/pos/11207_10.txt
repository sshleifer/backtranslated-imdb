This documentary has been nominated for an Oscar and it is easy to understand why. Even 45 years later, it's a pretty impressive job. Why this is not printed is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of live footage and tandem animation. It worked as part of "Vault Disney" every few months, but I have not seen it for a long time. * sigh * most recommended.
