This film is about one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the elderly. As someone who has met a number of families with potential Alzheimer's disease or who are in the training phase, I would suggest any health professional recommend this film to any family facing the trauma of this disease. . The film is designed primarily to talk to the patient's family and goes to the very heart of the fight. The cast is excellent and the dramatic representation is remarkable with a very impressive plot.
