This film was charming. An accountant wants more of life than conventional success approved. What makes it work so well, and makes it so different from the standard dance film, is that it's not really about becoming "big", but simply finding a way to express yourself. The big triumph at the end is not the victory of a contest, nor the discovery of a whole new lifestyle, but the simple joy of doing what you want to achieve the other aspects of your life. Nobody discovers his passion, he finds his soul tranquil. <br /> <br /> The Japanese origin makes the subtle oppression and "secret life" of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal. We can all see each other in the world.
