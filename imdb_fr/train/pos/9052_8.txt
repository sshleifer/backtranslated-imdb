It's a beautiful drama and a nice change of pace compared to today's more hectic and stronger films. This is another solid store based on a real store, which means that much of it could be made for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I do not know but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a young man of the 50s who is interested in the rocket and wants to enter this field instead of working in the coal mines. like everyone else, including his father, in this West Virginia city. The big problem is the conflict he causes between the boy and his father, which, in my opinion, was excessive. I would like to have a little less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> The young man, always a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first roles, I think. He is friendly, as are his classmates here. It's good to see beautiful children in a modern movie. The two other key actors in the film are Chris Cooper (the father) and Laura Dern (the teacher who encourages him all the time.) <br /> <br /> The cinematography is correct, the soundtrack of the 1950s is fun to hear. Once again: I wish there were more of these kinds of films made today.
