A really sweet movie that has some similarities to "My Sassy Girl" from 2001, but is able to enchant most of the time. The biggest applause should go to both tracks. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and offbeat, Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between the two is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses synthetic inserts to spice up the visuals and also offers impressive fighting scenes in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I liked it better here than in the very surfing "Volcano High". And this boy has a future - these looks, these fighting techniques and a romantic advance. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can be short: nice movie. My rating: 7/10
