I just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and particularly pretty movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters adorable and beautifully blossomed, but what really shines is the design of the digital set. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animated films than by reality, the drawings give you a world looking for amazing use of color. Sometimes, the reality keys appear (especially the water was impressive), but nevertheless, it is an imaginary world based on reality. Including loads of large landscapes helps to minimize the cost of rendering. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with a technical brilliance, it shines through an effective use of technical know-how. <br /> Pretty technical babble, entertaining film, family and sometimes just funny.
