Considered by almost all critics as the best of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan's films, I have no objection to that, although there are a few others that I thought were equally entertaining. One thing: it's the longest in the series I saw at 105 minutes. I saw only six, but it was longer than usual and, with the long finale, I found everything was too long. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it's a good mix of action, suspense and romance. All that's missing is the color and stereo sound. The primitive special effects do not bother me, because that was all they had in the 30s. <br /> <br /> Among some, this film is best known for its skin: the skin! "Jane" has never worn anything as thin as this film after the Hays Code was instituted when filming the next Tarzan film. Her outfit showed how much Maureen O'Sullivan was a great figure. The underwater scene naked, however, was not her - in the very long run. The woman under the water did not have a good shape, whatever it was. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action here. Until the end, it was not exaggerated either. The end lasted 15 minutes, however, and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch. <br /> <br /> Still, this movie offers just about everything - except "Boy" (their adopted son) - you 'would like to see in a Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan making his Tarzan shout a dozen times . With his pair of "lungs" it was not a problem.
