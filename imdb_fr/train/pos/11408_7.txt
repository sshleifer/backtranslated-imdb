Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - the kind of person that people will almost never know by name. However, he plays the coroner again - one of the only actors in Philo Vance's films to have played his role more than once. I have seen him twice before and I loved him every time because he was so funny and he breathed a breath of fresh air. This film is also interesting to watch, because besides Girardot, there are many other actors of wonderful characters, including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H. B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. It's a pretty impressive cast, and they certainly made it easier for Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce, two main characters. <br /> <br /> These great actors are one of the main reasons I love these old B movies. Although the mystery itself is rarely so fantastic, because of the writing and the play of the tunes, the movies really satisfy. As for this film, Vance is played beautifully by Lowe but, as I said, the mystery itself is only anticipation - with an idiot plot involving hypnosis and suicides. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize anyone to do anything like that - I'm trained in clinical hypnosis and if I could do anything the bad guy could do in the movie, I would have done it! Used car dealers and some of my former bosses would have been obvious targets !! <br /> <br /> Overall, although this is not Philo Vance's best film, it was very good and it's a shame that Lowe only played that role time. In fact, aside from William Powell (who has played Vance five times), the series has been hampered by a long and long succession of actors such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) interpreting Vance. It's a similar problem that has also affected the Bulldog Drummond series - too many different actors playing the main role. <br /> <br /> Good to see and exciting - although totally impossible.
