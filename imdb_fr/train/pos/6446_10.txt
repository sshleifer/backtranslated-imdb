"SÃ¥ som in himmelen" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful films of my life. That he did not win the Oscar, I will not shed a tear. This film is in a kind of class except an Oscar win would probably ruined it! My dear friend Anders (Nyberg), you have done a real magnificence with your pen here! Kay Pollak, with your creation and all those who contributed, you have all given a gift of love to our world. Between the entry points into our world, then out - you can really say that you have improved it! A special personal thank you from my soul to you all for bringing back precious memories of the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young spirit and my current being were shaped and shaped by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings with gratitude to you all. With love and light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
