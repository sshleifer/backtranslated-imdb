"Maybe we can arrange a meeting." "Where are you now?" "I'm sitting in my office." "I doubt." "Why would you doubt it?" "If you were in your office now I would have this face-to-face conversation." <br /> <br /> Bourne remains difficult and elusive. Only his inhuman resilience drives the film a little too far into fantasy. The conversation is macho, to the point of containing only bursts of humor like Bond. Everything is in action. <br /> <br /> The feeling that something different is happening in the world we live in is what the trilogy cove so well. A scene taking place in Waterloo with a Guardian journalist has a lot of effect. There is no meeting of the worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body. <br /> <br /> If the shaking camera does not bother you too much, enjoy this movie and hope that they will maintain the franchise.
