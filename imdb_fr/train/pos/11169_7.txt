When I first saw the movie, I thought it was boring because nothing was happening, but when all the scary things started to happen, like when the church dies and is brought back to life . bring them back to life even if he follows the warnings and ignores Jud. it's not the best job of Steven Kings. I thought his best job was brilliant. I do not think people who see this film and comment on how horrible it is wrong, because they only think what they thought. as if this person could do a better job by making a horror movie. I mean to be clever and how he kills Jud is a genius. Transforming the most innocent and unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool. people who did not like the movie are stupid because everything is a scary movie and nothing of all. do not expect something from a movie that it is not. it was still not very good in a general area. I always recommend people to watch the movie
