This short film by Joe McDoakes is obviously inspired by Warner Brothers' spectacular Thank Your Lucky Stars, one of those wartime morale boosters of this period. In this one Eddie Cantor played himself and an actor who would like to break into movies, except for his resemblance to Cantor. <br /> <br /> George O'Hanlon who starred in the short film McDoakes is both himself and McDoakes who is just trying to pause in the film. As a thank you to your lucky stars, a few Warner Brothers contract players wandered through this movie. <br /> <br /> O'Hanlon was sent by the central cast for a small role a line in a World War I film, but Mc Donald's look-alike gets the message. The poor guy is so nervous about his big moment, he's starting to think of ways to deliver his line. Sounding like a real movie star might be able to help. <br /> <br /> 86 begins to exasperate director Ralph Sanford and patient Clyde Cook who plays a British cockney soldier who finds a place in the film industry for the poor McDoakes. It's interesting to see this very entertaining short subject that has been nominated for an Oscar to find out what's happening at O'Hanlon / McDoakes. <br /> <br /> Both.
