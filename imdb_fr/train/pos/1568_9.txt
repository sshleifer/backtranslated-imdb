Catscratch is the best thing to do at Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show does not only please Maori and PIs. some people love it, and they are all Australian. At first glance, I admit that it sounds a bit rude, but that pushes you a lot. Also, to correct something that one of the other reviews has said, In_Correct (Tv.com) does not say "Does this mean you are homo now?" he says, "Does that mean you're homo, owww?" This is his sentence in the show. Mr. Blik is, I think, the funniest of all like the Peww-Weww Playhouse. <br /> <br /> First, I'll admit that the first episode was a little good. But after a while, the episodes have become great! And just when the show has found that it's surreal, crazy ... Nickelodeon cancels it! <br /> <br /> I know Nick is for kids, but from time to time, a brilliant show can be watched by teenagers and adults. These series include the animated series Mr. Bean, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, The Modern Life of Rocko (sometimes) and Invader Zim. All this must have been considered too good, with the exception of CatDog, because Nick felt the need to cancel them. <br /> <br /> What I like in the famous last episode, where Gordon fights a duck. <Br/> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD, with lots of audio commentary and behind-the-scenes docos, and including the final episode. <br /> <br /> But of course, what I would really like to see the show come back on the air. Wake up NICK! <br /> <br /> I would like to have a list somewhere on the internet with all the closing credits. That would be great.
