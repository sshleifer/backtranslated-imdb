This is not the best film of Bela Lagosi, but it has a good old-fashioned approach to some of the 40s horror shows. <br /> <br /> Brides fall like flies on the altar . I think I would delay marriage until the demon is caught, but it's a horror movie, so I guess people do not know the danger for whatever reason. Anyway, Lagosi is a mad doctor who needs young woman's blood to keep her elderly, sick, healthy and happy woman. He always escapes Keystone policemen by hiding the bodies in a hearse (who would think of looking for a corpse in a hearse?), And the wives continue to be zapped. <br /> <br /> No film like this would be complete without a Lois Lane reporter who wants to catch the criminal herself. Good to solve the crime, bad to keep your mouth shut at the wrong time, guess who Lagosi chooses his next victim. I like the "haunted house" where Lois Lane is blocked by a thunderstorm while she is invited into the sinister mansion of Lagosi. Hidden passages, a woman resembling a vampire, an assistant of the evil dwarf Igor, etc. Good things. <br /> <br /> The fairly steady pace keeps the film moving, and the story resolves in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, this one is worth the detour.
