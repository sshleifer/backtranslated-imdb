I watched this movie from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin ') one night ago on www.afrovideo.org, and I did not see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit that the character design is a bit rude and inaccessible today, but I think it's a satire and a very, very urban narrative of the old stories of Uncle Remus that black American culture has created up to to the main characters and the blatant nod to "The Tar Baby" and "The Briar Patch." Notice that these are not sectarian stories, but cultural icons created by black Americans and myself, a woman white, reading and loving these stories. And I also found an interesting temporal vision of black culture in Harlem, New York, in the 70s. <br /> <br /> Well, to get back to the bottom of the film: This film is a live- action / animation movie that starts live-action with a man named Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rushing to help his friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison but is stopped by a roadblock and ending up in a shootout with the police. Meanwhile, Randy involuntarily listens to Pappy (Scatman Crothers), his escapee, as he begins to tell Randy the animated story of Brother Rabbit, a young newcomer to the big city that is rapidly emerging from the darkness to govern Harlem . you know, for me, Rabbit, Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and Preacherman. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action sequences, the film is a graphic and condemnatory satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 1970s ?? Anyway, it's another good movie from Bakshi; and should we sweep movies like this under the carpet? pretend they never exist? hmmm ... I think it would be a pity; I think we should watch these films with enthusiasm and learn what is happening at the time, all the way since then.
