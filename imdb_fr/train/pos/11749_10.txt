Finally, we get a TV show where we can see the acting talent! Episode 1 was excellent! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, there was always the "I'm not your father - I'm your father and omigod, you cheated on me!" but the script allowed the actors to really feel and experience these real moments rather than showing us what it would look like like so many soap operas. <br /> <br /> The camera work also gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots from repeated angles for hours, but there was no no more 'shots unnecessarily inside shots or bare hand camera' to add an 'artistic' that gave us what we needed and beautiful landscape shots! <br /> <br /> Nothing was over-dramatized or melodramatic, it was real people in a real place, confronted with real situations, the series did not miss anything in the drama and was quite relevant . It was such a relief to be exposed to real actors and so nice to let our country see how talented our actors can be when given a real scenario, a real opportunity! Thanks Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all the actors and the team - wonderful work !! continue what you do, your efforts are much appreciated and do not go unnoticed!
