My Super Ex-Girlfriend is an entertaining film, no more and no less. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and silent. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) on the subway and meets. At the beginning of their relationship, everything seems to be fine, but then Matt discovers that she is G-Girl. At first, it seems really cool for Matt, but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and in need. He decides to break up with her and meet his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very angry and she starts to take revenge on her former boyfriend. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most in the movie are the scenes where G-Girl gets revenge on Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris play a role other than her character from the Scary Movie saga. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to 7 out of 10 and I recommend it to all those who love beautiful comedies.
