To be honest With you, I think everything was so good in this movie, there should be no reason for the movies not to be released in cinemas. The Deaths in the movie are awesome, the special effects are great when they are used, There are some boring moments The story follows the little girl, but all in all, it's a very good movie that I hope will one day have the support that is needed. The very first part of the film probably explains why he came directly to video with the murder of a little boy but the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the boyfriend of the mother who left to become a writer. The property he bought turns out to be the place where the witch (the tooth fairy) lives and all those who live in his house or go on his property will be in great danger does not want to give anything really just a little bit of if you want to see this movie then do it so it's worth the rental price
