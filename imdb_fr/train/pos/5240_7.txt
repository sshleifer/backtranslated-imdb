Some of the actors were a bit suspicious. I remember that Alexander Walker (Evening Standard critic, yeah, OK, he's dead now) made a speech about this film that said it was a shame to portray the NI Protestants as murderers. Now, with regard to all the Protestants of the NI, this film was loosely based on the Shankill Butchers (Loyalists) who roamed Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they were not called butchers for nothing. My main moan about this film is that it shows no ray of light or hope. It may sound silly but it might have suggested that not all products and products are bad or quite good either.
