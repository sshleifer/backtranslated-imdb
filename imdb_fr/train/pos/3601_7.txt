Michelle Rodriguez is the defining actress who could entice other actresses to search. She has the audacity to be early in a role of hard girl, very early in his career (and get away), a feat that should be recognized. Although his latest films rank it in the same role, this film was made for its harshness. <br /> <br /> Her character is a romance student / fighter who struggles to overcome her disillusioned existence in a little exaggerated in the film ... but not by a girl. This aspect of this film is not very original, but the story deepens when the stormy relations with which this girl must collapse are damaged and its primordial rage is needed. <br /> <br /> I have not yet seen an actress take such an aggressive stance in making movies and I'm glad she has that original touch in Hollywood. This film received a 7 of me because of the average youth story in the ghettos, but it has such a great actress describing a rarely seen role in a low-budget movie. Good work.
