This film is the perfect example of a film that divides people into 2 groups. Those who have the joke and those who do not have it. People usually attack what they do not understand. This film has a comic style and a charm like no other. It's an excellent comedy ... and a great romance. It's a perfect date film. A perfect film for someone who wants a good light laugh. And if your perspective is too tense, maybe this movie does not suit you and you might need some advice. It's an injustice that Paramount has been keeping this film on the shelves since the early 80's, having never seen the light of day on DVD. Still, they think an urban version of "The Honeymooners" is a good idea. I find it strange that my two favorite romantic comedies of all time have never been released on DVD. The other being Gene Wilder's "The Greatest Lover in the World", to which Fox has been based since the early 1980s ... Yet, "From Justin To Kelly" is featured in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Maybe those who have taken the time to appreciate this will appreciate "From Justin to Kelly", I'm sure we've had enough water for them to "get". Sometimes, with age, people lose their sense of humor ... Or, sometimes, it ends up becoming obsolete and they find a comical satisfaction in the reruns of "Full House".
