Simple, meaningful and gives an emotional punch. I regularly go through boring short films and it is always nice to find something that carries a simple and enlightened message, without pretension or indulgent direction. <br /> <br /> A boy at school has to attend a class when his friend skips school and gets the most important lesson of his life. But when he does not have enough copies, he has to share it with the bully at the school. <br /> <br /> Unlike most short films featuring children or actors that these kids hold their own and it's believable. The soundtrack completes the emotion of the piece and the punchline of the film works well.
