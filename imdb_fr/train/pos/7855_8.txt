Tess from the Storm Country was a Mary Pickford vehicle that I wanted to buy for a while. I finally found a VHS copy at a reasonable price and I could appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Mary gives her brave, sexy and innocent image of a girl on the wrong side of the path who wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time, the stakes are higher: a false accusation of murder, an illegitimate child (and the case of wrong motherhood that ensues) and a planned suicide. <br /> <br /> We understand why Pickford wanted to redo this one. History is a true story of morality, one in which she loved to play. Controversial topics are not always clearly explained; should a viewer be careful and pick up clues to capture everything that is supposed to be in the first viewing? although everything is more or less explained at the end. <br /> <br /> The only negative remark I can make is about Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, weighs around Â£ 6-2,200 (bigger next to Mary, of course!), Is panicked when a 60-pound chocolate lab attacks it! Then, to top it all off (or perhaps to justify his bewildering fear of the dog), he manages to pin it to the ground and hurts him to the point of hurting him so much that he still struggles to get up much later, as a big storm! This is the same kind laboratory that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and hugs with Mary! However, later, Mary throws boiling water on Ben's face, which barely slows him down! OK, I mentioned Ben and the chocolate lab! Other than that, the film was very touching and certainly caught my attention. Pickford's distribution was strong and credible. It's certainly among his best films.
