I saw this for the first time when it was created more than ten years ago. I saw it again today and it has always had a big impact on me. She fought alone tells the story of a girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a classmate who likes to hurt girls. Caitlin is part of a popular high school clique, but when she turns out to be raped, she turns against her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This film tells of Caitlin's struggle against an entire city. , including a high school that essentially lets athletes determine the social environment, allowing them to get by with what they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are the best performers and there is a real chemistry between them both throughout the film. All the actors in this film, inspired by real events, did a great job. She fought alone really captures the essence of what it's like to be in high school (at least in 1995) and to have her self-esteem and reputation at stake. 10/10
