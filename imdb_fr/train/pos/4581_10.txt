A French novelist, disgusted by the friends of his wife's society, goes to North Africa for a respite. There he meets a living and talented Bedouin girl living in poverty. Despite his wife, who romances with a Maharajah, he decides to train and educate the girl and present it to the Parisian society under the name PRINCESS TAM TAM ... <br /> <br /> The marvelous Josephine Baker is perfectly melted the main role in this very pleasant French film. With her enormous eyes and contagious smile, she immediately comes into contact with the spectator's heart. Her oversized personality and her obvious joy of playing make her a pure pleasure to watch. Baker cares about what happens to poor Alwina during her transformation and her introduction to European mores. <br /> <br /> Albert Pr√©jean does very well his role of Pygmalion to Baker, Galatea; Georges Peclet is also effective as a servant belonging to a half-caste and Jean Galland as a mysterious Maharajah. <br /> <br /> The film is very beautiful and well done, it reminds a bit of the films of Busby Berkeley produced at the same time. In America - although unlike the American movies of this period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM has no racism. It should be noted that there was no Hays office or production code in France. Some dialogues and actions are rather provocative, but it is important to recognize that Baker singing and dancing "Under The African Sky", as well as his culminating performance in the Parisian discotheque, are two of the most memorable moments of cinema. /> <br /> Filming in Tunisia greatly improves the film. <br /> <br /> Josephine Baker was born in Saint-Louis in 1906, in a very poor family. Her talent and driving ambition, however, prompted her to move quickly east. She was briefly a member of the Ziegfeld Follies cast. Realizing that America in the mid-twentieth century imposed great limits on a gifted black woman, she managed to get to Paris, where she finally joined Folies-Bergeres & Le Negre Revue. The French have adored her and she has become a great celebrity. A brief return to America in 1935 showed Baker that things had not changed for African Americans. She returned to France, became a French citizen and worked for the Resistance at the beginning of the war. Baker moved to Morocco for the duration of his stay and entertained Allied troops stationed on the spot. <br /> <br /> After the war, Baker's fortune began to decline and she had to face many financial and personal difficulties. For a while, she was even banned from returning to the United States. Finally, Baker accepted an offer from Princess Grace of Monaco to reside in the Principality. Josephine Baker was about to make a comeback when she died of a stroke in 1975 at the age of 68. <br /> <br /> Having only played in two decent movies - ZOUZOU & PRINCESS TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming obscure. But she deserves her place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich & Robeson, among the truly legendary performers of her generation.
