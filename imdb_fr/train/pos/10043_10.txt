This film has rewritten the story of the film in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks of this movie because it transcends criticism. Each flaw of the film is easily overcome by the many incredible things in the film. It is an extremely beautiful film and I doubt that many of us will see it again. I have seen more times than I do not want to count, and I am always pierced every time, with a feeling difficult to describe. One for the ages.
