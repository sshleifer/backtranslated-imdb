Here you will find spectacular photographs of breathtaking beauty, illustrating a range of landscapes and animals, from the Arctic to the tropics, and so on. Shooting techniques are varied and range from close-up to aerial work. The editing is great and the comment is perfect, with the right tone and dramatic and revealing facts about our world. The film collapses a bit by trying to cover and integrate four themes: seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories, and hunter-hunter interactions in multiple environments. Finally, everything becomes a little bitty and disjointed. Overall, it's definitely worth seeing, especially considering the issues covered, but do not expect any material for the Oscars.
