As a family, we were so excited about the movie "The Last of the Light Bombs" that we bought a copy for our personal video library. <br /> <br /> The acting game is A1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers. The theme is unusual and the script well written. The music / songs are timeless and bring us back to our youth when we sang the songs at the top of our voices. Describing the story here would spoil the "plot" because it's really nice to sit down and enjoy the story as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> Spotlight on this most enjoyable and exhilarating production and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a belly laugh and a lot of music.
