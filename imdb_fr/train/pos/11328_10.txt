This movie is great. If you like to watch class B movies, that is to say. This is a classic 1980s film from college, in which a song is played throughout the soundtrack. A horrible film, but it's worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men come out of their cupboards with knives. A little funny, if you ask me.
