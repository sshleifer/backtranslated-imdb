What can be said about Elvira that has not already been said in the world press? The classic actress IS Elvira delivers in her first big masterpiece of big budget comedy. <br /> <br /> Since the very first movie, Elvira has a dramatic fist that clearly says Great Movie .... Bette Davis! See a lost Elvira, see an excitable Elvira, see a jealous Elvira, see a murderous Elvira. You can only marvel at his acting prowess! <br /> <br /> At the heart of this comedy masterpiece, Elvira is eager to become a star in the Las Vegas show. Despite putting "ass back in the tube" as a horror host (with the greatest number), Elvira finds the small screen constricting emotionally ... and physically! Nuff said, she tucks her bag and heads east .... a hot dog in one hand and a letter from her aunt's lawyer describing her "bargain" legacy in the other. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie so many times, I can almost recite it word by word .... (word for word would just show)! <br /> <br /> Take a copy, laugh at yourself stupid, learn the lines .... <br /> <br /> Why she did not win the Oscar for best actress for this role myself exceeds.
