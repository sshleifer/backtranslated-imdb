I found this film charming. I thought the characters had been developed since I looked, I found myself worrying about these people. It's a period piece that I think was during the depression. A single mother, known as a recluse city (she has reason to be), puts an advertisement in the newspaper for "a husband". Christopher Reeve plays an ex-inmate who comes to town looking for work. He sees the advertisement and he goes out to see her. She hires him. I had a few laughs as their relationship progressed because I found it easy to put myself in their shoes. Everything was going so well. He needs work not to upset her. And she needs his help, but does not want him to take over. They dance to the fact that they are starting to really need each other. Things are starting to warm up to ...... the big explosion. I will not spoil it by telling you what's going on. But the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful. I found the story very credible for the moment it unfolds. I think it's one of the best "relationship" stories. Maybe the younger generation will not "understand", but if you're over 40, I think you'll like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time", you'll also like it in this one.
