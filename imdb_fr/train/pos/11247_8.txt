I saw the movie for the first time when it was on American cable a year after its release. It rocked my little head, I was only 16 years old and it was the first new wave music I heard, being a strictly folkloric and growing kid. The music mesmerized me, as did Hazel O'Connor's amazing look and charismatic vocal performances, and Phil Daniels' tough but sweet Cockney manager delighted me. But I think my favorite character was the drugged saxophonist Jonathan Pryce. He was so out of place in the group and so harmless and pathetic that he just begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes, the representation when the lights went out and the love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Okay, the movie is not Rose! But it was really good for his limited budget and for his portrayal of Britain in the early 80s, exploding with a rebellious youth, looking for a way out of the queue. A few years later, I went to Britain and found that the film reflected very well the atmosphere I had found during my stay there. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see it, look at it. It's an excellent movie, with great performances, and the music will blow you away. <br /> <br />
