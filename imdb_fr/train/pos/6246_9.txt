It is not a brilliant idea to watch Hundstage if you are not 100% sure of your mental stability, as this movie will be put to the test, no matter how healthy you are. I must say that Hundstage is a film of art rather than an entertainment film, so that the majority of viewers would not have the level of "maturity" necessary to achieve its charming side. A bit like Tarkovsky's films, but somehow different. Myself, I can not say that I had a lot of fun watching it. But it is an exceptional experience and very interesting for those who are tormented only by the clich√© proposed by Hollywood. Hundstage puts a finger in your brain and scratches your mind. You can not just sit back and watch the movie, you'll use exclamations or you'll look wide-eyed all the way through the movie. Nachtgestalten is a film similar to this one, but it was considerably better and much less violent. This one for example, is not for children or those who are mentally tender or in a bad mood. Most viewers would probably assign a 10 or a 1 to this movie. I give him a 9 because I saw the phenomenon of multiple stories in a movie in another movie and it was better. But this one is an exceptional piece in itself. It's worth watching, but be prepared to see something unsettling.
