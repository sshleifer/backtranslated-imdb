Good sequel to Murder in a small town. In this one, Cash and his comrade of police describe a thorny plot involving a Nazi criminal, a philanthropic witch and a family of nonsense and their assistants. As in the original, the viewer discovers a pretty little mystery with distinctive images and sounds of pre-war America. Go see him.
