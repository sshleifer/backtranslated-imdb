I went to the movies with two of my friends and I chose this movie out of the hat, not knowing what to expect. And it turns out to be a very fun and fun experience! It's an excellent movie with a very unexpected story, very good dialogue and crazy humor. All the characters are obviously made in the style "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical comics style), but that did not bother me for a second. In fact, this kind of loser alignment has created a very unique and interesting film. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is barely recognizable and brilliant. But the real star is actually Guzman. He played a role in his life in this movie! The scene where his character, Cosimo dies in the film, is so hilarious that it makes me choke and almost die with him! Highly recommended for all fans of "Alan Ford"!
