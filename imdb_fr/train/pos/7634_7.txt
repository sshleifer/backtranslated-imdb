<br /> <br /> Ok, the film was not going to win any prizes, it's pure bubblegum, and it's a modern update of "It's a wonderful life". But it's just an inexpensive DVD version and there are far worse ways to spend $ 13. You get a film that has a surprisingly strong distribution, but for the most part, they only had a year or two to become B-list stars. However, it's a nice way to spend an hour and a half, but do not think too much about it.
