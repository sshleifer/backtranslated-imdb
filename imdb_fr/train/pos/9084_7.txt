Yes, some people have said that this movie was a waste of money, but I'm the kind of dragon buff / end of the world / swagger of the sacred action movie. <br /> <br /> But if you take it from my point of view this movie had some of the best sence actions were pretty good. But that's the kind of film that made it all harder at the right time, or about the point when evil was a crush, something fell to save them at the right time. Although there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie, which surprised me. <br /> <br /> The 3D graphics were pretty good. I mean for this kind of movie, 3d effects were great !!!! The big battle that has been shown in the movie trailers is up to the hype of the film. The fight between good and bad in the end was, I must say, could have been longer and slightly better, it was still pretty good. <br /> <br /> Now, let's move on to the parts that, in my opinion, could have been better. The beginning was pretty good, showing the parts that led to the big battles. I mean, if you do not really want to go see this movie in theaters, then at least it's a DVDer ... <br /> <br /> Overall, I loved the movie, but Intrigue just fell into place too fast and fit harder just for good.
