The radio was not a radio 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when I grew up in 1930s England. Children's time was a treat for us when we had batteries and a battery to save energy. So the few shows I've heard have made a strong impression on my young spirit, and the three I still remember are "Toytown", one of all the animals in the zoo, and --- Gray Owl, talking about animals he knew, which he calls his "brothers". It's only recently that I learned that Gray Owl was not a real "Indian", but the homage paid by the Sioux chief seems to me quite logical: "A man becomes what he dreams" . If we could all dream of a changing and beneficial world for Archie Gray Owl Belaney. Could a new Gray Owl encourage world leaders to clean up the environment?
