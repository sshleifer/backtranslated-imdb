A number of contributors mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 years old and he was 50 when this movie was released. I think the difference mattered little for a drama like Vertigo, but it did for a romantic comedy. One can easily understand why his character would be attracted to his, but it is less clear why his would be attracted to his. <br /> <br /> It remains that the film works as a romantic and light fantasy. The scene where she stares at him through the cat's head, with her eyebrows painted on the bright eyebrows and the sounds of her buzzing and purring cat, is a real magic. So it's a bit shocking, then, when the scene moves up the Flatiron Building, and we see very clearly the age difference. As he kisses her, she reaches out to run her fingers through her hair, but stops the movement and lightly rubs the tips of her fingers against her forearm.
