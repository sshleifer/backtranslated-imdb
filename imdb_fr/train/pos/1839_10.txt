An excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman. One of the cops (Perier) killed her, but all the evidence seems to incriminate the other (Montand). Unfortunate Montand does not know who the other lover is who could have killed her, and PÃ©rier does not know that Montand had an affair with the girl either. Montand must find the killer ... and what a beautiful ending! Highly recommended.
