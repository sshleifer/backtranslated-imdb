The film did not work well at the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw it in preview. <br /> <br /> I have always enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the movie where the old players have gone. <br /> <br /> Not the best movie of all time, but nice. <br /> <br /> Robin is doing well with his role. <br /> <br /> Best line of the film at the beginning, by the character of Robin, Jack: "I was this SOB!" Cleans here to not shock anyone. <br /> <br /> I was happy when it came to DVDs a few years ago in the widescreen format / mailbox. <br /> <br /> I'm not a football fan or a real sports fan. But you do not have to be one to love this movie.
