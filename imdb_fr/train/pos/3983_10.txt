Fully deserving of its prestigious Hollywood Award nomination, this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some lovely surprises. Particularly amusing scenes include the hilarious filming (and re-shooting) of a World War I trench scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook in the role of an optimistic non-com and the unfortunate McDoakes in the Boyer / Colman messenger role? all under the keen eye of Ralph Sanford's deliriously irascible agony; a lost McDoakes guided and re-guided by Jack Carson, equally perplexed; assistant director Chandler looking forward to an opportunity from McDoakes: "I'm going to be a director!" <br /> <br /> The comical Ace O'Hanlon has a dual role: to play with both McDoakes and himself against McDoakes! Oddly enough, Richard L. Bare, who himself plays one or more other entries in the series, has turned down this opportunity here. In real life, Bare is a youthful lookalike and resembling Rock Hudson, but he is here imitated by the veteran actor (over 500 movies!), Jack Mower.
