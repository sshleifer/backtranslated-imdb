I always liked seeing Chuck Norris at the movies. Although the acting may not be superb, the fight scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills play alongside him. In my opinion, the Norris brothers proved that they were good artists and it was still a great production! I hope you take the time to watch this movie!
