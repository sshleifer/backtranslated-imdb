Bored, infuriating and implausible, Fay Grim is hard to accept, but Parker Posey is truly the only actress to follow and follow this story. She is at once touching, funny, cunning. Supporting actors are also involved. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to tell you the plot .. It involves characters from Henry Fool Hartley and tries to tell a story of international espionage. <br /> <br /> The film works well if you continue to understand it. in a sense, completely ridiculous. It becomes more and more ridiculous as you go along. (I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Fay Grim needs an adventurous movie buff who wants to tackle something that is not a predator. In the end, it offers something that defies description.
