It's not as violent as I thought, making violent scenes all the more brutal and effective. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of twists and turns and stabbing in the back and double crossings all along the way. film making it difficult to know which side is a given character. <br /> <br /> The plot is punctuated by good dialogue and development of the character and gives an interesting view of the functioning of the triad gang that follows. <br /> <br /> Violence when it comes is brutal, no guns or martial art scenes with special effects, it's credible in the violence of your face and for all the dialogue you do not are never allowed to forget, the Triad is a violent criminal organization. <br /> <br /> The end is surprising but perfectly coherent and credible.
