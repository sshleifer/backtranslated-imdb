Meatball Machine is an awesome movie, with an original plot with a young love, buckets of blood and strange alien creatures that turn people into whimsical robot war machines. <br /> <br /> The film is not for everyone. , people who like splashed movies or the movie Tetsuo: the Ironman will applaud. <br /> <br /> The special effects may be tacky at times in the film, but you do not exactly imagine taking the movie very seriously. <br /> <br /> Still, all in all, it's fun, if you find budding romantics infested with slimy, gobble-like tumors that seek to destroy each other in bloody battles.
