I saw this documentary absolutely fascinating for the first time in its first version in 2001, and it really impressed me so much that I urged many of my friends to see it with me in reruns. The bottom line: none of my friends left disappointed (ever!). Andy Goldsworthy, Scottish conceptual artist, creates absolutely beautiful works of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create works that eventually regain their natural form temporary state of everything?). We see Goldsworthy creating several temporary artworks, as well as some of his long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as some works of nature. The German filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs and edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for the eyes and ears (with an ambient music score, composed and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is generally audacious, experimental / noise textured guitar, as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for a few years now, if you can find a cinema that highlights the revival of this beautiful film, look for it (it's easily a film made for the big screen, with a sound system competent to really experience this movie the right way). No MPAA classification, but contains no offending elements (unless the live birth of a sheep on the screen is intended to offend or disturb)
