When I saw this film for the first time, I was with my father. He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, he immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A river crosses These are two brothers who each take a different path. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the eldest of the two brothers and he is on the road to education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the rebellious younger brother who takes a path full of pitfalls. The film follows these characters because everyone follows his own path. <br /> <br /> There is no problem with this film. You will be entertained all along. The acting, the staging and the scenario are perfect. The two outstanding things are cinematography and score. What imprisons you in the world that Robert Redford creates for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that is classic. It's good in my book. If you have not seen this movie, watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever.
