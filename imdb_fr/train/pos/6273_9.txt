I really loved this movie, yes, I know it was pretty far fetched, it's impossible that the Shelby car could have stayed on the road, as well as the 540i with all its traction control and other gadgets, but other than that, the whole movie was well set up. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast was also very good with the exception of the British Bad Guy, he was a little "too much", do not you think? Anyway, good movie, good cars and good acting. I made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely operated garage that night. :)
