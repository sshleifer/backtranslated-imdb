The Color Purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those who are deeply affected by the struggles of life. Each character had an element of the purple color in them. The film is about love, lost, hope, hatred and triumph. whether it was Celie who lived through hell and lost her sister, and that Shug comes into his life to show him his love again. his stubbornness, good and bad, and even Nettie, they had their emptiness and their difficulties through the film but were defeated in the end and this is the sign of a good movie. Good job to all the actors and the team.
