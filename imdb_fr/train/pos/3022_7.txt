Never realized that Charles Boyer, (Luis Denard) appeared with Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) in a film together and enjoyed their great actor together. Even Peter Lorre (Contreras) played a part in this movie and had a big misfortune in his bathroom that made him faint. This story deals with a Republican courier, Luis Denard, who travels to England during the Spanish Civil War and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause serious damage to other nations. Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) comes to the aid of Luis Denard by taking him in his arms and at the same time falling in love with him, then helps him to escape the angry crowd of English miners who threaten his life. The real villain of this film is Victor Francen (Licata) "The Five-Finger Beast" which gives an exceptional performance. Great classic movie of 1945 without Humphrey Bogart.
