"The woman in black" is without a doubt one of the most scary British ghost stories of all time. A young lawyer, arrived in a small town to take care of the property of a dead client, is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed in black. The film is loaded with an extremely disturbing atmosphere and fears are calculated for and produce the maximum possible effect. The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite unsettling. The acting is excellent and the tension is sometimes unbearable. So if you want to see a really scary horror movie give this one a look . I dare anyone to watch "The Woman in Black" alone at night with the lights off.Highly recommended.10 out of 10.
