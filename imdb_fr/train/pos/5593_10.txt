This film could have been a silent film; he certainly has the feeling of one. I was extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this movie. Extase, is a "symphony of love" that transcends all language versions. French, which is the ultimate romantic language, seems quite appropriate for this very sensual and lyrical version. A young Hedy Lamarr illuminates the screen, in this film that looks like a fantasy sex; but certainly far from being pornographic. The technical qualities may have been a bit crude; but that does not detract from the magic spell that emerges from this film. Many early cinema fans would absolutely love this movie.
