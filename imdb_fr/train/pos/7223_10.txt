The comparison with Sleuth, the first film shot on stage, is obvious and during my first viewing, I also thought that Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap has, at least for me, many more repetitive views than Sleuth. <Br /> <br /> I bought Deathrap in Wal-Mart's bargain baskets, thinking he had Caine and the underrated prefect and was worth $ 6. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could have bought. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best-kept secrets that moviegoers are always thrilled to discover. And it's really worth repeating the views. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine played Bravo performances at Sleuth, Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson impressed me twice. Reeve, legitimately associated with his now legendary portrait of Superman, stole the show in what should have been an Oscar-worthy performance. I always thought that Reeve was a character cast actor who did not really have the chance to shine outside Superman movies and some other ridiculous but entertaining movies like Somewhere in Time, but this movie shows that his potential was really tapped and taken advantage of, thank God. <br /> <br /> I absolutely loved the performance of Michael Caine. He was flippant, deliciously manipulative and sadistic. And watching him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact, it is thanks to this film that I entered a "phase of Michael Caine" and I began to praise everything that was humanly possible. <br /> <br /> As for Deathtrap, there is enough juicy dialogue here to complete its "memorable quotes" section. (Unfortunately, much of the dialogue would intrinsically spoil the extremely entertaining plot.) <br /> <br /> It's really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover. by yourself. Needless to say, it's a must. But for me, it was the biggest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time. <br /> <br /> Repeated visits are essential. <br /> <br /> And he deserves to sit next to Sleuth on your DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> I leave you with this quote beautifully written film: "I wonder if it would not be ... well ... just a little disgusted on my part to enter such a risky collaboration and exciting ... where I could not rely on any sense of moral obligation ... whatsoever.
