If you have an idea of ​​Jane Austen's production, you will find that she repeats the same thing in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the films in his novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen's characters because they all have a personality and typical sayings they like to repeat, as in Emma. What makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her lead role. In addition, the fact that each of the characters in the film does not seem to be able to think, but how to find a good partner and soon married makes the film hilarious.
