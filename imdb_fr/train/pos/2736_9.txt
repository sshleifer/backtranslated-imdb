A unique film ... one of the best of all time. Quincy Jones' play, screenplay, score, cinematography, editing, etc. - just fantastic. As most viewers know, this film is based on Truman Capote's book on the famous murder of a family of Kansas farmers (the Clutters) by a couple of young boys during an armed robbery. I have never seen a film that has so brilliantly transformed a true story into a fascinating film. <br /> <br /> The players are strong overall, but the focus is on the murderers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team who is pursuing them. Scott Wilson, like Dick Hickock is amazing. Flirty, nervous and devoid of compassion, he is so charming, fat and plausible. Robert Blake in the role of Perry Smith is also extraordinary - alone, both empathic and cold. Who could bring these characteristics together in one person and get them to buy? He does it and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how these two very different sociopathic individuals had to meet to create the critical mass needed to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and that these two actors are doing a magnificent job. Both have had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high marks, and this represents an interim period. <br /> <br /> The cops are so wonderful. John Forsythe is leading the investigation, but the other three detectives are also excellent. Unlike contemporary films, where producers find it necessary to endow the police with superhuman assets or weaknesses, they are only real flat feet, who treat the matter with determination and competence. They seem so real. I have never seen police officers so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most crime classics go way back. Truly unique in this respect. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL SPOILER TO COME (this film has the particularity that you already know what happened, but I warn you for the record). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes from the best crime movies and movies are interrogations - intellectual fencing matches between cops and crooks, Mano a Mano. This film contains the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see in a movie. Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff and get rid slowly, unaware that the cops have the merchandise on it. But the cops must skillfully prepare their suspects for the fracture of their alibis and obtain a confession, hopefully. This is one of the best actors you will ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the show. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and horrible angles of this true story, ICB was filmed in the real Clutter house, and I heard that student-moviegoers had interpreted Clutters to give them a true impression. It works. These seem to be decent and simple people. This makes the crime so palpable and so sad. <br /> <br /> I will stop here. This is not a film that feels good, but it's one of the best films ever made, and so unique, it's a mandatory viewing for all moviegoers.
