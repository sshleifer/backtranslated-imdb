A fantastic show and an unrealized classic; The League of Gentlemen remains one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times. <br /> <br /> With a dark and weird humor style that dominates the tired and formal approach of his inferior successor, but unfortunately much more recognized. Little Britain, The League of Gentlemen was really something special in a rather quiet era of British comedy. <br /> <br /> Until his arrival on the scene, there had never been anything like The League of Gentlemen before. On the surface, a show of sketches apparently simplistic, the show is soon revealed as a living universe, sinister but incredibly hilarious, populated by all kinds of brilliant comic creations. What really distinguishes the series from its rivals is its approach to telling us its story. Rather than using recalcitrant sketches, hardly distinguishable from the following, we see here each individual or group of characters browse their different paths and stories. No visit is the same, and every time they offer us a surprise. <br /> <br /> Little by little, over three series and a special Christmas show, the fictional city of Royston Vasey swells with a grotesque hilarious populace. And that's probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch (and also the reason why the show would easily deserve more series). Unlike other current shows such as The Catherine Tate Show or, more importantly, Little Britain, the League knows when a character has taken his course and has the ability to handle that. Several fan favorites, who could easily keep entertaining themselves, pulled out before the end of the series, leaving room for other characters to expand, or allowing new residents of Royston Vasey to stand out. <br /> <br /> Another thing that puts this show above others is that the writing team approaches the scripting process with care and intelligence. As mentioned before, all four members of the league have a healthy mind to judge the longevity of their creations, and when it's time to call, they drop with regard to certain characters. This awareness also means that the League of Gentlemen is undergoing a daring evolution, rarely seen in a show of this nature. The third series, inspired by the story and much darker, is a step forward from the first two series more focused on the skit, and this bold initiative of the League is bearing fruit. With the third series, it is less urgent for them to please an audience and, as in the case of the Christmas special, they tell individual stories with a clear story, unlike the previous series based more on the sketches that has linked (successfully) various sketch sets in the long story of a series. <br /> <br /> The third series is both a refreshing style change and a treat for fans who have already seen the first two. Despite the polarized opinion on the third series, any fan of the League will appreciate what the third series has to offer, as well as the more character-based episodes, which only dive deeper into fans' favorites, but wine characters that may not have already crossed the path before. <br /> <br /> It may take a bit of trying to get into the style change, but it's really worth it, and in my opinion, the third set is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series. <br /> <br /> The show is not without drawbacks, and very occasionally, some characters and pieces of board seem somewhat out of place, but for the most part, the genius of writing, the dark nature of the series and many brilliant characters (often very close to real life) are a real treat and prove what should be the comedy and puts forward a lot of the most recent comedy attempts, often dictated by the slogan and often desperate. shame
