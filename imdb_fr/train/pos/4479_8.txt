Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, he is very nostalgic to watch it on a videotape. At the age of 15, it was easy for me to be trained in the first of MGM Technicolor's great musicals. Now, I may be more interested in thinking about the future careers of the main players. Although Sinatra shot a few negligible films shortly after its appearance in the Dorsey era, as a lead singer, it was his first appearance in a major film. As another viewer has noted, it almost seems like a warm up for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to work hard, but her dance with Kelly is credible and he would do better in their next couple. However, by observing his physique, it is easy to understand why he was caricatured as a bean. Who could have imagined that in less than a decade he would win an Academy Award for his performance, and play many roles as a detective or leader in combat? Although Gene Kelly's personality and dance dominated the film, his mesmerizing performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a complementary dance style. to that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was odd to see the new Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a "thrill" killer in Compulsion, based on the 1920s murder of Leopold-Loeb. An additional note: a critic has praised Betty Garrett's performance as Sinatra's love interest. She then played in front of him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this movie.
