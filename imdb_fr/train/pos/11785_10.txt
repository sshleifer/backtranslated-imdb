I do not know how to explain "Darkend Room" because summarizing would not really do justice. It is a typical Lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange and mysterious situation. I would say that this short film is definitely more on the "Mulholland Drive" side of the lynchian spectrum, as opposed to "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story". It's hidden on Lynch's website, and well worth the search.
