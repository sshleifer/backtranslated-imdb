In April 1965, CBS broadcast the first of Barbra Streisand's monumental television specials. The show has not only been a resounding success, but has also won 5 Emmy Awards. This is one of the most memorable moments of 1960s television and (unfortunately) the kind of TV specials they no longer produce. Filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance by Barbra, this special show is a must-see show for all Streisand fans and anyone interested in the first television.
