As an adult, I really enjoyed this one. I watched it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1/2 year old girl was fascinated and the 15-month-old mouse laughed in front of the mice. <br /> <br /> The music is fun and the animation is wonderful. This sequel does what Return to Neverland did not accomplish. A good follow-up of Cinderella's story; but what becomes of Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope!
