This is the true story of how three British soldiers escaped from the German POW camp, Stalag Luft III, during the Second World War. It is the same prisoner of war camp that was the scene of the Great Escape, which resulted in the assassination of 50 officers recaptured by the Gestapo (and which was then transformed into a very successful film of the same name). <br /> <br /> While the other Stalag Luft III prisoners of war are working on the construction of their three large tunnels (known as Tom, Dick & Harry), two enterprising British prisoners have had the idea to build a horse could be placed near the wire fence, shortening the distance they would have to dig between this starting point and freedom. The idea of ​​building their version of the Trojan came to them as they discussed "classic" attempts to escape and watched prisoners of war playing frog jump in the compound. <br /> <br /> Initially containing one, then later with Two prisoners of war hidden inside, the wooden horse could be carried into the enclosure and placed almost in the same place, near the fence, daily. While volunteer prisoners of war passed over the horse, the escapees were busy digging a tunnel under the rope-jumping horse while being placed near the wire, under the wire and in the woods. <br /> <br /> The story also details the dangers faced by two of the three fugitive prisoners of war who cross Germany and occupy Europe after they leave the tunnel. The three prisoners of war who tried to escape actually hit a circuit (successfully escaped to their base.). The wooden horse gives a very accurate and true sense of the tension and events of a prisoner of war escape. The film was shot on the actual places along the road taken by the two prisoners of war during their flight. Made with a budget much lower than The Great Escape, The Wooden Horse is more realistic if not more exciting than The Great Escape and never fails to keep you out of the seat to encourage prisoners of war to make a successful escape. <br /> <br /> The story is clear and the game sounds right and is tense enough to maintain tension throughout the film. The wooden horse is based on the book of the same name written by one of the escapees, Eric Williams, and is by far the best prisoner of war escape story ever transformed into a film. Some of the prisoners of war were used in the film to resume their existence as prisoners of Stalag Luft III. I give this film a well deserved ten.
