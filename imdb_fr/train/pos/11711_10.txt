Ms. Patty Duke's story about her life and her problems with manic-depressive depression was similar to that of my life. I saw myself playing like her. I was so amazed by the similarities in our lives that include the sexual abuse that we both endured. <br /> <br /> I saw the film when it first appeared in 1990 and I liked it so much. Anyone who has had problems with manic depression could draw such a benefit from this movie. Never mind, it may be that it shows his rewards or what they serve. This is not the problem here. The question is how Ms. Duke had an illness and fought to survive and defeated. Ms. Duke is proud of her accomplishments in her fight for the survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hope. <br /> <br /> Unless a person has personally battled this disease, she ignores the hell they must live with. The film was a success for me because it showed the real problems and how a depressed and maniacal person behaves. It was so real ... so, really. It was as if I was watching on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would like to personally thank Mrs. Patty Duke for having the courage to inform the public about her illness. Bocka
