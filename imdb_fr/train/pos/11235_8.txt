Well done, and with "New Travels", it's a great continuation! Fabulous to see James Cawley in the last episode of "Vigil" <br /> <br /> I like the growing characterization and I think we have good substitutes for the television actors in a play produced by fans. This show manages to capture the sensation quite well. As they say on the ste, it has improved over the years and I hope, with a little more experience, a strong scenario editor, a resumption of timing and CGI rendering that HF ​​increasingly remarkable that it really is already! <br /> <br /> Good job to everyone involved! <br /> <br /> (I have a huge crush on Lefler & McFarland (BIG actor), although I 'm sick of Lefler' s laws. (but a bit stuck) and it's cool that she had the ship Commodore Ian is nice (like Fred Flintstone), but he does not have the cruel side of a commanding officer and seems The doctor, the Councilor and Rawlins are right in my eyes, as well as the WONDERFUL Nechayev (what a beautiful accent - a real Russian! (I guess René is from the Czech Republic).) <br /> <br /> He gets my vote , and the CGI is kewl. Some of the greenscreen are obvious, but on a small whaddayagonndo budget? <br /> <br /> Really happy to have und it! <br /> <br /> (Okay, some actors are not great but they are made by fans and so are allowed to be variable - sorry Cmm Cole) <br /> <br /> The gay matter is too thick (Graham Norton would be embarrassed). rek does not pay much attention to heterosexual couples, so why choose gays with beguinages? It's not necessary to highlight someone's sexuality to that extent - I hope they mitigate that and let Aster & Zen become people who are not tokens - I do not treat my gay friends differently, they are just normal guys. <br /> <Musically, it's a mixed bag. I can say more about the whole Trek OST solution and work most of the time, but the schedule may stop soon (the end of "Worst Fears Part 2" is missing the crunch and editing. the fact that they use the "Galaxy" Quest "music! <br /> <br /> I certainly can not expect more! Dazza <br /> <br />" Never give up, never ever be Surender! "<br /> <br /> Viva the frontieres
