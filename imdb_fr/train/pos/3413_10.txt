I just came out and I can not believe how brilliant this documentary is. You rarely go out of a movie theater with such enthusiasm and wonder. Lately, the movies have become so excited that the thrill of discovering something really special and unique rarely happens. Amores Perros did that to me when he came out and this movie is hurting me now. I did not know anything about this before going into this subject and what a surprise. If you hear the concept, you may feel that this is one of those touching films about an amazing triumph, covered in music and trying to convince us of the great story it tells, but do not let us in. Fortunately, this is not this movie. People tell the story! It's such a good job to capture every moment of their involvement as we enter their world and feel every second with them. There are so many things beyond the climb that make everything they go through so much more tense. Touching the Void was also an excellent documentary on mountaineering and the demonstration of intensity in an engaging way, but this film is much more of a human story. I just saw it today but I'll say it's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.
