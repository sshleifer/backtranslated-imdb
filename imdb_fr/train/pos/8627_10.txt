My God ! Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best films I have ever seen. Closer to the films of Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard, this one is really disturbing but not as macabre as the Nekromantiks. All the little stories have a profound philosophical interest and the realization is totally inventive, despite the lack of money (see the sketch of the "bridge"). Strongly recommended!
