Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his first film, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," they played together in this film. George Clooney was also involved in this film as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. In potential, it also looks like an interesting and entertaining project, which goes in the same direction as the remakes of films such as "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but this film has only a success halved or at least he is not. as good as it could have been. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are all played by very good actors well known, but it is a pity that the characters do not have enough room to develop. Even if, in their potential, they could have become fun and pleasant characters, they are only characters who entertain slightly, mainly because of some of the most original sequences of the film. The fact that they are played does not change that much, even if they prevent their characters from getting boring, even boring, or something like that. <br /> <br /> This is of course because of the writing that the characters are not used to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti Ignoti" works much better than this movie. The film relies too much on its simple story and its predictable narrative style. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is simply fun to watch, perhaps because of this same simplicity. It's a harmless little caper movie, in which you simply should not worry about the story. In this respect, "Welcome to Collinwood" is always a film that works and that simply fulfills its purpose. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that you will not regret seeing once finished, but still a movie you can really do easily without ever seeing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
