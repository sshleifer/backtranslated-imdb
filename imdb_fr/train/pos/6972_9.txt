The episode Caprica (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Really, this episode is exactly the same content as the pilot version of the DVD. That being said, episode 01 gives a very concrete insight into the very popular "Battlestar Galactica" series (both the original and the 2007 remake). It applies significantly to the 2007 series. Like current trends in science fiction, this series explores life or the "virtual" environment. In addition, we have a lot of knowledge about the Adama family lineage and their relationship with the undisclosed creator (in the Battlestar Galactica series) of the Cylons. For the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular theme of "virtual" life and (as one might expect) the early life of the colonies and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rather enjoyed this episode. Although this is not a new material for myself or anyone who has seen the Caprica pilot's DVD version, the series looks very promising. As in the case of many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a catch-cliff to ensure a follow-up by an audience (science fiction community). I will definitely continue to monitor resolution and development. <br /> <br /> I give 8 stars to this series.
