It's a complex documentary that shows a lot about early gay life. To put things in perspective, it was at the time when Gay was the word used to refer to the homosexual revolution, not just Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used that way today? I think most of the film was from 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it's been a long time. <br /> <br /> I was touched by documentaries capturing the love of one man for another, about twenty times. period of the year. A love expressed in a way that only true love can be. There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, as well as scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes of life as a homosexual and life as a gay. The film itself was a work of love and I think it's a diamond. <br /> <br /> At least, this film will provide an understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS. As I write these lines, I realize how much this film seemed to have been settled earlier. The progress of the medical, political, social and cultural sciences that have taken place since the shooting of this film (about fifteen years ago) is amazing. However, of course, in the case of AIDS, we have not finished yet. Damn I guess we have not finished on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's just a very good documentary. I encourage anyone who feels they do not understand gay life, gay issues or the devastation of AIDS to watch this movie.
