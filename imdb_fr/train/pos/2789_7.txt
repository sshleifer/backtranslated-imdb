Curl it as Beckham is full of intriguing scenes, but has a predictable hitting line. This is a girl named Jess who is trying to fulfill her dream of becoming a famous football player and who finally has the chance to get a job with a local team. there are so many limits and limits that she faces that holds her back, but she is always determined and striving. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good light film and wants to be inspired by what people can achieve. The song choices are really good: 'Shh my child, just go ... to your destination and you will create limits and complications.' Anyway, hope it has been helpful to meet your needs. Bend it like Beckham great movie
