Although not without flaws, this drama suited perfectly around Easter. It reminded us of our spiritual identity and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences. There was so much to enjoy in the drama, especially teenagers rappers who provided better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background. The acting was excellent and Timothy Spall was once again superb. The climax was very satisfying, although rather simplistic. Timothy Spall's "letting go" after the suicide of his deceased wife was credible and reflected the sense of hopelessness that reigned in this teenager who was self-injurious. The resolution between the graffiti and the Muslim was gratifying but less credible. A wonderful drama that left my husband and myself convinced that the evening had gone well. Congratulations!
