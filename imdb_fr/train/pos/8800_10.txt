First of all, I do not understand why some people find this film so anti-American. Of course, there are times when the United States is directly accused, as in the segments of Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair. But come on, these are not naive accusations; instead, they are based on real, documented facts, and all the documents that the CIA has published on Chile confirm it, for example. <br /> <br /> But back to the film itself, what I liked the most is the variety of atmospheres we find in it. We find children educated for the respect of all the people who died during the event; we find an unhappy couple who will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find ordinary people who have their feelings degraded by the shadow of the events of 9/11 and react differently to that, with dignity or frustration; we even find in the film someone for whom the fall of the towers gives rise to a real moment of happiness. <br /> <br /> All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a coherent mix and help the viewer to get a glimpse of how different people around the world have reacted to events of 11 September. So we see a panorama much more complex than whites and blacks, which can make some people angry; but it is the world in which we live, and there is no room for manichistic ideologies, regardless of what presidents and priests can tell us. <br /> <br /> Finally, I find it unfortunate that there is not even a release date for this film in the United States of America. It's a shame because most Americans ask why this disaster happened and this film could give them clues. This film shows very clearly - contrary to what some members of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future and that the mistakes of the past will affect how we live today.
