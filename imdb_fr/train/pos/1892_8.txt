After seeing Arthur on TV many times, I laughed so much that Dudley Moore's role in Arthur was a happy chance to become a drunk millionaire was hysterical, but John Gielgud as a servant / Hobson's figure was just as charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and I watched it. Despite the passage of nearly 27 years, it is still as pleasant as ever. The role of Liza Minnelli as the love interest fascinated, the chemistry between the two was magical. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach (Moore) is a spoiled drunk millionaire who has a bill on bars that reads like the national debt. He has no desire to grow up and likes to play like a child. His activities are supervised by his English butler Hobson (Gielgud). It seems that nobody really cares about Arthur except him. Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he does not marry Susan Johnson (Eikenberry), a blonde socialite, out of four. In a few weeks, his son will inherit $ 750 million from his son's inheritance. <br /> <br /> However, Arthur falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli), a young waitress of the working class and thief of ties. He must now make a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur grows up and eventually breaks up with Susan before the wedding, leaving him to keep his money and true love. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for everyone.
