The remake of Tian is not good at all. I'm just clicking on her remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress of the 1948 classic film, say a few words to the team. We will meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after the screening of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in the movie Archiev of Hong Kong. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old, she has silver hair and her appearance in Hong Kong movies is always a surprise for her fans. This year, at the Hong Kong Film Festival, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, director of this epic film, and Wei Wei's film is shot in Hong Kong. My son, who is 21 years old this year, is surprised that Wei Wei is so beautiful at the time.
