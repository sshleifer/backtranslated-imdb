Here's a proof of why Mary Pickford was America's friend. In this rather complex drama, Mary plays the girl of a squatter who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the "overthrowers". The scenes where they steal a kiss and fall in love are simply delicious. She is even ready to take a bath. The fact that Mary can play this role at 30 is simply incredible and a little due to its small size (5 '). <br /> <br /> Tess faces many physical and emotional challenges. She does it with a cum that is not seen in many heroines of the time. Tess has a whiplash and does not hesitate to fight with anyone. Why does she agree to help the girl "at the top of a hill" overwhelms me, but she sacrifices her own happiness to keep a deep secret. The close-ups of Pickford are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Born in Denmark, Jean Hersholt is simply wonderful as a villain. The scene in which he abuses a little baby is enough to make you throw vegetables (or something else) on the screen. If Forrest Robinson (who plays the role of Dad Skinner) had worn a beard, he would have been at the height of the model used in the recruitment of posters of Uncle Sam by the First World War. Wants You! <br /> <br /> Although the story is a little predictable and slow in the beginning, it's worth it to invest time in your time to see the play or purely "Americana". The film highlights the choices available to all of us - to make someone else happy and to become a true Christian. Recommended.
