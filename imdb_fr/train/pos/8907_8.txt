I saw this movie at midnight on demand the other night, not knowing what to expect. I had heard about this movie, but I never really thought about it. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was impressed by what I saw. I was really panicked in some parts and I really remember getting up in my seat a few times. <br /> <br /> The blob looked scary. Now, I'm looking into a jelly jar and I wonder if it will get caught in my hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was really good as a protagonist of the movie, Steve Andrews. I also liked the old man at first. <br /> <br /> For a horror film of the 50s, it was very well done, even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
