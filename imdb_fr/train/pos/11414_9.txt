A beautiful story with a message. Joan Plowright is superb as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is hilarious as "coach" and Richard de Klerk superbly plays the role of "Carmine". Mischa Barton in the role of "Frankie" performs well and Ingrid in the role of "Hazel" plays extremely well her first lead. This film is superbly directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The editing is first rate.
