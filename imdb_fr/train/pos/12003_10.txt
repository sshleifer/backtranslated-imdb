As a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as much as possible the story of my new religion. I was invited to attend a screening of this film with my sons and other young men and women and their families from our neighborhood. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring evening, we went to Kirtland, Ohio, in the historic village of the church. We had to have reservations at Vistor's Center to watch this movie. My viewing being limited to a few church documentaries, I was intrigued. The only "complete movies" of the church I saw were "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years", two texts that I found very well written and preformed. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the missionary interpreter distributed handkerchiefs saying that several people had been deeply moved to the point of crying because of this film. I thought "ok ... but it takes a lot to make me cry." Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing! It is truly a moving and inspiring testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> See and believe in his powerful message!
