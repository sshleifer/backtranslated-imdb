It seems that even the director does not like this film, but for me, I think he is a little hard on himself. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not perfect, but there are atmospheric shots and the story is good. enough to stay interested. <br /> <br /> It was shot in what appears to be a pretty pretty village, which also adds to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies shot in England, come try. <br /> <br /> I just saw a trailer of the director's last film 'The Devil's Chair' that looks amazing. <br /> <br /> There is not enough horror in English movies for me, so those coming deserve our attention, and this one is not as bad as you might think
