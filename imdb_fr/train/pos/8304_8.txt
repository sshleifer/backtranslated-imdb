I caught this movie late on Saturday night / Sunday morning with my brother. We had drunk. It's one of the best ripping movies I've ever seen. The "luxury" liner, which is actually a rolling ferry, with stickers on the cast iron doors, stickers on the staff, then the fact that the same door is used for something else in another scene : this film rocks! The continuity is so bad that you can not help but notice, it slaps your face with the holes. In the final scene, he jumps from a rescue boat with the ferry off. Cut to his son and his new girlfriend (the director of public relations of ships who knows the kung fu and who was part of the police but was fired for having acted in this way - it is true) on the ferry which is moving away quickly from the explosion. ...... Then the father is there to hug them. How???? Who cares, his magic. There is not a feature that redeems this movie. The casino is the size of a large room with a casino table. when pursued by the wicked, there is only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One table, launch four slot machines and a small corner bar (a corner in the casino - fantastic). They pass in front of the only hiding place, allowing our Casper to circumvent them and "take them out". <br /> <br /> Bring some friends, drink a few drinks, put on this movie and yell.
