If you want to watch something that is for him and for her so to speak, then this is the movie to choose from. I am a sucker for Roma but my husband is not always so enthusiastic (what a guy!). Anyway, I managed to make him look because I told him it was a sporting issue, and you know what, he loved it! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and his main man (sorry but can remember his name) is just as good. When I watched the movie, it was called "The Perfect Match" but I think the title was changed to the UK because it's based on the book Fever Pitch and there was already a movie done on the football with this title (the same movie but the English version - phew!), <br /> <br /> Anyway, all the comments will tell you more details if you need them, buy them, take them to me, put your boyfriend / boyfriend in front of the television on a Saturday night and you will both laugh and cry. A real gem.
