If you like science fiction 70s like I do, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai", you'll love this one. This is a spectacular science-fiction awareness stream of the 1970s, featuring a 22nd century breakage and the Earth in a million years. This film is pure 70's. Put Steve Miller's "Fly Like An Eagle" or Pink Floyd's "Dark Side Of The Moon" and you're ready to go!
