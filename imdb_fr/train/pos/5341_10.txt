CAROL'S VOYAGE is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons. The role of Clara Lago is simply incredible for such a young person and she is one of those special actors who can say a lot with facial expressions. The director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film without interruption of continuity, thus propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense so that we still wonder what the scene of the nest will bring. Angel Garcia Roldan's screenplay is the best in storytelling, which seems to be the main goal of the movies after all. The plot is unpredictable, but events as they unfold are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature film of this film is to tell a story of the Spanish Civil War as it affected the population. It was a major event of the 20th century, but almost no American knows it. In fact, in 40 years of university education, I averaged about one student per semester who had even heard of it, let alone those who could say more about it - and the vast majority of students were merit specialists who to the huge amount of censorship in American education. In a way, this movie is a good way to start a study of this event, keeping in mind that when a wire is drawn, much of the story is erased. The appreciation of this film is therefore directly related to the extent of knowledge. Seeing this film as another entry-age film is the complete misfire. The Left Elbow Index takes into account seven aspects of the film (acting, production, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity and artistic): 10 for very good, 5 for medium and 1 for need help. CAROL'S VOYAGE is above average in all respects, with the exception of dialogue classified as average. The LEI average for this film is 9.3, increased to 10 when equated with the IMDb scale. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.
