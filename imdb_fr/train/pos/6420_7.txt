This one is a super! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and influential film. This is the true story of the first black diver of the US Navy and the obstacles he had to overcome to obtain his certification at the hands of a racist master racer. Along the way, he must also deal with the old bigotry of all his classmates, none of whom wants it in their class. They leave the barracks when he arrives. In the end, he graduated and pursued a successful career as a diver in the US Navy. Look at this one! It's a great story of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we see racism slowly dissipate and everyone starts to respect the men one by one.
