This is one of those movies that is hard to watch without revealing the plot. In other words, strange things and unexpected twists occur, beyond the initial superficial plot "Tom Cruise screws with multiple women". <br /> <br /> The quality of the top actors elevates this film above the norm and all the actors Cruise is the irritating playboy who has it all - and then loses it, Diaz, the endearing but slightly lover disturbed, Cruz, the new exotic girl on the stage and Russell, the paternal psychologist. The story includes elements of romance, morality, mystery murder, suspense and science fiction. This is usually an entertaining trip. <br /> <br /> I would add that photography is also uniformly excellent and that various metaphors are inserted. It's beautiful once you realize what's going on. <br /> <br /> If you like well-shot movies with twists and suspense and are willing to accept a slightly fantastically Philip K Dick-style resolution, then this is a must. <br /> <br /> 9/10
