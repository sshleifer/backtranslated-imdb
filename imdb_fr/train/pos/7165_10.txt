I recorded that a long time ago, but I could only watch it today. I was sick, so I ran out of equipment to watch! I'm so happy to have seen it and to be able to erase my memory and watch it for the first time. This film is so wonderful! It reminded me a lot of fried green tomatoes at Whistlestop coffee. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the film, we see what are the links. Some people said it was a children's movie. I do not agree - this can be done by Disney and many characters are kids, but I'm 23 years old and I loved it! There have been times when my spine has tingled. The story is unlike any other film nowadays, full of adventure. I just ordered the Amazon book, can not wait!
