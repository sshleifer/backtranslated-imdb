There are a lot of problems with Mystery Men. First of all, there are too many different characters so that everyone can be assigned complex personalities, even interesting. Special effects are bad for history and not really special. Paul Reubens is lost in a pathetic and juvenile role as a character who simply fart and speaks with an inaudible accent. <br /> <br /> Now, let's move on to the decent elements. William H Macy, three divine words and his performance as a shovel is perfect. The sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and simply throws the traditional mystic proverbs. Ben Stiller is also very entertaining, showing a weak character trying to be part of the big leagues of superheroes. All the characters do it, and this is an area that I found particularly ironic. This is because all the actors are independent film actors who try to be part of the big Hollywood leagues. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I thought it was a box office failure, that America does not do it. irony. <br /> <br /> In the end, I liked the movie, but I think it would have worked better if you were trying to tweak the screenplay rather than having unnecessary CGI landscapes and effects.
