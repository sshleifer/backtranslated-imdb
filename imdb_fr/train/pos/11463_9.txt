I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was completely blown away. The structure and execution of the film have been fantastic ... I know this will not be the case, but it really deserves an Oscar nod. Cal and Andre were phenomenal as two troubled comrades. Yes, the film is very controversial and I can see that a lot of people have a lot of problems with it because it deals with shooting at school and leads you to identify yourself with the killers. However, despite its hard and brutal subject, Zero Day deserves so much to be watched. I can not wait to see it on video so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the final shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it is almost too realistic. Their uncertainty, the "recordings", the images and the panic of the students, totally indescribable. I really hope he gets the attention he deserves. It's in the same format as the Blair Witch Project, a portable camera, designed to appear like a true domestic documentary film, but god is infinitely better. Very impressive, hat to everyone involved. If you are lucky, you should really see it.
