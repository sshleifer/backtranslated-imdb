So we compromised. It was a pretty pretty movie, I liked the art direction (it sounded much more "real" than most children's movies) and the costumes were not too cute. The children actors are not bad to watch (the performances of adults tend to be ugly). It was good that they showed how a bullied child intimidated others, as well as children who were fighting bullying. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many adults would like to see it for themselves, but it's great. movie to take a child to. And since "Barnyard" has apparently been attended by more than 100 kids at the same time, I'm REALLY happy to have chosen the sparsely attended "worms" instead.
