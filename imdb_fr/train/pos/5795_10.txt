This movie is my favorite of all time !!! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this beautiful movie !! I am always above the moon, watching her !! It's a movie that you really have to see, even if you're not a fan of MJ, because this movie writes, like Captain EO, E.T. and Ghosts, a bit of movie history and music !! This wonderful film, out of the pen of Michael, is a must have !! And: Smooth Criminal, is really the most wonderful, exciting and incredible song I've ever heard in my life !! Thank you Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician on the planet, he is a good man and he always shines your eyes when you listen to his music! Please, if you do not know this movie, look at it and do not miss it, because it would be a shame for you if you missed it !! - Highly recommended film, for all movie buffs -
