I'm not a fan of new movies, but this one was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children could watch it together - what an unusual! My aunt loved it too. There were laughs, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot. It reminded me of a favorite, the Wizard of Oz. The hero Paulie, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and his family and lives many adventures, temptations and disappointments, keeping in mind his resolve to find his friend Marie. Highly recommended.
