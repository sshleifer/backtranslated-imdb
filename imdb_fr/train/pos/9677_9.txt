This film seems to be a series of children's movies that parents can unfortunately watch with their grandchildren mostly entertained. The film seems and is mainly aimed at children but it does not stop at this level. I watched this movie for the first time as a young child and found it funny, fun and comforting and I have not seen it for many years. I watched her recently at the age of 18 and found her almost as funny, but just as comforting and entertaining. This movie is very underrated and contains many real life messages. This film is an inspiring quest story, designed for kids and yet epic. I recommend this movie for all ages.
