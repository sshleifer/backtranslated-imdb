Some people might call "Paulie" a children's movie, but I want to say that it's more than that. Probably more than anything else, this film does its utmost to show the fate of immigrants in the United States - a topical issue given the recent debates. The film tells several stories told by a parrot telling a Russian immigrant concierge (Tony Shalhoub) how he had looked for America in search of his first owners. There is the elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) with whom he becomes friends, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very well done movie. Usually, I do not expect much of this kind of movies, but this one is a treat. I certainly recommend it. Also with Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
