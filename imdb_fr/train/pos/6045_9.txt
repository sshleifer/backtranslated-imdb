I was also in the movie, but I do not know if they put this scene on the stage. On the way back from a school trip (in 2005), we stopped at a gas station at the same time they were filming, and we were asked (all of us) to run and scream Go! Free Bird! We were all about 10 years old. Someone who saw the film could tell me if this part was kept in the film, it would be nice to know! I remember that I thought the film was never released, because it was still 2 and a half years before its release. All your comments seem to be good, so I guess the movie was a success. I might buy it, but I'd like to know if I'm in the movie first! : D thanks
