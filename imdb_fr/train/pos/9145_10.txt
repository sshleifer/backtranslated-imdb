Prince plays the role of the "kid" in this semi-autobiographical film of a talented but narcissistic young musician, who lives a less brilliant family life. Certainly, the game of actors is poor (except Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams, which are both perfect), but the film is still great and is among the best of the 1980s. It has the best soundtrack of N ' IMPORTE What movie of the last fifty years at least, highly quoted lines, and the scene of the dumpster is HILARIOUS !! Moreover, Apollonia is simply amazing. On another step, when I saw Prince in concert in 2004, he destroyed the stadium. He is an expert on the show and it was one of the best concerts of my life. <br /> <br /> My note: A <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: Record 1) Comment with director Albert Magnoli, producer Robert Cavallo and director of photography Donald Thorin; Theatrical trailer; Trailers for "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" 2) A 12-minute featurette on the First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass (a half-hour featurette that I will review later on his page);" Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: The Impact and Influence of Purple Rain ", a 30-minute featurette, 30 minutes from the premiere of MTV Images (when MTV did not suck the donkey balls), 5 music videos from Prince (Let's Go Crazy, take me with you, when the doves will cry, I'll die 4 U / baby I'm a star and Purple Rain) 2 videos by The Time (Jungle Love and The Bird) and a video clip of "Sex Shooter "by Apollonia 6 <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Apollonia shows her beautiful breasts
