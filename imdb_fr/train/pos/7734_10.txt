I saw this film a few years ago and I must say that I really like it. Jason Patric was perfect for that strange role he played. Director? I do not do too much about him ... and I do not do it. The scenario is good, that's for sure. In a few words, I must say about this strange, strange, even black film, but it's good. I saw him a few years ago and I've never seen him since.I want to see him again and again.I know I'm not going to get tired of watching him.The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, history ... all is well. The film should have lasted longer I think 120 minutes should have been perfect. I was hoping for a second part for this film. Too bad it did not happen. Jason Patric : you are the man! Very good movie. the end. :-)
