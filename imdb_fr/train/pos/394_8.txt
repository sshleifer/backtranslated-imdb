It's an incredible return of the director's mind, Tsui Hark. This is one of the few movies that deserves a face-to-face with Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer. From the moment the film started, there were breathtaking sets on each side that were moved with superb style. If you're a science fiction or Chinese martial arts geek, you'll love the sheer amount of 3D effects and realistic computer-generated weapons. Here is a great performance (as always) of Ekin Cheung who plays "Sky King". He teamed up with Louis Koo (Red) who was very impressed by his flexible "wing" that deflects incoming attacks. The combat movements of these actors were competent in every respect. Not only is the action superb, but the scenario is complex. Many critics of this movie complain about the lack of story / theme or simply "shoving at random" and even describing "The Legend of Poo". However, the viewer can not watch Dragon Ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie. Others who are familiar with the movies "Wu Xia" will have a better approach. With respect. there may be a weakness that could be foreseen. The blow to the enemy during the last combat scene may have been inflicted in a more serious and devastating manner. Nevertheless, this is an event not to be missed.
