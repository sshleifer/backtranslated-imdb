Old horror movies are interesting, lots of screams, screams and humor. "The Blob" is a classic in his own work. Steve McQueen (1930-1980) plays a teenager trying to become a hero in his city. To go out with her daughter is rather typical of all teenagers. But when the old man discovers the same object falling from the sky, he ends up being the victim and Steve helps him as best he can. When it's teenage, this movie really provides it. I know that most teens have had difficulties when they have been alive, when the danger has occurred, they must learn to forget the past and do something good to save humanity. When adults in the city learn at their own expense that "The Blob" has gone crazy, they must learn to trust teens and not let their behavior take over. The oozing heavy weight was pretty cute in the day, and in my opinion I think it was JELL-O! When everyone mobilizes to end the threat, the city is safe again thanks to good old cooperation. I always eat Jello and watch this movie all the time, if you do not like Jello, TOUGH! Rating 5 stars
