Even if there are no new episodes, and it is rarely shown. I loved the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I have never seen the last episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles or Josh? And why did the aunts have to disappear from the show? I'm sure the end was going to be perfect. But there are many unanswered questions. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard that she decides between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I really hope she chooses Harvey! And can I say that Nate Richart is HOTT !! Too bad it's too old for me though. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of the kindness she adds to the series, but there are a lot of "stupid" little things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and that all the actors are listening. stupid. Also, the cat was starting to get really lame, as the show went on, the jokes were just starting to get stupid, and the things the audio-controlled "audience" was laughing about, I would think it was so lame. Do not get me wrong, in some places it was funny, but I think the show simply lost its "magic" so to speak as the show continued. However, I congratulate all the actors for having tried, although this Moon Frye girl has no taste and she is a horrible actress. I wonder what Melissa or the other actors are doing now, now that the show is over.
