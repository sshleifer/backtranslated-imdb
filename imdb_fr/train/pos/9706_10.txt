The League of Gentlemen is one of the funniest, strangest, darkest and most memorable comedies of our time. So much that it has paved the way for more comedies of its kind, many of which have copied style but have never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Unlike all the other skits presented, the characters of The League of Gentlemen are all vaguely connected. First, they all live in the fictional town of Royston Vasey, in the north of England. <br /> <br /> The first characters to greet the newcomers are Tubbs and Edwrad, the pig-mouthed owners of a supposed local store so far away that most residents probably do not know about it. Other quirks include: the Denton family, obsessed with hygiene, chastity and toads; Hillary Briss who sells a special but fortunately unknown brand of meat; Pauline, a recovery agent with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens; Mr. Chinnery, a good-natured veterinarian, and a threat to all things on all fours; Geoff Tipps, a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humor, often involving guns, electric tubes and. . . . . . . PLUM !!!!! <br /> <br /> Although it's a comedy in the soul, the League of Gentlemen often transcends genres while never appearing as a parody or a scam of the material of others. There are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker, a pair of silent twins, an obsessive circus owner and a sudden surge of nosebleeds. More striking are the moments when the series takes a more sober tone and where characters such as Pauline and Geoff are presented in a more sympathetic and vulnerable light. Film adaptation is the best demonstration, but some fans may decide to belong to the local community. <br /> <br /> The third series, equally underestimated, also borrows a different path, instead of sketch, each episode focuses on a scenario character leading to a conclusion involving a plastic bag and a van of fugue theater company. Although many fans may not benefit as much from the structure of the film or the third series as the first two films, they show how the League of Gentlemen can be inventive and not be afraid to explore new areas . <br /> In short, the League of Gentlemen is definitely worth seeing, as the welcome message says: you'll never leave!
