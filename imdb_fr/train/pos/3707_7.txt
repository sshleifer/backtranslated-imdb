I found myself at six and seven looking at this one. Altman's manipulation with the front and back zooms was there, and I expected these devices to comment on the characters and situations. Unfortunately, as far as I know, they were sometimes free, sometimes spiritual, often sterile for not reporting any ironic or otherwise. In particular, two zooms back from the golden dome of the savannah were simply perplexed. To be fair, however, a few zooms on Branagh accentuated the growing amazement of his character, the Pudgy McCabe or that of Philip Marlow. Overall, the zooms were very inconsistent and sometimes even banal. <br /> <br /> Other almanesque devices, such as several panels of glass between the camera and the subject, have succeeded in suggesting the solipsism or narcissism or opacity of the characters. states of knowledge. Car windshields, house windows and other screens have been used effectively and relatively consistently, reminding me of the player THE PLAYER and even THE LONG GOODBYE. Some catchy jumps, especially to a suggestive TV commercial, reminded me of such use in SHORT CUTS, with sardonic effects. <br /> <br /> But finally, the gap between Altman's very personal style and Grisham's momentum weight did not get me excited. The masterpieces of this 1970s director reviewed and deconstructed various classic genres, including the Chandler detective film, to which it resembled in some respects; this time, the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytical quiver to bring a significant blow to the soft belly of this bestial genre. Was he muzzled by Mammonist producers, perhaps? Or am I missing something, because of my poor knowledge of the genre he is dealing with here? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the cast was excellent in all areas: Tom Berenger (for its terrifying ferocity), Branagh for his) the hybris, the pheromonal fog of Robert Downey Jr, the method of junk Robert Duvall and Davidtz's threatening femme fatale were almost all perfect choices. And aside from a few slips from Georgia to Chicago on the part of (the brunette?) Daryl Hannah, the accents were clearly from the south. <br /> <br /> The suspense and atmosphere were captivating, although the story was not so dark. the viewers. The coastal barometric swings before the hurricane were extraordinary and made sumptuous - I wanted to scream at the usher to turn on the pronto swamp cooler. <br /> <br /> Ripped up, I finally judged 7. <br /> <br />
