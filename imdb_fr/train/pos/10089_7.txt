. . . or typing on a computer keyboard, they would probably give this eponymous movie a score of "10". After all, no elephant is shown being killed during the movie; it does not even imply that someone is hurt. On the contrary, ELEPHANT WALK's master, John Wiley (Peter Finch), complains that he can not shoot any of the pachyderms - no matter how threatening - without the government's permission (and his tone suggests that such permits do not are not the domain of probability). In addition, the elements conspire - in the form of an unusual drought and an epidemic of human cholera - to leave the Wiley plantation home due to the total destruction by the elephant people (as natives call them). to close the story. If you see the current version of EARTH, you will find that the Elephant People are doing worse today.
