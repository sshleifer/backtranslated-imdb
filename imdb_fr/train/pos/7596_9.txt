The first episode immediately gave a good impression of what to expect from the series! Mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! I like the fact that they gradually reveal the stories about the characters! Explain just enough to stay excited! Of course, this show has some flaws! In the first two series, there are characters who, for some reason, do not show up in the third season! Many characters have a revocation letter but some of them are just not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they'll come back in the next episodes! But it's a bit incoherent! That being said "Lost" manages to be thrilling at every episode (especially the first two seasons)! It's a very difficult thing to do! I notice that in the third season, the accent is more on the development of the character than on the mysterious aspects of the series! This is not a bad thing! This even prevents some episodes from getting boring! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters! You will love these characters! Good or bad! But finally, I want to see some mysteries to solve and to close! The danger of cancellation of "Lost" due to the drop in ratings is near! And it would be devastating!
