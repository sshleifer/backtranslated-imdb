On the occasion of Earth Day, Disney released the movie "Earth". Stopping far from any strident message of gloom, we receive excellent images of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about us. <br /> <br /> The stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf. The story begins at the North Pole and continues south to the tropics, while being presented to the inhabitants of different climatic zones crossed. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned in the evolutions of the polar zones. bear; there has been a decline in sea ice islands in recent years. We never see the bears catching seals, but the father's desperate search for food brings him to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> Aerial shots of caribou migrating into the tundra are one of the most spectacular ever seen on wildlife. seen; It is with another representative of the migratory migratory birds that it is enough to reward the price of admission to be able to see them on big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments I felt was seeing great shots of great white sharks capturing seals. slow motion. You never get the feeling of a characteristic of wild animals; their incredible speed. I think that the idea of ​​slowing down the film to give a great speed started (or at least it's the first time I remember seeing) the TV show "Kung Fu" in the early 70s. /> <br /> An interesting light is that, at the end of the credits, some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques used are revealed. There are enough dramatic, humorous and instructive moments in this film to make it a solid choice for nature lovers. Perhaps because of some selective fixtures (sparing us, so to speak, the appalling end of a predator-prey moment) and the fact that these images were released in 2007 and are available on DVD, this is a solid film in its own right. And you can take your children! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
