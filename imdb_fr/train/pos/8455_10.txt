While being a young impressionable during the first experience of the Gundam Wing series, after reviewing the series, I reaffirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but that the plot, the design of the Gundam, the design and depth of characters are masterfully achieved. While originally appearing as a group of boys, the elegant appeal of the characters can partly be attributed to an exceptional art, the personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions between the characters. As a result, it is extremely easy to become attracted to a particular character. Personally, I loved Heero because of his stoic personality. Although I may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper issues of war and life in general (how can we get peace?) While providing action packed fights in great robot costumes, which, to say the least, is excellent.
