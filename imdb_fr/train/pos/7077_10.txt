One of the greatest science fiction works, as visionary and stimulating as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's Brazilian. Willis makes his best performance here, but he's surpassed by Pitt's incredibly frenzied turn that is unlike anything he's done before or since. Even Stowe is not out of his league here, though. The story is very complex and offers a lot of thought. The culinary scene is beautifully beautiful and the latest lines fit perfectly. The scenes at the psychiatric hospital are frightening and yet so amusing in their own way. A lot of black humor on display here. Fantastic production design and appropriately bizarre cinematography. In my top ten.
