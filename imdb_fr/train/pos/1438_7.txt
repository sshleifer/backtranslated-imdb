Full note for Pacino's speech on the coffin of the dead child; Mark Antony of Shakespeare would be shameful !! <br /> <br /> Was it Paul Schrader or Ken Lipper who should be complimented for his remarkable dialogues? They are rich and smart and are well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts. I found the narrative story to grow pretty well until postscript. <br /> <br /> There is little else to talk about in this movie; Even John Cusack played better than this one. Interestingly, the film is very masculine. Women are only appendages.
