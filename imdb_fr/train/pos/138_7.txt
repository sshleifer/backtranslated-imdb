I do not understand why other reviews focus on McConaughey. He has never been a very interesting movie actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is writing and the mind. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw form an unusual comic duo without any type of action. Although we can not say that their characters are well developed, it does not make them any less fun. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was on HDNET and included subtitles for the dialogue in Spanish. problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underestimated film, judging by the unusually low score that IMDb members attributed to him. I thought it was fun and interesting and was worth at least 7. A lot of smooth movies with higher scores and big box office winnings are a lot less interesting.
