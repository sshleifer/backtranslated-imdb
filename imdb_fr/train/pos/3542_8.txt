If I had already known the theatrical production of Guys and Dolls before seeing the film, I might not like it as much as I liked it. Although, in all fairness, I would probably prefer that the production of the film be better because of my general adoration of Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, although it is also quite actor, see The Candidate Manchurian or From Here to Eternity.) <br /> <br /> As for other song critics' statements, I have the Broadway soundtrack and although Isabel's voice Bingley surpasses that of Jean Simmons, she is not more pleasant. I think it's a pretty high quality. The voice of Jean Simmons is much more realistic, although it is true that it is not always a big problem in musicals. Also, the only time I particularly noticed Marlon Brando's particularly weak vocal range was when performing "Luck Be A Lady", and that only because I knew Sinatra's version before. I also find that Vivian Blaine's voice is much more pleasant in the film than in Broadway. And Sinatra's voice alone could redeem the failings of all others, if they really needed redemption. (They were not) It's infinitely better than Sam Levene's, especially in my favorite song, "Sue Me". <br /> <br /> In addition, the grievance that many songs have been omitted from the film for the songs of inferior quality, I beg to differ. 'A Boel and a Peck' is hardly a jewel and the song that replaced it, 'Pet Me Poppa', and its accompanying performance are more Hot Box material. all "Marry the Man Today" and rejoice I love 'I've never been in love before', and although it's not sung in the film, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in the locker room Adelaide: The song 'A Woman In Love' expresses the same feeling as well and probably in a beach that the two stars could reach more cleverly, and the film would not be the same without the song 'Adelaide', not included on Broadway. if the soundtrack of the film was available for sale, I advise you to buy it instead of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen the original production, I can not not to imagine that the actors' play is superior to that of the film actors. <br /> <br /> The important thing is that the h Istory is as charming as ever and the acting of the actors and his son do not make him less.
