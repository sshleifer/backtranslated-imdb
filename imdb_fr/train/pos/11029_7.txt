I'm far from being a fan of Sylvester Stallone and I guess the only time I really enjoyed his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is a small role almost nonexistent. And yet, I must admit that this movie was actually not so bad, even though I feared the worst. <br /> <br /> When Gabe (Stallone) fails to save the girlfriend of one of her friends and she plunges into death. At a height of 4,000 feet, he can not force himself to continue working as a ranger. For almost a year, he does not put food on the reserve, but he comes back. Shortly after his return, they receive an emergency call from a group of hikers trapped in a snowstorm. At least that's what the rangers believe. In reality, it is a group of thieves who crashed with their plane into the mountains after the failure of their bold project of stealing crates filled with money in a government plane in flight. The cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to recover them ... <br /> <br /> This is of course not one of the smartest movies of all the times, but in its kind, it's a pleasure one. I particularly appreciated John Lithgow as a nasty master and leader of the gang of thieves. I know him better in the television series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I also enjoyed his performance in this film. Overall, the acting is OK, there was a lot of action to offer and of course, some one-liners, but it also offered a very beautiful scenery. This film was shot in a beautiful natural environment. I loved the mountains and the snowy valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests ... Maybe that's why I'm giving this movie a higher score than the one I usually give to a movie. action / adventure of this kind. I give it a 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect too much, it's a nice movie.
