True wacky comedy from the mid-70s, this film was a huge success for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I am constantly amazed by some comic movies that come out in droves a week before disappearing: HIGH ANXIETY, THE GOOD DETECTIVE, THE BLACK BIRD, DO NOT LOOK NOW, WE HAVE BEEN FROM ......... .and n I have no profile at all today. NORMAN was the comedy of the month of 1976 and everyone seemed to see it, laugh and never talk about it again. Famous for being filmed and transferred to the movies, an experience at the time, NORMAN is a far-fetched and politically incorrect joke that the Farrelly Brothers should consider redoing today. If they did so in the first place, there would be no complaint about its content or bias. It's very funny and YES, very rude and hilarious. Just as it should be. In fact, as a groovy 1976 film with all these colors and horror clothes, it works better nowadays.
