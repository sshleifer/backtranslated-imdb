I just came back from Hong Kong during my summer vacation and saw the legend of ZU. I thought it kicked! It was so creative and unique. It's the Hidden Dragon Tiger Squatting with much less drama. Even if some thought there were too many special FX (yeah that's it!), You can not complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so good !!! The legend of ZU ..... kicks a * s !!!!!!!!
