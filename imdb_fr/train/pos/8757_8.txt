I like movies that do not offer the typical "happy ending", and that's the main reason why I like this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend, Darlene (Beckinsale), are arrested in Thailand for drug trafficking after receiving an anonymous tip from the Thai authorities. The film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing if (or what) girls are involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their shady lawyer. Jacqueline Kim performs an extraordinary performance as a kinder and magnanimous woman, Yon, who is also a lawyer. I would have liked the girls to have been more mistreated in the prison, as another speaker suggested, because I have heard that Thai jails can be quite brutal. Where this film takes me, however, is its end. Alice submits to a 96-year sentence in total so that Darlene can be pardoned, and we (the viewers) realize that they are both innocent. Any movie that defies my expectation of the end earns extra points with me, and this well-played drama certainly deserves.
