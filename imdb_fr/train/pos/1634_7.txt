I started watching the movie on its first HBO (probably) release in 1981 and being 15 years old, I thought the movie was hilarious. I remember not seeing Alfred E. Neuman's performances in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satirized the movie and abruptly stopped half-way with the "usual gang" apology for sitting down to satirize such shit, I just assumed they were making fun of themselves, which, I'm sure, was, but to find them seriously (and Ron Liebman) so embarrassed to remove their name from any credits, I was quite surprised. There are surely a lot of worst movies to associate. Looking at the video now (at age 32) with restored MAD references, I'm still fed up. And being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think that's his performance gem (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
