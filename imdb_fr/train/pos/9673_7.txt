Paulie sounds like the sweetest, ludicrous and sentimental trash you can find, yet she's way better than you'd expect. The stupidity of the plot could have so easily set the tone for the whole movie, but in most other departments, the movie is charming. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Purchased for a little girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on his shoulder during speech therapy classes and becomes himself a hyper intelligent speaker. However, the girl's mother sent Paulie away and he spends the rest of the movie trying to get from New York to Los Angeles to be reunited with her. <br /> <br /> movie succeed relatively well? First, it has interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Second (and much more significantly), he has the courage to adhere to his ridiculous hypothesis and tells a truly moving story, often humorous, without much worrying about the obvious flaws of the plot. Thirdly, he has several surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a cunning swindler, Gena Rowlands as a kind old lady and Cheech Marin (yes, Cheech Marin!) As a musical immigrant. It may not be a classic, but Paulie is a sound entertainment for kids of all ages.
