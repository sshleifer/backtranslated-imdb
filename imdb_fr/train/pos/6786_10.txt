Ronald Colman electrically sings Tony John, a Broadway actor who can not separate his life from Othello's scenes of Shakespeare, the character he plays on stage. Two important scenes illustrate Tony's dilemma. The first takes place in the office of producer Max Lasker. Playing is a matter of talent for Lasker, a man of practical skill. But Donlan, Tony's friend, does not share this view. "No, no, when you do it like Tony does, it's a lot more, the way he was made to become someone else every night ... so completely." No, do not tell me not his, the whole system is not affected. "... The other scene is in waitress Pat Kroll's apartment. Tony tells him his name is Martin. She thanks him. Then he said, "Or Paul, Hamlet, Joe, and maybe Othello." ... When Tony begins to repeat Othello, we learn that while he's trying to keep his real life separate from his life on stage, "the game begins to seep into your life, and the battle begins. the imagination ". He can not separate the two: in his mind, Pat is Desdemona and Othello, and he mistakenly believes that she has unfaithful. He kills her ... Colman's bravura performance, in a complex and difficult role, earned her the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1947. Oscar nominations were awarded to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for best original scenario. Do not forget Milton Krasner's cinematography in the atmosphere.
