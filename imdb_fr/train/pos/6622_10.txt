I just attended the screening of the film at Expresion in Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was present and gave a brief introduction. The film rolled and, at first, I was amazed: a long continuous shot of a futuristic Paris in black and white glorious. <br /> <br /> I should not go on with the details because I think it's a movie to watch. The science fiction story could be found average for many ... for me was really good. The action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere and I mean everywhere. The things you could not do or see are done wonderfully. The performance of the distribution is good, in my opinion, no one is wrong. <br /> <br /> The thing that I found great is the animation. 3D graphics have a 2D appearance. A BW cartoon came to life. The details on the backgrounds give more texture than if it had been done by hand (I'm sure it was, but when the angles change, you see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director, she said, is brilliant, but perhaps he was quite inexperienced since he had only a short film in his CV. So, many people had true faith in them. They created their own studio from scratch and since then they have faced the challenge they have thrown at them. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. I think you will not regret it ... maybe Richard Linklater is superior to his, in my opinion.
