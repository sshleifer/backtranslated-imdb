Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who spends his time finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters her life, she tells him that he is the chosen one and that he must find the golden child. Skeptical and motivated solely by desire and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realizing that he is about to embark on a fantastic journey, that of the demon Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> Is The Golden Child a product of its time ?, by which I mean, the popularity of Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child was it exclusive to the public of the late 1980s ?. Because I remember how much this film was entertaining people during this decade, its box office was $ 79,817,937, making it the eighth largest livelihood of 1986, but since 80s, it became the perfect thing to deny Eddie Murphy comedy braces that they actually had once. The Golden Child is not above the more accepted 80s images of Murphy, such as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but during the recent screening of the film, I personally discovered that it holds Murphy in his best film that seduces, seduces and seduces !, Seriously !. <BR/> <br /> Taking advantage of a fantastic action formula invigorated and tempered by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child pushes all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, bold and reluctant hero with a brooch in his armory, dashing naughty {Charles Dance so English that I could kiss him myself}, gorgeous color and a cute kid with mystic powers, the movie only asks you to involve yourself in pleasure, do not dissect and digest its value as a cranial fantasy image. Yes, the CGI demon looks crisp now, and yes, the genre had much better images in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the outrageous rating of 5 here on this site, so maybe you take it a little bit as seriously, seriously. 7/10
