This movie was beautiful. It was full of memorable pictures, good acting and touching subjects. It would be very easy to say that it's too sentimental, but it's the feeling that this type of movie is trying to achieve. I was totally involved in the unfolding and presentation of the story. There were some cheese shots, but that's to be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can make is that there was not a ton of detail. However, this film was not created to explain every element of life, ministry, triumphs, controversies, failures, etc. Joseph Smith; It was designed to take a quick look at some of the highlights of one of the most amazing American religious and historical figures of all time.
