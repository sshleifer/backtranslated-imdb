Every time this film is broadcast on the BBC, someone in the Radio Times newspaper says it's a satire against the world of post-war rationing and the welfare system. I do not think that's the purpose of the film. The film parodies the spirits (petty criminals who ran the black market) and the league of housewives who campaigned against the restrictions of the government but who were actually an avant-garde organization. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, the film sends the political / social message But finally, people realize that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society, they want to be British and to fend rather than to be strangers. <br /> <br /> But I do not think they come back to being exactly like they were before.
