I was going to give him an 8, but since you got 6.5 on much better votes, I had to increase my contribution. The Styx River was pure genius. Of course, Woody was his perennial substance, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really hilarious, and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialogue was smart enough, and Woody's card tricks at parties, as well as the throat reaction, were fun to watch. It was much better than the newspaper critics suggested. And a plus, a little Sorcerer's Apprentice to accompany him. And of course, did you notice that Johansen gets a little wrinkled? Charles Dance is always fun, as is Hugh Jackman.
