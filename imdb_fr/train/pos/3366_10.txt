Ettore Scola, one of the finest and greatest filmmakers we have, is not yet available on DVD ... (it's summer 2001 at the moment ...) Mysteries to hide the 'mind. <br /> <br /> This great classic has returned to the theaters of my hometown through a summer retrospective of Sophia Loren, and seeing it on the big screen after all these years of seeing it in video-tape ... it's a real gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid criticism while still trying to prove something, I took my unwilling younger brother with me to see this movie. He had never seen the film before and "does not like those old Italians ..." Like all other actors in the theater, he was intrigued by this wonder. Even during the last titles, the theater remained completely silent. <br /> <br /> This special day is really special. A wonder of refinement. And a big loss if you have not seen it yet ...
