After seeing "Break a Leg" in Vancouver on the night out, I thought it was a very enjoyable movie. yell. I did not hear about the actual release date, although I heard it was close. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but is primarily a vehicle for characters and situations. The scenario is fluid and homogeneous, the plot develops without effort and the acting is comfortable and cool. This film has won at least one award from EVERY of the film festivals in which it was filmed, which is between 10 and 15 approximately. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend "Break a Leg".
