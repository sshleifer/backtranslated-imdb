I stopped giving "Mr. Blandings builds his dream house" 10/10 because of an aspect that makes us a bit naughty in the twenty-first century: the fact that a black is the faithful servant (a bit like Stepin Fetchit). But other than that, the movie is funny. Representing New York middle-class couples Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) trying to build a home in Connecticut, this film has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant does very well as a simple woman. But Melvyn Douglas adds real laughter like Bill Cole, the lawyer of Jim and Muriel, who seems to have more projects than he says clearly. As for the house itself, you will probably feel ambiguous whether you want to live there or not. Builders, contractors and others are also providing their fair share of laughter. <br /> <br /> In total, a classic comedy. With Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
