Another exquisite taste of what should be a superhero movie after Batman: Dead End, which just helps to stimulate our taste buds and let us desire more! That's what a real superhero movie should look like! Even if it's a kind of fanfilm. Attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. Although the production of resources is limited, it shames big budget productions, stars and fashion, "other" movies about superheroes. Here, the main characters and the secondary characters play the role of characters of real life. Finally, a Superman who really looks "super" and looks like the real thing! Batman as it should be, without the molded and torn rubber body armor to hide a lean physique to overpaid actors who do not deliver. I just wish some sensitive leaders of Warner Bros. give the agreement to produce a complete adaptation of this jewel. I do not care if it goes to the movies or directly to the DVD, I'll never get tired of watching it. The plot itself is worth the effort. I hope that the bigwigs of Marvel & DC productions will take a look and see what a true superhero movie should look like. No more fiasco "Batman & Robin", or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these modest filmmakers and learn that there should be no reason to "reinvent" the film's hero, just to "bombard" theaters. Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you !!
