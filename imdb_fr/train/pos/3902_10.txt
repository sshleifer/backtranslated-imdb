I had heard about Eddie Izzard, but I had never seen him in action. I knew he was a transvestite and when I saw he was on HBO one night last summer, I put it on, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, he blew us away. He's better than Robin Williams. He has total control of the public. when he does "the Englebert is dead - no he is not", the routine, the public does not know what to think in the end. God as James Mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of the Spanish Inquisition Python as it was performed by the Church of England - "Cake or Death? has no price. My jaw hurt at the end of the show. We went through the TV channels for months to see him again, and we had the chance to record him on his next visit. If you have the chance to see this show, cancel everything and save it, you will not be disappointed.
