I was eager to see this since I first saw it in his work. I finally found it yesterday on 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments on the fact that it's a "funny and funny story of two people crossing each other" were not followed up. Writers probably should not get bonuses, all the other members of the SRO who directed the film. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic film SHOULD SEE IT. <br /> <br /> Natasha's on-screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric, to say nothing of her beauty, that everything that keeps her in my list of favorites. His televised and written interviews I have seen are just as refreshing and worth the search. <br /> <br /> God bless her and her family and future plans. <br /> <br /> This movie did not seem to be available on DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would be too.
