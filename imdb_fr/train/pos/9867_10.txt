I saw Ice Age for the first time in Subiaco cinemas when it was released in 2002. I was only 13 at the time, but even then, I liked it. There was a kind of heat. <br /> <br /> We have been watching video for many years and no matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. This is due to the only element that makes it different from all other 3D animations made at the time: the characters have no particular "homeland". They are nomads, and it's really refreshing and stimulating to watch. <br /> <br /> In addition, each character on the surface seems to support himself, but they are all good friends. In addition, all characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). Sid the lazy is charming in his annoying manner, too affectionate and naive. Manny is adorable in his depressive, lonely character, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Another interesting point of the film is the beauty of the animation. All environments and characters were originally modeled by clay, which gives the film an artistic advantage. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the atmosphere of the film is that the genre means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you do not realize it until you have watched the movie several times. Even then, it has little effect on the way you watch the movie. For this reason, there is also no question of a nuclear family that would be truly pathetic in a context like the ice age. <br /> <br /> Overall, The Ice Age is a fantastic movie that proves how much effort has been put into 3D animations before the release of Shrek 2 and The Incredibles.
