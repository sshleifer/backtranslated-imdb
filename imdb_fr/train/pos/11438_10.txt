Ralph and Mumford, unsuitable in their own country, are made like involuntary pawns of Synanomess Botch. Twice Upon a Time tells their story, the characters they meet and their struggle to fix things. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and a wonderful voice performed by some of the best in the industry, this quirky movie strikes. <br /> <br /> The animation process resembles that of the "South Park" style. , is much smoother and much more three-dimensional. If I did not know that the animation matched that style, I'd swear it's traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, PLEASE DO! If nothing escapes you, nothing will escape you, but if you do, you will get much more experience!
