As it was only a toddler during the broadcast of this show, I recently chose the DVD and I hope that other episodes will be filmed. This show was a version 70 of the popular TV series of the 90s "X-Files" - but with a slightly more comical / light approach. But make no mistake, some of these episodes are full of horror themes, and many of them have quite impressive intrigues (left to the imagination of course - it was TV in the early '70s). <br /> <br /> Some of the intrigues were a little ridiculous, just like the acting, but that's the charm and attraction of this series. Whether you like mystery crime dramas, comedies or sci-fi / horror themes, this series brings it all together. Each episode was about 50 minutes long (about 1 hour with commercials) and these 50 minutes went by quickly, leaving me wanting more. A great classic show that is underrated in my book!
