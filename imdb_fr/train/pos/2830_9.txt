The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason to see this film. Why she never became a bigger store may never be known. But she is exceptional and steals every scene she is in. Garson Kanin has made this piece of duvet and the cast is first-rate, with Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro particularly memorable. A "9" on "10."
