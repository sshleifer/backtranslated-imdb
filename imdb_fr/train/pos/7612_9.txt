OK, I will be honest. When I saw the program trailer, I thought it was an advertisement for a sunscreen product. With all the people who walk on the beach. Even so, I decided to watch it, thinking it would be a new series that I could laugh at. But I was seriously surprised. <br /> <br /> From the first 10 seconds of the program, I became hooked, why is he lying in the trees, why did the plane crash, etc., etc.? <br /> <br /> It's not every day that a show happens, mixing intelligence, humor, action and suspense. But 'Lost' manages all this. With great distribution, beautiful locations and pretty decent special effects, "Lost" will surprise anyone who listens, and is a must for those who are fed up with nerdy sitcoms and crappy reality TV. <br /> <br /> Lost is Tuesday at 10 am on Channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
