Ella was excellent, Franchot was inevitably excessive (but he played similar roles in other films such as "The Man of the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost nonexistent, but the film was certainly "delighted". <Br /> <br /> * light spoiler to come *: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook was strangled in his films, but I seem to remember several other examples. I will avoid naming the murderer but I think it's obviously obvious because of the "thriller" plot required. <br /> <br /> A very well done but dated black film (for example: everyone was smoking like crazy and the police were really characters in stock) No corpse was ever shown, unlike the gore fests of today) made in the format of well-known brief scene paintings from this period. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10.
