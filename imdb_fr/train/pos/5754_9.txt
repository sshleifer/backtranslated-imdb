I remember seeing this one when I was seven or eight years old. I had to find the characters round because they left in my mind an impression that lasted long after the end of the film. And the end is sad, well ... for a child from 7 to 8 years old. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to review this movie recently and found the plot was too simple. character, in two dimensions ... I guess this is the kind of movie you can only innocence of a young child ... Too bad ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this one to all your parents with little children ... (I saw it in its original French version, so I can not tell you if the translation is good or not.)
