Even though I enjoyed Hanzo the Razor's films, three are more than enough: "Who's got the ornament?", The final adventure of the Japanese jurist with his impressive package, is a pretty nice piece of Pinku cinema, but offers little in terms of ideas, while taking a big step backwards in regards to the scandal. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the appearance of a female ghost and gives the impression that it will explore a supernatural territory, could have taken the series in an interesting new direction; unfortunately, after the ghost only became a Scooby Doo-style ruse (prepared by a corrupt treasury official anxious to drive people away from the lake where he steals stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue is content to recycle familiar elements from the first two films, the result is a bit bland. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hanzo leads an investigation that requires her to interrogate women through her powerful penis, slice her enemies and commit abuses. his superiors. On the way, we have crazy orgies, rapes of good nature (Hanzo imposes on women who end up appreciating his obstinacy) and bloody fighting with the sword. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen and enjoyed the first two movies, you may as well watch this part to complete the decor, but be aware that this is probably the least satisfying of all. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, rounded to 7 for IMDb.
