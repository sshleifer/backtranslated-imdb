Our song is a wonderful example of exciting and aesthetic filmmaking. It's actually a marvel of a movie; a penetrating and insightful work of art that recounts the lives of three downtown girls (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) on a particular summer of their lives, when the difficulties of their adulthood push them to they make it difficult to change the choices that will probably redefine each of them, as well as how they will continue to bond with each other in the years to come. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay's writing / direction is graceful and simple. There is no free sentimentality or sappy, or clich√© solutions in this film. What we see here seems, at times, to be a real heart. There is a naturalism - a credibility, if you will - in Our Song that outperforms other giants like American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> The merit of the film's spirit lies largely in its main actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is dazzling. It would be easy - and, of course, obviously obtuse - to reject, as some apparently do, the performances of these three people as apathetic or non-emotional. In fact, their discreet charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence throughout the film are absolutely fascinating. One should be completely "disconnected" or totally indifferent to the behavior of adolescents to miss the resounding authenticity of what these three girls bring to the screen. Similarly, the actors, especially Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, compliment the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our Song is a film not to be missed - by anyone of any age.
