Add Paulie the parrot to the adored characters of the filmed animals. This film is a love story - Bird and Gena Rowlands, Bird and Marie, Michael and Marie Beloved. A Russian janitor helps a talking parrot and thinks of finding his rightful owner many years after Mary's parents sold him to a pawnbroker. Before the end of the warming of the heart, we learn all the misadventures of Paulie. Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are wonderful. Beautiful photography everywhere. Super little film, word of mouth will make a cult favorite.
