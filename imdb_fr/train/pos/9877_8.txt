<br /> <br /> Presenting Lily Mars is part of a genre of film that unfortunately seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Ok, now that you know my bias, here are some reasons that make this movie stand out. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin) is a pretty Hollywood story of the period, the writers vary the theme a bit more than usual. Although Lily gets her big hit when the star leaves the club, she has no success and has to swallow her pride to take a minor role in the series. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (enough said!) <br /> <br /> 3. The support cast includes very good performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is really wonderful, as is Fay Bainter (the director's mother - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). The exceptional support performance goes well to character actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, an actress at a time become a repository of theater. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing. One of those movies designed to make you feel better in the world and your dreams.
