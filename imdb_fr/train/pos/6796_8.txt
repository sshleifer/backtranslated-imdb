Zodiac Killer (2005) is an interesting film by German director Ulli Lommel. He directs, produces and co-stars in this latest production. Not only did he manage to make an interesting movie cheaply. But it reaches a new low when Herr Lommel is working on footage from almost all of his film catalog. I've seen footage of Boogeyman I and II, Warbirds, Wolf Tenderness, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes an appearance from beyond the grave with this film). Even if he uses a lot of old movies, he uses them well (and with a lot of creativity, can I add). <br /> <br /> The film follows a young man who copies the original zodiac killer. it also corresponds with a writer (Ulli Lommel) who had written about the serial killer in the late sixties and early seventies. The writer's friend (David Hess) helps him try to find this budding zodiac. Can this killer be stopped? Will the writer put two and two together to recover some of his former glory? Is David Hess still the man? You will have to discover it yourself and watch the zodiac killer. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT about the original zodiac killer. I also heard people complaining about the filming of this film. So what. The artistic style of the director's old school surpasses the fact that it is shot in video. My only complaint is the excessive use of archive footage from Herr Lommel's previous films (but I understand why "wink" "wink".) Do not believe the hype. It's a horror film at the street level. As the warning says at the beginning, this movie does not glorify murder. You must love this statement. <br /> <br //> Highly recommended for Ulli Lommel fans.
