I had never heard of this film despite the connection with George Clooney (whose company produced and it appears in a very entertaining accompanying film) and with the director of his 11, Ocean's, Steven Soderbergh. Even worse, we found this in a discount basket for $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars)! What a great and pleasant surprise. But then, I feel that if William H. Macy is in the game, you can not be disappointed. It was a reminder of Ealing's English comedies in the 1950s. OK, with more blasphemy. It's a strange and sometimes funny film. The burglary made me laugh so much that I cried. Perhaps the most funny use of underwear in the film's history. It may have been the low expectations I had, but I watched with a group of people and had a blast. Best $ 5 I spent in the ages.
