This film tells the life and times of William Castle. He made a series of low-budget horror movies in the 1950s-1960s that he sold with gadgets. In "13 Ghosts", you need viewers to see the ghosts (they were in color, the film in black and white). "The Tingler" had theater seats equipped with a ringing tone that moved the audience when a monster escaped into a movie theater. "Marabre" has issued a life insurance policy for all members in case they are scared to die! The movies themselves were pretty bad, but the gadgets made people rush to see them. In this document, you will find interviews of directors inspired by Castle, actors in his films and his daughter. He also enters his personal life and the kind of man he was (by all accounts, he was a great guy). The documentary is affectionate, very funny and absolutely captivating. It is very short (less than 90 minutes) and there is never a moment of boredom. A must for Castle fans and horror movie fans. My only complaint: very few sequences of his photos. That aside it's just great.
