When you compare what Brian De Palma did in the '80s to what is happening today for entertainment, his films continue to do better and better. "Dressed To Kill", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" are all superb works of a cinematographer at the peak of his abilities. The guy had a long series of better than average movies. It's a pure Hitchcock with a hint of evil 80s, a story of lust and murder with lots of twists, a huge touch of style, a stunning score of Pino Donaggio and a rigged plot of giallo inspiration. succulent and blood-stained visuals help to overcome the pitfalls of logic, while the great performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good full-fledged director), Nancy Allen (De Palma's wife at the time) and Michael Caine Let the virtuoso take you on a surreal, scary and erotically charged odyssey and you'll enjoy every image of "Dressed To Kill".
