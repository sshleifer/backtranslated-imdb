This film was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of baseball, but it's a film that was designed to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, and so on. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. are brought with a variety of talented actors and an understanding of the sport. The plot was credible and I love the message. William Dear and the guys put up a good movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports films revolve around real stories or events and often do not work well. But this film reaches a 10 on the scale of perfection, although there have been some small mistakes here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
