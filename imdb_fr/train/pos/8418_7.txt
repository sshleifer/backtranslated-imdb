The Russian emigrant director in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) presents his epic about the Russian revolution and hires an old ex-general of the Tsarist regime (Emil Jannings) to play the role of the general of the film, and the two relive the drama the memory of the woman they shared (Evelyn Brent), 11 years ago. <br /> <br /> In spite of my efforts, I feel uncomfortable to devote myself to "The Last Command" for all its virtues. "The Quays of New York" was undoubtedly a great film and "Underworld" is a film that I always wanted to see, but "The Last Command" is rather heavy. The premise is fascinating, but the treatment really brings the script to life, except in the Hollywood-shots, describing the main thread of usable extras and the machinations of a great film production with cutting-edge technology. <Emil Jannings is, predictably, a wonderful Russian general, wonderfully distinguishing the old former general traumatized and decrepit, pierced by sadness, and the vigorous and generous officer of the past. <br /> <br /> The end is great and worth the wait, but to get there, you have to be ready to get a little bored.
