This is a very good movie "Call Me Anna" because it shows how a person has suffered so much without knowing what was wrong with her. The fact that Patty Duke is known to the public and tells her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease. I have a lot of respect for her as a person. The only thing I do not like is that I can not record it. I tried to search for it but without success. Anyone know how to get it?
