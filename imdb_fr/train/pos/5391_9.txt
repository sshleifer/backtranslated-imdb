Life begins - and ends - in a maternity / recovery room typical of the 1930s, where we see 48 hours in the lives of several high-risk pregnant women, performed by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, and Clara Blandick (Aunty Em ???), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree and Gloria Shea, waiting to give birth. Although the film presents conspiracy scenes that seem self-evident today when the maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted, it gives us a look back at the past to see what the delivery was like in a typical city hospital. 1932 for our grandmothers and grandmothers. grandmothers. I found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving. <br /> <br /> Curiously, the most remarkable performance of this film comes from a cast member, the young Eric Linden, in the role of Jed Sutton, Grace's husband (Loretta Young). What actor! As a father for the first time, Jed is distraught and uncomfortable with hospital staff who seem to erase his worries about his wife, as they could wipe out the crumbs of a cafeteria table. I felt all his worries eagerly. I would like to see more work from this actor. He had a very emotional voice, which was used for an unforgettable effect in Gone With The Wind. In this film, Eric played the young soldier whose leg had been amputated without anesthesia and who was shouting "Do not cut! Do not cut!" as Scarlett fled the hospital with horror. Chilling! Aline MacMahon, who plays Miss Bowers, the nurse, is another great performance. Her character is a salt of the land type, the kind of nurse we all hope to have for our hospital stays, who constantly breaks the rules of the hospital to show a more humane side of the medical profession. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young has also done another great acting job, a very authentic performance and deeply felt by Grace. Ma, she is great in these precodes, I really appreciate more as an actress in recent months. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell played a little too much of her role as an acute single mother. for my taste (no one knew in 1932 that brandishing a bottle of hot water with cognac could be dangerous to the health of the unborn?), but his character redeems himself at the end. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast was a silent movie star, Gilbert Roland, uncredited, in the role of an Italian mourning husband. His on-screen time was short, but remarkable. <br /> <br /> Life Begins is a pre-code not to be missed. Try to catch him for a moment on the TCM, but do not forget to bring some tissues in which to cry. 9 out of 10
