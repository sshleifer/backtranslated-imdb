Normally, the best way to get bored in a movie is to include a reference to Orson Welles. But here's a sci-fi comedy about the War of the Worlds show ... and it's gold! The very concept of a small group of tiny, aggressive and stupid aliens who are mistaken while children in Halloween dress is beautiful is beautiful. Do not be fooled by the idea that because it looks like a children's movie, it's not sophisticated - it's not, there are a lot of hidden gems ... A gem!
