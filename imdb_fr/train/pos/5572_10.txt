This film was hysterical. I have not laughed so hard for a long time. I mean, it's not "Good Will Hunting", but was it supposed to be? In fact, I went to the advanced projection hoping a lot less and was pleasantly surprised. Comedy hits hard and is fairly constant. Amanda Peet is hot and great. All the audience with whom I projected it seemed to enjoy the film as much as me.
