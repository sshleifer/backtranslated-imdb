This is the true story of an Australian couple who is accused of murder when her young child disappears Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages to keep our interest even if she plays a character who is not particularly friendly. <br /> <br /> The media frenzy surrounding this case in Australia is reminiscent of Sam Sheppard. murder cases in Ohio during the 1950s. These real-life situations demonstrate that the media can actually influence the handling of a criminal case. I remember very well that the Cleveland Plain Dealer had a headline saying, "Why is Sam Sheppard not in prison?" The prosecutor finally succumbed to this incessant pressure and Sheppard was tried and convicted. He was exonerated only after years in prison. <br /> <br /> I like movies that tell a true story, do it interestingly and play an important role in the process. This is one of those movies. "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant" are other films that tell the story of innocent people accused of crimes. In particular, the latter is another highly recommended Australian film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
