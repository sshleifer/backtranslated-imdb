I only give him 9 out of 10, because I have to see him again, in a more current state of mind to have a new perspective. What I remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when I watched it. I would watch it every time he came back on HBO in the day (probably around 1990). I might have even recorded it, but that recording has long since disappeared, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to try to get this title in, they do not wear it right now. I hope to find it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend trying it if you find it somewhere. It's interesting at least. If you liked movies such as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or any other kind of strange and such, try this one.
