I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, even though it did not have special effects, the acting was really good. And he still has the same message for today, even if the technology has changed, maybe they should do a remake of this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also enjoyed the music of the movie. Larry Norman was a very good songwriter at the time, although most Christian music is now a song of worship and praise. I was always curious to know what had happened to Patty after the end of the series? Did she continue to make more movies, did she finally get married and raise a family? I would like to have an update.
