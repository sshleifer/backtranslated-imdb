Did you have a bad day? The dog bit the postman? The car would not start? People have pissed you off? Then refresh yourself with a delightful experience. <br /> <br /> Two women decide to pool their resources in response to an announcement for a one-month rental of a villa in Italy. Due to the financial situation, two other women join them. Two have a common married life; one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past; the fourth is a rich and beautiful woman, completely bored by life. <br /> <br /> While the charm of the villa pervades their spirit, each grows in its own way and grows in its perspectives. It also changes the people in their lives who visited them. When they leave, you will know that the magic of the villa will stay with them ... and you will see that your prospects are changed, for the better. A deliciously edifying film!
