A very engaging documentary about the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mainly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements of nature. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., which fly away when the tide goes up on the beach or the wind blows on the field. So, most of Goldsworthy's works do not really last, except in the form of photos or films of what they were. Goldsworthy's works can be said to be a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but is it not easier to say that what he does is simply beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable and living in crumbling urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, self-centered person family, who loves nature and lives in nature. a small village in Scotland (of course, these are the same reasons why it was avoided by some people in the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial).
