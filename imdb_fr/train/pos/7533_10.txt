I liked this series when she was on Kids WB, I did not think there was a spin-off of Batman since the original show ended in 1995 and this show was happening in 1997. First, I loved the idea that Robin lets Batman solve the crime himself. It was an interesting prospect for their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series and once again, like his predecessor, this series had great storylines, great animation (better than the original), fantastic voice work and of course a brilliant writing. The only thing I did not like was that when he was in the United States, he would often air episodes in a 15-minute scenario. I would like some episodes to be longer. My favorite episode of any Batman cartoon comes in this series, and it's called "Over the Edge", in my opinion as good if not better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's account." Overall, a good follow up, with Superman, this show made my childhood very happy.
