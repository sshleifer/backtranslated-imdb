Director Jean-Marc Valle brings to life the story of Victoria and Albert. Queen Victoria's most superficial thoughts for most people are those of a woman who has ruled for many decades and has lived her life in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives the audience a different perspective. She represents Victoria in her youth, her ascent to the throne and her early years. Blunt's Victoria both fresh and sober throughout the film. His strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All actors are doing well, including Miranda Richardson, in what could be a role to play. <br /> <br /> Although it's not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic "play" moments, the story is still interesting. to make it interesting to watch. The writing on the screen took some historical liberties, the film tries to remain faithful to the relations between Victoria and Albert and to the social and royal structure of the time. The scenography and the costumes are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This film will be very popular with history buffs, plays, Blunt and other actors. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Category: A
