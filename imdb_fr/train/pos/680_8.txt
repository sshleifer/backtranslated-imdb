"The Last Wave" is one of those films that relies a lot on the spirit. The title refers to aboriginal Aboriginal theory: there will be a last wave that will erase everything. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer hired to defend Aborigines accused of murder. At that time, precipitation was unusually high in Australia. While defending the Aborigines, David learns the theory of the last wave and begins to wonder if it is not a mythology. <br /> <br /> The last sequence of the film is a metaphor of the descent into the depths of the spirit. Peter Weir has created a disturbing but stimulating film. Native actor David Gulpilil (whom you may have seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") plays an interesting supporting role as a defendant. <br /> <br /> chance, look at the "making of" on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the nuances of the film, some of which relate to Richard Chamberlain's background.
