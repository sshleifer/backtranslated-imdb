Okay. This film is pure pleasure. He has the horror ever so violent mixed with a bit of suspense and a lot of black comedy. The dentist really starts to lose his head and it is nice to watch him do it. This film is for some people, though. Either you will love it completely, or you will totally hate it. A good movie to rent and watch when you have nothing to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
