I notice that the DVD version seems to have scenes or missing lines between the FRF publication and the launch. <br /> <br /> They must prove that they can win the right to sit in the FRF, with the exception of the green team. <br /> <br /> Another scene is that of their failure during the simulation, Kevin gets Joaquin to clam down. <br /> <br /> I think that the VHS edition other than the ABC version could contain all the missing elements. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I like to know which version of DVD contains the missing elements. <br /> <br /> The DVD I watched seems to be published for television.
