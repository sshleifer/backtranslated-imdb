Here Italy (I write from Venice). Why canceled? The ABC should have given him a chance to create an audience. The cast (with Hope Davis, Scott Campbell, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen recently. We need more shows like this so viewers feel like smart people, not thoughtless drones. I hope that ABC reconsiders its decision or that another station will take it back.
