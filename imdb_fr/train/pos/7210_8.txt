New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) turns 46 and faints quickly. at the opening of the film, Mr. Caine's last piece failed on Broadway. Television critics make fun of Caine and he gets drunk. Death on the Long Island Railroad brings Caine to Montauk instead of his home in East Hampton. Arriving home, Caine is comforted by her tight-fitting wife, Dyan Cannon (Myra), a patient with heart problems, unfortunately. There, Caine and Ms. Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap", written by the young boy Christopher Reeve (Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's alumni. The couple believes that Mr. Reeve's "death trap" is the success needed to revive Caine's career. <br /> <br /> "The trap is in place? For one who is going to be funny, who will do it." <br /> <br /> Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's long-time success on Broadway is not too far from its origin on stage. The cast is nice and the twists of the story are always captivating. One thing that did not work (for me) was the end of the call to the curtain; it must have played better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again; the performances are blank, but in retrospect, Reeve's welcome message to Caine at East Hampton Station should have been simplified into a smiling "Hello". The location is not really East Hampton, but the windmill and the pond are alike. And the ballyhooed love scene is terribly lukewarm. But the game was so good, "even a talented director could not ruin it." And Mr. Lumet does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Christopher Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
