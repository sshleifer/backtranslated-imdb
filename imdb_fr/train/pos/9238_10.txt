Although others have commented that this video is only an edited version of the two series: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you look at the original series, you will find that the dialogue of this edition video has been removed. I found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added. I would say that if you want to see the show in its original version, check out the video versions on VHS. They have more to offer fans than the original episodes available on DVD. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which contains more scenes from Galactica 1980 than the shows themselves. Overall, I consider this a 10 because it gives you more pleasure than the networks wanted to show in the time slot given to producers.
