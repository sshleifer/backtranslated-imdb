I did not read anything about the film until I watched it, by chance, last Saturday night. And then, as I watched her, I felt the pain of Lena and Boesman in my bones. The acting, the tone and the filming so captivated me that I only partially listened to the dialogues. My husband fell asleep shortly after our bedtime and I was sleepless under the impact of the movie. I wanted to wake him up and say, "If I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, it would be for those two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the movie on IMDb and I was sad to hear that Mr. Berry had died before the movie was released and that he had probably never seen the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I always want to tell him that for me, his film was a true independent film, in his concept and in his mind. The actors must be congratulated not only for their brilliant performance, but for having accepted a piece without brilliance, without being worthwhile, on the contrary, displaying the true image of human depression. Sad but poignant.
