It's a fun business, watching movies. In these days when "internalized emotions" and "emotional detachment" are favored over mere sentimentality, it must be difficult to stay true to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Shortly after the end of my jury duties at the 58th Berlinale, I managed to catch Yoji Yamada's Kabei. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I watched people dreamily come out of the theater room, wet eyes, men, women and critics. Even the director of the Berlinale, a keen film visionary, confessed to being caught off guard and found himself crying three minutes away from this shameless sentimental experience. <br /> <br /> But what really surprised me was the criticism came after. Despite being ineffably moved by the film, many critics have chosen to be lukewarm and emotionally uncommitted in their writings. Apparently, after weeping, they had put on their "spirit cap" and had therefore forgotten what I felt like Kabei's genius. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. <br /> <br /> The story of Kabei, which takes place in pre-war Japan, revolves around a writer's family and his destiny, after he was imprisoned for what has been described as a "crime of thought" against the imperial will. Through a series of prolonged emotional scenes, Yamada familiarizes us with the man, his faithful wife and two daughters, as well as with three lateral characters: the pretty young sister of this man, a delirious ex-student and a kid so the? ? all come to help the family cope with their fate, in the absence of the man of the house. <br /> <br /> The story moves at a slow but steady pace, and rifts occur at times when everyone can predict. Of course, it is virtually impossible for anyone in the audience to be too moved by a dramatic event. <br /> <br /> In other words, even if you learn to love the family and its assistants and sympathize with their unfortunate You are so lulled by the certainty of the plot that you expect a particular end. <br /> <br /> However, two hours after the beginning of the film (do not worry, Yamada gives the viewer enough moments of gravity and lightness to accompany you), he slaps you with what I can only describe like "the sting". All that you supposed to be what the story was about - an innocent man snatched from his wife and his faithful daughters ?? now suddenly points to one of the family's helpers. Someone you have so far taken for granted is now immersed in an unexpected twist of fate. <br /> <br /> At this point, something odd happened in the theater where I was. Everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibition. <Br /> <br /> "My word!" I whispered in my breath. I then realized that "Kabei", in the final analysis, was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the brink of war. It was in fact a sneaky examination of a common human object: how much we worried about the secret feelings of the people closest to us. <br /> <br /> The most common criticism about the movie was that it was technically sound but lacked innovation. This is what happens when critics put up their proverbial reflection cap, I suppose. With Kabei, I think Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he would use to address a unique aspect of humanity. An old nasty trick that he so perfectly applied in the Tora-san series, and later in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> After sleeping the audience in a sort of narrative comfort zone, he throws us into a realm of emotions. rarely explored in the cinema. <br /> <br /> This is for me the most effective cinematographic tool of all. One that avoids detection, but affects you deeply. And the proof of its effectiveness is a thousand pieces of wet kleenex, thrown into a bin just outside this thousand-seater movie theater. <br /> <br /> Now, if only some critics resisted the idea of ​​being as smart as they forget what cinema really is. Human emotions. Pure and simple.
