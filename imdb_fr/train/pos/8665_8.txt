I picked up this title by accident with the Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of pure Euro-trash films. But this film has a nice approval and should deserve a better transfer than what currently exists. Stuped we are not ... satisfying! Watching this film, I could not help wondering ... how is it that Sergio Martino did not make this film? This bears his signature everywhere and is punctuated by Edwedge Fenech (alas, she is not as well known as she should be but she had a beautiful appearance in Hostel II). Double-cross and triple-cross and seal this film end to end with Lee Van Cleef oozing cool under pressure from the first second. Did this guy have to go to Italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let him go? In addition to Lee's more recognizable films, moviegoers should try this in size and see how, if Sergio Leone would have lowered his epic scale on Once Upon a Time in America to half the total time (and a quarter of the budget) here's what that it would have been. If refreshing, it should be taken during the day at home and make it a morning couch
