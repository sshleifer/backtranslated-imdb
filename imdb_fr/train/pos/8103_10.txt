it was the most expensive film, once produced. Sir Alexander Korda and H.G. Wells were both saddened by his poor grades - for good reason. he was and remains well ahead of his time. Apart from the seemingly mediocre direction, probably the editing, at the very beginning, the book ends in an astonishing conclusion. <br /> <br /> whether it is the role of Sir Ralph Richardson's "Boss" or, better, that of his wife, Sir CÃ©dric, opponent of space, the central role of John Cabal of Raymond Massey - all offer breathtaking performances. <br /> <br /> the scene with mr. The incomparable assortment of Korda, that of the little girl who rushes into an absolutely incomparable scene, comments "Life is becoming more beautiful and more beautiful"? which quickly brings tears to any parent / grandparent. it is not a film for young people - unless you are "experienced" and rather see those who have seen "the horror" to which it opposes. <br /> <br /> of course, the "fake parachuting" looks hokey - while using a "magnetic cannon", now called "mass conductor", can be considered ridiculous, as opposed to rockets - - give Sir Korda a break - Mr. Wells made that choice. and at +/- $ 8 million, this film went far beyond the excessive budget - so it focused on what it could handle. <br /> <br /> The true power of this greatest cinema is in Cabal's 'John The Final Declaration of Human Fate' - his friend 'Passworthy' casts doubt on the wisdom of space-faring, saying: "We are so small animals." The appropriate answer from John Cabal is (paraphrased) "Yes, small animals, and if that's all we are, we have to live and die as such." they stand under a large astronomical telescope. he passes his hand through the night sky. "Still, we can have the whole universe or nothing." - then the final chorus breaks in --- "Which one will it be?" --- it's not "Star Wars", "Blade Runner" --- anything you can think of as "awesome" - that's the real thing. <br /> <br /> I remind everyone of the last speech of Steven Hawking, on the occasion of his last "Medal of Honor" --- "Humanity must leave the Earth, or die." - the heart Even from this work - I really like 'standard entertainment' - but this 'relic', for the discerning viewer, offers much more 'Who will it be?' to be in a good mood - no matter what it takes - it will take your breath away - I 'guaranted' - overall, for humanity - the most important of the cinema. <br /> <br /> Since I am in post, I notice that many commented on the poor quality of the "surviving" examples.In the 80s, I developed an "exclusive" colorization process that required a "clean" original. leads to Michael Korda, who unfortunately noted that all were gone, so we must savor what remains --- "sad but true?"
