Somerset Maugham characters come to life in RKO's "Of Human Bondage"; but the film is a skeleton version of the novel, and Bette Davis' star-spinning performance absorbs all the energy. Otherwise, it's the story of Leslie Howard (in the role of Philip Carey); he dreams of becoming a painter, but he is told that he has no talent for the arts. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard fights to become a doctor. His efforts seem to indicate bad advice about the arts; although successful in medicine, his painting seemed easier - note also the symbolism of his handicap, a "club foot" (explained in the film). <br /> <br /> On the way (right now, in this version) Howard is passionate about the waitress Davis (under the name of Mildred Rogers). Davis's characterization of "Mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in a dramatic speech when she tells Howard, among other things, that she must "WIPE MY MOUTH!" after kissing him. Howard also plays well, but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and his love for Davis; then, their performances are ruined. <br /> <br /> Yet, a movie to watch for the acting game, with some good support players. The characterization of Bette Davis was famous for having inspired a campaign "writing" for the Academy Award "Best Actress" in 1934. For the record, she placed third. The results are: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It Happened One Night" <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" <br /> <br /> <br /> 3. Bette Davis - "Of Human Bondage" <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "A Night of Love" <br /> <br /> ***** ** of Bondage Human (6/28/34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis and Reginald Denny
