It's not one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies - I admit it fast. However, even if some people see his film as pure propaganda, I wonder what's wrong with that? Yes, of course, like the TV show THE FBI, this is a clear case of the Bureau that works in the field of public relations to try to mobilize support. But, as entertainment, it does a good job. Moreover, surprisingly enough for the moment it was shot, the movie is more focused on crime than on espionage and "commies". Instead, it's a fiction of one of the first agents and career he has chosen. Now, considering that the agent is played by Jimmy Stewart, it is almost certain that the roles of actor and writer were good - it was a film with a real budget and a studio that does not was not going to lose the spotlight in a third-class movie. So overall, it's worth a visit, but not especially great.
