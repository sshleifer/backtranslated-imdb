It is an excellent musical with a timeless score of one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a "Parisian" atmosphere that gives the film a lot of charm, but in terms of history .. and it's not really there. Or at least, not very well worked. The acting is not so smooth by Caron. But I liked certain dialogues, I liked the scene at the Seine, I liked the character played by Levant, the colors; and the dance of course, which is quite magnificent. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 seems very good to me.
