Ossessione is in very bad condition but is currently undergoing a complete restoration at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is a 2nd generation "master positive" resulting from the impression that Visconti managed to hide from the fascists. It was digitized on the Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data) and processed using the DaVinci Revival restoration software. After that, the rest is manual labor and we do not plan to finish until early spring. Next year, it should be available on DVD and, hopefully, also on HD DVD. This film is beautiful and we hope that this restoration effort will benefit many generations.
