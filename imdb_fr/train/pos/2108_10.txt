A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers from the same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who maintain a romance via a mailbox without their knowledge. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch eliminates any syrupy sentimentality and calls his actors to discrete and unadorned performances. As a result, you fall in love with almost all of them. <br /> <br /> There is a strong current of melancholy in this movie that I enjoyed. Loneliness is a major theme, very clearly represented in the character of the owner and manager of the store, interpreted perfectly by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he is cuckolded by his wife and realizes that the successful life he has created is not enough to prevent him from feeling lonely when he has no partner to share it. This makes shy romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant as they reach out to this invisible other, who considers herself a soulmate before even meeting. Of course, we know that everything will be fine in the end, but the film does not let you forget the lamentable feeling they would feel if they discovered that the reality did not correspond to fantasy. <br /> Lubitsch fills his film with a crackerjack cast that has plenty of chemistry boats. The small group of store employees describes themselves throughout the film as a small family and that's exactly how we feel about us. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful and unknown novel. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
