I really enjoyed this movie. The humor was sometimes a bit absent, but I enjoyed the story of the dramatic and serious story throughout the film. This is the only second movie I saw Verdone play (the other was "A sacco bello"), and I understand why the Italians find it tiring, but he thinks he played well as a loving father . <br /> <br /> My only disadvantage with this movie is that I knew it was happening in Italy - somewhere in the center or south, I presume, but I felt like there was no representation of a place. This film could have been made in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Delhi ... I still think it's important that films have a place where viewers have something to tell. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, I think you'll like it. It's not a Fellini or a Rossellini - it's not realism or neo-realism. It's a comical story with serious moments that could really happen to anyone of us.
