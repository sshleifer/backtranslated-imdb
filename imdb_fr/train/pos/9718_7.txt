POSSIBLE SPOILER - Somehow "How to alienate friends ..." is the "loser who learns to adapt, who succeeds and who discovers that something else is more important", as in the story of Fame. - END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book, but this comedy offers several good moments. Although I think the end is imperfect. It was too fast and too abrupt, as if something was missing. In addition, I would say that the film is not able to keep a high level. Apart from that you will find a nice selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities. So far, I have never seen Pegg otherwise. Yet he is a very unique type, although on the screen it can sometimes seem a little more tedious than necessary. Fox proved she was able to play a hot star with her head in the clouds. I do not know if it was difficult, but his performance was hot and much better than when "Transformers" (ok ... it's probably not a difficult match). Kirsten Dunst is very good Kirsten Dunst (again) and you can like it (like me) or find it boring. On the other hand, you will see Anderson who proved his actress talents and Jeff Bridges (who is doing well but who might have been able to act a little more powerful). They all correspond quite well to their character. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a beautiful comedy of celebrities with some more and less funny passages, a nice distribution but an end too sudden.
