An executioner (played by the sexy Jennifer Thomas II) is pleased to realize all the fantasies of all men sentenced to death before meeting their creator. And what a way to go. Fortunately, this film is not real, otherwise we would have more people in the world sentenced to death. <br /> <br /> It starts very slowly. As in most movies (B), the light is weak and the actors act badly. It improves as you go. And ends in beauty. <br /> <br /> I would say it's very high for the low-cost and sexy movies of the 90s. It's a must see once the kids are away or lying down.
