There is so much to befall in Aro Tolbukhin. In the middle of the asesino (in the mind of the killer), it is very difficult to speak without warning. Let's just say that this film is like an exercise in the cinema but really very well done. It is composed of super 8, black and white photos, 35 millimeters, colors, interviews and flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin, it's as if a film had made a documentary or vice versa, which the most singular aspect refers to the doubt that puzzles you: has it never existed? The film follows the life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, having worked for a religious mission, then killed some people. An act for which he was arrested and sentenced to death. The film begins because some French documentalists became interested in this character and interviewed him before his death. Nowadays, other people have become involved and have deepened their research on the character. The one we are witnessing - the movie. <br /> <br /> For most of the story, we are guided by a semi-slow phase that allows us to look into Aro's mind, mainly to understand why he did it. what he did. Nevertheless, the important thing is that filmmakers never give us a biased point of view; they left judgment for us all and even though we can understand his actions, we never justify them. Thus, the first half is based on the collection of information; later, things turn in Aro's childhood, giving the film an incredible new strength (even the tough ones never became weak or boring). <br /> <br /> I do not mean - and I do not want - to mess up anything; The only thing left to say is that if, by chance, you get this movie near you, trust me, the trip to see it is more than worthy of interest.
