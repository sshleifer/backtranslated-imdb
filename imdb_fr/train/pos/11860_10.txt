This film has everything. It is a classic representation of the events surrounding the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is one of thousands of people to have the chance to choose his destiny in America. This cinematic but extremely accurate representation of Miamis's drug empire is astonishing. Brian DePalma does a remarkable job directing this image, so much so that the viewer gets involved in both the script and all the characters in the cast. The pressure of Tony's characters being so credible and so strong, Brian DePalma explained the raw talent revealed by Steven Bauer (Tony's best friend Manny), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Tony's sister Gina), Robert Loggia (Frank , Tony's boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I enjoyed every minute of watching this movie, and I still watch it every week. In this year, the 20th anniversary of this classic detective film, I am a strong believer that in 20 years, people will still be referring to this film in astonishing numbers. Since other crime movies are so dramatic that I find, this movie is a shock to the system.
