It's the first time I've seen Buster Keaton's debut feature, and I must say I enjoyed it a lot and would have liked to have it there years ago. Rohauer's introductory text warned that the simple Three Ages nitrate print had been rediscovered and recovered in 1954 just prior to the burn and that many frames that looked hopelessly stuck were separated. So it's hard to watch movies in places, but I've seen and survived a lot worse. <br /> <br /> It was fitting that the 3 shorts were covered, but for Intolerance, it's inventive and fun from start to finish. the finish: at the Stone Age with the wicked Wallace Beery riding an elephant and the goodie Buster riding a company brontosaurus; In Roman times, Buster mounted a chariot with wheel locks and adapted to sledding. Signs No Parking in Latin; In this technological age of need for speed and greed, his car falls beautifully to the forefront. He and Beery are after the girl through the ages, an endless showdown. Favorite Piece: As a caveman, it is flipped over a cliff edge but still emits a kiss to the camera - an amazing second or two! <br /> <br /> Excellent thing, reaffirming my love for silent movie comedy.
