this film is ok if you like stupid action, nerdy play and a very small plot! The special effects are decent as this film is from the director of "Event Horizon". The costumes look like something from a crazy max movie. None of the soldiers speak, so others tell them what to do. It ends up becoming a big shoot'em up movie with explosions everywhere. Personally, I liked Russell better in the areas of "tango and money", "New York getaway" and "executive decision". He must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a sci-fi action movie flawless !!
