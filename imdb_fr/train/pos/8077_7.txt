A film made for the contemporary public. The masses see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and of course sensual scenes. It's not really a film that we would watch with the whole family. It's not for the eyes of children. I needed a number of fast-moving scenes. <br /> <br /> If you're just looking for entertainment, this movie has it all. The songs are catchy. A sumptuous production, I must add. <br /> <br /> However, the film's message is not universal. He emphasizes the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do good, you will get good. And if you do wrong, you will get hurt. The fruit of good deeds is good, while the fruit of evil is evil. <br /> <br /> In real life, it's not always true. It is well known that most people do not receive justice in this world. While it is true that some evil people face a perverse end, many are escaping. And then there are many people who do good, but who in return come up against a sad end. <br /> <br /> If you do not care about the message, and all you want is an escape from the reality of the world. , this film is a good artist.
