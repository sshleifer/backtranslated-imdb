I have always loved movies that describe life as it is. Life sometimes has boring spots, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Crosses" is the perfect name for this movie (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life flows and flows like a river, with difficult places, but a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the film. His narration has a friendly meaning that perfectly matches the photo. As a director, he is sober and calm, and captures incredibly beautiful scenes. As for acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work well as brothers. I do not know how to describe the performances of Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn, except that they really feel real. "A river runs through" is a magnificent film. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
