I loved this film. I am a Mexican and I was the least offended. In fact, I think this film should be shown at police headquarters throughout Mexico. It's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3-month-old corpse. It makes me angry to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slimy people are freeing themselves by paying a laughable fine or living like kings in prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, the character of Denzel Washington. A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. Kidnapping is a flourishing industry here (at least in big cities). In fact, I would like the real-life kidnappers to suffer the same fate as Creasy did his job. It would be so wonderful (sorry, I'm so irritated!). MAN ON FIRE is a captivating film not to be missed. This may be difficult for some of you if you are not used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do it all the time while watching American movies), but the effort is worth it. Some editing is a bit blurry ... a bit like TRAFFIC, remember? (Another brilliant vision of Mexico's corruption). The film begins a little slowly but the pace accelerates from the second half. I swear you will be excited by Denzel Washington who ships the wrongdoers. His performance is simply excellent. The end (no spoilers, OK !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best movies of the year. A "must own" for a DVD collection! 9 out of 10
