I grew up with this as my favorite movie of all time. The special effects are incredible for the time and have been awarded. I remember the dialogue as if I had heard it yesterday. It's simply a great timeless adventure. The music is by Miklos Rosza, who is the best in the history of cinema. Sabu is the thief. Conrad Veidt is the big bad guy. I have a copy on hand for the next trip in the past. Whoa there! Rex Ingram wants to bring out his bottle of geniuses!
