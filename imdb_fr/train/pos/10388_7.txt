I am a big fan of the television show of the Dukes of Hazzard. And I really enjoyed this movie. I had a lot more fun here than at other summer blockbusters. <br /> <br /> It's funny to hear people complaining about this movie with excuses like "stupid plot" and "it's a lot rougher than the show". Does anyone remember the rudeness of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy makes jokes about incest and Bo says Luke probably fathered half of the children in the orphanage. The only reason it was cleaned up was because it was replaced by an earlier slot. <br /> <br /> And as far as possible. It was the perfect plot of the Dukes. In fact, as a remake, it is probably more faithful to sources than any television program that has migrated to the big screen. <br /> <br /> While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville do not look exactly like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. I did not like Boss Hogg from Burt too much. And I would have a little more incompetence on the part of Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie, Roscoe is a little ... scary. <br /> <br /> And who did not have a smile on his face as General Lee ran through the streets of Atlanta and the alleys of Hazzard? <Friends, allow yourself to enjoy a film that is only an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you will not regret it. It's just a great silent movie!
