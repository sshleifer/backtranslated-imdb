What a beautiful episode for this beautiful series. This is television excellence at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and is beautifully filmed in black and white, almost a black film style with deep shadows and black images. It's a story about two men falling in love, but I do not want to ruin that. This is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the superb Tom Pettit and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we live their lives, their love for each other and their tragedy. Tackling such a sensitive problem makes this episode all the more surprising. Our emotions are as torn and nervous as the characters. Shivers ran through my spine at the end when they played the wonderful role of Bob Dylan. This far exceeds the 10 and goes to the stars. Pretty.
