THE ITALIAN is a surprisingly accomplished film for its time. Superb shooting, with truly sublime light effects, it is an early jewel that clearly reveals that REGINALD BARKER is a pioneering director of equal rank to D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. It's hard to know how much control Thomas Ince has exerted on the production, but this film still has extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his family in New York is very moving. The themes of social injustice, vengeance and forgiveness are very topical. The use of close-ups is exceptional and the impressive performances of GEORGE BEBAN are electrifying. What we need now is a very good impression transferred to DVD so that we can really appreciate this old masterpiece of cinema.
