As a person who was looking for an existence as a "professional" person with an income supported by a BS in Chemistry and a MS in Business Management, my mental health has always been spasmodically supported in external indulgences in more artistic fields. My post-graduate courses were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, forging / metal welding and artistic drawing which also included screen printing. <br /> I also stay healthy with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to distant destinations in California and neighboring states like Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking make it possible to approach the earth with time to stop to watch and listen and also to photograph or record sounds. <br /> <br /> In this context, I was obsessed with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was also impressed by the documentary content of the artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the skill and finesse of the director / director of photography Thomas Riedelsheimer. In fact, I could not separate Goldsworthy's art from Riedelsheimer's camera path. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
