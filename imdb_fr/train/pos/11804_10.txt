Praise the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing that I went to find a used copy and I bought it for myself. Now, when all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I give them the Sasquatch Hunters. It must be said that a rule has been established to improve the film. No conversation is allowed while the movie is on, unless the words are repeated Sasquatch in a song. I also liked the credit at the end of the film. "Thanks for the jeep, Tom!" Whoever Tom is, I say thank you because without your Jeep, the film might not have been shot. In short, a good movie if you are looking for something to laugh about. If you want a good movie, maybe look for something else, but if you do not mind laughing at the expense of a man in a monkey costume, take a copy.
