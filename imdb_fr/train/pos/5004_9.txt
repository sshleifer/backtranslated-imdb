but just as fun and random! Love it or hate it, but do not expect a sophisticated plot or a biting cliffhanger. Think of it as Seinfeld, but without the follow-up and repeated representations of wacky characters (well ... until now, I have the feeling that I will develop favorites as the season continues.) <br /> <br /> "Comfort" is not for humor, but for pleasure with the least effort of your brain. That's why this show embodies everything I need in a program when I come home from work in the evening: superficial conversation in the background with just the right "cute" for the characters I can appreciate when I finally look up from the computer to see what I miss. <br /> <br /> Funnier than most current sitcoms, quieter than an evening at NASCAR. Just the right mix of dead air and returns. I can not wait for the next one.
