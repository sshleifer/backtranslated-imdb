The name just says everything. I saw this film with my father when he came out and after serving in Korea he had great admiration for the man. What is disappointing about this film is that it focuses only on a short period of a man's life. It is interesting to note that the whole life of man would have made a biography so epic that it is stunning to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> Some posters ignore the imperfect characteristics of the man, which are cheap shots. The theme of the movie "Duty, Honor, Country" is not just a bland word on the lips of a high-ranking officer - it's a deep statement of a man's total devotion to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peck is the liberal who has allowed him to better understand the man. He does a great job in showing the intrepid general tempered with the human side of the man.
