"Nothing, there's nothing in room 237. But you do not have anything to do with it anyway, so stay outside, you understand, stay out." <br /> <br /> Never has such a feat of psychological horror been accomplished by this film. It's the highest rated horror movie of all and rightly so. Jack Nicholson is a great actor and it's one of the greatest movie performances. <br /> <br /> This is a family who moves to a secluded and deserted hotel for 5 months during the winter. Then, the father (Jack) is almost possessed by the horrors of the hotel. <br /> <br /> The direction of Kubricks is nothing less than perfection. Follow-up images, atrocious music, mystical messages and complicated plot make this movie the best horror film ever made. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, danger, death and horror are constantly evoked. Red is used in EVERY scene. Has the red been voluntarily set in Kubrick? Of course. <br /> <br /> It's a Kubrick classic and it's the third of his films that I gave 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction and it shows in all his films. He likes to leave his viewers perplexed in each of his films. <br /> <br /> I will talk about this film in the months to come. It has infinite depth. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it is the cornerstone of horror and tension. A masterpiece of terror 10/10
