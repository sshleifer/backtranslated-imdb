It seems to me that the best screen version of Quo Vadis? never done. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and obvious as in the book, sometimes sinuous and losing its suspense among aesthetic subtleties. But the film is really and beautifully "strange", has an enigma and style, that the other versions - with R. Taylor and the new Poland - really miss. It looks like Roman decadence, the beauty of declining paganism and nascent Christianity. At least, I think so. Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did a great job in describing their characters. Forrest's petrone seems to be the biggest success of the cast (not to mention Brandauer who is one of the greatest actors of all time) and accumulates the very essence of this dying world (IMHO). That's all. That's how it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
