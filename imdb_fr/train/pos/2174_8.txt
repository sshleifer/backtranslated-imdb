I think I really like this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film but later dubbed in French in 1930. Despite the dubbing of someone else's voice over his own, it remains a breathtaking tour de force for Louis Brooks . The fact that her sung voice is doubled by the legendary Edith Piaf helps reassure purists about the trickery. <br /> <br /> This is Lulu's story and we first see her in a hotel complex with her macho boyfriend, André (Georges Charlia) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame like a pair of legs: we see her inside the car trying to put on her swimsuit. Lulu is very free to show her body and that does not go with the boring André. When Lulu plans to apply for the Miss Europe title, we know that a happy ending will not be at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be very focused on men who watch beautiful women. We see a lot of bathing beauties and the reactions of men watching them. But at the center of it all is the beautiful Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind watching movies from bygone eras, consider watching this one. Louise Brooks is not a name that most average movie buffs know well, but as soon as you see it, you will be fascinated and want to know more. Discover it also in the "Pandora's Box" if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Beware of the US Kino DVD. I do not know if their projection speed is correct. A lot of scenes seem to be shown at a speed too fast. Maybe that's how they were shot. I do not know. But as this is the only way to see this film, do not swallow this minor and bitter pill.
