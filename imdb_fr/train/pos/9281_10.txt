I do not know how and where the Iranian directors are inspired by the creation of a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple conspiracy that many filmmakers could imagine --- but that may not have the ability to project it on a film like Jafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> The film looks like a revolution of two worlds at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between the sexes that takes place behind the walls of the stadium. <br /> <br /> It makes you feel like you're in the movie and you're one of the characters, and watching the movie, as if you also want to get a glimpse of the football match . You will feel exactly the same enthusiasm and the same feelings as these film actresses. You want to know the verdict, you are dying to see what will happen to girls. <br /> <br /> I like intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainees. It's like Venus VS Mars, it really shows the difference of thinking between men and women and women's struggle for equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is Jafar Panahi's second film I've seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and I can not wait to watch a little more. <br /> <br /> I'm already addicted to Iranian films and this one is to see absolutely!
