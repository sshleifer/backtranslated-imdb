Following Watergate, a number of conspiracy films appeared, such as this one, written by the late Adam Kennedy (from his novel). <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays Vietnamese veteran "Roy Tucker", a loser who ended up in jail. He is visited by Marvin Tagge (Richard Widmark), who claims to represent an organization designed to help people wrongfully convicted. They offer him the freedom and despite Tagge's mistrust, he accepts. But he takes a cellmate named Spiventa (Mickey Rooney). Why is it hard to see, Spiventa being an irritating little man who makes Tucker mad for persistent sexual conversation, not what you want to hear when you're behind bars. <br /> <br /> Tagge's benefactors kill Spiventa before Tucker's astonished eyes. Gathered with his wife Ellie (Candice Bergen), and given a new identity (strangely, he does not try to change his appearance.) Shaving this mustache with cheese would have been a start, he settles, but finds that There is a trap - Tagge wants Tucker to do as much as assassinate the President of the United States. He refuses, so Tagge has kidnapped Ellie ... <br /> <br /> I'll leave the synopsis here, but I'm sure you can guess the rest for yourself. The script has enough holes in the plot to make you want to read the book (interesting trick!). The people that Tagge represents are never revealed. Allusions to the murder of J.F.K. are undeniable. Despite the findings of the Warren Commission, the doubt as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone persists to this day. <br /> <br /> This is Stanley Kramer's first film in years and, although there is no turkey, say John Frankenheimer's "Manchu Candidate" or "The View of Parallax" By Alan J. Pakula. As a leftist conspiracy film, he tends to abstract from his subject instead of mastering it. I prefer the right people myself - they are more funny! "Domino" has the appearance of a T.V. movie, and boasts what must be the easiest escape in film history, not forgetting an end to Michael Caine's classic, "Get Carter". <br /> <br /> What makes it visible is Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter, sadly deceased earlier this year, is superb as the mysterious Tagge, who initially seems to be behind the operation until he is also ruthlessly eliminated, thus starting a chain of deaths to eliminate all traces of evidence. the perpetrators of this diabolical plot are falling - just like dominoes. As a Tucker, the innocent pawn, Hackman is wonderful. You have to wonder why he chose to hide in such an obvious place. In its place, I would have fled to the other side of the world, anywhere to escape these fanatics. Hackman's love scenes with Bergen slow the plot, and it's almost a relief when she gets caught. Presumably, the producers also thought so, which explains why the film begins with a strange prologue exposing the whole principle of the film - expressed by the British actor Patrick Allen - warning the public that he "exists" and that he "seeks" "to get us. Actor Les Dawson later usurped this overture in his film B.B.C. show 'The Dawson Watch'. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney had already worked with Kramer on 'It's a crazy world, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy'. His scene of "death" here looks like an exit from this image, the actor seems to be stung by a wasp rather than being shot. <br /> <br /> Previously, conspiracy films were made only by the left. but now rights are mingled with the law. Last year, "Taking Liberties", an absurd compilation of lies and half-truths about Tony Blair's government turned out to be the British answer to "Reefer Madness". At least Domino had a beautiful Candice Bergen. The best film Chris Atkins could offer was Anne Widdecombe! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "The Domino Principle" was created by Sir Lew Grade, the legendary British television mogul behind "The Saint", "Jesus Of Nazareth". and 'The Muppet Show'. He again collaborated with Adam Kennedy in 1980 on "Raise The Titanic!", Whose failure was such that Grade's ambitions to become the new Louis B. Meyer failed. Being a bit open-minded, I would not exclude the possibility of a conspiracy.
