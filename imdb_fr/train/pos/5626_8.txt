Marjorie, a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two roommates, Pat and Terry. One night, she gets into her car and is attacked by a masked man with a knife. Her plan is to rape her, but she manages to escape. The man has his purse. The police can not help him, because the rape itself did not happen. One day, while Marjorie's roommates are at work, her attacker goes there.The name is called Joe.A long fight begins this man.She then manages to spray his eyes and mouth insect repellent, which would kill him if he did not get help quickly.She attaches him and makes him undergo the same kind of physical and mental aggression The Extremities (1986) is directed by Robert M. Young.It is based on the controversial Broadway play of 1982 by William Mastrosimone.Farrah Fawcett, who unfortunately lost his battle with cancer last year, is terrible as Marjorie .James Russo, who played the striker also in the game, is convincing as Joe .Alfre Woodard and Dia na Scarwid is awesome like Pat and Terry.James Avery is considered a security guard.She was nominated for a Golden Globe.This is not a movie that is supposed to entertain you.He asks a question is a justified revenge.This is not a movie perfect but I recommend it
