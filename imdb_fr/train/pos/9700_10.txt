In one way or another, this film manages to be invigorating, sweet-bitter and comforting at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring history to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a life from top to bottom through the most innocent eyes imaginable: a bird. <br /> <br /> Paulie starts life as a baby parrot given to a little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi girl) with a speech disorder. Even if she learns to speak correctly, Paulie does the same. However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything that is said. The military father does not like the bird, so he is sent to a pawnbroker and bought by an elderly artist, Ivy. She teaches him good manners, etc., while traveling the country to find the owner of Paulie. The film continues with several twists, until Paulie finds himself in a laboratory where he is finally hidden in a basement and found by a Russian guardian, touched by the story of this bird. the plot is in keeping with the simple and metaphorical theme that language is a gift and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is amazing. A beautiful mix of flute, digital base and horns enhances the film to pure ecstasy. Panoramic viewing angles and breathtaking scenery add to the history. And, by way of conclusion, the puppet theater is quite credible. (Unlike Star Wars, where Yoda looks like a Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite movies, with the added remark that my wonderful four-year-old parakeet has passed away recently. Overall, I give this film **** on four stars, a boost and a big hug.
