I had some reservations about this movie, I thought it would be the usual bill - a movie formula about Christmas. Being in the midst of a heat wave at the end of June, we still decided to give it a go. We might see snow. <br /> <br /> This movie turned out to be a laugh after another. Ben Affleck was credible in his character, but the real star of it is James Gandofini. He interpreted his sentences with a true spirit and created an excellent "father". <br /> <br /> If you want to spend a few pleasant hours, take a look at this one.
