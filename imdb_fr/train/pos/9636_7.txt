Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim), a lonely and depressed French Frenchman, on vacation in summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (the magnificent Stéphane Rideau). Quiet and slow it is a very frustrating film. On one hand, I was absorbed by this and really felt for both boys. On the other, I became angry - the film continued to scroll from past to present, without rhyme or reason. It's very confusing and useless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> There are also lots of holes in the plot - Mathieu, at one point, does something that leads him to the hospital. What is it - we are never told! Then he breaks with Cedric and tells the others that he lives with him. Why? We are not told. Then he inexplicably connects with another guy at the end. Why? No explanation. It is clear that Cédric loves Mathieu and Mathieu lives in the same city so ... However, it is a tribute to the movie that you really care about the characters. If only things were explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim like Mathieu is not good. He is tall, handsome and has a beautiful body - but he can not act. His idea of ​​playing is sitting with an empty look on his face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. He is VERY handsome, has a very beautiful body and is a sacred actor. In addition, he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him. There is complete frontal male nudity, lots of kisses and a rather explicit sex scene in the movie, which is great - most movies are afraid to show love scenes between men. This one does not do it and it is useful to see how the characters care and feel for each other. <br /> <br /> So, a frustrating film that deserves a little bit of being seen - especially for Rideau's nude scenes - that is, you love beautiful naked young men! <br /> <br />
