The Perfect Son tells the story of two brothers in their thirties, one seemingly "perfect" and the other fundamentally cured, which is often found in detox centers. After the death of their father, the two are reunited after a long absence and the usual rivalry between brothers and sisters resurfaces. It is only when the "perfect" brother makes the surprising revelation that he has AIDS that the irresponsible younger brother finally decides to put his life in order and take responsibility. <br /> <br /> The movie It's nice to chronicle the "return" of the younger brother, although it may seem a little exaggerated sometimes (overcoming drug addiction is never so easy). What makes the film more tender is the treatment of AIDS, a subject that has somewhat moved to cinema in the cinema over the last 5 to 10 years. And also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two brothers formerly in conflict is very credible and well done. The two main actors were very competent, even terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> Director and writer Leonard Farlinger's first feature film, whose brother died as a result of AIDS, was solid. The end is well done too. <br /> <br />
