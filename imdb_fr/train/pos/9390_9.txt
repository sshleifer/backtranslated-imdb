This movie kicked me on Nick Cage's kick. It's a story full of twists - a movie of motivations and movements. Of course, Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web. Everything is good in this film - cinematography, rhythm of history and especially end. Cage excels in what he does best - not to be an action hero, but to be an ordinary man caught in the traps of life.
