Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by the maverick film Samuel Fuller, contains an astonishing opening that establishes a double complication. Subway rider Candy (Susan Peters) collides with the pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark drenched in cool Sinatra tones). She does not know that she wears valuable microfilms. McCoy does not know how to seize it. Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents. Thus, the claw sets in motion a degree of knowledge. Candy is doubly supervised (Skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the overconfident little thief, is singularly unconscious, followed by federal agents; the feds, who all know, are finally helpless. They can not prevent the "passage" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
