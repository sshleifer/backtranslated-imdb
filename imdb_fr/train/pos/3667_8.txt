Hollywood North is a satirical look at the era of Canadian film history, when the Canadian government offered huge tax breaks to Canadian films. Most of the time, it has been treated like a tax shelter or an inexpensive way to get American movies done. For example, Porky came out. Anyway, Matthew Modine plays a novice producer who wants to adapt a beloved Canadian novel. However, to get the money, he needs an American star. He takes a gunshot and learns that he has to compromise to the point that the film no longer resembles the book he was originally based on. It plays well in Canada but may not be understood outside the Great White North. Americans will think that we are satirical, but miss the fact that we make them a satire. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
