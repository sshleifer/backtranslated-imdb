'Cry Freedom' is a movie about the distance traveled by people to find the truth. <br /> <br /> The first half is an interesting representation of an unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and editor-in-chief Don Woods (played fanatically by Dezel Washington and Kevin Klein). While the second half deals with Woods seeking answers about Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Although most people are supportive of the first half of the film, which focuses on the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods. I found the second part of Don Woods had a hard time making Biko's story much more interesting around the world.
