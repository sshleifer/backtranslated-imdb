I have to start with Ed Furlong on this one. You must. God bless this kid. $ 5 dollars says that the character he plays in this movie is what he really likes in real life. He has a line or two that made me almost crack because of the subtle humor of the screenplay. You know all the hardships this guy has gone through in the last few years and it does not even seem like Furlong is doing anything. Maybe that's why his performance was good. Even with Madsen. You keep thinking, "I bet this guy is really like that in real life." Should Madsen even act? All natural. Vosloo has obviously gone from type to pen. I think the biggest surprise of this film was the performance of Jordana Spiro. His reactions are well known in this film. I fought whether she was hot or not, but I realized that I would just like to see her more. <br /> <br /> Not a big fan of shoot-out / hostage movies. But what I'm a fan of are movies with lots of twists to try to make you guess. It's not just your burglars who take control of a bank, they kill hostages and the good guys win in the final movie type. The twists continue to happen ... and to come. <br /> <br /> Coffee scenes work better with handheld cameras to show what it really looks like inside. Not ignored a bit. Imagine Bourne Ultimatum's "lightened" style on some of the cafe scenes. <br /> <br /> And for the fanatics of Bo Bice, actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will make you a double take. These guys are twins. <br /> <br /> As I watched, I wondered why some actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town? It made sense at the end of the day for these people to smuggle contraband into other countries / states to get these accents. But more details are revealed in the bonuses on how some producers wanted to make this film for an international audience with some of their stars that we might not have heard about. And some of them smoke hot. Moncia Dean? Do I need to say more?
