I really like this show. I can easily see how he attained cult status. It's original and provocative. For some reason, I have never felt the kind of resonance I could have had. It does not pack the kind of open door, the winter cold that would result from such an impressive place. Whenever I watch an episode, I find myself in a hurry and I try to answer a question without name or form. <br /> <br /> Before continuing, let me start by saying that the following is my opinion and opinion only. Different shots for different people. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more scenes of "American Gothic" night tours. There is too much light in this show, and I think it has tended to neutralize the suspense. We are not afraid of the day, after all. We are concerned about what is in the shadows. The devil is not always in the details. What we do not see is often what scares us the most. <br /> <br /> Second - and this is the one that will probably lead to tar and feathers: Gary Cole is an extremely talented actor ... a character actor. I followed his career with Brady Bunch movies, which is why I find it hard to say that he was probably misinterpreted as Lucas Buck. He is almost too petroichan, too kind to embody evil, even by the standards of the Bible. Lucas Buck is a stunner. He is the heroine. He's in a kitchen lab next to a gallon of Drain-O. You go back there, even if you know that the end will be madness and death. He should be like the ultimate loan shark. He is a book maker, but also of indescribable condemnation. Sure. You have money and soon you will have broken fingers too; a cut hand, a decapitated head, and finally, a damned soul. Turning to Buck is an act of desperation, and whenever he is near him, there should be some immediate and ambient finality - with a compound interest daily - in the air. <br /> and by the time you realize it, you'll know it's too late. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to three: they showed a little too often to Buck. In fact, he is in most scenes, which may have made him lose his advantage. The sheriff would be like the mythology of next door. He is apocryphal knowledge. Many would know it, but few really know it. It would be the subject of flashbacks and enigmatic conversations, and the ideal person to present this presentation of the plot would have been the deputy character described by Nick Searcy. <br /> <br /> Four, the show could be very autonomous. Some would say it's a little reverential - and it's the hiss of "Meet Me Fishing" in the series pilot. I think we've already established that what Cassidy and Raimi were shooting for was anti-Andy Taylor. We probably do not need the concept provided via Fed Ex. I understood that in the first five minutes, the piano on the head was useless for me. <br /> <br /> These remarks are about what, FOR ME, would have done a good show. I also understand that the producers had their own style and that there were a lot of hands in the soup. In their eternal pursuit of LCD programming, the network played a decisive role in the disappearance of this series. <br /> <br /> The least that these jerk-off could do was broadcast the episodes in order. <Br /> <br /> Be realistic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a serious loss for genre fans and casual viewers.
