This film was impressive. My first experience with a foreign film was neither too long nor too complex. I myself enjoyed the subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and his belated brother after a long separation seemed at first a clich√©, but it was very touching and realistic. There was also some subtle humor to not depress or annoy the audience.
