Very funny movie. Eddie Murphy's classic 80s fun movie. I saw when I was a kid and I have a good memory. Murphy's classic irony does not fail, the movie is funny, well played. Murphy in the 80s made many action movies that were a way for him to joke about anything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some, but the film from 1986 to date has changed. The atmosphere for a film from this era is good and the special effects are good for a movie of this period. A cool movie to see and enjoy enjoying the ironic taste of Murphy, a recently deceased actor. The last part consists of anthologies, the sympathetic actor who plays the role of the Tibetan monk. That's all.
