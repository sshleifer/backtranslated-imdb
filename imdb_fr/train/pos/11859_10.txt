On MTV cribs, all participants and shooters shoot the classic Scarface movie out of their DVD collection. This can give you an idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Of course, there are gangsters and monsters inside, but that's not Scarface's goal. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is only a Cuban refuge in search of a new way of life. He falls into the crowd group and becomes a well-known drug lord. Montana was everything to do what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Say hello to my boyfriend!" is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to my mind when I think of Brian DePalmas's film, Scarface. This is part of my top 10 favorite movies. I would say that *** 1/2 (on ****). Certainly a movie that you must see. PHENOMENAL.
