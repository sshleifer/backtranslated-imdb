This is the first film I saw from John Singleton and he is a very good director. The film begins with a group of freshmen and shows what happens to many of them. Omar Epps plays a star on the track with a partial scholarship and has trouble following his work. He is friends with Ice Cube and beings with Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is raped that day and befriends Jennifer Connelly, a lesbian, and who does not know how to go. Michael Rapaport is a child from Idaho who belongs to a group of neo-Nazis headed by Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them. This is a very good film and it is unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts in the film.
