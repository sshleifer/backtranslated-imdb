Although I was born in the year of the release of this film and had never heard of it until my first year of high school (1996), I became totally engrossed in laughter, crying and feeling to be with the characters because my friends and I were them. <br /> <br /> Their hair, clothes and speech were out of date, but the emotions and desperation of each situation were so familiar! I remember thinking how real it was and how much I wanted them to make movies like that. <br /> <br /> In fact, I saw this movie the night after a crazy party (not so different from this one). in Jay's house) that had been crushed by what we thought was the loser loser lying around our crowd. A type of world-class BS'er and "responsible" figure that I immediately identified with Jeanie (I was also the one with a car) although I had some insecurities from Madge floating there too. My best friend was Deidre and her childhood friend was our Annie. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene when Jeanie is at school or when she and her boyfriend separate and then she tells Madge how much she loved him as if she had conversations and personal situations. <br /> <br /> Now, at the age of 27, I recently reviewed the film and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching a piece from me. youth (although none of my friends died). I think it's a must for all girls 13 and older.
