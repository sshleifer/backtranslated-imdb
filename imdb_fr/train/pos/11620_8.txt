Super little thriller. I was expecting some kind of silly horror movie, but what I got is a tight short film that does not waste our time. Most of these films should be covered in the stories of previous characters so that we can feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start being killed. o such stupidity here. Yes, you see some characters but they only interact with the main ones. Like the motel's wife whose room was canceled. We saw them in order to assess the effectiveness of Lisa's character and the inefficiency of the new hotel clerk. We see the little girl simply because she will play a very small but important role later in the film when everything will be fine. The Atrendants of Flight because it is necessary in particular to advance the plot. The villain in particular needs her at the beginning of the flight. The rude guy at the airport was also important for the movie. The only two characters that were only 5 passengers and had no use for the plot were the two young guys on the plane. It was smart because I thought they would have something to do with the plot. From the first to the last scene, the woman is led by a young leader named Lisa. Even when Jackson shows her true colors, she does not panic. She thinks about what she can do to save time. Any other movie where smart women would be fools. But not this one. It was a very short movie and I was waiting for the usual plot features to come into play as the movie seemed to come to a quick conclusion. Fortunately, none of them have been used. The new hotel employee did not call as usual and did not tell him what to do: panic, let the phone fall and leave the hotel without saying anything, or ask your boss and tell him that she must drink too much and send her away. Was Craven should do more of these types of movies. Also a last comment. Brian Cox is in the movie but I had no idea who he was. I had to come here to see that he was Lisa's father. He is completely unrecognizable.
