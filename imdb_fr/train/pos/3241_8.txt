Action. The comedy. Suspense. This film has it all. <br /> <br /> The plot says that 4 professional thieves are invited to participate in a robbery in a small town in Montana. every type of archetypal crime movie character is here. Frank, the master spirit. Carlos, the weapons expert. Max, the explosives expert. Nick, the cracker and Ray, the driver. Unfortunately for Frank, he is apprehended by 2 buzzing detectives (very well interpreted by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck) who chase him from New Jersey and write after sending the letters to the 4 others. <br /> <br /> Our 4 characters meet at the station and, since the beginning, none of them are appreciated or trusted. Added to this is the fact that Frank is gone and they do not know why they called. <br /> <br /> Now, Frank is brought back to New Jersey by the 2 detectives, but soon escapes on foot and tries to get back to the guys who have all kinds of problems. <br /> <br /> Really a very good film loaded with laughter and good acting. Just a good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little different
