WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I am not at all a fan of contemporary Italian directors. Usually I do not like dramas. I'm not a super fan of Will Smith, even thinking that he is a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's such a good movie with such an original script, such a good direction and so well played ... wow ... it's beautiful. This film caught my attention minute by minute and I did not even like "The pursuit of happiness" (maybe also because I did not like the game of Will's son who is a very bad actor while the children all seem natural born actors, I also saw last night in "The day the earth stopped" and I confirmed my feeling that Jaden could not act). I do not want to write spoilers so I do not talk about the story, but what I can say is that this movie is about love, death and other feelings that I do not like to watch in movies .... but THIS FILM is really a great movie. If you have a minimum of heart, you will not regret it
