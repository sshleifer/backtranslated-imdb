The blood-shed house is the third in a series of seven horror anthologies Amicus. If THE MONSTER CLUB is part of the series, it would be eight movies. Although this film is very different from others. <br /> <br /> I consider Amicus anthologies with great memories, as I loved them when I was a teenager. My feelings for them today are just as strong. <br /> <br /> I spent many years trying to find this movie. The summaries of the stories were so appealing that I went as far as paying a substantial amount for that when I finally found a copy. As awesome as the movie was, I felt a sense of disappointment when I finally saw it. It was not as good as I thought. Although better than his two predecessors, he is far from being as good as his four successors, as I will show above. <br /> <br /> The resulting story sees John Bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house. His journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of former occupants. The story that binds him later sees him visiting the real estate agent who sold the house. Although this binding story seems appealing on paper, it is flat and lifeless in practice and is arguably the weakest of all Amicus anthologies. I could not help thinking that John Bennett was a version of the poor man of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry. I would have seen better one of the two actors above play its role. We could have had both here - one as a police inspector and another as a real estate agent. They could, and I think, made this weak element of the film much better. <br /> <br /> The film contains four stories, each featuring a resident of the house. <br /> <br /> The first story sees Denholm Elliott as a writer of crime stories. He is engrossed in an exciting story about a strangler, even going so far as to draw a sketch to help him write. Shortly after, he begins to see visions of his own creation. Peter Duffell's excellent direction, particularly with regard to the choice of camera angles, helps to attenuate the text retained. Elliott's performance is superb as a tormented writer and he also helps to enhance the story. The story ends with a half-turn but I could not help but get the meaning of a script that would not allow him to realize his potential. <br /> <br /> The second story sees Peter Cushing enter the house. He is a lonely man who is always looking for a beautiful young woman who once threw him and keeps a picture. Cushing's performance really gives life to this moving story. He is helped by the director who chooses to continue to take an interest in Cushing's loneliness. This is taken further with a big hallucination scene that helps us see inside Cushing's mind. Anyway, Cushing sees a figure in a nearby wax museum that looks like his daughter. Naturally, his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing turn in the end. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's rival, but his performance is largely overshadowed by the late Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third, easily recognizable story, sees Christopher Lee - my favorite horror actor of all time - moving into the house with his daughter. Mr. Lee gives here his perfect frozen performances. He shows no love or attention for his daughter at all. He even summons a school governess to educate him. The housekeeper, played by Nyree Dawn Porter in another of her great performances, tries to find out what's wrong. Without saying too much, I can reveal that witchcraft plays a role. The presence of Christopher Lee is really electrifying in all the scenes where he is. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as a little girl who is easily the most terrifying character of the entire film. The film is worth the detour even to see only this story. <br /> <br /> The last story is played almost entirely for laughter, but it's entertaining and that's what really matters. Jon Pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house. He is very unhappy with his film producers' approach, considering that everything is cheap and fake, especially costumes. He decides to buy an authentic coat for his latest vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon has an excellent reputation as a dealer who sells Pertwee an old coat. When Pertwee puts on the cloak, he starts to grow fangs and turns into a vampire. The performance of Pertwee must be seen to be believed. It's really hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is also part of this story, but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much more important. <br /> <br /> The connected story ends with a loose connection with the final story. This is particularly good because the inspector was looking for Pertwee and naturally decided to visit the house. The rest, you will be able to manage. As weak as the narrative that binds it, the film has a decent end, though somewhat unintentionally comical. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that the mistakes of what should have been a really beautiful film do not lie. with Peter Duffell, the director, who really does his best with what he has. I think the screenplay was too small and lacked the ambition that we find in the next four films. <br /> <br /> All in all, THE WHOLE BLOOD HOUSE, despite its flaws, is a must for fans of Amicus Anthologies, fans of other Amicus movies or horror film fans. If my resume gives the movie enough appeal to you, check it out. You will appreciate it!
