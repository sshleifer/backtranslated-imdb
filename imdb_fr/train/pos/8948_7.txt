This is the kind of film that, if it were made today, would feature Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; in fact, now that I think about it, it is likely to be redone one day. It's nice, but without any depth. He suffers from the almost fatal error of James Stewart in a role for which he is about 20 years old, and so there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs, in the secondary role of an aspiring writer, is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call "the spirit". (** 1/2)
