Now my friends, movies like "The Beast" can only be shot on the old continent :), in this movie we see all: the naughty sex, the nymphomaniac genre of the gorilla, no sensory dialogues, etc., etc., etc. etc. ... In serious terms, it is an allegory, that men can sometimes be brutish, visceral and brutal, Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It's an amazing cinematic experience, weird and full of grotesque scenes. I recommend this film to all fans of shocking European exploitation. If you like this film, I recommend: "Orloff against the invisible man" and "modified states".
