This is not a movie for fans of the strange Lynch. It's more for those who enjoy a good story or who are fed up with banal stories of overt sentimentalism and Oprah-ish "It's such a wonderful film! You must see it!" - semantics (although she is right, for once!). <br /> <br /> The story runs smoothly, and we're on a journey that I think most of us will eventually recognize. A compassionate and existentialist journey in which we correct our past as we approach our inevitable demise. <br /> <br /> Act without fail, cinematography also (sometimes very brilliant!), And the dialogue leaves just enough for the viewer to grasp the details of the story. <br /> <br /> A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental.
