Excellent film that reveals the way people are connected to ordinary and exchanged pearls that he takes for granted during Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a comment on globalization. In fact, he humanizes workers in China, the owner of the plant, the pearl distributor in New Orleans and even the party-goers in New Orleans. What stands out most is the director's ability to tell a complex story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way. His incredible access to the factory is another intriguing aspect and I just want to know how he came in. It's a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt, and the conclusion gives hope without letting people feel alienated.
