It was at 7:30 in the morning, too close to school to see very often. Animation and computer graphics were spectacular for the time. The idea of ​​cowboys and ordinary people casually throwing space vehicles and robots was incredible. Maybe that inspired Treasure Planet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the DVD format is really boring. The shows are all basically the same. When you watch non-sequential episodes on a DVD, disc # 3 will smash you. Compared to current standards, the animation is uneven. We no longer notice CGIs and we focus on how nerdy characters are. <br /> <br /> The bright spots are the characters of the heroine. They were much more believable, took themselves more seriously than modern heroines and were not tacky. They actually saved the men.
