Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the greatest directors in the world. This sensitive and visually beautiful film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures well the dark irony of this writer. John Turturro gives what I consider to be his best performance (I'm not usually a fan of him); and Emily Watson is also brilliant. It's worth the detour.
