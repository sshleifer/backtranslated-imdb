An exceptionally straight actor played by a casting and filmed by a director who has obviously taken the film seriously. Pristine, as you would expect from a film shot clearly with a tight budget, but the drama is involving - it's one of those movies that when repeated ad nauseum on Cinemax 2 or Plus Max or no matter what they call it, you end up watching 40-minute blocks when you're supposed to go to work. Along W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault", reminding that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low-budget compatriots, who has a real ability to frame a genre film . when he's really interested in the subject (that is, he does not watch his Shannon Tweed movies with a 3 or 4 after the title!) actors who have had too little to do recently ( Mancuso, Ford, or even Gary Sandy) for chrissakes) have really put all their roles in their best roles for years - as for Grieco, he has the right look, although his acting is a bit monotonous - he's clear that his character is supposed to self-destruct from end to end the film, but Grieco does not transmit it completely. I checked on IMDB and I see that the author also wrote "Sorority House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" for the director - two minor classics in their own rights, but obviously "stupid" as in Roger's cinema Cormon - this one looks more like Some of the best images of Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan of the 70s - giving you the element of exploitation while offering dramas at the same time - constitute a real step forward. It's not "Citizen Kane" and the last moments of the comics are a little disturbing, but it's a well-written, above-average, character-driven and character-driven actor. Do not neglect small achievements like this, which is quite rare (as I was reminded while I was trying to attend a monstrosity of Albert Pyun called "Heatseeker" the other night - this material Low budget is not as simple as it sounds - but that's another story!)
