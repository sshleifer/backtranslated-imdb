First of all, I want to say that I wanted to see this movie for about a year now, because I knew that Angelina Jolie was there and that I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the film. Anyway, no video store has won, but down and the local library has done it. I watched it and I really loved it. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes but it was well done and funny. It did not degrade in any way. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress has done a remarkable job. I laughed a lot to sexual humor. All in all, I think this movie is worth visiting if you can find it. It is adorable and just fun to watch. I rarely classify movies as 10, but I give this one a 10 !!! <br /> <br /> Go get it and look at it!
