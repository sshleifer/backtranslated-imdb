The adaptation of Alice Walkers' popular novel by Steven Speilberg is not without controversy. On their first outing, members of the black community criticized the treatment of black men, while others wondered why a white man was directing the film on black women. <br /> <br /> Here is the story of a young black woman named Celie, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century. She has two children of her violent father who are ripped off at birth. His only comfort in his miserable life comes from his sister. <br /> <br /> CÃ©lie (later played by newcomer Whoopie Goldberg) is married to a violent husband (Danny Glover). The husband is humiliated by the sister and she is quickly removed from Celie's life. <br /> <br /> The story is often heartbreaking, as Celie continues to hope she can one day find her sister and her children. Throughout her life, she has met various characters, including Sophia, wife of her son-in-law, and Shug, a strong and pulpy salon singer, who teaches her something about love. <br /> The management of Speilberg is omnipresent in this image, which offers brilliant cinematography and breathtaking performances. I challenge you to watch this movie and not be moved! The Color Purple film captures the essence of what is a complicated story. Although it tends to minimize lesbian aspects and African history, both of which were so vivid in the book, the film remains true to its themes, allowing Alice Walker's voice to shine through. <br /> <br /> I could not begin to answer the controversy surrounding this film. Let's just say it's one of the few movies I can watch over and over and that has left me an indelible mark. <br /> <br />
