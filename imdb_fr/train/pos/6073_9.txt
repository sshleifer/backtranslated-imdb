My university professor says that Othello is perhaps Shakespeare's best drama. I do not know if I still agree with him. I bought this video version of the movie. First I like Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. Curiously, he did not direct but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare as well as British actors. not that there is a British problem against the American. In fact, if we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the masses he deserves. In addition to Shakespeare's other tragedies, the problem of race is dealt with. Something that has existed since the dawn of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and show the complexity of their union. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak in jealousy and fears losing it to the benefit of a non-Moor like Cassio. It's a very good scene at the end of the film but I will not reveal the end. It's just worth watching. I think they edited a lot of the lines at 2 o'clock, but they still edited Shakespeare.
