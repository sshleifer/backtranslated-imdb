Originally, I rented this movie for my daughter because she loved football - and I was not disappointed that way (except that the plot interfered with the football scenes). As a father, I guess I was a little surprised by the introduction of the subject of lesbianism - but I must admit that as a parent, these problems are completely accessible to children nowadays (as uncomfortable as I feel with the subject). In a way, this emotion was a fundamental part of the film: at a certain age, you have to trust your children to make their own choices. This dilemma is introduced by a UK-born teenager - Jasminder (Jess) - of Indian descent, who dreams of playing professional football. The impending marriage of her older sister to a traditional Hindu wedding offers her many opportunities to explore (with kindness) her hopes and fears for her future. <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration with her parents' expectations of her - again, basically, most parent-child relationships. <br /> <br /> In summary, the football scenes are LARGE (a lot to learn in slowmo) and although I do not need the plot, it needed something to advance the film.
