Probably the first Portuguese movie I saw in my life and I enjoyed it. The plot tells how young army officers came to power in Portugal in 1974, eventually defeating the fascist government of Caetano and ending the wars in the colonies, namely Mozambique, Angola and Guinea ( Bissau) - Cape Verde. Most of the events presented in the film accurately reflect the behavior of army officers and soldiers during the coup, the oppressed people, very happy about this new development and the freedom, the resistance of the men of the Caetano and a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as new president. We remember the Portuguese revolution because of the action of several young officers, but for me, the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain declared that Portugal should develop democratically, and that's what the country realized a few years after this blow. or revolution. The film also shows that army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone. even the most serious enemies were respected in the end.
