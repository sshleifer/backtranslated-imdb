I saw this on TV so long ago that I can not remember when, but it remains one of the scariest and most annoying movies I have ever seen. There is a subtle but intense fear induced by the woman in black hiding at the edge of the frame, not clearly visible, so that you feel (like the hero of the notary), uncertain whether it is just imagination or not. It's also one of the few movies that really made me worry about continuing to watch. "The values ​​of production" are suspended, the good films concern the director's ability to create an atmosphere with the help of films, actors, places / scenery, music, attention to detail and .. of imagination. A real gem.
