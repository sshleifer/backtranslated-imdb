At first, I thought that the main character of a TV show could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought I'd try it. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and I wait on Wednesday night to watch it, then the next week, I watch it a few more times on my DVR. Colorful characters, witty jokes, quick dialogues and unique new situations attract and captivate me from beginning to end. The relationship between Ned and Chuck Charles is interesting to watch as they work their self esteem on the fact that they can not have physical contact. Even Detective Emerson Cod's character has continued to grow in complexity. And Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She makes me crack! The narrator's voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography makes me feel like watching a movie rather than a TV show. I have recommended to my family and friends to activate "Pushing Daisies" and they are hung too !!! The show is good to wait a week for a new episode and if you have not seen "P.D.", I highly recommend you watch it!
