An unusual film by Ringo Lam, strangely underrated. The mix of imaginary kung fu with a more realistic representation of swords and spears passing through bodies is striking, especially during the first ten minutes. A rider is cut in half and his size and legs continue to ride on the horse. Several horses are chopped. It is very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a crazy maniac general and imprisoned in the Red Lotus temple, which seems to be more of a torture chamber than a temple. The general has a similarity to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now as he vomits distorted philosophy and makes scary paintings with human blood. <br /> <br /> The production is very impressive and the setting is dark. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and especially consistent unlike many scenes of HK action of the time. Sometimes the movie becomes nonsense or the effects are ridiculous, but it's never serious enough to ruin the movie. <br /> <br /> Find this one, this is one of the best kung fu HK movies of the early 90s. Remember that this is not suitable for children.
