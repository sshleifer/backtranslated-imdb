Film very well done. It stays in your memory. It is better to speak of romance than to steal or to make war, even if the flying parts are realistic and almost without error. Fans like me will enjoy this movie even if they are attracted to planes, unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love. <br /> <br /> Have fun watching Crowe early. He is good and breathes charm. His reading of "High Flight" is superb. <br /> <br /> Bravo, Boom
