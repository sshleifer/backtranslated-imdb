The movie can be great. I watched it last night, but I feel unable to give an honest opinion because I read the book first. The book is so much better than the movie that the movie disappointed me. If you plan to watch "Of Human Bondage", do not read the book in advance. On the other hand, the book is so good and contains so much more than Phillip's love story with Mildred, you can still enjoy it after watching the movie. I do not make this request lightly. I read an average book every four days and read authors as disparate as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" gets my vote as one of the top ten novels ever written.
