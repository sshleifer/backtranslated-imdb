I had heard that the movie was good from many of my friends who had seen it, and they all said it was amazing, so I had very high expectations - and Nancy Drew went over expectations! There were funny roles, it entertained me with the action and all the guys trying to kill her, and Emma Roberts was amazing as Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was very good too. I would definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why these guys were trying to kill us ?!" Corky: "Yeah, I was wondering that too, actually it scares me a lot!" <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I hate when people try to kill me, it's so rude!" <br /> Nancy Drew
