This movie was meant to be better than the average action movie and in that respect they were successful. This film had a spectacular cinematography with spectacular snow and mountain heights, a very good Stallone condition also offering a good performance, a fascinating plot and an excellent The film does not rank as a great player of all time, because his screen is weak. The plot and the story claim that this movie makes Stallone a very special human, much like the characters in the movie Rambo or Rocky or Bond.They chose to humanize the character of Stallone in this one that fits but saw the style of the plot weakens the excitement factor.In addition, the dialogue was cheesy and sometimes condescending.The scenario should have been more realistic and less "talkative". Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes. The filmmakers should have been more attentive to the way in which they had managed the blows and misses. They should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the hijacking of the aircraft at the beginning of the film. Instead, they decided to dilute a lot of filming sequences (TV series "A-Team") as soon as the bad guys set foot on the film. This movie had a lot of potential all the time. Stallone's Rambo / Rocky action sequences, better dialogue and more emotions / style determination would have taken this film to a higher level. I know it's not Stallone's fault. the director of the film wanted to calm down the character of Stallone and try to steal the film by attributing to him the merit of his staging which was not so great if it was not for his director of photography. A good movie however ........
