"Read My Lips" tells a strange symbiosis that develops between a socially clumsy ordinary office worker (Devos) and his trainee in the workplace, a crude exconne (Casel). As the film unfolds this unlikely duo, they mingle in a frightening fusion of minds, each using the other for his own reasons, with extraordinary results. Good for anyone who loves movies directed by characters with strong psycho-dramatic currents. In French with easy to read subtitles and good translation. (B +)
