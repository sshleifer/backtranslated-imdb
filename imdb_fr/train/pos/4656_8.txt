Peter Ustinov embodies a career hijacking on a London-based American conglomerate. He is encouraged by the fox (and falsely misleading) Maggie Smith and threatened to be exposed by the jealous Bob Newhart. It's a heist film with a lot of brains. Ustinov is exceptional, just as Smith and Newhart are quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, as the "Executive Vice President" pill. Malden has rarely been so loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in funny cameos. The excellent score is by Laurie Johnson. The management of Eric Till is bright and the scenario of Ustinov and Ira Wallach is first class and very intelligent. A good moment of swing!
