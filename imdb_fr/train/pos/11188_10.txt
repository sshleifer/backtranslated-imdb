I am a big fan of Stephen King's work and this movie has made me an even bigger fan of King. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They have just moved into a new home and seem happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind their house. Jud, Creed's new neighbor (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the burial site behind the Pet Cemetery. This cemetery is pure evil. Jud told Louis Creed that when you bury a human being (or a pet) in the cemetery, he would come back to life. The only problem is that when they come back, they are NOT the same person, they are perverse. Shortly after Jud explains everything about Sematary Pet, everything starts going to hell. I will not explain any more because I do not want to reveal some of the main parts of the film. Pet Sematary's role was pretty good, but needed a bit of work. The story was one of the main pieces of this film, mainly because it was original and captivating. This film contains many makeup effects that make the movie more weird and scary. One of the most fundamental reasons why this film made me shiver my back was actually the effects of makeup. There is a character in this movie that is really weird. This character is "Zelda". This particular character appears in the film about three times to be precise. Zelda is the sister of Rachel Creed who died years ago, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the film is usually not afraid, because she does not speak or anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time scares me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film, it is almost perfect. Pet Sematary offers great scares, good performance, first-rate intrigue and hypnotic makeup. It's really one of the most favorite horror movies of all time. 10 of 10.
