Nicely and cleverly played by the two girls, Mischa Barton in the role of Frankie and Ingrid Uribe in the role of Hazel, although the plot rather defies the imagination. To be honest, the young Hazel seems to be out of place. <br /> <br /> Although the acting is well played by all actors, the film generally lacks a real dramatic atmosphere. We may have learned to expect a cruel reality in movies, a bit like comparing Pollyanna to How Green Was My Valley! Regardless, each of them is good in his own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright even if her role is somewhat moderate here. An entertainment in the middle of the road that is well suited to young viewers, and what a pleasure to be sometimes exposed to refined classical music, which is almost a rarity! <br /> <br /> I find this film a welcome change because it reflects more silently, thoughtful values ​​for years of growth, and no violence, thank goodness. A warm family film to enjoy.
