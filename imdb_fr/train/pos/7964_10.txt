It surprises me how much I love this movie despite the fact that I do not really like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche do a great job with the voices of Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the game of animals is amazing. <br /> <br /> I've already seen this movie 72 times (I know it sounds scary, but it's true!), and every time the final scenes touch me again. I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. This is indeed my favorite movie of all time!
