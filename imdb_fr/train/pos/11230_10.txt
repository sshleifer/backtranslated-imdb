Several news agencies have talked about Hidden Frontier and reported on their long-standing commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and providing an example of the unity that was Gene Roddenberry's mission. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war and acceptance of different races is equal to or greater than that of other Trek series and movies. The value of production started out being smaller and unstable, but over the course of the seven production seasons, the acting game has improved, the stories are more complex and the visual graphics have become smoother and more impressive. In Season 6, Episode 1, Countermeasures, there's one of the biggest space battles in Trek history. The ships are well made and the space battles are impressive and exciting. The real attraction of Frontier is not in the ships or the backgrounds, but in the people, the interaction and the growth of the characters. There are also nods for other Trek series and movies with places and characters we all know. I recommend to all fans of Trek to check Countermeasures and you will be addicted!
