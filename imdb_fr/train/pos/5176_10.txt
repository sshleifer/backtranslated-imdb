A must-see movie for anyone who has already been to the camp or who wanted to do it. This film captures the absolute essence of what is the summer camp. It's funny, it's a compassion that makes you want to take a closer look at the characters once the credits begin to play. If you have not seen this movie, what are you doing? get off and start the video store. Have a good summer :)
