I did not expect much from this film, but I was very pleasantly surprised because it is light, fun and very well observed. The central trio of bad weather bikers was surprisingly friendly as they stumbled and followed their path during their drug-centric trip to Wales. The humor was sweet and subtle, as were the three characters (their benevolent treatment of the little old shopkeeper). The atmospheres of rural Wales were perfectly captured and the soundtrack was very well chosen. Intelligently and carefully written, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic portrait of alternative culture - I felt that I was with them. Very light in touch and fun - it's not what you'd expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. A delight on all fronts and hard to criticize, even though I thought the last two scenes were a bit lame - the film should have ended when they left Wales. But all in all, an unexpected treasure of a movie.
