I think Sarafina is a huge effort by Whoopi Goldberg. Besides her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than that of the main character, Sarafina. Since I've been working in a high school with kids from cities, I think it's an important film to show the history of apartheid in South Africa. Sarafina is a film about a teacher's education and relationship with her student, Sarafina. I bought the video for virtually nothing in a video store. I watched it and quickly transmitted through the musical numbers. But I highly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand. Now, although I do not know the other actors and actresses of the film, I guess they are very popular in South Africa and I'm glad they were shot with a South African cast, with the exception of Goldberg in a small role But if it brings people to see this movie, then Whoopi will have a global appeal.
