I'm not sure I understand what all these people with resentful grudges are talking about enthusiastically. It may just be that some people like to blame. <br /> <br /> The film was certainly imperfect may have had difficulties with time changes, actors too willing to go to places I really prefer not to go, etc.) but in my humble opinion, some things outweighed the imperfections. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, I loved the little "breaking the rules". Normally, when you leave the haunted house, the bad guys leave you alone, leaving you time to regroup, make friends, and find the mysterious paranormal symbolic type. NORMALLY (semi-spoiler alert), when you hide under the covers, they can only help you through this small opening as you take a look. NORMALLY in the end, the ghosts became less scary because you discovered that they were simply misunderstood, or that they had been released, or whatever. <br /> <br /> Second, the production was exceptional. While the film was not really loaded with special effects, the supernatural parts, though brief, were extremely well done. <br /> <br /> This is probably not the best kind of movie for those who think that Freddy and Jason are the ultimate kind against, they have their place), but fine for those who have started taking them. conventions for granted and that do not have problems with time distortions.
