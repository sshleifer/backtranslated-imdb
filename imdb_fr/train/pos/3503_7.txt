If you still remember this summer where you had your first kiss, your first boyfriend / girlfriend, or your first love for a puppy ... this movie is for you! OK, so this movie would win and never win an Oscar BUT as a Dominican, I loved ... there are things in the movie that you might miss if you're not part of the culture ... the kids raised by a grandmother who is both father and mother, the youngest son being rocked and bathed with a box of coffee Bustelo (sooo Dominican!), Judy harassed by the men of the neighborhood, going to the church and lighting a candle of prayer ... the brilliance of the film was in these small details. Admittedly, it was not an outing of all cinematographic extravagances, but it was not supposed to be NOR, it was rather an educational tool for those who wanted to know more about the Latin culture (trick: do you new friends). More than a faux-bitter, a false documentation, this film has kept realism without taking itself too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien", it was simply the story of a boy's transition to adulthood. I recommend it (especially if eres Dominicano!) = O)
