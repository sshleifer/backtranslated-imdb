Great actors, an Oscar-nominated actress, breathtaking scenery, a good story and more laughter than you can fit in my new handbag (and it's pretty big). This film was brilliant. It was very well played in the most serious scenes and funny moments. . well, side slot. I have never heard such a funny movie audience and tears running down my cheeks during the "Ladies in the Tea Shop" scene. Congratulations to the British film industry and Craig Ferguson, whose magical ingredients made this film one of my favorite movies of the year, if not all.
