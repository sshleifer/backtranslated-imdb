The only complaint I can make about this adaptation is that she is sexed. The things that have only been mentioned in the novel are shown on the screen for a strange reason. Did they think the public would be too stupid to understand if they did not show everything outside? Other than that, it's very good quality. All the actors do a wonderful job to bring their characters to life. For shallow women, it's worth looking at at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing in the world. If I were Helen, I would have conveniently forgotten that I was still married the minute I saw her ... <br /> <br /> A kind of spoiler - The final scene is a funny turnaround of what happened in the book.
