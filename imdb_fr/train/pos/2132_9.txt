The cast really helps to make this surprise a pleasant surprise and a step ahead of the Hollywood romance / comedy lover opposite Hollywood, man to woman, all the time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not usually prefer this type of film and this tedious scenario, but this one was refreshing, fun to watch and overflowing with charm. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan each play their other role well and make a very nice couple. The support cast is outstanding - from always the friendly Felix Bressart to the wicked Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters of his career. He takes the film and transforms it into a completely different atmosphere for a moment when something dramatic happens to him. This "twist" is another reason why the film goes over other films of the same type. <br /> <br /> Once again, when a movie has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is an excellent example of this. In this film, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's done well. I'll take this on the redo "You have a mail", any day. No comparison.
