Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been dropped by his wife because he is one of the most annoying and neurotic people in the world. Suicide escapes him, but he just can not make it work, so he goes to his friends. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) has also just divorced and live in a bachelor's paradise. Smoking, playing, tackling chicks, going to a restaurant and never cleaning is a paradise for him. Well, with the suicide attempts, Oscar decides to let Felix move in. At first, it's a match of paradise, Felix cooks and does the housework and helps Oscar pay his alimony on time, but Oscar soon launches for the women and Felix (who today's world would probably be gay ) is not ready to move forward. They invite two British birds to their home and they find Felix so tender that soon they cry and talk about his family life, leaving Oscar denied. That's it, it explodes and throws it out, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as he looks, and he soon gets the better of it. My favorite quote "You leave me little notes on my pillow, I told you 158 times that I could not stand the small notes on my pillow." We are all short of cornflakes. F.U. "It took me three hours to understand that F.U was Felix Ungar!" Based on a play by Neil Simon (who also wrote the script), he has a certain theatrical feel. Set and the repartee and looks pretty like a game (for better or for worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comic chemistry and have appeared in the Grumpier Old Men and Out to Sea movies, taking on the same capricious / slob roles, but with different names (to avoid royalty issues, I'm sure). <br /> This film is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. The chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberry is tart, juicy and bright red (unless you get these naughty greenish). They are almost opposite, but together the contrasts stand out and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
