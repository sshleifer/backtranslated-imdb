Unlike the summaries of some people, the women represented in the film are not geisha. They are prostitutes living outside the most famous recreational areas, and their lives and experiences are those of many women of the Tokugawa era. I can not say that the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm lies in their typical character. The themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I really liked the artistic direction and the acting. I felt like I had a glimpse of a moment and a place that I could never see otherwise. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main role, were thrilled to see. I would recommend this film only to those who want to taste Japanese culture or those who love quiet and emotional stories. This is an excellent example of both.
