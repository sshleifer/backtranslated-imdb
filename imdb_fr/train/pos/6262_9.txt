It was incredible, it meant it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would make this amazing migration twice a year and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, did not stage certain scenes and shots. But what blows they are! Cinematography, in essentially extreme conditions, is brilliant and the Iranian music score added to the video output gives this memorable documentary an additional richness. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing this and "Kon Tiki". the same weekend, it was a thrill and certainly made me understand how hard and brave people can be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science.
