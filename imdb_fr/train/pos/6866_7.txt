************** Possible spoilers ********** There's only one reason I saw this movie and it's because I have a huge crush on Richard Belzer. I do not really know what humor is). Some parts were funny, like Barbie and Ken Spoof, the croupiers and the skit of the president. Note that this is sometimes torrid (Dare, I say brutal?) It was sometimes funny, but it could have been better. Probably if they had spent more time in humor and less time undressing women, the movie would have been funnier. Some sketches make you want to gag and cringe, others make you laugh and, strangely enough, to think. Unfortunately, this film is dated. If you have a crazy crush on Richard Belzer (it's worth it), it's worth checking out and seeing Chevy Chase.
