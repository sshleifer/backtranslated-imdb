In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis appeared on a Too Young To Die TV show where they both played about the same kind of roles they play in Kalifornia. I'm sure that's what led to their casting in this film on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia finds budding writer David Duchovny and his girlfriend, art photographer Michelle Forbes, in a stormy relationship because of Duchovny's obsession with writing a book and penetrate into the mind and soul of serial killers. In fact, he has planned a most unusual odyssey: he wants to cross the country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers. But he and Forbes are completely broke. <br /> <br /> Destiny comes in more than one financial way with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, two strange types from the south of the country who agree to share the cost of gasoline on this country All Terrain. trip. It turns out that Pitt is himself a serial killer and he decides to do a little research alone, immersing himself in the mind of someone who is fascinated by amorality. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia is not the type of movie I'm used to living. go, but in fact, Brad Pitt's acting ability and charisma make him work to a large extent. Pitt is the traveling definition of a Gothic refugee from Deliverance. But better than him is Juliette Lewis who once again plays these types of low self-esteem that she seems to be doing well. Watch his scene with Forbes comb his hair and Lewis describes his sad and pathetic life. Lewis 'dialogue and Forbes' reactions should be highlighted in the drama classes of the country. <br /> <br /> For those who love their slasher movies, they are no better than Kalifornia.
