Yesterday afternoon, after leaving the cinema, the public had not lost the eye in front of the public after seeing this gem of a movie in a packed house at the Hamburg Film Festival this year. And the tears shed were all laughing. This film was hilarious, there is no other way to say it. There was no boredom in it, I laughed and with me all the others, three hundred passionate about French cinema. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat was absolutely great. A great clown if needed and serious if the situation requires it. The performance was of course completely exaggerated, but that was exactly what the story needed and what made it so effective. Charlotte Gainsbourg, whom I love to see too, was just as great. The mother was also very successful. The sisters could have been a bit more detailed in terms of scenario, but other than that, there is nothing wrong. I had a great afternoon watching this film as Hamburg drowned in the rain, and I would like films like this from France to get a regular release in Germany. But distributors are this country do not seem to understand that the French make good movies. At least, I can not wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?), Because I need this film at home to be able to watch several times!
