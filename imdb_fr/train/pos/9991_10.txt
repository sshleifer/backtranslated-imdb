I thought this movie was hysterical. I have watched it several times and highly recommend it. Mel Brooks was excellent. The cast was fantastic..I do not understand how this movie gets a rating of 2 out of 5. I loved it. I saw other movies of his and they were also funny, but this one really trots me in the head because of the humor .. Its, I can not say enough about this film. I search for it periodically but never enough for me. People who played homeless people were also compared to the funniest standards. Please put this movie more often. I do not see it enough .. Leslie Ann Warren was also one of my favorites since Cinderella. I always thought she was not really funny but she loved to play it. In this movie she was very funny..and she and Mel did a great job together. They should put more of his movies on TV.
