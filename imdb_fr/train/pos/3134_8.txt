It was a well written account of the Making of the Batman Sitcom that brought our heroes together on a grand quest and told them the story of their TV shows. Unlike the Brady and Partridge family of documentary films, not only do we take a look at Adam and Burt's past and present life, but we also see them returning to action. Filled with Kapow's and catwomen and Riddler (s), Batman is back in a well-told story, which tells not only the satisfying closing of the Batman series, but also the modern fan of all the Hollywood legends who tell about them that this hero was heard in 35 years. <br /> <br /> Bravo !!!
