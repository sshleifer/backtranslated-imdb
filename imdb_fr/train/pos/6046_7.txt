I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Let's face it; the premise does not seem particularly appealing when you have to give money back for a movie of the night, but it had an easy-going nature that prevails. I did not find any time when I was angry, and I doubt that I remember the next day, but that does not fail. What I found funny is to watch him here in Beijing with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands what I like. I told him there was a plot: three guys have to bring some grass to London. Not really satisfying for her. There is no shoplifting for the camera, which I expected after reading a number of comments. I take exception, however, to comparisons with Withnail and myself; not in the same league, and I doubt that it was planned. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
