Losing friends and alienating people is a decent comedy with a romantic touch. <br /> <br /> It's actually a story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) who stands out in the field of writing journalists and magazines and is interpreted in a funny way. Simon Pegg made a decent appearance, slightly worse than normal. The film is neither hilarious nor funny, but it has its moments, and these moments are really hilarious. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and worthy movie to be watched with an English cream comedy to anyone who I just want to sit back, relax and enjoy the movie for what it is . If you are about to watch this movie with a critical approach, you should move on if you do not want to be disappointed and start throwing it to the trash.
