Yeah, that's it. In fact, it's somewhere in my top 20 favorite movies of all time. Number 15, I think. Anyway, I'm not usually a fan of intrigues, but I think intrigues work best in anime and RPG video games (eg Final Fantasy 7) and not in movies. But this one has everything. Bright drawings of planets, stars, an extremely well written scenario. Although it's not really for children, they can still watch it, it does not contain graphic blood, gut and silicone. But I do not think they will understand it.
