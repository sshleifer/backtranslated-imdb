Scanners II: The new order is just as good as the classic scans of David Cronenberg, Scanners from 1980 and Scanners II in 1991, which represents an eleven-year gap between the two films. The film captures the style of the scanners, which is a good thing. It would not be scanners without an explosion of the head. Scanners II therefore proposes a scene of explosion of the head as horrible as the first. Scanners II: The New Order has other imaginative and bloody scenes well done. The Scanners II: The New Order intrigue is a new interpretation of the series, which uses Scanners as a surveillance force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young Scanner named David Kellum discovers that he is used to avenge himself. <br /> <br /> Scanners II: The New Order is a fantastic sequel to David Cronenberg's classic sci-fi scans and should be seen. Look at this. 10/10
