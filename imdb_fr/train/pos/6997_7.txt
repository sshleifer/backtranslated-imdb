One thing is certain ... you should not watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a character who must live with a sin that he can not handle. The story is transmitted to you drip rather than the usual simplified explanation, so you always wonder what's going on. Finally, the points are gathered and the performances make sense. All the characters were OK and Wil Smith had another good day at the office. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that many moral questions arise, but if you simply accept to accept his suffering, it is easier. accept what he chose to do. Whether you agree or not is irrelevant. The trip you are traveling in is quite interesting, not to mention overwhelming. <br /> <br /> A good movie that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. I would recommend this movie if you like the type where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights.
