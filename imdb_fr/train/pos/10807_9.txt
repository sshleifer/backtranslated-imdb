I just saw this movie and fell in love with it. There is a little something for everyone, and it's a free for all when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil. When they are on the beach, I almost cried ... there is the tacit awareness that time is the most precious good and that it is most obvious when they are together. This idea taken from several angles, from marriage to siblings through the discovery of love in the least conventional places. The film makes you almost impatient to experience that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow may be your last. Crowe was particularly wonderful in his role as Lachlan. I always had a thing for the accent, but I almost melted with his portrait of his character. The way this film was shot is also beautiful, with music, outdoor fields and a superb RPG. All in all, it's a wonderful film that draws attention to human emotions.
