Aim√© Joan. Good performance. What does not make it good? I watched this movie, then Jane Eyre right after ... it keeps getting better. My heart was pounding. Super old movie drama. Just what I want from a classic movie. The facial expressions are worth the whole movie. I'm happy to have it on video. I do not know what you need more in a movie. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... avarice ..... murder .... detectives ...... trial ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes are very beautiful. I wonder what was the budget for this movie? If only they were still making movies like that. Whenever they try, they just seem to make a nerdy movie. Black and white movies still keep some mystery.
