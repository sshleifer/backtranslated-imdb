The inspiring story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky, then joined the US Navy, aspiring to become the first Black Master Diver in Navy history . We are shown the series of struggles since childhood that Brashear must overcome to realize his dream (and then to keep him alive.) Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the head coach of the diving school that the navy sends to Brashear, who is not particularly sensitive to Brashear's goals, but ends up becoming an unlikely friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie; Fast paced and with a lot of action, although it is not an image "action" in the normal sense of the term. There is a very human story here too, and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to conquer it; There is also an idea of ​​the struggle that took place in the 1960s between older and younger naval officers (the "old navy" versus the "new navy"). The performances are pretty good, especially the Goodings. I thought DeNiro was perhaps a little exaggerated in his Sunday portrait (though, who knows, Sunday might have been that kind of extreme cowardly cannon) and the portrait of Sunday's wife, Gwen (of Charlize Theron ) also made me wonder if these parts were "jazzed" to provide entertainment value. <br /> <br /> A good movie, though. I never wondered if it was worth it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
