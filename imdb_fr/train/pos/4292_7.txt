I did not know anything about the movie before I looked and I think it was the "no wait" factor that helped me endure at first and then pleased what I thought more than I expected. The setting was interesting, strange. but interesting. The scenario had gaps / jumps that, I think, bother the audience a bit. There is no big soundtrack in the background, creating a "romantic" mood. BUT they did not matter. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply exquisite. There was an unexplainable strange chemistry that I could not resist; I fell in love with it and here I am writing this review. The subtle love of the two actors was superb, and I think that's the heart of this film. <br /> <br /> This film is not an everyday romantic comedy; In fact, we will not appreciate it all. I had to sit down for a while and then slowly began to understand the little things that I did not understand at first. I can not guarantee that everyone will like it, but I hope you will like it.
