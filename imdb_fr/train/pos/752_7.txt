In the suburbs of Los Angeles, four teenagers have all sorts of problems: parties, drugs, policemen, mixed policemen, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, somehow the mother of the pack, tries to keep everyone together as a "family" (like the family unit she never had), and the sad heart of the film is that she does not can not. Slowly, everyone grows up and leaves. This precise point of alignment, although underlined in the whole, is unfortunately altered. Did we really need a long sequence with Scott Baio overhanging a car stuffed with thugs on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence - also with Baio - where Foster has a strange monologue on the "pain of illusion". Part of the dialogue is in fact frankly buckled, and I did not care about a late editing in the film that awkwardly passes from a death to a wedding. But these are just low shots in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a close bond. And Jodie's face in the end speaks volumes. If the viewers are really stifled at the end, the film deserved it. He does not cry for tears and does not ask for sympathy. This shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand. *** of ****
