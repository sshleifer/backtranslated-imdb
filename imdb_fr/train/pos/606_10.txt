I have seen a lot of Saura films and I have always found it amazing to see how he combines music, dance, theater and big cinema in his films. Iberia shows an even better Saura, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that caught my attention is the fact that in this film, the dancers and the musicians, the dance and the music, are just as important: the camera shows various aspects of the interpretation of the music, examining not only technical problems, but also an emotional experience. Saura's interest in the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is another ingredient that makes this film the most aesthetically exciting among his other works. That's why I highly recommend it to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance and great art.
