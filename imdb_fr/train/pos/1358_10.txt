Season after season, the players or characters in this series seem to be people you absolutely love to hate. Was this show designed or were they chosen for the same thing? Each episode denigrates a particular person and ends up being killed. You like to see them get caught, although it's totally wrong and sick. You like to see them kiss each other, get fucked, play dirty, get it back, escape and finally get kicked out by Trump. The amount of tears also seems to increase with the season. <br /> <br /> Rewards that try to compensate for past humiliation and suffering are also greatly reduced. In the new seasons, it's like "you're going to meet xyx who will tell you things about uvw" ... who cares about panic? The characters are so hateful, collectively and individually, that you wonder if they are paid actors? The only sane who wins wins. <br /> <br /> Take care with your guard and keep your conscience. These are your human brothers in the line of fire.
