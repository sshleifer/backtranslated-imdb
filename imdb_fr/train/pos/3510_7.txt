Real movie fans will love this authentic movie. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolls who give this movie a star and call it unrealistic. Although I have neither the past nor the environment of the protagonists, I spent many years working in low-income neighborhoods and I feel that the acting was very real and representative of the adolescent behavior. I do not know what the comments of others are based on to say that the film is "unrealistic". The dialogue is excellent. <br /> <br /> The value of low-budget production did not bother me at all. I felt that natural lighting enhanced the character of the film. The focus was entirely on the plot and development of the character, not on a spark or a Hollywood melodrama. <br /> <br /> I completely integrated the motivations and reactions of the character. The acting game was credible and impressive for both new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​a good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, then ignore it. If you like character-driven dramas, watch them. <br /> <br /> (Regarding the negative comments that are "trolls": click on their name and you will see that most have no other criticism or negative opinions.)
