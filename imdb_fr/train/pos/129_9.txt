With a superb cinematography and a thread of Kafkaesque absurdity, this film pulled me from the opening scene, simple but fascinating. The film plays a lot like a dream, and I think that might explain why people hate it or worship it. The characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is light and perhaps a little useless. But these are failures of the film but conscious choices. The film does not attempt to function as a story, but rather a deconstruction of 1940s war films. <br /> <br /> I would have a hard time saying that the film had a lot of real substance, but the film is a cinematic wonder that completely swept me away. It's one of the most beautifully filmed films of all time, and its style is overflowing. I can perfectly understand why people would hate it, but I give it 9/10.
