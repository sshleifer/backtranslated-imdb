The combination of the beautiful black-and-white photography and the "Eugene Onegin with an Twist" plot made it a real coup de grace for me. The atmosphere created by the generally very dark shots contrasting with occasional bright overexposed whites was striking. There was a wonderful moment when transparencies - seemingly conventional holiday shots, but the faces of the actors revealed the character and the situation in a subtle but instantaneous way - were presented, accompanied by the heartbreaking opera of Lensky's opera. Tschaikowsky Eugene Onegin. <br /> /> For me, the quality of a good film is that it takes advantage of the opportunities offered by this medium, which means that the story is often less important than the images and the atmosphere - The year last in Marienbad is a good example of such a movie. Krisana is in the same mold.
