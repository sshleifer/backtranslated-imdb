previewed - awesome movie - wonderful characterizations - witty and intelligent dialogues - the actors were fantastic - Peter Falk will be leaving for an Oscar - Paul Reiser was charming - the photography was wonderful Reiser was at the theater told a story striking of the film making; his dream was to create a semi-autobiographical account of the relationship between sons and fathers, and especially between him and his father, which was done in a dramatic and entertaining way. fashion - the distribution was well chosen and gave the film a sense of family - I recommend this film to all those who wish to see an intelligent drama and good performances
