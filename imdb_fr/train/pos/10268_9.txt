This typical film from Mamet offers a calm and balanced overview of what is good for a man of trust (Joe Mantegna). Explored as a psychological study by a renowned psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), she slowly brings it into her world with the usual harmful consequences. The cast includes a number of players found in several Mamet films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Soule Allen, William H. Macy) and they do their usual good job. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this movie and I often wondered why she had not become a more famous player than she has become. Maybe I do not look in the right places! <br /> <br /> The film moves slowly, with a flat dialogue, while maintaining a level of tension that logically leads to the end of the bang-up. You would expect a real disappointment in the end, but I found it uplifting and satisfying. I love that movie!
