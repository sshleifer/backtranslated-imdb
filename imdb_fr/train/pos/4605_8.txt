It's not only one of Jackie Chan's best movies, but also one of the best kung fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> We expect crazy stunts and fast, creative action in Chan's films, and this set the benchmark for others to follow. It's two hours of pure entertainment that impresses. <br /> <br /> In addition to the superb action, we have a viable script and credible characters, with Chan adopting what appears to be a more Western approach to writing, by mixing Eastern methods of solving that is, hitting the ass). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's funny, serious, fun and revolutionary. A must for any fan of kung fu, while remaining accessible to the greatest number of the film community.
