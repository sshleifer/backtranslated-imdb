The superb adaptation of Chris Marker's THE JETEE by Terry Gilliam is full of mind-blowing surprises, while still touching your heart with the superb cast. Gilliam's flair for phantasmagorical works with David and Janet Peoples' screenplay is to play as much with his head as with poor James Cole Traveler of the future traveler who literally does not know if he will come or not, a team of scientists continue to send it back to the bad times while trying to prevent a deadly 1995 plague for humans but no harm to animals. Willis, Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and well-meaning psychiatrist Madeline Stowe offer the best performances of their careers. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is obsolete. This one is not to be missed!
