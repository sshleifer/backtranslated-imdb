Before that, the "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But this adaptation to the screen of "Mother Night" is very faithful to the book and maintains the intention of the comedy, the mystery and the tragedy. Fortunately, it was not Hollywood or silly the movie "Breakfast of Champions". Another good thing about this movie is that you do not need to know the book to follow it (as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). It's probably also the case of Breakfast of Champions, but they did such a bad job that you'd better read the book and not see the movie! Nick Nolte did a great job in this movie.
