You have never seen anything like it. Once the coup is over, it's the most dazzling thriller you can see - even if you know the outcome. And all this is real because it's a documentary - incredible. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was part of my list of the top 10 movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Do not take into account drooling right-handed fanatics. Everyone I know who has seen this film gives it 4 stars. Even if you do not care about Venezuelan politics or politics, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat and believe it. <br /> <br /> It's a roller coaster.
