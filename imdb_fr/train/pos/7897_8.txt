At first glance, this movie does not look very good. After all, a Bette Davis movie with only 166 votes on IMDb and a rating of 6.5 must be pretty bad. But the film turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> First, it's expected to be a normal 1930s movie with a stereotypical love affair, but the film is surprisingly well-constructed and has a unusual and original story, which also helps to make this movie a very enjoyable movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story is carried by its two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. They were helped by a cast of rather amusing characters, but the film is mainly about two people. Their character is involved in a very unusual and intelligent love story written that also works with humor. This makes this movie a charming little comedy to watch, perfectly entertaining. <br /> <br /> The film is quite short (just an hour longer), which means that the story does not waste unnecessary time. plots, development and characters. This also makes the film rather fast, which also helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable film by today's standards. It may make the film a little bit simple, but it's never done to the detriment of his entertainment. <br /> <br /> A charming and pleasant romantic comedy simply enjoyable that deserves to be seen by more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
