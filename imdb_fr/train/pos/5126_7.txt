For Urban Cowboy, John Travolta plays one of the strongest alpha men ever on the big screen. It is a fairly decent young boy who leaves his parents' family property and goes to the big city of Dallas, where his uncle Barry Corbin promised to find him in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, this began to take off and Texas was definitely a growing place in the United States. <br /> <br /> Travolta does a good job of making the public care about their sexist pig character. He meets and marries Debra Winger, who has the same past, but she has ideas that women should not be the shadows of their men. And when she beats him to Gilley's mechanical bull, a man's game is all for him. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn, former convict, works at Gilley and this film was his main role. He is a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he looks at the Travolta goat and he goes to Winger. Travolta meets Madolyn Smith Osborne, a rich girl, who moans at Gilley's. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was actually a gigantic commercial for the world's greatest honky tonk. Gilley's is no longer in the Texas suburb of Pasadena, but the memories are still alive. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of country / western songs featured in the movie. I do not know if some songs were not written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason I can understand why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this movie. Johnny Lee's Looking For Love, though specially written for this film, is a shame that she was not nominated for the best song. I liked Debra Winger's best character in this movie. She does not lose a trace of femininity, but she stands up to Travolta and does it in style. And this review is dedicated to this still unknown woman who will one day be the first woman to be a rider in the Professional Bull Riders.
