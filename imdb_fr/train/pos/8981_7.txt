Dig! I would say to everyone, even if you do not like Metallica seeing "a kind of monster", it's a dash-back-type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world that behaves like a mental kid during a difficult period. It's fun and fascinating. In the same spirit, we must dig! A film about "The Dandy Warhol Massacre" and "The Brian Jonestown Massacre", two Portland bands that are creating a kind of musical scene in their hometown, but one of the bands is becoming huge and another who gets lost in the musical history books. From the beginning, both groups are moving in opposite directions only by their ability to make decisions, good or bad. Filmed for seven years and sometimes painful to watch, we see the dandy's meteoric glory (thanks to this vodaphone announcement!) And the seminal fall of Jonestown, who was the instigator of the scene and bickered . As the groups become more and more disjointed, the friendships become tight and mingle several times with the arguments and even the fights on stage. All this is both funny and tragic, and believe it or not, you will notice it with perversity. As I said at the beginning, you can watch Metallica's movie even if the band does not interest you. Dig! On the other hand, it is slightly more different, more pleasant and much easier to watch if you have a passing interest for one or the other group. Still a good movie and more a testimony of not being in a group than to encourage this as a career path. Dig! It's a crazy ride on the basics of rock and roll and a great example of the traps and pleasures of celebrity.
