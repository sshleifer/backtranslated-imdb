I have been fascinated by tornadoes for over 40 years. My Grade 5 teacher, a Texan, told me stories of those he saw in his youth. Fortunately, I have lived all my life in the central Atlantic states, where tornadoes are rare and generally less violent than those in the Midwest, but I had two close encounters, one in Pennsylvania and the another NJ in the last decade. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the family scenes, especially the conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was close, Dan knew almost everything he needed to do, and he probably learned it at school, because I know that tornado safety is an important topic in parts of the United States where these storms are more frequent. However, the characters in the movie did two things that some people think are supposed to be done or are safe in tornadoes but are not actually supposed to be done or are dangerous. <br /> <br /> When the siren sounded for the first time, Dan and Arthur walked through the house and opened the windows. For years, that was what people were supposed to do, but tornado safety websites now advise against doing so. In addition, people hid in an underpass on the highway. This method was made popular by a video of the early 90s performed by a crew of T.V. during a relatively low twister in Kansas. However, in the most severe tornadoes, people can be sucked by these underground passages. This happened during an outbreak in Oklahoma in May 1999. <br /> <br /> In this movie, tornadoes hit in the fall, which is not a common time for them. (Then, one of my closest encounters took place at the end of September.) Moreover, they traveled from northwest to southeast, while most storms of this type in the hemisphere north go from south-west to north-east. However, it is not so unusual. A famous tornado that hit Joliet, IL, in the early 90's, took this direction (like the one involved in my other close encounter). <br /> <br /> I think the film should have been in the spring. This film was based on a book that, in turn, was based on a real event that occurred on June 3, 1980. But it was still a fascinating story.
