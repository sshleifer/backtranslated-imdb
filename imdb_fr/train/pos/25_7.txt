I had never seen this when I was a child, so it was seen with new eyes. I had never heard of it and I rented it for my 5 year old daughter. In addition, Christopher Walken's idea of ​​singing and dancing made me curious. The special effects are tacky and the singing and dancing are mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was fascinated. I loved watching Walken in this role, thinking about what the future holds for him. Very funny to see him dancing! And if the songs were not great, at least they are not a saccharine sugar sweetness over-produced by Disney. The ogre scene at first made her a bit scared, and she was a bit nervous when we saw her at the end, but it was mostly benign. Interestingly, we had recently read "Puss in Boots" and I had wondered about the implausibility of the story. But while remaining faithful to almost every aspect, Walken's acting makes it believable. Very funny. I would watch him again with my daughter.
