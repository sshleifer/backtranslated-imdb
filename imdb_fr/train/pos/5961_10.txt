I may be biased, I am the author of The Hungry Bachelors Club, published in 1994. The script was written by my good friend and starving star, Fred Dresch, who inspired the character of Marlon in the film. I could not be more satisfied with the trailer, I hope to see the film in full and I will make other comments. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is stellar. She wears most of the emotional vehicles in shape. I could not have done better myself! It looks like real people, badly inspired by a formula and happily leads my statement against racial prejudice, gracious and sincere.
