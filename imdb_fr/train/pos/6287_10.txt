Disappeared in 60 seconds is a very good comedy action movie that has grossed more than $ 100 million but has been criticized by most critics. I personally thought it was an excellent movie. The story was plausible and probably has the best distribution of all time for this type of film, including Nicolas Cage, winner of three academy awards, Robert Duvall and the very hot Jolie anjolina. other than the lame cascade in the end it's a perfect mix of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (on ****)
