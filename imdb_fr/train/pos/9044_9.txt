I recently saw this movie because of Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I thought I would see the movies I missed. I did not expect to get into the movie, so I was surprised to learn that I had missed this movie. It's a captivating story between father and son, and it's also an underdog story. I even shed a tear in the end of this wonderful story. This film appeals to all ages. The only reason I give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a bit in the middle, but it comes back in the end. The acting was great, the story was beautiful and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film. GO TO SEE THIS FILM! Rent it, buy it, look at it, adore it! I know I did!
