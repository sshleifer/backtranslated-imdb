I liked this TV show because it was his own thing that a girl from her sixteenth birthday discovers she is a witch and lives with her aunts at home and they are also witches. It took him about a few weeks. When she used her powers for the first time, it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple. She had to go back in time and repeat a day. This series is really cool and it's a typical series of teens, but she was slim when she left her house to go to an apartment with her college mates friends, then it got boring and I I stopped watching I loved her aunts, they were so funny and the other was really ditzy. I loved Valerie and hated Sabrina's enemy. Libby was ugly.
