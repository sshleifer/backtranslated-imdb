When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I must say that, of all the shows I've seen, this one is the best. I had to see this show and that's what I really did. When I had the first volume of this series, it was the best. I really liked the animation, and all the fight scenes were great. I must say that my favorite characters in the series were Saber, Archer and, of course, I also love Illya. And of course, all the episodes of the volumes were interesting and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is that Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers, etc.) plays Berserker's voice. He has a cool character. And I even watched the entire series again before watching the final volume. So, if you see something good, then watch this show, it's the best.
