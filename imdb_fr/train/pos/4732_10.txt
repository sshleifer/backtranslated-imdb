I'm not a big fan of martial arts movies, but the video library was almost empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I got it for free when the other movies I rented, whether in a meaning or in the other. I loved my roommate and myself (22-year-old biochemistry and accounting students) spent half an hour after the movie making strange kung-fu sounds and throwing shurikens. I can not explain it (maybe a little tequila). I never liked Bruce Lee, a skinny guy kicking a big guy, beating him, kicking a bigger guy, etc. Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.
