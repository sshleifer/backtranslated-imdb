Friz Freleng's "rumors" are an excellent cartoon from Private Snafu that warns against the spread of rumors sparking wartime panic. Produced, like all of Snafu's shorts, intended to be presented to the military audience as entertaining educational films, 'Rumors' is extremely imaginative and encompasses tons of ideas in its very short life span. When Snafu begins a rumor about a bombing, it turns into a rumor that America lost the war. This is brilliantly illustrated by a long chewy rubbery piece and several strange and fictitious creatures that come back to haunt Snafu with ever more terrible news about his country's army. "Rumors" is inventive, rhythmic and fun, which helps to obscure the rather laborious message, "do not blame the military". This is one of the best Private Snafu shorts.
