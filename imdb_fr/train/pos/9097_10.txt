I rated this film as high because it was really cute, really funny, and unpretentious. I went to see this movie while playing in the Philly area and it was the centerpiece of a good evening with friends. The film is well written and well played, and although it looks a bit like a sitcom rather than a movie, it does not detract from the movie. You can not find comedies like this, where you do not have to shock people to make them funny. The film focuses on a Ukrainian housekeeper who works for a young couple in need. Although at first she helps, she quickly adds more craziness to their lives than expected by the couple. Things get more and more out of control until ... you have to see! The joke made me laugh even after leaving the theater. This film just put me in a good mood. I can not wait until it is published on DVD because I want this film in my collection.
