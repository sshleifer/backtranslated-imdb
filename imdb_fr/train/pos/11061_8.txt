Me too, I went through a very painful personal loss (twice) and this film describes very well the heartbreaking reality of this experience. Unbalanced life, nothing makes sense, well meaning parents, etc. ... <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Ally again. She is one of my favorite movie actors of all time. <br /> <br /> I laughed and cried as the story unfolded. Beautiful story and casting. Good game!
