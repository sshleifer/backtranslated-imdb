To put it simply, I enjoyed this movie. The reason for my interest and pleasure was related to nothing but the subject itself. My mother and my grandmother had told me the story of the life and attitudes of the working class in the north of England. In particular, the paternalistic but domineering father who "knows" what best suits his family and his stubbornness when this paradigm is questioned. (Few things changed then !!) <br /> <br /> The people who saw the play will probably be disappointed by the film because the story is not easily transmitted between different media. However, in a sense, the film is a historical document and I personally appreciated it, if only for the way it conveyed a social phenomenon.
