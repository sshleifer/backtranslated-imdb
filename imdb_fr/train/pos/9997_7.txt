Life Stinks (1991) was a milestone to Mel Brooks' other productions. He is interpreted as a rich man who makes a crazy bet with his "friends". Brooks says he can live as a homeless man for a month. His shocked and amused friends accept this unusual bet. During his "stay" in the Bowery, he meets a handful of homeless people, one of whom catches his imagination (Lesley-Ann Warren). They befriend her as she teaches him the many tricks she learned while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive alone without the luxury of being extremely wealthy? Will he win this unorthodox bet? Who are his true friends? Find out what will happen when you watch LIFE STINKS! <br /> <br /> This film has been treated unfairly. Of course, it's not a classic like his previous films, but it's still nice. I liked how Mel Brooks pays tribute to Charles Chaplin in this film. If you have watched Chaplin's previous silent films, you will also get humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
