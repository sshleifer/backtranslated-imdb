it's the best comedy I've ever seen! but all can not understand that, you must be from Georgia to understand this amazing movie! :) one of the best movies I've ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all the supporting actors playing very very well, but the role of Kote Daoshvili (Father Germogel) is, in my opinion, the best role in supporting role in movie history :)) in this film playing many Georgian stars like ipolite xvichia, sergo Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze ... they are all stars in Georgian cinematography :) The big Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course the director of the movie Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... I recommend this film to everyone, but remember that you must know the good Russian language to watch this movie.
