In fact, I thought it was a comedy and I watched her expect me to laugh at my ass. It quickly became clear that it was not a comedy, or at least not the "Jim Carrey" type. What made us look was the characters - the film begins with rather sinister and troubled people, gathered to try to fight one of their fundamental fears - the fear of water, the fear of swimming. we begin to enter their lives little by little, to witness their problems, to guess their thoughts. <br /> <br /> in fact, I made it look a lot darker than it really is, and in addition the chain of events quickly brings a little light and I hope they will find their life. <br /> <br /> I probably would not have watched the movie if I had known it was not a comedy, but rather a drama, but I had a good time, I liked it and spent about 90 minutes with her. <br /> <br /> Many films deal with the alienation between the peoples of the western world. This film shows how people can meet and help each other <br /> <br /> "and if in the light of the last day you meet her, do not let her go, do not lose her, she is your gift of the sun ... "<br /> <br /> 9/10 peace and love
