Not having seen the film in the original version of the play, I was pleasantly surprised when the DVD arrived, because this film did not have the wide diffusion it deserved. <br /> <br /> The first film directed by Denzel Washington and the finished product have nothing to envy other films on the same theme by more accomplished directors. The film has a very professional look. This shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot from the other side of the camera. He brings a different angle to this film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is undoubtedly Derek Luke's great performance. He is an actor who, with the right advice, will go far, without a doubt. His interpretation of the troubled young man, at this moment of his life, in turmoil and suffering for having a bad life in his hand, has treated him so far, is very true. His Antwone is a beautiful portrait of a suffering man, who is basically very good and has so much to give, but nobody seems to see this aspect of his character. <br /> <br /> At the worst moment of his despair Antwone is sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, very soberly, though somewhat moderately. Because of the anxiety within Antwone, it misses the opportunity to open up to this man who wants to help, but because of the constraints imposed on his office, you only have three sessions and then you have to send back his patient. <br /> <All is well, because Antwone is able to convince the doctor to continue working with him. Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The aggression he suffered at the hands of Ms. Tate, his adoptive mother, is, to say the least, brutal. The attempted sexual assault by an elderly woman of the Tate family gives Antwone a bitter taste that will follow him throughout his adult life, as he was marked by the shame he carries with him. <br /> <Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to make her see a different world through the love she brings to her and the support she gives her. <br /> <br /> The main performances are really good. Dr. Davenport of Denzel Washington also has his own problems. He is not a happy camper either. He can help Antwone, but he can not help but help himself or his relationship with a loving wife. <br /> <br /> The talent in the movie is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a beautiful Cheryl. Novella Nelson, an excellent actress, is superb as Ms. Tate, the abusive foster mother. <br /> <br /> The meeting of Antwone with his unknown family is a little too sweet and sentimental, but of course, if It is to believe that Fisher finally finds happiness, we must also accept this part of the film .
