A meteorite falls in the country of a small town, bringing a creature in jelly. An old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) take him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor carefully treats the light bulb and asks Steve to look for the place where they found the old man. When Steve comes back, he sees the drop killing the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and locals, but no one believes it, as the blob engulfs many people, getting bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> "The Blob" is a cult and a classic science fiction. It's a low-budget movie, with many actors and ham actresses (with the exception of Steve McQueen), dreadful effects, but also delicious and very, but very entertaining. This is the first time I've seen this classic (I had seen the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon), and I highly recommend it to Steve McQueen fans and the 1950s B-series science fiction movies. My number 1400's movie's subject could not be better. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The blob")
