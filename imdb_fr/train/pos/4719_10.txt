This movie is the reason why I found this site. I could not find this movie anywhere else! I'm so glad we found it here! We have already seen it on television and we desperately wanted to find it, buy it and make it love to several friends. Another poster said it was boring, but I have to say that's not the case. Especially if you are a horse, you will love this movie. The horses are great, well trained and the film is well done. This is certainly the one we will buy for our home DVD library. We will recommend it to our friends. The link between man and horse in this film was really inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses. It is certainly a film that we will look at several times.
