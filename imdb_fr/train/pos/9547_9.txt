This film is the first cinematic experience for many people in the cast. All are experienced actors and have played in several television series and plays. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It's a bit odd to see him in a thriller, while he's at the peak of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is Togan Gokbakar's first feature film and almost the first director's experience. But they all did a good job. We are happy to see such an enthusiastic young actor. They look very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay, long-time sweetheart of Sahan Gokbakar, is also a talented actress, known for her recent play in the "Number 27" theater and several television series.
