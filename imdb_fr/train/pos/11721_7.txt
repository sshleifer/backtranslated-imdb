The magnetism emanating from Elvira, which attracts its legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With his long, toned figure, wide bust, innocent and mischievous attitude and pocket lexicon for slang in the valley, Elvira's character has universal and timeless appeal. As a budding folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of the story, it is obvious that the character of Elvira has some archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of his tabs and his large chest. Initiated by the way the city's children react, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman who can connect at their level: a strange mix of one-dimensional romantic nostalgia, childish sexual desire and a desire for light and non-threatening. It symbolizes an undeveloped female ideal, perfect for boys and a source of strength for girls in the city. Other adults have problems with it for the same reasons. In the end, though, his film can not let his ingredients go over campy. The end result is that, even though Elvira is infinitely interesting, his film is limited by the weakness of his showcase for his talents. Almost everything is adapted to an adolescent mindset and although it's a simple comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will enjoy it. Fortunately, I have such a capacity and I found that the film was a charming charmer. <br /> <br /> Best Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I had no complaints.
