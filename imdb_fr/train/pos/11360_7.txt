Chris Gerolmo took care not to just give us a list of murdered "Jack-the-Strip-stripper" people: he explored the psychological characterization with convincing results. Perhaps mainly because of Stephen Rea's excellent performance against Donald Sutherland with good empathy on the part of both. It was the game of these two parts ?? above all ?? which made the film more than a morbid account of the story of the Rostov butcher. Supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, interpreted their roles very well. Good staging. The photography was good too. It goes without saying that the fact that the film was shot in Hungary inevitably produces some aberrations, but frankly, given the depth of the story and the interpretations, we can completely forget these little anecdotes. For once, an HBO TV movie, made for television, was decisive Recommended, especially if you like to analyze the characterism and forget some morbid scenes ?? which, I hasten to add, are never exaggerated.
