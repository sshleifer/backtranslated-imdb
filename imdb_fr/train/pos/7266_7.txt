I remember having a fairly low regard for a company like this one when it was first published. James "Not Jim" Belushi, a very sexy actress and a cheese title in a John Hughes formula. You could not have paid me to see him 15 years ago. But, I found myself caught watching while losing a Sunday afternoon, and it strikes me on many levels. The fairy tale (part Pretty woman, reverse party pretty woman), the very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street - performance of Kelly Lynch, the escape. Overall, he gently pulls very nice strings. It's pretty hard not to go down in history, to have a crush on Kelly Lynch, to identify with James Belushi, not to love the mean boyfriend and make fun of Curley Sue's lines. At all the ups and downs, with a happy ending, and the kind of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.
