almost all the critics of this movie I had seen were pretty bad. It's not bad, it's actually pretty good, but not great. The character of Judy Garland could have become annoying, but she did not allow it. Somewhere along the line, I became a fan of Van Heflin's rumination, dominance, over-activity, at least in the early '40s. Judy's vocals are excellent, but the film missed a good one. opportunity by not showing more their relationship. I gave him a 7.
