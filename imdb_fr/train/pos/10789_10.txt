When I was little, my parents had this movie to watch. I really liked it and watched it again and again. Even when I was in grade 3, I still watched it from time to time. Recently, I watched it again, just for the sake of nostalgia, and although the show was not meant for my age group (I'm in the late teens), I still found it entertaining and educational. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and good understanding with others. Some parts seemed pretty funny to me. In addition, this show has no bad content, so you can leave children alone with this show without worrying about whether they speak foul language or anything else. I would recommend this.
