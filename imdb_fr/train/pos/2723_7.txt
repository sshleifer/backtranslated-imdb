IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, he is also so intent on being realistic that he is sometimes more clinical than entertaining. Recounting the brutal murder of a Midwestern family, author Truman Capote focused on minutiae, wrapping the reader and himself in the subject AND topics! Brooks deviates wildly from this approach in favor of something closer to the docudrama. Although he films on real places, he keeps his distance. The murderers are portrayed as depraved idiots, which they surely were. They are not perceived as misunderstood souls (as in the book Capote) and the savagery of their act is terribly brutal. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent killers, as is secondary distribution, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as a reporter (the "Capote character"). The reference photograph is that of the great Conrad Hall.
