I found it very interesting that the film manages to bridge the gap between my own American culture and that of the authors, that is, Chinese. It becomes a story of values ​​and leads the observer to reevaluate one's own life choices and loyalty to institutions. Surprisingly, he managed to do so in a gentle and slightly humorous way, which is only a hindsight for the status quo. I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if I could.
