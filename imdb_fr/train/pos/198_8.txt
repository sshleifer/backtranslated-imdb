Oh, it's so cool to watch a Silent Classic once in a while! The director Vidor is simply charming and even makes a long cameo (at least for 1928) as himself. The story speaks of success in life and how it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a larger "theater" studio. She becomes a big star and the consequences are that she really separates herself from the real world. For a moment, she even denies her (poor) past! The cameos are just hilarious, certainly the scene where the protagonist (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies in the studios and concludes that she does not seem so special ... It must be one of the first movies here and for the real freaks it's great to see the cameras and equipment of the time. A must if you ask me !!
