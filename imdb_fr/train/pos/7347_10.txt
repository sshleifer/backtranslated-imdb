I own Ralph Bakshis, the forgotten masterpiece of Fire & Ice, on an old OOP rental video tape. <br /> <br /> Well, it's better than any other movie on Conan-esque you'll ever see. Of course, it's nerdy, but who cares? It has stood the test of time, and the only way to start looking corny is a comparison with modern fantasy epics like LOTR: FOTR (although I like this movie.) <br /> The plot goes like this: After a battle between Fire & Ice, a girl of the king is kidnapped by subhuman creatures jarols (Ice), while the only survivor of a victim village saves her. <br /> <br /> Yeah, that does not sound as original as Nurse Betty, but that's not the question. It's really about bringing to life an interesting idea of ​​a world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. And that succeeds. <br /> <br /> Regarding the action scenes: superb. They are well handled, have great suspicion and have a lot of loud noises. Just look at the climate battle, now IT'S an end! <br /> <br /> The actors' game and the dialogue: competent. Really. They will not be nominated for an Oscar, but they are fine and do not get upset. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Shot in 3D and rotoscopic (I think), it looks pretty good. Most backgrounds look well detailed and well drawn, and although the designs of the characters have a one-dimensional aspect, they are acceptable. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a neglected gem that will entertain you more than any of the superficial "entertainment". 10/10
