Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. You know the part where Shadow falls in the ditch ... thing, I * cried *, considering that I was only six years old, I cried! it takes a lot to make me cry! The dogs and the cat are excellently trained. A nice family movie, * not * for completely hardened non-fluffy people or animals that hate animals, but could for people like me, shit like shit, like me. <br /> <br /> A good movie, 10/10!
