Nowadays, it is rare to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly disgusting and appalling throughout the film (eg Big Fat Greek wedding, Me, myself and Irene). There were only some uselessly insane jokes in this film, nothing inanimately profane. All around, it was a cute movie with nice characters. I thought the end was a bit steep. It's as if they should have finished at the World Series for a really successful finish. The acting game left something to be desired, but was offset by the rhythm of the story. If I had known it was a Farrelly brothers film, I would have supposed it was a stomach that was spinning and I was not looking at it, but it seems that even these are able to accidentally make a good movie. Good for them, I hope they'll manage to start making good movies.
