It's probably one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a crazy country, Arjun Singh, is hilarious. The best thing is that laughter never stops. The plot is the same old story where the child is separated from his mother and who sacrifices everything for his duty - with a happy meeting at the end. There are wicked people (Ranjit) and brothers (Sashi Kapoor), foxes (Parveen Babhi) and lovers (Smita Patil), as well as a blind brother and a grandfather who do the same. But this movie is about Amitabh and that's all you'll remember at the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh settles in the city to earn a decent living; his dialogues and manners are hilarious. Later in the film, he becomes the angry young man for whom he is famous, but the humor remains. Memorable parts include her walk, her conversation and her English, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and all she has with her dad. <br /> <br /> In all, I rolled laughter throughout the film. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at its best - that's it. This will easily give him a 10/10.
