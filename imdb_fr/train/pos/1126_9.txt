My interest was sparked as I flipped through and saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia so I thought OK, let's see what it is. I'm so happy to have stayed on the channel. What a wonderful story! Dramas, sadness, some acting perfectly but a wonderful time to live. I look at this and it makes me sad for all the hype that the film industry produces and these beautiful little jewels are forgotten. Try Iphigenia and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I even allowed my children (27, 25, 20 and 17 years) to enjoy it. It starts slowly, however, the drama is built and you will be drawn into the story. Watching this beautiful film made me want to immerse myself in more Greek tragedies and pathos.
