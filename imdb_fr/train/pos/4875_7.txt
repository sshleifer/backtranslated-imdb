"The father is still on a business trip", headlined a review after "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many people think that Kusturica always has the same unique expression and that critics can not touch it. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from a lack of concentration or fear of empty spaces, it is still unique and preserved. Surprisingly good performance of Stribor Kusturica. Many more close-ups and less landscapes than in "Life is a miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a fatal potential as a woman, do not ruin it. I recommend everyone to see this movie.
