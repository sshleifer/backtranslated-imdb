Barbara Stanwyck as a tough cookie, working class waitress (and prostitute by her father) who fled to New York and uses her female devices to get a job in the rankings, before moving on to Mortgage and Escrow, and later as a as assistant secretary to the second in command of the bank. The dramatic study of a female character not afraid of being unseemly has lost none of her power over the years, Barbara acting like a storm (representing a woman who is learning to be a leading actress). By incorporating a small Nietzschean philosophy into her spoiled life, this lady crushes all feeling, but she never loses our fascination, our fear. She is broad and hard, but she is neither a bitch nor a man-eater or a woman. This girl is everything to her, and while we wait for her to finally discover the true values ​​of life, her journey into the ladder of success provides heated and sexy entertainment. John Wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye makeup) does his job as an assistant in the records office, although all support players are very good. *** of ****
