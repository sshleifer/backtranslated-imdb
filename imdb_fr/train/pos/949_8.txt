"TV movies" tend to fall under the pitfalls of a tight budget and an early filming schedule, which is why this film always tends to thwart the trend. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott perfectly embodies Ebenezer Scrooge, perfectly encompassing all his cold tendencies, and still makes him a simpathetic character. The production value of this film was exceptional, never using special effects or a particular sound configuration, but relying on the depth and clarity of the shooting on the site and on solid backgrounds. A film that certainly remains alone.
