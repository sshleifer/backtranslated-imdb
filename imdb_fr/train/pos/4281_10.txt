One of my favorite "domestic" movies. I do not know if there are people in our country who have not seen this movie! It's funny and sad at times ... I do not know how people around the world (who have had the opportunity to watch it) have accepted this film because you have to know certain moments of our Serbian history and the character of the Serbs of the first half of the 20th century, to be able to understand it! But as I see him here, there was someone from Canada who looked at him ... and he loved him. <br /> <br /> I think I'll try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this site, but first to know how to do that ... <br /> <br /> Cheers.
