I became hooked from the beginning to the end. The great horror comes from disturbing images and organic shocks created not to blow you up, but to make you leave. "What did I just see?" All the other commentators briefly summarized the subject of the film, so I will not go back to what has already been said. I was talking to other people about this movie a few days after seeing it just because it still haunted me. I even had a bad dream after seeing him and I'm a real horror fan, not easily scared by guts like "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What made me dream is the discomfort I felt about what I would do if I were in this cell with these guys. What would be my personal horror? My subconscious took me there and it was not nice. That my friends is what a good horror movie does to you! The best part of this movie is that it's subtle. It's not about Bogeymen jumping on you, invading foreigners or tons of blood. It's the contrary. The horror you create in your own mind. The irony for the four characters is that the horror does not come from an external force that asserts its power over them. Simply, men ask what they want, and they get it ... but not as they had imagined. So, on the one hand, they get what they want from an occult book, but may not want it. Sometimes being locked in a prison cell is the best place to be!
