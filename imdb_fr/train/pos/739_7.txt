I have been a fan of Jodie Foster since we were both children since her Disney years. I loved his boy romp in movies like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> "Foxes" is a huge change from all of this. <br /> <br /> Where other young actresses of this time have turned to the sexual puerility disguised as comedy ("Little Darlings", do you like it?), Jodie embarked on a depressing narrative and tragic of adolescents driven by the powerful attraction of temptation and dependence. <br /> <br /> It was not Disney. It was not Porky. It was not "Halloweed". It was a dark and powerful story of the destruction of young lives. Unfortunately, it is a story that is played every day across the country. This film could be replayed (with a current soundtrack) and remain quite relevant. <br /> <br /> This is not the best film ever made, it is tired in some places, all the performances are not particularly remarkable. But Jodie Foster continued to show off her talents as a true adult actor (a trend began when she was very young in Taxi Driver). <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 Barky
