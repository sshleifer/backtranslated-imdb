Women have never been so attractive and pathetic as in the movie Piedras de Salazar. Although the publisher's cuts here and there can help the film, it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense footprint of Pedro Almodovar's latest films. 5 different women manage with their male partners and their families. Beginning with several different stories that must meet as the plot continues, Salazar describes her female characters in the same neurotic and borderline behavior familiar to Almodovar. A kleptomaniac lady with a shoe with smaller shoes, a burlesque housewife who cares for her disabled daughter, a drug-addicted dancer obsessed with her old boyfriend and a taxi driver taking care of her husband's troubled children , wandering the streets of Madrid in well-designed scenes. Using some of Almodovar's familiar actresses, the director succeeds in his first film to give depth to all the characters who share the film and to create a real sympathy for each one of them. Women control the plot, and men are forced to stay with each other, at the end ... Surprisingly good for a first film, and worth, regardless of their quality. It should be noted that Salazar hesitated in some directives necessary to actresses, but an impressionable act is always shown on the screen, especially by Monica Cervera, who played in her former short film. <br /> <br /> A must for everyone Almodovar fans, and nice to everyone.
