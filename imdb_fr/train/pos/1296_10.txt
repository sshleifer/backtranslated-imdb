It is an extremely difficult film to watch, especially since it targets the deepest of our lives. But in the end, it's a very beautiful and deeply moving film. Anyone who finds it cynical, I must say that it must have greatly missed the purpose of the whole message of the film. For those who watch the film, they will see that the way in which the problems are treated is absolutely necessary and that the result is finally edifying. Of course, it's very difficult to watch, a difficult and even brutal subject. Yet it is extremely relevant to society and to everyone. This shows the pinnacle of what world cinema is doing right now (I will not limit this term to France) and everyone should try to see it. I would say that it is better to go lucidly without being influenced by different points of view and let the film work for you.
