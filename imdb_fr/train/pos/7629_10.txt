Kurt Russell IS Elvis, clear and simple. His dedication to this role has resulted, in my opinion, in the best organic film of all time. If you are a fan of Elvis, see if you can. <br /> <br /> The film specially designed for television was shot two years after Elvis's death. <br /> <br /> One piece of advice, there are two versions - one at 180 minutes and one at 117 minutes. The only one to watch is the longest. The shortest has more than an hour of footage released. It just does not work because the scenes it contains often depend on the scenes that have been cut. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece takes you from Elvis's childhood to his emergence as a star of entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's real father) are excellent parents of Elvis. And Pat Hingle is a very competent Colonel Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the king!
