I love hidden horror movies and the big British studios Hammer, who made one of their greatest movies with "The Devil Rides Out" (1968), proved to be more than competent in this area of ​​the film. 'horror. This tenth hidden episode from Hammer's hit television series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "The Guardian of the Abyss", is indeed a scary entry into the series. Director Don Sharp, who had previously enriched Hammer's work of "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Crazy Monk" (1966), also directed two films "Fu Machu" starring Christopher Lee. the most well-known names among the directors of HHH, and he also delivers here. Antique dealer Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles over a mysterious old glass that is scary. The reading glass is precisely the object of the desire for worship worshiping the devil, who wants to use it for his satanic rites. When he houses a beautiful girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), who is to be sacrificed by the sect, Michael has more and more problems with the sect and its sinister leader (John Carson) ... Although it is not one of my absolute favorite episodes of "Hammer House of Horror" (the best is clearly the brilliant seventh episode, "The Silent Scream"), it's a very scary and atmospheric episode. The plot has several interesting twists and remains suspended and disturbing throughout the film. Ray Lonnen looks good, the young Rosalyin Landor is convincing as innocent beauty and John Carson is really scary as a leader of satanists. Overall, "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and terrifying story from HHH, and my Hammer fan friends should not miss it.
