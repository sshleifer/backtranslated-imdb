This film exceeded my expectations. I thought and I heard that it would be garbage, so I did not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first, I did not really like the main girl and I did not really care if she lived or died. After a while, she definitely grew up and became a nice character. It's not just a slasher movie where people die for no reason. There is a story that takes only a few seconds of the movie, but that explains a lot. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Anyway, if you're not sure to watch it, you only have an hour and a half left. Either way, you're going to live 80 years.
