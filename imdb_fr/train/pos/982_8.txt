It is one of those westerns that, finally, remains practically alone in the unequaled quality of its dialogue. Very few can cope with it in the long run. That said, the rest is bad enough. Nevertheless, I give him an eight because there is no other western with such a good dialogue with perhaps the exception of The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner and maybe a few others. <br /> <br /> He is riddled with weaknesses, John Drew Barrimore the most glaring. However, there is a truly memorable scene. Nothing like. It's just after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff and goes to Jack Elams' house to push him to fight. Wonderful stuff. Up to the best in any western.
