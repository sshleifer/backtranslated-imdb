Aside from Susan Hayward's wooden delivery throughout this film, it was as good as any Bible movie. Henry King treats this film with the respect of an epic in all the small scenes, and Peck is, as always, impeccable. The melodious sound of Alfred Newman, accompanied by the Twenty-third Psalm is unforgettable, even after many years. The scene with Goliath is a little hokey, but not so bad for the time when this film was shot. It goes well alongside the biblical epics of the day, "The Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King". It's worth looking at, and Raymond Massy is excellent as the prophet Nathan. The film is completed by the very good James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, the first wife of David.
