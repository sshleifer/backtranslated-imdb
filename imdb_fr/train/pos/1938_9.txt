The big bad bath has a small budget, indie feel about it. So many times that I start watching independent films that have had very good reviews before discovering that they are pretentious, elected by people so blinded by the idea of ​​the film and its provocative potential that they forget that this film is a form of entertainment first and foremost. <br /> <br /> I do not know if The Big Bad Swim has a message, a higher meaning or a metaphor, if it's the case then I missed it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, BBS felt good, it was easy, warm and human, there were no major dramas or significant ideas, I just connected directly to the characters. And when, as with all good movies, the end has arrived, I felt sadness at the loss of this connection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something big, fast or insightful, look for a movie trying to deliver more than it can. BBS offers a solid, pleasant and real experience and I felt rewarded and reassured to have watched it.
