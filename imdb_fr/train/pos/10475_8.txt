One of my friends recommended this film, citing my vocal and inflectional similarities with Des Howl, the main character of the film. I guess to some extent I can see that and maybe a little bit more, I'm not sure if it's a flattering picture. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty unique work, the only movie that could True Romance would have more than a striking resemblance, not for the content or style of filming nor for the rhythm of the dialogue (Whale Music is so much more, well, relaxed.) But they both represent modern love stories. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm a big fan of Canadian music and musicians (for example, I highly recommend the Hard Core logo) and this particular movie. He has an innocent charm, Des is not always the most plausible guy, but there is something about him that attracts a kind of empathy.
