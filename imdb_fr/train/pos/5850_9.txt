It's been 16 years since the movie came out, I would have hoped that a "marketing magician" would have promoted a live actor version of this classic, or at least sought to reissue the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why the science fiction or cartoon network did not detect it. Galaxy Rangers actually had well-thought out lines and even better scripts. The animation was above average for the moment and excellent compared to the Japanese slideshow that was presented today. He preceded the heavy toy-on-market tie on the market, that may have sealed his fate too. I would gladly spend money on a GR DVD, if available.
