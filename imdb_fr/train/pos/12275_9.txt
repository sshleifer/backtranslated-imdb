I have never heard of this book, nor do I care to read it, but I will probably see the film several times. <br /> <br /> This film is unforgettable. It may contain the richest images ever seen in a movie. It was as if I was looking at paintings several times, which, in my opinion, was the idea. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary film, story, actors and cinematography. Full of deep emotions from all angles. Although I do not particularly like love movies, I loved this and was deeply touched by Winona Ryder's call to his father towards the end. <br /> <br /> Mr. Irons deserved an award for his performance and Close was never better. <br /> <br />
