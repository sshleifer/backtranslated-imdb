Welcome to Kiefer Sutherland. it's been too long since you did not appear in a movie, and what movie it was, was not it 24, but very intriguing, especially with a pro like Michael Douglas in the lead as an agent besieged secret service. The character of Kiefer is the one who pursues Michael Douglas all the film, the partner of Kiefer, is Eva Longoria, the homemaker Desperate. wow, she can really play outside flirting all day and look good, I wish Kim Bassinger had a bigger role, but other than that, I really think that the whole movie was great from start to finish. This film is what I consider to be a political thriller, everyone has played their part thoroughly. nothing has been revealed to sooon in the film, to let you guess at any time. and I really think Kiefer did a hell of a job here in this movie, but in my opinion, Michael Douglas had the besxt performance of the day, well done.
