I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was a classic animated film ... except when bras and bullets started to fly. I must admit that this film will upset everyone because it is ready to discriminate everyone and everyone ... but the truth is that it's as funny as it is deep. I recommend it to anyone who loves cult classics. Also try Fritz the cat and the NINE lives of Fritz the cat. If I'm not mistaken, Ralph Bashki also shot this film. This is a cat that goes through difficult times with family, on the street, at work, etc. When I was old enough, I rented all those movies. Because Coonskin was an offensive title at that time, it was also called Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also directed Cool World with the very young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another drawing that dealt with the life in the street of a young man.
