Warning: May contain spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie 3 times and I liked it every time. Seeing him again, I always remember how good it is. An HBO TV movie - very well done like most of their movies - it would have earned Oscars for its performances had it been distributed for general distribution rather than for a television. <br /> <br /> As I'm sure. Everyone knows by reading the other reviews here, this is the story of the serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo. He murdered 56 people for 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried and could not be traced, so he was convicted of only 52 out of 53 murders.) The story focuses more on forensic analyst Victor Burakov, interpreted to perfection by Stephen Rea. A man who becomes tortured and obsessed by the search for this murderer despite the additional obstacles imposed by party hawks, his role is essential to be sure. Towards the end of the film, a very touching scene indicates that investigators in America are routinely removed from serial killers after 18 months, whether they like it or not, because of mental tension and frustration. According to this act, Burakov worked for more than 5 years before getting his first break. He followed the case until its conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, tells him in fact that he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing that he should have given him a break earlier. <br /> <br /> Rea's performance is so good. That done, he does not overestimate, does not chew the landscape and does nothing that distracts from his portrait of an inflexible man who seeks to find his killer. He is a passionate man, but does not show it in the same way as in crime movies. He gives only occasional tantrums after being subdued more than most people could handle under such circumstances. Rea does so much with his face, his eyes that he does not need to react too much. It's just * is * - his character, so frustrated after so much time, at one point, frustrated, he actually says he'd rather find 3 at a time than nothing in a year. Of course, what he means is not that he wants more people, he just wants clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel for this man. It only gives us a glimpse of what living with such horror and such futility. <br /> <br /> Mutant, the childhood of Chikatilo is the one that produces such "monsters". The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. In a way (it seems impossible), it arouses a minimum of sympathy for itself. Maybe he is the worst of us terribly wrong? Anyway, his performance is very well done. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to the rank of general) is also doing a great job. He begins by appearing to be a cynical mundane official who does not seem more interested in assisting the investigation than anyone who blocks Burakov. But he ends up becoming more than just an assistant, he actively participates in helping Burakov. There is also a very nice trick of Max Von Sydow while the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and determine what kind of deviant they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Although this film speaks of a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it is really more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself. All around, a movie very well done with great performances and an excellent screenplay. The script succeeds in making the best of this type of film: to give factual events and place them in a dramatic way that gives you the impression of knowing the people behind the facts. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
