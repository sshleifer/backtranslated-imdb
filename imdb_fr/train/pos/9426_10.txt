This is one of the funniest series of all time! I laugh until my sides crack and roll on the floor. If only someone liberated in America. Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please. <br /> <br /> I know the record will be released in the UK, but it's also Region 2 and PAL! Let's give this series its jolt. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved Tracie Bennett's offbeat and awkward role in all of this. Of course, I loved Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Broadcast this show in America! or show it again on PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please make us happy, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
