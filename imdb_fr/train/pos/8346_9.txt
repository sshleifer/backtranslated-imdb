I just watched I. Q. again tonight and I forgot how much I like this movie. It's wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that everything is going well in the world. I love allusions to Mozart since the beginning with "Einstein" who plays "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" on the violin while humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during Ed Walters' IQ test. I like the fact that a woman is described as intelligent and encouraged to make a career, a particularly unique situation in the 1950s, at the time this film unfolds. (I myself was a teacher but I stayed at home to raise my children, so please do not think I'm a woman freed.) It's wonderful to finally see a man who is "only the fat monkey". important and dignified as Catherine's fianc√©, researcher in clinical behavior research. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but what we are is defined by so much more - no labels. There are so many little gags and one-liners that make you almost lose your mind if you do not watch and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> I caught a few things in the movie that do not appear in the goofs page. In the scene where Ed Walters is scheduled to speak at the symposium, there are 3 instruments (reporter, ruler, etc.) hanging to the right of the chalk heel. In the next shot of the camera, there are no more 2. In the credits of our video, it is about the character of Tony Shaloub, Bob Watters, and not Bob Rosetti as it appears in the film and is listed here on Imdb. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. In some estimates, it may be a piece of fluff, but it has much more substance than many people attribute to it. Not only that, what a great distribution is assembled here. Watch it and enjoy!
