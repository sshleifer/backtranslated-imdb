The story is about Ankush (Abhay Deol) - a professional wedding witness, in short, he acts as a witness for couples registered in the marriage registry - and Megha (Soha Ali Khan) who has fled from his home to Nainital to marry her. love interest Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins when Megha is waiting at the marriage registration office for Dhiraj to show up, but for some reason he does not show up. So, Ankush appears in the picture here, who had approached Megha with the intention of winning rupees. 200 for his work as a witness and he ends up helping him by providing shelter. Ankush grows up alongside him while working in a bank as an agent ... Ankush falls in love with Megha and also falls in love with him (or some kind of love), both agree to the marriage and Dhiraj return to the picture. In fact, unexpected circumstances occur, I should say, expected circumstances with unexpected reactions, then .... <br /> <br /> In fact, the story of the film is slightly different from the movies we see and I do not think it will be accepted by the but if you like movies like me and you like look at something different, then you will definitely like the movie. The film is just an innocent love story written by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that you feel like something is happening to the neighbor. The background music of the film also plays a very good role, it is just too good. The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a feeling of freshness. <br /> <br /> then let's cut it out and summarize it. <br /> <br /> History: A very common story that unfolds very well and turned into a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Music: As it was the creation of Himesh Reshammiya, I did not expect much, but I still liked some songs from the movie, including Qawwali. <br /> <Actors: Abhay Deol was the most impressive game, very natural and innocent, but he was not to sing in the songs. Soha Ali Khan, it's a doll, a very cute doll I must say. Again, the acting of actors very innocent and natural and these two actors integrate perfectly in their characters. Apart from these two, Shayan Munshi needs theater lessons and maybe a few layers of fat to cover the bones. Other actors did their job well. <br /> <br /> Stars: I would also give it 3.5 stars out of 5. You will enjoy the movie if it is watched at the theater, I would recommend it if you are a movie buff and accept unusual stories. Otherwise, wait for the DVD to arrive. The film will certainly not please the masses and the business it can do is word of mouth.
