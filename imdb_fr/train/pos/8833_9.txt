The title intrigued me, so during a small bout of insomnia (fueled by my curiosity ...), I stayed awake and watched it. I then checked my TV shows and watched again! When I saw this film, I realized very clearly that despite the politics, the traditions, the culture, etc., the teenagers are practically the same. The characters of the children of Belgrade could have been transported, for example, somewhere in the American Midwest during the same period, and linguistic differences, apart, would be indistinguishable from the adolescents of that time. They have certainly displayed the same growing pains and concerns, with the exception of politics: music, sex, movie idols, music, alcohol, sports, music ... In fact, the same things that have occupied my time in the 1970s in Southern California. <br /> <br /> It was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it very pleasant. The characters, especially the young actors, were equally credible. I will not say it was the Yugoslav "American Graffiti", but I would say that it fits well with other movies about the 50s.
