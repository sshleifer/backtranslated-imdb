Farrah Fawcett is superb in this powerful drama of 1986, in which she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape the clutches of an alleged rapist. Congratulations to Farrah for her Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. <br /> <br /> When her rapist Joe (terribly played by James Russo) goes home, she shares with her two roommates (who are conveniently Marjorie must play with Joe's scary demands.) This gives troubling images and shocking! <br /> <br /> When her roommates come home, they are surprised (to say the least) by the actions of Marjorie and a superb performance by Alfre Woodard who tries desperately to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and turn her into a cop makes the movie even more scathing. <br /> <br /> I find Diana Scarwid very irritating, but when Joe finally confessed that he came here for all to kill, the film is indeed a very emotional drama. <br /> <br /> Overall, Extremities is a film brilliantly thought out and well played and I must have watched it hundreds of times! Congratulations to all those involved .
