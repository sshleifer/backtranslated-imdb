This film seems to be criticized for some reason. Probably just by mass mass. Anyway, it's actually a very interesting movie. The film is a sci-fi sci-fi movie that works, because of an interesting storyline and well done scenes. <br /> <br /> This film may not be for everyone. If there are Sci-Fi fans reading this, I really recommend this movie if you like good science fiction. The film has crazy ideas. The framework includes countries that are at war with GIGANTIC machines in which all countries invest all their money! The world has been divided into territories. Anyone can challenge anyone in a war or rather in a "robot duel". The method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war, since now everyone wears these breathing masks. Certainly a film that makes you think. Smart, well written and good effects for lean budget. <br /> <br /> I tend to like movies that have a small budget and that work.
