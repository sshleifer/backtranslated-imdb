Writer / director John Hughes covered all the basics (as usual) with this bitter Sunday afternoon family film. "Curly Sue" is a sweet and precocious orphan, looked after from an early age by "Bill". The couple lives with their spirit as they roam the great United States of America. Destiny matches them with a "very nice" yuppie lawyer, and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Children will love this movie because they can. compared to the heroine, played by Alisan Poter (9 years old) (who became the "you go girl!" from Pepsi advertising). The character is supposed to be about 6 or 7 years old, as she is invited to think about going to school. Some of her vocabulary suggest that she is at least 9 years old every day. <br /> <br /> Similar to "Home Alone", there is a lot of slap-stick and small fists striking big breasts. Once again, this is a cinematographic "formula" for a young audience. Entertaining and comforting. Do not look for surprises, but be prepared to shed a tear or two.
