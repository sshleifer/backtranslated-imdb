I saw this movie Sunday afternoon. I loved this film. I loved everything, difficult times for moms and daughters at scenes where Mamie Gummer (Lila) cries because of her bad decision to marry a man for her parents and not because she is really in love. I loved these moments because they were so real. At first, I was very scared because I was hoping the film would not end up like Bobby, a great casting, but a badly written film with little value. But in the middle of the film, I felt completely different. You will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see the evening again. Believe me when I say go see it!
