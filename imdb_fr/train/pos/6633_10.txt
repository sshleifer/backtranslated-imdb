The first movie ever made. Workers arriving from a factory, some cyclists, most walking, moving to the right or left. The Lights are, with Melies, both the starting point and the starting point of the cinema - with Melies beginning the narrative fiction, the cinema, the fantasy, the artifice, the show; with Pure Lights, no frills, observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of the latter's cinema with the tired formulas of the previous one. <br /> <br /> But consider this brief. There is nothing objective about it. The film is full of action - a static and inhuman scene burst into life, the activity and the silent harmony of the frame is broken, decentered from the back to the right or the left (but never, of course, the front where the camera is). And yet, the camera is motionless, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. The cinematograph is perhaps a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes: to map the world, modify it, limit it, limit it. <br /> <br /> worse is the historical reality of the film. These workers are employees of Lumi√®re. The bosses spy on their workers, the invisible eye of his faceless minions. The film describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the doors, workers are confined to their workplace. The opening of the door seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, confining them further. The first film is also the first example of surveillance by video surveillance, an image of invisible and invisible authority that imprisons its servants. A scary film, too prophetic.
