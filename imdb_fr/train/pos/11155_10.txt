Young, handsome and muscular, Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York thinking of earning a living as a stud farm. He gets there and quickly discovers that it will not be easy - he goes through one degrading experience after another. At the end of his rope, he meets Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), crippled and shabby. Together, they try to survive, get out of the city and move to Florida. But will they do it? <br /> <br /> A very dark film, disturbing and yet fascinating. Director John Schelsinger paints a very dark portrait of New York City and its people. In this way, it is dated - the city may have been so bad in 1969, but it has already been cleaned up considerably. He also uses all camera tours of the book: the color changes to black and white; triumphant dream sequences; flash forward; flashbacks (especially in case of rape); shock cuts; strange sound effects ... you name it. You stay disoriented and off-center - but I could not stop looking. <br /> <br /> There is not really a story - it's about the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an implication that they might have been lovers (the last shot shows somehow that). This is just the portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold and cruel urban jungle. <br /> <br /> It was originally X ranked in 1969 - the only reason being that the MPAA did not think his parents would want their kids to see that. Nevertheless, high school students were very successful (at the time, X did not mean anyone under 17). He was also the only X rated film to win an Academy Award in the Best Film category. Hoffman and Voight were ready for an actor award, as was Sylvia Miles (mysteriously) who was in the picture for a total of (maybe) 5 minutes! It was finally lowered to an R (unbroken) when reissued in 1980. <br /> <br /> The excellent song "Everybody's Talkin '" was also featured in this movie - and became a big hit . <br /> <br /> A great movie --- but very dark. I do not see it on commercial television. It's cut into ribbons and incomprehensible.
