An amazing little English movie for so many reasons. First it is a rare look of Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. Although his performance is not up to the average he would have defined as one of the greatest players of the twentieth century, he is perfectly credible as a lawyer deceived. Historically, this film has a great interest for the place and the time when it was shot. Being English, he did not have the big budget of Hollywood movies of the same era and this is often seen, but it is interesting to note that this film was shot just before the war and shows an England that would soon be gone. When we look at it today, we think in terms of modern morality and review the fact that this film and its closest American counterpart, "It Happened One Night", were in their day as risky as "Fatal Instinct" in our time. But after watching and enjoying this movie the first time, I can not help but feel sadness when I look at it today. With half of the films shot before 1950 being sold out, saving the remaining films involves difficult choices. Unfortunately, movies of this type are often missed to save movies that we all consider important. The color change, the lack of contrast and the generally poor quality of the impression most often seen are heartbreaking. This movie with "It Happened One Night" is perfect for snuggling up against a lover, under a blanket, on a cool evening and watching, or better why not a double feature.
