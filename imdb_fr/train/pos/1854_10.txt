Having developed a critical eye for film and a love for good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher, symbolic breathing. Although I am a flawless fan of Denzel Washington - both for his acting talent and for his public figure; I am a fairly honest fan to admit the (very rare) times he did not quite succeed in a movie or two. And I could be wrong about these - after all, I'm not an actor. But it was different - Denzel would put his career experience in the service of a film about one of the most sensitive topics that a man knows - child abuse. As his debut as a director, no less. And develop the film so that it successfully presents the triumph of a man. I did not want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I was not. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a film full of promise that connected diverse audiences and gave those who had no viewer experience a brief, but sincere, look at the life of a young man whose childhood was a hell, but who triumphed despite everything. This film did it - and no dry eye of any color of the theater has proved it. Someone must know the topics in this film to know when the truth is presented. It takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you have not experienced it. And if he manages to attract more audiences and make him react emotionally without mercy, the filmmaker has done his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or polka dots. That's what makes good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and especially Antwone Fisher, you have won.
