I must admit that when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance", I was a little skeptical. "Steamy"? In a film of 1968 ?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized that the shoot was entirely black and white, I knew that my erotic expectations were broken. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong! This film contains not only all the elements of a torrid romance - the discovery of first love, the fear that the secret is discovered, a sudden and unexpected end - but this film has sometimes been downright erotic. You will soon forget that it is shot in black and white. Cinematography deserves all the honors it has received over the years. And the performances of the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so they're both in their mid-20s trying to play college kids. It's 1968. Do you really expect teenagers in the 60's to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? At the time, many adult women were still trying to control their sexuality. Anyone looking for real teenagers here is expecting too much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure. she nevertheless managed to leave much to the imagination, preferring to give us poetic descriptions to add to what has been shown to us. <br /> <br /> I do not doubt that lesbians will identify with the characters here. When it comes to straight guys who like to watch lesbians in action: Although it's not all you expect, I do not think you'll be too disappointed.
