I'm 60 years old, I'm a guitarist (lead / rhythm) and in the last forty years I've been in four bands, everything is there, the fighting, the faults, the rotten food, the worst accommodation, always traveling , little or no money, and everyone was drunk or high. But clubs, fans and music have been worth it! Just like Strange Fruit! I'm too old for that now, and arthritis in my hands and hips does not want to move, but for the length of this video, everything came back, and everything was there! Birds, fights and alcoholic drinks! And I was still young! It's like the voice of Billy Connolly, God loves this thing of the 70s! Rock On Forever!
