<br /> <br /> Robot jox is an excellent little movie. Some decors are bad and the acting is not very good, but the special effects are very good for a movie of this size and age. Remember that this movie is over 10 years old now and that it was shot very cheaply in 1st place, so you can not complain about the negatives. So sit back and watch a cool movie with big robots.
