Having no knowledge of this film until I saw it on Rialto Channel, I found it pleasant, poignant and rewarding. <br /> <br /> The casting was excellent. I loved all the characters, they were a bit exaggerated in places (but it's a movie). His appearance and the exciting turn of the main character took until they turn out badly, as can real life. Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was particularly interested in watching this film once it started because people joke so often about her acting abilities (I find it rather strange because she is still a strong actress in my opinion) . <br /> <br /> I loved the moment at the end when Andy's character said "sometimes I feel like he's never been there", etc. I think by Chopin, which was a nice way to finish (except the light comedy at the end, which was probably useless). <br /> <br /> I say "congratulations" to the directors - I have seen 1,000 s of worst movies!
