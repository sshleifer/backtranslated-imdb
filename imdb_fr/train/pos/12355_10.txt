I can understand those who do not like this film because of a lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, these girls are not Geisha, but brothel tenants, and those who do not know the difference will not understand half of the movie, and certainly not the end. This is a complete work of art about women's lives and the needs of that time. Everything is important, and the way they dress is certainly more than just words. For those who thought it was a boring geisha movie, I suggest you read a bit about this company before drawing a conclusion that is so irrelevant. This is Kurosawa's work, it's his life, and I'm sure the director understands the silent meaning of Kurosawa's work in the appropriate intellectual range.
