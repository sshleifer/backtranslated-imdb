Saving Grace is a movie that feels good with your heart in the right place. Grace recently became a widow and realizes that her late husband left her with a lot of debt. She could lose her beautiful home and see no other solution to her misery than starting to grow marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most viewers would like to live and the villagers are all wonderful people that most viewers would like to have as neighbors. There is only one problem with this image: it's the way she describes the effect of marijuana on her user. It is obvious that no actor or writer of this film has ever actually smoked. The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and supposedly funny. It is precisely in these scenes that the spirit is replaced by the English slapstick, and it's a shame for a film that is nonetheless very pleasant.
