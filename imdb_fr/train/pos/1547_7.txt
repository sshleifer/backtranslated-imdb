Like almost everyone who commented on this film, I can only wonder why it never appeared in a video. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him at the age of 12 at "The Late Show", around 1972. I also remember the poison gas attack and horses with strange clothes. (I do not remember the most horrible passages I've seen here, they were probably made for the TV audience.) But the scenes I REALLY loved were those involving the death of Lord Kitchener on board HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. The scenes of the cursed cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were really terrifying, if I remember correctly. <br /> <br /> Do not remember the score, but the comments of others now make me curious. Get this one on video!
