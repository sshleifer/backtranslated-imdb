I have a six month old baby at home and from time to time she struggles very badly to sleep. One morning, she had trouble falling asleep when the doodle bop theme song was broadcast on T.V. She stopped crying almost instantly, and the rest of the show was happy. I sat her in her inflatable seat and watched her kicking her, moving her arms and actually laughing at this show. She kept her entertained and happy all the time. I also had a video of them so that sometimes, when my little one is troubled, I have something to calm her down. Certainly, late at night, if she wakes up with colic, doodles are not her cup of tea, but they will be useful when it will take me a little time to clean, etc. The biggest surprise about doodle bods is that my child does not even like to watch T.V. She prefers to play with a toy or with our little poodle that look T.V. Yet, the doodle bods have totally captured his attention. I do not know if she will continue to love them, but for now, she is attached.
