This film has received horrible criticism from everyone who voted here, but I am here to say that if you like movies like Dude Wheres my car and Dumb and Dumber, this movie is for you. If you like movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id, you have to look at it from a different angle. However, I still love this film and everything that happens there, even if it's a bit "funny", it's one of the few films that my friends and I could watch over the years. years and quote as much as possible. SUPER FILM. This film should be number 1 AFI because its class is so disconcerting. The only problem with this film is that you might have trouble seeing it because it was a movie made for television on a channel that no longer exists. So, I do not know how to get this movie, I would like to buy it for a DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. I have always recorded it from the moment it was set up, you can come if you want and watch it, but I sleep maybe. this film is rocking and that's all you need to know.
