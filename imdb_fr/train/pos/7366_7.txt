This is a movie that the mainstream market will probably never have access to because it does not really allow the viewer to look easily. The story of Spike and his friend Heaton, in trouble, is not exactly a Friday night movie, but it has a unique advantage and I found it entertaining. There are brilliant moments as the film was shot on such a small budget, for example when Spike inhales the aerosol. However, I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and to be honest, it made me spend most of the movie trying to solve the problem. And also I did not like the fact that most of the film was spent with the two friends talking and not really much "action". It's a complex little movie to watch and that's what makes it attractive.
