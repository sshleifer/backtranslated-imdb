An absolutely enjoyable song and dance film starring Frank Sinatra and General Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> The film wins the prize and the award for the Oscar-winning score of George E. Stoll. Kelly, and the best photograph, as well as the nomination for best son for "I Fall in Love Too Easily" performed by Sinatra. <br /> <br /> It was a cute story where Kelly helped her boyfriend Sinatra to be in love with herself. The charming Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with her singing. We had a lot of wonderful songs and dance routines from Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the art of pianist chef JosÃ© Iturbi. /> A classic Hollywood music from a bygone era.
