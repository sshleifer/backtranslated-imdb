Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is an excellent film, not only the year it was shot, but also now. It is an art film that is not outdated, even in the 21st century. The director maintained a good narrative talent and thus made the story so fluid! <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the latest film of the new French wave: "Woman next door" by Fran√ßois Truffaut, which has the same theme.
