Since their divorce with the Disney Company (Disney keeping the brand Miramax), the company Weinstein seems to specialize in above-average films that are then poorly promoted and seen by few people. THE FLOCK is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> This story will tell you more about sex offenders than over a whole season of law Order - SVU. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere gives his best performance of all time as an agent with a soft voice, exhausted by the task. Claire Danes, for once, has the opportunity to play a solid role (instead of the crap in which she is normally stuck) and she takes full advantage of the role of the novice. The cinematography, the stimulation, the editing, all this is first-rate - and I have not seen any trace of the jump of the camera with deficit of the attention / disturbance of the camera or the excesses of camera cuts of which others complained. The subject is treated with restraint, but remains a difficult subject and could make you sick. <br /> <br /> Fifty years ago, the types of sex crimes listed here abounded, which would even shock the jaded. Then come the decisions of the Supreme Court that simultaneously bind the hands of the police when the "rights" of the sexual perverts are open and that America is transformed into a shopping paradise for sexual perversity, consenting or not. The Liberals hailed each of these moves, which celebrated Warren Court's reprehensible acts with brilliant covers in Time and Newsweek. Everyday Liberals have also praised the Court's action and mocked those who do not agree. In 2007, how many Americans knew that the type of pornography describing the savage violence and torture of young women could be subscribed and that its delivery was subsidized by the US Post Office's discount magazine rate. Only part of the problem - a problem that can put anyone's family to nothing in powerlessness. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere is a Liberal, but he does his best in his work here. Maybe with age, he has acquired some wisdom.
