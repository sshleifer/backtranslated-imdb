Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is informed in prison of a perfect flight. As he is behind bars and can not do it himself, he has to leave that to his girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). Although there are five people who organize the crime, five people. The brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welcome to Collinwood (2002). This is a police comedy that is often very funny.You can not help but laugh when everything goes wrong with these guys. William H.Macy plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is Basil.Gabrielle Union plays his love interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays the loving interest of Pero Carmela.George Clooney (also producer) plays Jerzy, the guy tattooed in a wheelchair. It's a very entertaining film. I certainly recommend it.
