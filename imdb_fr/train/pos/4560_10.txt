I just got back from a showing of "My Left Foot" in our public library. What an emotional experience - I feel exhausted and inspired. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Christy Brown, Irish writer and painter, and based on the author's autobiographical, "My left foot". Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy such that the only limb he mastered was his left foot. The doctors informed his parents that he was desperately mentally retarded, but his mother had not abandoned him and, much like Annie Sullivan had done with Helen Keller, had helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he had learned the alphabet, then read, write and paint. <br /> <br /> This film won the Oscars by Daniel Day-Lewis (best actor) as well as the best actress in a supporting role for the actress playing her mother; he has also received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Match. <br /> <br /> As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, many films can entertain me, but many also often leave me with fictions or improbabilities behind realistic psychological reactions. <br /> <br /> This film is not this film: it is a film that perfectly describes the roles and behaviors of typical Irish parents (see, for example, typical Irish families in "Ethnicity & Family Therapy" ) as well as Christy Brown's uneven emotional maturation - some immature reactions of the personality further magnified by his father's features. <br /> <br /> The film presents the greatest truth while modifying certain sequences its development (painting and writing) and the condensation of several important personalities in one person, with the aim of telling a coherent and credible story, without being bothered by small distracting realities less important. (See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more details.) The DVD version that was presented to us included English subtitles that helped us a lot in understanding Christy's speech (and some of the Irish speeches); this may have been missing at the film's release. (If you see this on a DVD, enable this option.) <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is one of the greatest and most real acting jobs I've ever seen. Really beautiful, exceptional, superlative. <br /> <br /> "My left foot" presents more than a resemblance to a more recent film, "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly", in that each one portrays the life of a real person Successfully overcoming the imprisonment and the isolation of an extremely serious physical disability. <br /> <br /> And, in doing so, it resonates with William Ernest Henley's "Invictus" which begins: "From the night that covers me, // Black as a pole-to-pole pit, // I thank all the gods that are // for my invincible soul. "
