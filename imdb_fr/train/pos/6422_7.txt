Military training movies are becoming so common that they become a genre in itself. Among the most important, we have "Officer and a gentleman", "Top Gun", "GI Jane" and now "Men of Honor". The fact that it is true does not change the fact that the formula is the same. This movie probably looks more like GI Jane because it focuses on the angle of desegregation. <br /> <br /> The story is actually quite inspiring and is probably the best story of human interest among those mentioned above. Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is unquestionably a man of great courage and good principle, and his strength of character shines brightly in this film. Unfortunately, the director George Tillman has the vision of a tunnel by presenting the characters and avoids the development of characters characters other than Brashear in favor of showing Brashear in a state of constant adversity. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure and, with the exception of the original scene, the hand-to-hand fight and some scenes with his wife, we do not know much about him. For example, Brashear sees the scars on the palms of the Sunday and we must assume that he has worked with a plow, but there is no follow up on this. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) gets only one scene to judge him. The rest of his time on the screen shows him pacing. If a director wants to make a story of human interest, he must humanize the characters. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. gives outstanding performance as Brashear. It's probably the best I've seen. He's a much more complete role and character than anyone he's played before, and he's up to the job. In "Jerry Maguire," Rod Tidwell was a fascinating but unidimensional character, with the depth of a puddle of rain. Brashear is much more complex and rooted, and the problems he faces are life crises, making the game much more difficult. This is an excellent cover of Gooding's last role in Chill Factor, a movie so appalling that it was almost a professional suicide to play the role. <br /> <br /> After a trial as a comedian ("Analyze This", "The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle", "Meet the Parents"), Robert DeNiro has returned to his dramatic roots with an exceptional performance. DeNiro is not a bad comedian, he's such a big actor that he should not waste his time doing comedy. DeNiro gives Billy Sunday a hard personality like a soul that tortures a tortured soul. It's a pleasure to watch him work. <br /> <br /> It seems like every movie I watch recently has Charlize Theron. I saw "The Legend of Bagger Vance", "Men of Honor" and "The Yards" just after and I began to wonder if she had participated in every film in 2000 (in fact, she did not only five). It was a minor role for Theron, but she did well and managed to stay with DeNiro step by step. David Keith, who played alongside Richard Gere in "Officer and a Gentleman", has a cameo here <br /> <br /> The DVD contains some interesting peculiarities, including reflections of the real Carl Brashear and deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie despite the tired plot and the unidimensional presentation. I rated it 7/10. I am a con for stories of outsiders and I have a penchant for stories where strength of character is the central theme. This film is particularly strong in both areas and offers us two memorable actor performances that compensate for some of the director's weaknesses.
