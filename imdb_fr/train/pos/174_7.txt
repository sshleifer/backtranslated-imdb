Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the Mexican region, is a bit dark, to put on gently. She drives an old clunker and rents a small room to a homosexual couple. However, she saves the life of an eminent Arab by taking a bullet in the back that was intended for the person in charge. She charms the national press with her crazy remarks and her sweet looks. Sniffing out an opportunity, the presidential aides have it installed in the US government protocol service. Even then, she sometimes disturbs, but she does her best and learns a lot. It even attracts the romantic attention of a State Department official. But, is there another grim plot in the making, involving an Arab man who wants to take another woman? A blond? MDR MDR MDR. This film presents Goldie as pretty as an image and as silly as a fox, as they say. Sunny trains very well in the jungle of the US government. She even has important things to say about honesty and its lack in its protocol environment. The Arab community may be less pleased with this work, but praise it today for those who like to laugh.
