The tracer for the eyes was worn almost 6000 years ago in Egypt. Really not so exaggerated to be in the 12th century. I did not realize that the show had collapsed. There is a second broadcast season now, is not it? It's amazing to me when the comments are made by those who are uninformed or who do not watch a program at all. It is a waste of space on the boards and the time of others. The first show in the series was perhaps a little painful as the cast began to take shape, but that is to be expected. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can not wait for the second season to start in the United States.
