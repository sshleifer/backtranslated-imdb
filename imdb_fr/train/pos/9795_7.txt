Bruce acts strangely mostly outside of the character, villains are reused from the latest movies, and although the action scenes are exciting, they are not really new. It also lacks the dramatic impact of other films, especially that of "Sub-Zero", heavy in dramaturgy and character development. <br /> <br /> Everything in the film seems well recycled and the secondary characters are charming but nobody is worth taking root. <br /> <br /> All this time, I really enjoyed it, I burst and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising, but it was not as exciting as me. d hoped. <br /> <br /> (** half on ****)
