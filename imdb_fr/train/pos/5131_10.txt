Jammin 'the Blues is an Oscar-nominated short film from 1944 that consists essentially of 10 minutes of improvised jazz played in a long jam. Marie Bryant sings "The sunny side of the street" at one point for the climax of the film, then jitterbugs with Archie Savage to carry out this most entertaining "jam session". Director Gojn Mili was a photographer and this experience is illustrated by some of the double exposure shots of some musicians, making it one of the most innovative angles of the 40s. According to some notes, one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette to reflect the social attitudes of the time. Too bad. Still, this most unusual movie of the moment is available on YouTube, so if you like jazz, I suggest you pick it up.
