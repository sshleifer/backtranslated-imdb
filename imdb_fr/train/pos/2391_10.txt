My husband and I love DoodleBops as much as our 8 month old baby. We bought him DVDs and CDs so we could watch and listen to them ourselves. They are fun, energetic and very entertaining. They encourage children to be active, to share and to care. They always have a positive message and fun entertainment. Whenever our son hears the theme of the song, he quickly turns his head towards the television and begins to leap with excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a beautiful voice. Moe is a great dancer. I would recommend the DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You can not help but smile and want to dance when you hear it.
