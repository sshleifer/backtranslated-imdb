This first melodrama of Sirk, shot in black and white, is a minor film, which shows yet the talent of the German director who has transformed tired stories into works of art. Located in the 1910s, Barbara Stanwyck is the woman who sinned by abandoning her husband and family in the small town to attract the attraction of the Chicago scene. She never fulfills her ambitions and is brought back to her hometown by an enthusiastic letter from her daughter informing her that she too is passionate about theater (a high school production). Back in her old town, she once again comes up against the small mentality and has to face her hostile elder daughter, her disconcerted (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and his ex-lover. The plot is nothing new, but Sirk stands out by creating meaningful compositions, each image being carefully filmed, and he is extremely helped by the fact that Stanwyck is his main wife. It lasts 76 minutes, and that's just as good, because the material does not really have legs to go any further.
