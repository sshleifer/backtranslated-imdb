A woman, Mujar (Marta Belengur), enters a restaurant one morning at 19:35 unaware that a terrorist kidnapped people in the restaurant and made them play a musical number in this strange and fascinating short film that I only saw by finding on the DVD timecrimes equally fascinating director / writer. There was a pretty catchy song and it kind of made me smile, despite the general plot of the movie. I'm glad I stumbled over it (I did not know it would be a bonus when I rented the DVD) and I would not hesitate to recommend it to all my friends. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A-
