The biggest games of Kasparov or Fischer can be mess for a total rookie. It's a good movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. This is the clue! This is private land, built as a private enterprise. It is a self-destructive and self-organized plot. In conclusion, the scenario describes the perfect professional plot: private, self-organized, self-destructive, with no trace at the end. Everyone can be behind the plot: a smart "manager" with money. Everything can be done simply by delegation. The "director" must be just trigger. If the normal viewer can not see the essence of the plot in the explicit footage of the movie, a real plot is less likely to be discovered. All of the actors' performances are well done, with a special mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
