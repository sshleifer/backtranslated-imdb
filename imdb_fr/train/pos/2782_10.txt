"Bend It Like Beckham" is a little known film in the United States. This was probably due to the fact that the film was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football (football here), which some might find difficult to tell in the United States as well. This is unfortunate because this film is absolutely fantastic and deserves a lot. more coverage here. I think that the basis of the scenario (following a dream) is something that many people can relate to. In the end, "Bend It Like Beckham" turns out to be a good movie with a source of inspiration and a very good interpretation. I was not too eager to see this movie at first, but now I regret not seeing it earlier. I highly recommend this movie!
