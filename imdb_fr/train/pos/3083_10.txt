This deserves a 12 out of 10. An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. This show must come back, I have seen each episode and it's a real quality. <br /> <br /> The show is centered on a couple of New Yorkers, plays with the concept of six degrees of separation and cleverly interweaves their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are dazzling, as is the adorable Caseman. The scenery is amazing and the cabinets are exquisite. <br /> <br /> We need more shows like this so viewers feel like smart people, not thoughtless drones. <br /> <br /> If that never comes back, six degrees will be missed.
