It's my kind of movie. I am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that. But it's also a black comedy. Although I see it primarily as a horror / thriller, others might see it as a black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But anyway, it's a fascinating descent into madness. The end caught me off guard, but what an end! This leaves the viewer a lot of food for thought. <br /> <br /> Powerful performances, a complex and detailed plot, a superb scenario filled with dread and touches of humor and a strange atmosphere make this film a must-see film. <Personally, I think I will have to look at this a few more times to understand and understand all the subtleties it contains. But it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore to do it.
