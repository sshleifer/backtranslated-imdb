I really enjoyed the debut of Hideo Nakata, the director of the Ring. If you've ever seen Ring, you'll be familiar with the style and idea of ​​this movie. There is a subtle phantasmagoria that works better than the constant (and predictable) stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre. If you like movies that give you chills, you'll probably like this one. A good scary start to Hideo Nakata. 8/10
