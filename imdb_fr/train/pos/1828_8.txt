Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's St Ives, the film tells the story of a young French hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic wars. Captured in action, he was sent to a POW camp in the Scottish Highlands, led by Major Farquhar (Richard E. Grant). He falls in love with a girl from the city (Anna Friel) and befriends the major. and discovers that his long-lost grandfather, who fled France during the revolution, lives right on the road! The enthusiastic performances of all the actors and some memorable lines make it an above-average offer.
