I saw this film on television many years ago and I saw this movie when I recorded it. I thought it was reasonably well done. It was not the best of all the movies, but it was pretty good. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially the youngest. The acting was good, with Danny Glover at the head of the cast. The plot was not very credible, but the script was well written. This film may also be of interest to baseball fans. This does not apply directly to an action-packed sports film. This applies directly to a beautiful movie that you can watch with family and learn hidden messages in this movie. Overall, the movie was good, but not great. I give this film a 7/10.
