I suggested renting this film to my friend and he was obliged because he had already seen the film and he said that everything was fine. I thought the title was a little silly because the version of our store was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I was expecting this movie to be a bit of a Halloween scam with a killer wooden guy. But it started with a good scene and the killer immediately murdered two victims and burst twenty years later when his son saw him kill both people (including his mother) and he even saw him. His father's suicide goes to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he tries to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with the spirit of his father. Good enough for a suite and I have never even seen the first one.
