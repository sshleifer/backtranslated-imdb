It started slowly after an excellent animated introduction, as the director had a group of characters and a school setting to develop. Once the bet is launched, the movie speeds up because it is a race against the clock to find out if a certain number of worms can be eaten at 19 hours. On returning home, we had a good opportunity to discuss some things with our son: bullying, helping others, paying attention to the matter when you do not want to do anything. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the girl played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director suddenly brings her in unexpectedly and when she is on the screen, she is captivating. She's one of those faces, "Hey, she looks familiar," and then I remembered that she was the little girl Pepsi had introduced about eight years ago. She was also in "Paulie", this movie about the parrot trying to find his way home. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Eisenberg made numerous appearances on television and in cinema between 1999 and 2000, but was not seen much in the coming years. She is now 14 and growing up to become a beautiful woman. His smile really warms the screen. If she can get more good roles, she could have such a good career (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, another nominated actress of three other kids, but fortunately without some of the problems that Osment has experienced recently. <br /> <Anywhozitz, according to my 8 year old son, who just finished reading the story, the film does not seem to follow the book very well, but entertaining all the same. The end of the movie seemed to be a big install for some suites (how to eat sluggish slugs? Snail style for kids?), Which might not be such a bad thing. It was good to get the family to see a movie without having to worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of the film is the respect / fear caused by the principal, Mr. Burdock. (Hotplate). Nowadays, movies tend to show adult authority figures like jesters. Although he had a particularly naughty scene, he led the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin working.
