Sensational. Something of a surprise. Although defective, it is much better than I expected. <br /> <br /> The all-new Arcturus spacecraft, with some 3,000 passengers, is in the final days of its sixteen-day journey to Jupiter. Without warning, the Cerebral (mainframe) of the ship sounds an alarm in case of disaster and orders everyone to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon, only a handful of people remain, including one of the ship's astrogators (Penny), the captain (Cary) and the director of the shipping company (Kenyon). <br /> <It turns out that the alarm was wrong and that the main brain is acting erratically. The remaining passengers and crew must flee <br /> <br /> and avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The film starts very well. Opening advertising is a very good idea. There are obvious parallels with 2001: the Space Odyssey and the historic sinking of the Titanic. The film sometimes slows down and has rhythm problems but is usually well done and well done.
