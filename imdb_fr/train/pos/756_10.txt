I must say that even if I despise this kind of shows, I am a girl, I feel that I must express my opinion. I had already seen Dirty Sanchez before seeing Jackass, and I think it surpasses Jackass in terms of creating programs. Stories and interviews are woven to create a more interesting show. The other night, I saw a few minutes of the film Jackass and I could not believe how badly it was. It had to be the easiest show to edit, shockingly amateurish. Although drinking vomit is not really my thing, Dirty Sanchez is a long way from the Jackass league.
