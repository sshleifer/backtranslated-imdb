It was a wonderfully funny comedy with an excellent cast. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfectly chosen as parents, and the kids were great too. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice for playing Bridget, who was sort of a softened version of Kelly Bundy of Married with Children. The writing and performances were excellent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series and that put a brake on things. They had to scramble to switch sets and bring in more cast members, and this was obviously an uncomfortable situation, but they handled it well. James Garner was a good addition. It could have been longer if Ritter had lived. <br /> <br /> I really liked him a lot when they brought Ed O'Neill to a guest. It was great. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
