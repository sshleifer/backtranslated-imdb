I find Alan Jacobs' criticism very specific about the film, but I had the opportunity to rent the blockbuster DVD with a commentary from the BYU curator, Arch's Motion Picture Archives James. Heber J. Grant, LDS prophet at the time, approved the film, including deviations from historical content for dramatic expression and telescopic events. For example, the film showed Joseph Smith in trial. despite Brigham Young's great oratory in Joseph Smith's defense, he was nevertheless sentenced. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith has never been convicted. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed before the trial.
