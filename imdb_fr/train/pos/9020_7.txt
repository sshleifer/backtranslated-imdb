The Theory Of Flight is an engaging character study of an artist (Branagh) eager to break free from boredom and mediocrity, and a terminally ill patient (Bonham-Carter) in the final stages of the ASL, confined to a wheelchair, who wants love to a man before dying. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham-Carter breathes the spirit, the challenge and the independence as an ASL patient who is virtually dependent on those around her to care for her. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh, condemned by community service to take care of her, completes Helena's charm with a gloomy melancholy, creating a captivating and sentimental love story in which two people are trying to help one another to find the path of happiness.
