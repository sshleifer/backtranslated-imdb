A thin story with many beautiful shots. Eyecatchers are the three ladies of the D.R.E.A.M. team. And, to a lesser extent, the guy who accompanies them. Traci Lords is convincingly acting on the female half of a couple of evil business people who intend to poison the world with antrax. Original in this film is the bombshell, put on a captured member of the team D.R.E.A.M. Of course, she is saved by a co-member three seconds before the explosion. Although clearly lent by James Bond's "Goldfinger" and "You only live twice," such a climax still works well. In summary, James Bond has replaced three Charlie's Angels here.
