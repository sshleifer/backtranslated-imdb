Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It's raw, painful and realistic, but very entertaining. Lead actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who will become Academy Award-winning actors, deliver incredible performances. Voight as a Texas burglar, Joe Buck, who emigrates from Texas to New York to become a hustler. He does not apologize for the job he has chosen but it is not so easy. New York women like the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass by Sylvia Miles, nominated for the Oscars, are different from Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape his life in Texas. He was raised by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by the wonderful actress Ruth White, who died of cancer in 1969. The New York scene is beautiful to watch, as is the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and the characters from Buck evolve into a touching friendship. Men struggle to survive the life of New York City by breaking the rules, like getting a real job. As the film progresses, Buck's past surfaced and he haunts but is unclear. The film is not for kids but compared to today's movies and TV shows, Midnight Cowboy could be more tame. I can not forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party you can not forget. It's also a movie tearer, so get out your guys too.
