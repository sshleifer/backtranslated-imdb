The people who produced this masterful film have served a novel that is perhaps the best fiction work ever published on human guilt and responsibility. Nolte takes the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr. and makes it his own, staying true to Vonnegut's description of a man who lost ALL (to and) for love. <br /> <br /> No weakness in this good adaptation.
