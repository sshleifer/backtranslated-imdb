Dude, it's a hard to find DVD. I could only find it on Region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it worth it? Well yes. Not so much because it is a masterpiece of cinema, though directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com reads "Robert" but the generic DVD Curt list), or because it contains a few known characters from other mysteries of murder - Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gomez - but because my curiosity about the film for a decade has finally been satisfied. <br /> <br /> A respected but independent engineer (Alan Curtis) was retained by his ex-wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two show tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to hers and politely invites him to join him during the musical review. She agrees, a little sadly. The mopey bartender watches them both as they leave. <br /> <br /> During the show, the unleashed star realizes that this lady of the public wears the same hat and leaves stage with anger. The drummer of the group, Cook, looks at the silent lady but receives no answer. Curtis takes the woman home and asks her name, but she will not give it and she does not want to know his name. If she had been a Longfellow fan, she would have talked about ships passing through the night. <br /> <br /> OK, Curtis goes home to find that his wife was murdered in his absence. The chief of police, Gomez, hands it over to the prosecutor. His only alibi is that he was with a ghostly woman that nobody seems to remember - neither the bartender nor the Latina star nor the taxi driver ("Al Alp") nor the drummer - and from the woman she -even. has disappeared, it is impossible to find it. <br /> <br /> Curtis is convicted and sentenced to death. But Inspector Gomez thought it over and decided that she was probably innocent, because no one with a brain invented such a stupid story. He joins Curtis' beloved secretary, Ella Raines, for a new informal investigation into the case. <br /> <br /> They visit again to the supposed witnesses. The sinister bartender is crushed by a car, maybe accidentally, so it's irrelevant. The choleric Latina left because of the closure of the series. It is uncooperative and simply ignores the source of the hat. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by the real murderer, but not before being staged in a scene where he beats drums in an improvised jazz band. His sweaty face takes on an expression that does not suggest intense concentration, but rather a monstrous and orgasmic madness. His eyes shine on the ceiling, his gaping mouth, his pounding becomes frenetic. I laugh aloud. <br /> <br /> No one's performance is otherwise remarkable, but all are professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. The best performance, however, is probably Franchot Tone. He is the real murderer and he simulates his alibi. He is reserved and artistic. Even when he faints, he is decorative. I do not know how to say that precisely, but Tone seems to think and simply play her role. Alan Curtis, as an innocent engineer, is close to zero on the Kelvin scale and appears in photo B. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it's considered classic. It's really your basic murder mystery of Cornell Woolrich, not as good as some of his others. But the direction of Siodmak is sensitive. A man is overthrown and his hat is wrapped in a gutter surrounded by water. Its use of shadows is discreetly effective. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I got it.
