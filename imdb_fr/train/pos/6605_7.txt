2054. Paris is an Escher drawing with people and vehicles rushing on several levels in an obvious homage to Fritz Lang's metropolis. Paris is both ultramodern and decomposing. And between the surveillance, a young and pretty medical researcher is kidnapped just after leaving her sister in a shabby nightclub. A tough police captain investigates. Presented in black and white, with dark corridors, dark alleys and lighting at a source characteristic of the harshest black film, comparisons with Sin City are inevitable. But history owes more to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than to Frank Miller: high-tech surveillance, stealthy, almost-invisible combinations, and ruthless super-corporations are as much a part of the landscape as guns and cars. The film never generates the harrowing atmosphere of Gibson's cyberpunk vision, with its marginal characters laden with technologies that clash with the industrial types of businesses that seem to have their own Department of Fear, but the viewer definitely feels that Paris no utopia and future science is less than benevolent. And as the procedural intrigue of the police unfolds, we are plunged into the darkest recesses of individual ambition under the brilliant veneer of Avalon's cultured public relations image. The motion capture process used here gives an appearance somewhere between B & W comics and next-generation rotoscopy. It is either captivating or intrusive, depending on your tastes. Nevertheless, a great visual sense is displayed here, and the future Paris is filled with minute details giving the photo a unique aspect, both spartan and baroque. Well worth a look.
