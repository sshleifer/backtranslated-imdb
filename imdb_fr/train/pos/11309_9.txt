A masterly treatment of James Caine's film "The Factor Always Rings Twice" as Luchino Visconti's first film shot mainly around Ferrara in a war-torn Italy. It was thought that the original negative had been destroyed, but Visconti kept an imprint and, fortunately, today we can see this neo-realistic work. Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who had recently unveiled her breasts at La Cena delle beffe "(1941), are the main characters of the sensual and unlucky lovers who plot to kill her husband - an unusual end in which, although the crime does not no, we pay in a way that is not directly related to the crime. "Director, script, interpretation and cinematography excellent. This would not be as good as the" The Last Turn "French (1939) but probably better than the version American (1946) with Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles.
