This film is hilarious, original and beautifully made. I have become a group of BIG BAD SWIM, directing it to film festivals whenever I can. I've seen it about half a dozen times now, and every time, the enthusiastic response from the audience has confirmed to me that it's one of the best films to be released in years. Just about every festival he has screened has been sold or won the public's favorite award. It's clear that people love this movie, and even why they do it. Cinematography is superb, the characterization and play of brilliant actors, the fantastic ending and the direction filled with compassion, wisdom and the art of perfect timing. It's hard to believe that this is Ishai Setton's first film. I hope it will be released soon so that everyone can see it.
