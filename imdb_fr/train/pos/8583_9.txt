The Korean War has been dubbed the Forgotten War of the Americas. So many unanswered questions were buried with the 50,000 men who died there. From time to time, we see a play or movie about this distant frozen ghostly cemetery. Here is perhaps one of the best. It's called "Sergeant Ryker". The story is that of an American soldier called Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin) who is selected for a very secret mission by his commander. His job is to visit the North Koreans and offer his services against the United Nations forces. Its cover is so successful that it is invaluable for the enemy and given the rank of major. However, he is subsequently captured by the Americans, brought to justice as a traitor and spy. Declaring that he was ordered to defect, he sadly learned that his commander had been killed and had no proof or proof of his innocence. He is found guilty and sentenced to hang. However, Attorney Young (Bradford Dillman) doubts his conviction. Convincing General Amos Baily (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubts, he is granted a new trial and if found guilty, he will be executed. The drama in the courtroom is excellent, as is the cast, which includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was a distant land, but the possibility of condemning a Communist and suspending him was very close to home in the 1950s. Because of his superior writing and his powerful message, this drama became a hallmark of the hall hearing. Excellent viewing and recommended to all. ****
