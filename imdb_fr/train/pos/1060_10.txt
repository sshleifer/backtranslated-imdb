Dark Angel is a mix of Huxley's Brave New World and Percy Love in the Ruins - portraying the future in the not-too-distant future as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. Once one has swallowed the principle that "the Pulse" can block any modern technology, it offers an entertaining landscape to explore the personality and relationships between the two main characters - Max (the Dark Angel / Courier Messenger) and Logan (the rich rebel). This seems uneven, perhaps the result of a variety of authors, but it is held by Jessica Alba, a beautiful, charming and energetic, who seems both strong and insensitive, but vulnerable and sensitive. I think Fox did it again.
