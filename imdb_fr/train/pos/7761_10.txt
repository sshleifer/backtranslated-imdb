*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Published in 1956 and considered quite racy at the time, Douglas Sirk's melodrama is still wonderful. The plot concerns events in a dysfunctional Texan family rich in oil, including the insecure, weak, hurt and very alcoholic big brother Kyle, played by Robert Stack in a very touching and vulgar performance and his sister Marylee way of Dorothy Malone. Ms. Malone's representation is telegraphed to us through her eyes, which she uses to show us her emotions, mostly composed of lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I have ever seen in movies to get into the eyes of a play. Now, do not get me wrong, his performance, to say the least, is an absolute delirium and one of the most important roles in the 1950s camp. But it's also terrible, because it's so nice and attractive as Malone is, she is not a very good actress and she is not able to do subtlety or shading. His performance is of a grade. She manages to make a nasty mambo, and in a superb montage, like the dad without love played by the always good Robert Keith falls dead, climbing a staircase, Sirk mixes it with an almost mad malone doing an orgasmic dance undressing. Stack (who should have won an Oscar) and Malone (who won the award, but should not do it) are the real stars of the film, those who put all the hysteria in movement, both sexual and sexual, "true stars "of the film, Hudson & Bacall fades into gray & brown, the colors in which they are mainly costumed. Hudson, who was a better actor, was later credited for Stack's Best Friend plays, and Malone's stooge who moaned and groaned on Rock for most of the film. But Hudson does not want any part of her and is in love with Bacall, married to Stack. Nobody is very happy and nobody is happy for a very long time. The Stack-Bacall marriage breaks up after a year and Stack is almost drunk in oblivion because he thinks he's sterile and can not give Bacall a baby to prove he's a man. Sirk, a very intelligent man who had a long and fascinating career in film and theater in Germany, ended his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid-1950s with a series of "women's movies" or melodramas bright and intense colors. Although they were mainly adapted from medical equipment or trash, they became Sirk's masterpieces of the genre. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design that he had brought to these films, filling his big screen with characters who were playing their emotional lives between strange color combinations and lighting, making shadows and a lot of inverted reflections. In "Writing", the characters peek through the window, listen at the door or sneak. Thus, in the end, after much violence, accidental murder, miscarriage and more, Sirk finishes the film with a final and surprising scene depicting a "rebirth" and reforming Malone in a man-sized suit, sitting at a desk and discovering a miniature oil well.
