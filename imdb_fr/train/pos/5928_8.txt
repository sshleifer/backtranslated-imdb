It's not a good movie but I still love it. The Clovis cat is gold in a jar, as is the principle of the cats themselves - intrinsically opposed to the wicked sleepwalkers. I think there is more in this film than what people realize, basically it is very hard, but this abruptness can sometimes be good. It has the old-fashioned lines, the abrupt end and a comic element conveyed by the ruined police. <br /> <br /> Has anyone found the incestuous element a little disturbing? In the end, this film is acrimonious casually and randomly, which is quite effective, I compare it to Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, the change of protagonists. I think that abruptness also works, it's not a film that you want to lengthen, it only works if it is short. <br /> <br /> I still do not know if the director has lacked depth or if he did. We know that these things make sense, we know that Stephen King has the ability, but I have not even read his books, I have only seen a few of his films. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it. If you like hard, tacky movies with 80's, look at it. but do not wait too much. It's so bad that it's good.
