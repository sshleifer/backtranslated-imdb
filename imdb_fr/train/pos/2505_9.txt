Many people think of it as a service film for fans because a lot of super stars playing in this movie (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom is a very famous singer in Japan). But do not judge him before looking, that's what I say. Gackt and the staff are very serious when making this film and they worked so hard. It's a good movie with a delicate story inside. Many scenes can be so fun and others are so sad. They played so well that I can not stop looking at it. <br /> <br /> The story has written very well, but I admit that their act is not very disappointing. This is especially true for Hyde because his ability to play is underestimated and it is odd to hear the way when he speaks with another language, with the exception of his mother tongue (Japan). But that's understandable because it's the first time they play in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt is trying to show us how weak a person can be when they lose the most important person in their life. When Toshi was killed, when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che into a vampire like him because he would not let her die, when Sho's brother died, Kei Shoot Son died, and the best and beautiful scene is when Sho dies ~ Even though I said that Hyde's skill is still strange, I gave him two resounding hits to this scene! <br /> <br /> There is a time when the plot goes too fast without telling the reason why Son Son can join the group. the local mafia and Sho's enemy because they are good friends in the past and that Son is Sho's brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like this movie ~ (a lot ^^). <br /> <br /> It's an action movie with a beautiful touching story.
