I saw this movie more than 100 times, literally ... it's really packed with entertainment !!! Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981), I never thought an actor could capture "intensity" like Shatner and Liebmann in these roles, until I consider Boothe as Jim Jones. ! As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe is Jim Jones ... this movie captures his best performance !!!
