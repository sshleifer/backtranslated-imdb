When I started watching this anime, I never thought that making bread could be interesting, but fortunately I was wrong. As soon as I started to watch, the anime entered the world of bread making, I became addicted. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is his humor, which is very intelligent and very funny, with recurring gags. But the animation, the soundtrack and the development of the characters are below average, whereas these disadvantages are not enough present in the first episodes. Because of the excellent work done for this anime, it really begins to appear in the last 20 recurring gags are only getting older and are not as funny as before. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, if this anime ended with episode 52, I would have given it a 9, but the last episodes only leave a bitter aftertaste, which unfortunately can not be washed away by the 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
