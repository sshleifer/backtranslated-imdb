The handsome and dashing British British pilot George Taylor (a solid portrait of Guiseppe Pambieri) gets beaten by thugs after a hectic night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong (a beautiful and charming representation of the charming Chai Lee). George regains his health and goes back to work. When Emy does not want to hear about George for a long time, she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute. Although director / co-writer Bitto Albertini actually delivers a satisfying amount of expected nudity and hot sex, this film is anything but your dismal routine. Instead, it is a surprisingly thoughtful, touching and tragic love story between two well-drawn and very attractive characters (Chai as Emy Wong is particularly radiant and endearing). The photo starts in a sparkling and joyful way, but the tone changes dramatically to a darker, harder mood two-thirds of the end. The descent of Emy into vice after falsely assuming that George had abandoned her was dark and overwhelming; ditto the surprise ending surprisingly sad and heartbreaking. Of course, the story is certainly melodramatic, but never too stupid or trashy. In addition, sex scenes are good taste and even truly erotic. Famous Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a beautiful piece of support as a jealous and uninhibited secretary of George Helen Miller. The refined cinematography of Guido Mancori offers many stunningly beautiful shots of exotic locales. The funky and thrilling score of Nico Fidenco hits the spot. Worth a look for those looking for something different.
