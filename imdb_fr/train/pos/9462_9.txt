Family-friendly film. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was afraid I could not see Steve Carrell other than as a blunderer Michael from the office. Boy, I was wrong. He should win an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. My husband appreciated and he does not make movies of this type. I saw it with 2 other 30 year old couples and we all agreed it was the best movie we've seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest. 1 word of discussion! I do not even know why it was PG13. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, drama, romance and more!
