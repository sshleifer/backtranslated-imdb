The legendary Boris Karloff has ended his illustrious career by making four clunkers for scary movies in Mexico. This is the symbolic gothic horror entry of the period. Karloff gives a typically vivid and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval, an eccentric old patriarch who invites many of his unscrupulous, greedy and meditating grandparents to his scary castle to be abandoned for reading a testament. Soon, hateful customers are surprised by deadly wolves and toys that populate the place. The Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of the infamous "Tintorera" describes the dashing hero of the police and Julissa is absolutely delightful as the only friendly female character. The cumbersome and laborious scenario, the banal scenario, the ugly, the dilapidated cinematography, ridiculous decorations of murder (a big slob is sandblasted by a miniature canon!), An overheated partition, a morbid morose atmosphere, an essentially ugly game (Karloff in particular), a sweet cheey gore, a weak dubbing and a fiery and fiery ending all give this pleasantly awful lemon some endearing cruddy charm and so strangely amusing. A real mistake.
