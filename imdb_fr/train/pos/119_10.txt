The best way for me to describe Europa, which features prominently in the list of my favorite movies, is the exclamation of a companion that ended after the end of the film: "I did not know that movies could to be done this way. " Completely original in its visual style, this is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. It is as far from the style of filming "master and cover" that we can have; perfectly integrating many layers of images, sounds, effects, accessories, dialogues, voiceovers, performances, montages, lighting, etc., all equal, none being predominant. Despite the myopia of "dialogue" in Hollywood, cinema does not speak of dialogue, beautiful lighting, action or music. It works best when all elements are on an equal footing, where ONLY the FUSION of these elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, will communicate the idea. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of an element and the film does not make sense. "Europa" is what cinema should strive to be.
