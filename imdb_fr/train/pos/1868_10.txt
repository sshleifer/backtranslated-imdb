This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the worst of circumstances but, unlike many people, he became a respectable person. What's more, it's a true story. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same woman for 10 years and has never had fun with women, coca cola, cigars, grass, alcohol or any other popular product in places where growing. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this film, it is excellent. The only note I can give him is a 10/10.
