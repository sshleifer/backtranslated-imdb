This could be the most underrated movie of its kind. I do not remember seeing ads or ads for this one, which could explain why he did not do so well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and truly original horror film. I rank it in the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with snapshots of photos and newspaper articles about an assassin who calls himself "the hand of God". And then a man enters a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the murderer is his brother. Two of them leave together to go to a place where the victims are buried, which could help to solve the case. During this trip, the man begins to tell the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who, one day, claims to have received a divine message from God asking him to kill the demons who seem to be ordinary human beings. He receives from God a list of names of demons to destroy and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your place The tension is high, innocents (or demons?) get killed and religious experiences are put questioned. He does not have one but very few very smart twists at the end. If you like this kind of music, I highly recommend Frailty. I own the DVD and it's one of my favorite horror thrillers of all time.
