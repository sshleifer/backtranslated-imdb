This is so exciting! After seeing "The Wheel" this afternoon, a small light film, I consider it a real treat! It's absolutely charming and one of the most charming pictures I've seen this year. This is all the more surprising as it is an early walkie-talkie and is ashamed of beautiful images of the 30s because of its innovative use of sound in the cinema. It's just filled with music and an adorable mood that is really optimistic and, in the end, it made me happy! Obviously, it would not be so difficult to recover the lottery ticket sought by the main character, but the pace is so exhilarating and the film is so spectacular that I did not even think twice. The comedy is often hilarious and I think it is superior to the Marx Brothers, probably the greatest comic force of the time. It's pretty perfect.
