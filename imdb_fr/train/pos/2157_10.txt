Okay. As you can see, this is one of my favorite, if not favorite, movies. It's an absolutely hilarious character drama. The main character is a businessman who is stuck in a mentality of "same thing, different day". He sees a melancholy woman every day through the window of a dance studio on her train. He wonders about her and decides to find out more. He decides to take the dance class only to discover that she is not the instructor. From there, he connects with four other dancers and learns to love to dance and to discover the mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> There is no free sex (or other) involved, but just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed. <br /> <br /> This film was redone with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new film on appeal is as enjoyable as the original. The film never made the star in America because it was not eligible for the Oscars because it was broadcast on television in Japan (the films can not be broadcast on television or they are disqualified for nominations to Oscars). He has won numerous awards in Japan for the best film, the best cast, the director, etc. for his "Oscars".
