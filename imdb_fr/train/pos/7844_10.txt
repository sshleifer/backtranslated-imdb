I really like this show, it's like reading a book and each chapter leaves you wanting more. This makes you think of what will happen in the next episode and the difficulty of trying to maintain their friendship over the years. After each episode, it leaves a sweet bitter taste in the mouth, knowing that: One - The series was good, you can not wait for the next episode and it really makes you think about what really happens to friends during these twenty years . And two - the fact that the show has been "paused" and we will not see the show complete in its entirety. Fox obviously does not know what they did, they claim to lose 18- to 49-year-old viewers and clearly do not know what people want to see if they've gotten rid of a good show like " Meeting". I have a question I would like to raise. If this were to bring the show back and it would last another season, how would it work since each episode ends in one year and the story is based on what happens in twenty years? Your answers are welcome. Bring the Meeting back! Bring the Meeting back!
