Best animated film ever made. This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely astounding effects, but also the branches of the mind, soul and philosophy of man. The story features a family of cats where, in the dead older sister, the younger brother sees him and saves his body, but when she wakes up, she remains without a soul. So, the two brother cats embark on a journey to find him. I have told this trip to many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I look at it, I discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not so much in the physiological aspect of it, you will always love it. The animation is superb, and the creative scenes will have you attached to the screen. For example, the ocean froze in time, God soup soup out of the ground, a strange and slightly SNM blaming Hansel and Gretel. To conclude, Cat Soup is an absolute treat for everyone. <br /> <br /> PS- Not for kids, free violence included.
