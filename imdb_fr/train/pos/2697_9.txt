Nothing revolutionary here; A cinema impeccably elegant and sober. <br /> <br /> CUSTODY VIEW is confined almost exclusively to a dull police station, and mainly in an interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who has directed the wonderful other film) intersperse some spotting insights exterior paintings as a minimalist location scenography. Miller's restraint, particularly at the beginning, is breathtaking, and his exquisite manipulation of the inner staging, which results in a pivot, allows for captivating visualization. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is superb, as usual, succeeding in legitimizing a character on the paper, it's the clich√©: the laconic homicide detective, hard to cook, that tires the world. Ventura saw the role, making it quite believable, even though the script leaves us with little access to its inner workings; the film ends at the very moment when it appears that it will be forced to confront for the first time its failure. <br /> <br /> Michel Serrault is up to the task of the alleged killer who killed a child. cop mind. The exchanges between the two are more often than charged with tension and the aura of a playground in constant metamorphosis for a battle of wits. The character of Serrault is in turn deplorable, cunning and pitiful; then later .... <br /> <br /> The "message" of CARD, if we were looking for one, is a condemnation of the methodology used by the police and the kind of pressure that makes a cop too zealous if necessary, close the cases at the expense of justice. The film was hardly as long as an example of how to turn a potentially soporific scenario into a thrilling drama of the biggest film economy. <br /> <br />
