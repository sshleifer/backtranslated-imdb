This is very sneaky for all the 60s are turning to the film. The humor is sweet enough, but it has grown on me much more than I expected. The cast is first rate and they seem to have a wonderful time. Ustinov wanders in the film mumbling funny things in his breath, and all of this is inconsequential. I will buy the movie as soon as it comes out on DVD. The plot is that Estinov, released from prison and released from prison, masquerades as a computer scientist and embezzles money from an American company with an office in London. Maggie Smith has been her secretary for some time and watching her being fired many different jobs is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual impassive, and Karl Malden has fun as a dense and shady leader running the London office. The end is funny and very cynical.
