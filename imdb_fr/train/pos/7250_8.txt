I first read the book, when I was a teenager, and then I saw the movie late at night. About a year ago I checked IMDb and found no copies available. I then went on the Internet and found a site that offered War Movies. I am very happy to have done so. I ordered a copy, sat down and confirmed why I wanted to see him again. <br /> In my opinion to really appreciate the film, I suggest you get a copy of the book, then watch the movie. The book is no longer printed, but I found a copy via E-bay. The author Alan White was a commando / paratrooper during the Second World War and was involved in covert covert operations. This was his first book. It is written by someone who knows and this fact gives the book and the film an authenticity. I did not give the movie a number 10 just because of the nature of the end of the movie, not as good as the book. There are also two intrigues that differ from the book, which is strange, because it does not deal with the large-scale nature of war, but about the individual at war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have the copy of the book to let my son read, then the movie to let him look in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, the book and the movie are worth it. and I only wish it was more readily available for more readings and readings, one of my best war movies, ever!
