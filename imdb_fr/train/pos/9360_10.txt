Let me start by saying that at the age of 34, I suddenly became a widower. I was devastated because he was NOT sick - he died suddenly of a coronary - his carotids exploded - he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation on the part of the police because he came across something and it made him feel bad. I was a murder suspect until the autopsy returned. <br /> <br /> My children were as traumatized as me, so in love with a good father figure. I had three small children, no education, no financial support. I took it very very hard. <br /> <br /> At the end of two years, my parents-in-law attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally and spiritually, and I have no grief in front of the children, I wear masks and show people what they want to see and not my pain during the holidays ... Nobody took the defense of me and my choice to spend a day off, except of course, the grief therapist I saw who had advised me to follow my heart and my soul. My in-laws did not understand it! It ALWAYS changed my relationship with them and I never went back on vacation. This is just one example of how my grief was not respected! My own (new) husband saw me collapse talking about the trauma I felt when I shared my soul. I collapse, I can not breathe, I do not hyperventilate and, generally, I disappear for a few days if I even try to convey the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now, about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today, my soul was moved, my heart shattered. My fears and my pain have resurfaced from the real demons presented in this film. how we complain about what others expect from us and the demons inside. Adam Sandler has perfectly described the terrible agony that you face, overcome and, above all, work at your own pace! This film has absorbed all the pain I have been trying to cope with over the years. You see, when something hurts your soul so deeply, so deeply that all the utterances come from your mouth in thought, you can not cope with it without wishing you were dead and walking in life, in a state death. <br /> <br /> The Bible contains a scripture, Romans 8:26, to which I clung, that when my mouth and my soul do not know what to pray for, the Holy Spirit of God carries this agony at the feet of God. - I do not need to talk. Sandler described it perfectly! <br /> <br /> There was a scene where he was summoned to a court hearing for mental health engagement purposes and returned to face his in-laws --- (which is familiar to me) --- and he tells them the amazing truths that he has been possessed, per se, that he can not overcome. It is a deeply strong and powerful performance. I started screaming and had trouble getting up after getting up to get out of the theater feeling my legs too weak to do it. My son was with me and saw him first-hand, my precise movements while trying to hold him together; a lesson for him, my youngest who hardly remembers his father. It's been 13 years for me but this film reminded me of the moment of losing my in-laws when they asked for a mask for my emotions and my abandonment to their desires, instead of respecting mine. <br /> <br /> I'm writing this, so if you're a plaintiff, you're ready for this movie, but highly recommend it in Sandler's 1,000-star performance. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a plaintiff, take a lesson from his film and listen and accept the choices of people in their sorrow, allowing them to find peace at their own pace! Sometimes the soul can not pronounce words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie with handkerchiefs and prepare yourself to take it ... in your soul!
