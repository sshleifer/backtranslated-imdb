One of my favourite movies. He has it all - a rocking soundtrack, permission from Eddie Clark, ex-Motorhead, lots of action, lots of laughs, a totally ridiculous plot and the most beautiful stereotypes of the 80s as characters. Eddie, the nice guy, who just wants to be left alone to be different, Leslie (about as wet as they come), Nuke (stone burnout), Eddie's Mom (pathetic), Roger (the geek ) and Ozzy as a preacher (surely he exists in America?). Then there are the boys (rich, vicious and stupid) and the girls (vacant, vain and stupid). What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, there's Sammi Curr, the rock star, an amalgam of all the 80s rockassins you can think of. What about this rocket gun guitar? Then there is the scene where Sammi pulls the old lady across the television screen and crushes it. And what does Roger do? Why, suck it, as a good geek would do. My favorite scene is where Tim Hainey gets his long-awaited reward from Sammi via the wet finger in the cork - magic! <br /> <br /> If you like rock in the 80s or if you like silly movies like me, then check this one out. It is available on DVD and very inexpensive, so treat yourself.
