While the title "Before the devil knows you're dead" comes from an Irish proverb, the film is played like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with a robbery and continues to get out of control as two brothers try to escape the mess they have been plunged into. <br /> <br /> The cast is well assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman & Ethan Hawke play the aforementioned brothers. Notable support includes Albert Finney as a father and Marisa Tomei as a brother's wife and a lover of the other. Beyond these principles, the acting is not remarkable. <br /> <br /> The story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve. The narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent offsets over time. That being said, the unpredictability of the film is somewhat stifled, as it soon becomes clear that this story is a tragedy from one side to the other. In summary, the debut of first screenwriter Kelly Masterson is impressive. <br /> <br /> The direction of Sidney Lumet is well managed, but I am more impressed by the fact that he is still in charge of eighty years. Carter Burwell leaves me less impressed, but it's not a major distraction. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film is a captivating view and, although the story and the presentation may have superficial similarities with other films, this one remains a unique experience.
