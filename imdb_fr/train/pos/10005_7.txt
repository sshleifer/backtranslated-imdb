Yes, it's an art ... to succeed in a slow-moving thriller. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in beautiful volumes without you even noticing it. <br /> <br /> Beautiful performance of Robin Williams. The angles of sexuality in the movie may seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the movie. However, the basic plot is very attractive. The film does not rush on you and grab you enough to keep you puzzled. The direction is good. The use of lights to achieve the desired effects of suspense and unplanned is good. <br /> <br /> Very nice watch 1 time if you want to lie down and hear a new exciting!
