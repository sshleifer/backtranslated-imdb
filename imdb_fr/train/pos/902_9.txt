I thought this movie was really great because in Indian cinemas nowadays, we only see skin, music and bad acting ... in this film, we can see a tradition, a ethnicity and at least some decency ... although some parts were a bit dramatic, guess what? that's what Indian cinema is all about! After watching this movie, at least you do not have a headache because of the loud music, or any violence, it's the truth, it teaches love and, of course, the attention of the person you love throughout life ... i think it was a fantastic movie ... kids can look at it without a doubt, and adults will appreciate the simplicity that once was the assured depth of india ... until all those rap hits, miniskirts and skin splashes are part of it.
