Was the scenario more suited to a 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but they do it anyway! I thought the actors had done a fantastic job with a rather bland scenario, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most council members seem to really hate this movie. Personally, I do not see how that could be, but Envy is just one of those movies you like or hate. Just like Napoleon Dynamite and all Leslie Neilsen's films ever made. Either you think it's one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest. Do not avoid this movie because of the critics. Look at her and see if you are one of those who really love her! If you do, I guarantee you that it's worth your money. If you do not like it ... well, now you know.
