The pioneering Technicolor cinematography (Oscar winner of the Special Technical Achievement Program) is a delight. Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a dream team to romantic cinema like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you get a rather nice "picture". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the artificial plot as well as the interim puff leave a lot to be desired. There were still no breathtaking Technicolor films before this one (1936), and very few of them have since surpassed this stunning visual experience with astonishing colors. Movie buffs who have enjoyed the beautiful cinematic color images of "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone With The Wind" (1939) will not be disappointed with the fantastic work done here. "The garden of Allah" will always be synonymous with brilliant cinematography in color.
