Or at least one of the best. I think it's a very fun and cool game for the N64. Bowser lives up to his usual shenanigans (yes, it's a stupid word but the only one I can think of) and Mario has to stop him again. This game is very fun to play and contains a lot of nostalgia for me. The only drawback is the graphics, which are horrible by today's standards, but everything else is pretty good (especially the little mini-games you can unlock). This is the second best game on N64 (the first best is Conker's Bad Fur Day) that I recommend to any Mario fan or platform fan. He beats the super mediocre Super Mario Sunshine every day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
