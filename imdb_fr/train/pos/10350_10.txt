I think they were telling the truth all the time ... You can not trust anything in nature ... Their family has gone through a hell. These poor boys are too young to understand what is going on around them. But still have to deal with the rumors. In addition to the loss of their little sister. I can not believe that this case lasted so long. It looks like the jury could not see the truth, even if it was biting their ass.I am sensitive to this family, and if I could let them know that I hate what happened to I have no idea of what they lived, I can not even imagine. After watching this movie, I was in tears and had to look at my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should watch that.
