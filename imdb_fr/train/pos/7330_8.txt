This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, the mythical fantasy illustrator. Some of the characters are directly from his paintings (the Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages to keep the feeling of original art. Bakshi is well known for his intensive use of the rotoscope (a technique for tracing a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. However, as the subject of the movie is quite realistic (all characters are humans), it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like here is the plot: for once, we have a story with interesting characters. and beautiful action sequences, a really ugly villain and a gorgeous girl. This film has the feeling of the best comics of Conan, which is not surprising since Roy Thomas is the writer of the series Marvel of our favorite Cimmerian! It's far from the rotten live action, Conan, not to mention all genre B movies. </ I> <br /> <br /> Absolutely recommended!
