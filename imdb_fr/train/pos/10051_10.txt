Family problems abound in real life and this is the subject of this movie. Love can keep the members united during trials and tribulations, and this is the purpose of this film. A man, dad, has the maturity and courage to support the family in the face of adversity. As children grow up, we realize, the hard way, that regardless of their age or that of their parents, parents still love their children and are willing to provide a cushion when they fall. ALL actors describing their characters achieved remarkable performances. Yes, I shed a tear on the way knowing that I had similar experiences as a young adult and later as a parent. It is a reality that every young adult and every parent would do well to see, although some do not realize it before being parents too. A must for those who care about their family.
