Watching "The Fox and the Child" was an intoxicating experience. The lush visuals, the integrity of the point of view and the beauty of the decor and the characters left me in a delirium of pleasure. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. Deceptively simple. In the container of this simplicity, a world unfolds which attracts you and leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I learned. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you can trust. Indulge. Dare I say that it is an act of love for every innocent heart. It reaches the heart of the viewer - of all ages - and reveals the world through new eyes, as if seen from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that true art takes the viewer beyond the point of view of ecstatic participation in reality. I feel that I had the privilege of watching - no, participating - in this film, a true work of art.
