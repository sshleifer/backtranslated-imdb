In 2005, I saw this film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Of the 14 films that I watched, I would classify this film at No. 4. The 900+ theater was full and in the end he received a standing ovation. It was Peter Falk's classic if you're a fan of Falk and you've been a lot of chemistry between the characters of Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. The title of the movie seemed too long and strange. I am surprised that this has not been made public. It was much better than the majority of garbage that the big studios throw at you. Perhaps too much adult in the sense that it was meant for baby boomers and seniors. Many people could relate to situations in this movie. It will probably come back in a few years when people watch this film and consider it a kind of jewel. I would give this rating of 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and would recommend it without hesitation.
