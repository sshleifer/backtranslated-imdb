First of all, let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes. It seems that some people are less intelligent to recognize this fact, but it is remarkable to think of the kind of total disgust that this little harmless film generates from some people. For me, like most people here, before Sunrise touched me deeply, I was really stunned, moved, inspired. It is a film that finally benefits from several views. It creates some of the most amazingly unforgettable feelings and emotions that you can possibly imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking of the kind of inspiring feelings I have had. <br /> <br /> The film functions as a communion of two fragile souls who are beginning to know each other. It's very clever and inspiring, not so much the way a conversation is necessarily related to the following or the importance of the topics in Jesse and Celine's discussions, but rather the small nuances, the perfectly articulated responses that they provoke one another. It captures an honest, romantic but fleeting human emotion that begins to flourish in the sublime sublime Viennese milieu. this convinces us that their evanescent relationship could be the greatest compliment in the world. And what will happen after this night is open to debate, but I never doubt that they will not see each other again. <br /> <br /> Easy comments from RockytheBear and the inferior user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissident who does not want to accept and respect those who love this film. <br /> <br /> Look at it and it may change your lifestyle.
