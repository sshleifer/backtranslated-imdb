Mr. Jim not really a boxing movie. It's a vehicle for Errol Flynn like Jim Corbett. That said, boxing scenes are a revelation to the modern viewer. Errol Flynn plays the role of the Irish bank clerk trying to win the world heavyweight title. Flynn is well suited to Corbett's role, sweet but unpredictable. However, his opponent John Sullivan is even better, an old school player played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is a man seeking his greatest chance. Corbett abandons his mundane life and builds a new character as a gentleman Jim. Jim is a striker who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egotist. Sullivan, heavyweight boxing champion, is portrayed as a mere brute but his honesty and sportsmanship give a certain contrast to the main character. <br /> <br /> There is action and excitement and a wonderful ending with the redemption required for all. And Errol Flynn gets the girl.
