Japanese animators have a unique freedom of animation. That's why they tend to be able to produce movies like these, movies that end up on hard disks of cartoon fans and on student floors, but they are completely ignored by anyone outside of his native country. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from the Western point of view, is supposed to be experimented with drugs or analyzed in depth. In reality, it is only a surrealist journey beautifully detailed. <br /> <br /> There is no real dialogue, which facilitates the transmission to other interested parties indifferent to the subtitling. A cat and his half-dead sister (cerebral?) Cross various imaginary and associative landscapes. There is a general theme of water, or lack of water (perhaps because of the cat drowning at the beginning, perhaps because of the title?). There is an interesting kind of genesis taking. There is a pig that is eaten. An elephant made of water. And it's beautiful, captivating, exciting and fun - provided you do not look at addicts who can not feel anything from a visual point of view without comparing it to an acid trip. Finally, the film turns off by itself, adding another level of self-reflexivity to the procedure. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
