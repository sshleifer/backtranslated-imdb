An excellent film describing the cross currents in the life of a multiethnic mix of not-so-ordinary people in the rural North West Pacific. Strong leadership and writing, as well as a good action game, especially the performances of Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was made the same year as the very successful "Crash" written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of action may not be as fast as in Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to know each other better in "Apart From That," but the characters' personal relationships are also flawed and confused, and their stories too. resonant than those of "Crash". For the spectators who enjoyed "Crash", it's a must-see movie. Also, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will love this movie.
