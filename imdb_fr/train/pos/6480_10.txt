It was by far the best documentary of war ever made. From the beginning of the first episode where Sir Laurence Olivier described the horrible events of Oradour-Sur-Glane "The day the soldiers came". Until the last days of the war, when the clouds of mushrooms appeared over Japan, I never missed a second of this classic series and I remember it well, even if it had been projected long ago in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy has been covered in detail. This whole series should necessarily see as many children as possible in the world, so that the tragedy of the Second World War is not repeated and that fanaticism, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
