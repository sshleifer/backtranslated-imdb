I bought it a year or more ago for $ 2 (yes, $ 2), I left it on the shelves for years, now I watch DVDs while it was cold . <br /> <br /> It's a haunting movie. Bright performances of everyone involved, especially the 6 year old boy (about the only smiles you get in this movie). <br /> <br /> The plot may remind me of my favorite movie, Grosse Pointe Blank, but it's obvious that it's light, is a heavy heart. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, clinical psychologist and forensic pathologist, a shiver rose up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed. Scary things! A brilliant job all around. <br /> <br /> Pete
