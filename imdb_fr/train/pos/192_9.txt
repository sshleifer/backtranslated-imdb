Before seeing Show People, my silent comedy impression was basically great, and only great. I could not imagine how much on-screen comedy could be possible without much use of words or many practices. But this masterful film proved me the opposite. Davies, in my opinion, was probably the greatest comedy actress to have preceded Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy primarily because Davies' facial manners and facial expressions reminded me so much that I wonder if Davies was not one of Ball's main influences. This comes from a 21-year-old who had never seen a silent comedy before, and I have to say that no matter how many specific references to a period you actually get (I do not have it apparently), you will not be bored movie. You will probably even laugh more than in most walkie comedies. It's not just my favorite silent comedy, but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
