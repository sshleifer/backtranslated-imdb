It all started with True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse, which put the club safe. Noble Heart Horse met Dawn & John and took them to see True Heart Bear. Later, the care counter fell further and True Heart Bear & Noble Heart checked to see if it was Dark Heart, but they can not go unless the club in charge asks Dawn & John to to occupy it. After True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse come back, they send Dawn & John back to the camp. Then the club and its cousins ​​grew up to prepare to fight Dark Heart. In the end, Dark Heart kidnaps all the bears and the children (Dawn & John) have to tell Christy that Dark Heart is an evil. Then they work together to save the Care Bears. Later, True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse discovered that dark heart's shadow and return to the mainland to find that their gone. The children (Dawn, John and Christy) come but they were not powerful enough to stop Dark Heart. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse came to help Dawn, John and Christy free the other caregivers, but Christy was obstructed and touched by the magic of the dark heart. Than Dark Heart saw that Christy had been touched and stopped to help him, but he could not because Dark Heart (himself) did not have the power to worry about saving Christy. Babysitters and children help Dark Heart save Christy. Now, Dark Heart is starting to get interested and has become a real boy to fall in love with Christy. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helps Christy train in the camp. <br /> <br /> It's a great move and the best Care Bears movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I like all Care Bear movies & I can not wait to see "Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005)". <br /> <br /> Who liked this movie?
