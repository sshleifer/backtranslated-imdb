I really liked the movie. In the end, I was in tears. This film is amazing. Go see the movie. I could have ranked it more than 10. I loved teasing between chance and sassy. I loved the leadership of the shadows. Overall, this movie was perfect. <br /> <br /> his sequel is good but not good like this movie.I think there should be a third sequel to that.not that this film attracts children but also adults.Any family appreciated this movie.Chance was humorous.sassy is a smart cat. <br /> <br /> Again, I say that this film is a watch not to be missed.The more you see this film, the more you are attached to this film.This film is a classic.
