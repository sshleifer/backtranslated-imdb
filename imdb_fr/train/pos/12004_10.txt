This film is a true and historical film. This is very useful for those looking for the LDS church because it's 100% true. It is an excellent film and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> It's very factual, exciting and motivating. There are some who think that it is not factual, but it is the case. <br /> <br /> This is the restoration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Prophet Joseph Smith who restored it. He had events in his life like the illness he had when he was little, his courting Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, childbirth, etc. But above all, he reveals the restoration of the church.
