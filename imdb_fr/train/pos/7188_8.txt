With "King of the Rocket Men", this was repeated at BBC TV in the early eighties. If I loaded a time capsule of this period, these two series would definitely enter. <br /> <br /> Someone who looks at it for the first time will think it's silly, but it's one of the best examples of the "Series". Don Del Oro will make you laugh (when I was little, my nickname for him was Mr. Dustbin's head) and it was funny to get shot, he said "Your balls can not hurt me" then he stumbles back, apparently less than happy. I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode. <br /> <br /> I watched it again because I had good memories of it, there are good stunts and good music, it contains the ingredients you expect to include some water, falling rocks, carts ... Apart from the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner), the swordplay was not as good as I remembered, and yes, it has the inevitable episode "flashback" ! He receives 8 out of 10 because he is still suffering from slowness, padding and other tricks. If you are interested in these soap operas, I recommend William Witney's book, "In a Door, in a Battle, in a Door, in a Pursuit", although there is only one small entry about of this series.
