Have you ever had, or do you have, a pet that has been around you, without whom you would be lost, and that you would like, anyway? Betcha never thought they felt the same for you! <br /> <br /> Beautiful, wonderful family film. If you have a thing for animals, you are sure to cry whatever your age. I used to watch this movie all the time when I was little and I see that now, at sixteen, I love him as much as before. At that moment, I could never choose a favorite character and I still do not think I can do it! I like the three animals. The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving but conflicting family. I love Chance and how, in the end, he says he finally has a family. Cheesy, yes, but we must not forget that this is a family film and that it fulfills this role perfectly. Sassy just has the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the ideal leader / model for the young and adventurer Chance. <br /> <br /> The way animals outnumber humans, having them interact with them (ie save Molly and the end). Not to mention the amazing soundtrack that gives every moment even more emotion and a feeling of swelling of the heart that accompanies it. I give this 9/10. To be compared (and even scored) to Cats and Dogs and Babe
