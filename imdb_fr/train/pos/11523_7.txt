It's one of the funniest movies I've seen. I watched it on DVD and the disc has no particular features, or even menu, but it's not necessarily what I care about. <br /> <br /> I tend to judge films on a case-by-case basis, depending on, among other things, whether it's a big studio production or a smaller one. It's a little movie and I'm ready to forgive some minor things. That said, I feel like I have one of the most original and imaginative titles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the acting of the main actors. I particularly enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character described by Claire Forlani may seem unrealistic to some people, but I have personally met real people with emotional problems who very easily consider the decisions of life as does his character. This helped me understand the nuances where his wounds could appear through the veneer of his humor. <br /> <br /> This is not a children's movie, of course, but it does NOT engage in free sex and nudity. There is a bit of adult language, however, but sometimes it can be a lot of fun. (In particular, the character of Alan Arkin, who can not even swear properly.) <br /> <br /> Also watch the cameos of actors of known characters.
