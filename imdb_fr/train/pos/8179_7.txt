It would have been so much fun to see a movie theater in 1996. There is a corner of guilty pleasure that is close to my heart, which really appreciates really good shocking movies. <br /> <br /> "The dentist" is sometimes criticized probably because people usually have strong opinions about dental issues. Perhaps the ADA has launched a campaign against this project, because dentists have an obligation to apologize for this film and for "The Marathon Man" (which has only a scene comparable to that of "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It is amazing to note that, according to the trivia page, the film was shot in 21 days. Of course, post-production can sometimes take longer than recording a movie, and editing "The Dentist" is a perfect picture. The fast cuts accentuate the tension so much that on the stage where the dentist "takes care" of his wife, there are only two quick cuts that show what is happening. The rest is left to our imagination very fertile! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has a lot of experience in the psychologically "off" character game and has completely sold the obsessive-compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me, the film was rhythmic right. Filmmakers reveal the wickedness of the woman in the right way. All the characters in the dental office look like people working in a real office. There is a lot of tension as they deal with impatient people waiting for the dentist to arrive. Meanwhile, the dentist is about to undergo a huge psychotic crisis! Unlike so many films of this genre, the scenario is very tight. All victims fall into the trap of the dentist in a very calculated way. Two types of law enforcement are involved even in a small subplot that ends up creating the shock of a showdown towards the end. <br /> <br /> Certainly not for the sensitive souls or the phobic of the teeth, but for a real roller coaster ride and highly recommended for fans of smart gorefests.
