The most remarkable achievement of Georg Wilhelm Pabst's period of social realism is based on a tragedy in early 1906 that claimed the lives of nearly 1,100 French miners, while a coal dust explosion at the bottom of Courri√®res, in the north of France, had occurred after the three-week-old fire, eventually releasing deadly mine gases that resulted in death. The estimable designer Erno Metzner creates rigid sets that simulate tragedy and offer a perception of reality, complemented by an incomparable sound editing, the only music produced by full orchestras at the beginning and end of a party for which the effects sound are equally important. the fascinating visual compositions of the eminent director. Pabst's "invisible montage" manner, which links the action from one shot to another, is perfectly integrated into this historical film which also presents a sublime cinematography using cameras mounted on vehicles, allowing the director to move among the scenes without needing Cup. Although the main theme of the work relates to socialist dogma, the unforgettable power of this film is contained in its details. It was born from Pabst's unparalleled ability to weave many intrigues into a movie tapestry that elicits the admiration of German rescue teams, whose proud homeland, while not despairing, of disastrous losses for the families of the victims French; certainly, a seminal triumph that is just as stimulating for a filmmaker as it was on his first outing.
