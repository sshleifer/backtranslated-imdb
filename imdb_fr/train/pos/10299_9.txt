I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey. I laughed my ass during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like it in his serious movies, especially Truman Show. This is a cross between his VERY funny side and his serious side. He is of course VERY funny in this film, but some parts are very serious and he gets away very easily. he is really a multi-function actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with the role of Jennifer Aniston. I think she is more than a couple of beautiful tits and a nice ass. Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God. As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are VERY funny, especially in the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I should note this as a 9. A good acting, a funny scenario and very serious situations a very good movie.
