Not many critics, so thought I'd add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO BY OTHER NOTICES! It was an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the rare Indian directors to be able to make a very good film. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay give yet another great example like Bhoomika too, which was a little unexpected, but nice to watch. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised there was not a lot of hype around the exit. <br /> <br /> Or filmfare / other awards nominations, given the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> Better then Khakee, I thought. Khakkee was also a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty long movie, but it's well worth it and it really looks long looking at the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next RKS movie and AB's next movie, Akshay: they always seem to work together well ... for example waqt. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika has also done very well in the film and should do very well if she continues in the same way in the future.
