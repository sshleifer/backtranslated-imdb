The Young Victoria is a beautiful movie that has portrayed Queen Victoria from a different angle than anyone else thinks of her. The films erase Queen Victoria's impression of "I'm not amused" and show that she was a playful young woman. <br /> <br /> As I love history, especially Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when I saw it for the first time. this movie advertised, I was so so excited and counted the days until he came to cinemas. I was a little concerned that this is not historically accurate, but it was true and I loved it. I discovered new unknown facts about Queen Victoria and that interested me a lot. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria was one of the greatest monarchs of all time, and this film portrays her. true personality and how was his life. His mother's counselor, Sir John Conroy, treated her so badly, because he wanted Britain to have a regency. That's what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic queen, what she was! The romance between her and Albert was so deep and it was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, both great! The Young Victoria is a heart-warming love story, but at the same time presents a glimpse of most of British history ... I LOVE !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... without doubt!
