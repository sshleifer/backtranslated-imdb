the only word that summarizes this film is offbeat. it is a slight madness through an existential concept. inflatable (for more than one reason) and a little crazy. I would not say that it would be a grandiose and unforgettable cinema and that it does not seem as memorable as the first film of the director's director, but it is a good hole to watch on Sunday morning. the game of actors goes from respectable to boring at times, but I think that's how things had to be written. made like a serious movie, it might have been great or could very well have entered a state of pretension. a bit like "the matrix" meets "the head" and "human nature". <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of ten
