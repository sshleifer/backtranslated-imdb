At first, I thought the Ring would be a more than normal movie with its usual plot. As I was surprised! Of course, the plot is simple: a girl is in love with two men, but Hitchcock presents it to us on a silver platter, with bursts of laughter and fear, with compassion and anguish. The way he describes the popular crowds of the fair, the strength of the girl's attraction to the two men, the tragic elements that combine with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest films (North by Northwest, The Rope, etc.) The master did it well before his thirties!
