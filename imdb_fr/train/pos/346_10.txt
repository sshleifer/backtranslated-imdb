What a great movie! It was very scary, very good acting, well written, beautiful twists, interesting characters, a very good direction, and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile. It's a horror popcorn movie that may not appeal to non-horror fans, but it's still (nevertheless) one of the best thrillers on the market! I highly recommend it ONLY fans of: <br /> <br /> 1) The kind of horror <br /> <br /> OR <br /> <br /> 2) An actor or an actress featured in this film. *** on **** stars! <br /> <br /> PS- I'm tired of people comparing this, as well as other modern horror movies, with SCREAM. You know what, they do not want to be like SCREAM. Everyone says, "Oh, they copied SCREAM!" Well, if I'm not mistaken, SCREAM has also copied other movies! In fact, almost all horror movies have been copied. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is! <br /> <br /> GO TO RENT THIS! <br /> <br />
