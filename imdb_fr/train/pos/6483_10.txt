This excellent series, commented by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly describes, it must be said, the beginning to the end of the Second World War. The origins are not fully examined since the fall of Germany in the hands of the Treaty of Versailles which helped propel Hitler's demonic rise, but as one critic says, it must be hard to do, in a series of 26 episodes with so much to tell. <br /> <br /> Aside from the photography / fighting action expected, there are many personal things, emotional and human tragedies tell the audience an incredible insight, especially if you're not necessarily a fan / fan of the Second World War. Episodes showing "testimonies" and the home life of the main allies / adversaries, namely Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States of America were quite revealing. Demonstrations of the extreme savagery of war on the front and, of course, the suffering of civilians, death camps, etc., were very well managed and exposed. I would recommend it wholeheartedly in all history classes for the younger generation (which could be said to be one at 47!). <br /> <br /> Some things are strangely omitted, such as the advent of the new jet era, with Frank Whittle's experimental Gloster jet and Gloster Meteor's battle debut, as well as that of the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - all the more so as the V-1 made its debut and surprisingly less V2 was mentioned. This is probably a small oversight that does not hint at the more secret and fantastic weapons more sensational than World War II brought to an old, more sterile science. But a big series that has made its mark and has since done so, when happily repeated. <br /> <br /> A series to own as a box in historical terms, on DVD for all those who happen to be fans of the army. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be very proud.
