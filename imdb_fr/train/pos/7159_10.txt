Louis Sachar's irresistible classic for kids is about as Disney-like as Freddy Krueger. Assassination, racism, face disfigurement and lizard killers. <br /> <br /> A tightly planned narrative that tells the story and reveals Stanley's hidden heritage and secrets. It goes from the lush greenery of Latvia to the opulent Green Lake Camp (hint: there is no lake or green). <br /> <br /> The first success of Disney is to recreate the environments of the novel so convincingly - the scenography is superb and without brilliance. The other plus is in the casting. Rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) may not be the big boy of the book, but his attitude is right and he is far from the usual hero. The rest of the cast is equally full, from Patricia Arquette to the Frontier School burglar, to Henry Winkler to Stanley's father. The downside is the pop soundtrack - pure marketing department - and the feeling of having reached the maximum volume at the end.
