I felt this movie - everywhere. I was impressed by Russell Crowe's talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, a typically Australian mix of gently soft, self-destructive and very persistent approach. Really loved the cinematography and direction. Pace was just right and almost all the characters were played. <br /> <br /> God, Russell's talent did not shine even in 1993! .. and I have not seen Gladiator yet.
