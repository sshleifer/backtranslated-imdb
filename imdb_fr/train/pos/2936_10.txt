If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we would all remember. But even I was only 4 when he came out. If you have not seen it yet, praise Dr. Dolittle, Showtime, I hope, Pluto Nash and all of Eddie's family comedy movies - so watch this. Without laughing, you will laugh 90% of the time. The remaining 10% will wipe the tears from your eyes. <br /> <br /> You really have to watch it more than once to understand all the jokes. From rude humor to a joke for kids! (If you've seen it before, you'll laugh here) - you'll love his job. If you can (or if you're a big fan), try downloading excerpts from Eddie's numbers. Many shows are different from what you imagine and he still has more fun jokes. <br /> <br /> But it's like the "best of" Eddie Murphy's "X-rated" if you want. <BR /> <br /> And all I can say is do not watch Delirious please, if you do not like comedy, if you do not have the sense of humor or if you're not having fun going out with him. You will only defeat this great Eddie Murphy classic and you may miss out on someone. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie got Beverly Hills Cop and became famous, Delirious is.
