This is the first Tom Hanks movie that I have the privilege of seeing at the theater, although it is my favorite. When I heard that he was going to be very successful, I was a little stunned thinking, "Can Mr. Hanks pull this one out?" And he made it fashionable. This 1930s depression movie deals with loyalty, redemption and a path that you do not want your children to stumble over. Tom Hanks directs a stellar cast of Michael Sullivan. To be the father and the secret life of the contract killer for the Oscar, Paul Newman. This film, Tom Hanks, focuses more on the reaction and the look than on the dialogue, which offers an exceptional performance. <br /> <br /> On the night of one of his jobs, Michael's son, Michael Jr., played by newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, witnesses to the coup. And Michael Sr.'s partner, theater actor Daniel Craig, can not have this information. So, he kidnaps Michael Sr.'s son and wife, with the exception of Michael Jr. The two are heading to Chicago to look for Conner Rooney (Paul Newman's son Rooney). <br /> <br /> The drama and intense plot really as a father tries to settle things, even if his son is in the game. During this murderous trip, someone hired a hit for Michael Sr. The murderer would be the photographer of the late Harlen Maguire, played by a Jude Law stained teeth. <br /> <br /> The film will make you feel The old days. And with the beautiful and haunting score of Oscar-nominated Thomas Newman, you can not help but enjoy this film from award-winning director Sam Mendes. So sit back and enjoy the wild ride.
