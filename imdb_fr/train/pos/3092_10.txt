You probably already know it now, but 5 additional episodes never aired can be viewed on ABC.com. I've watched a lot of television over the years and it's probably my favorite show. It is a crime that this beautifully written and played show has been canceled. The actors who played Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Anya and Steven Caseman - are all incredible and natural in these roles. Even the kids are great. Wonderful show. So sad that it's gone. Of course, I wonder why he was canceled. It is out of the question to let me believe that Mrs. Moynahan's pregnancy was for something. It was the ideal time slot on this market. I watched all the episodes again on ABC.com - I hope they all come out on DVD one day. Thanks for reading.
