One of the best love stories I have ever seen. It's a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but still charming ... Big Edie and Little Edie look a little like family members after watching this movie several times, and are very much quoted: "C is a beautiful day, now you are silent? The opening explanation of the costume of Little Edie only promises that the film will live forever, just like Big Edie "The world famous singer" and Little Edie "The dancer of world renown".
