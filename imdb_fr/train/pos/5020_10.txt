That's what a movie should be to try to capture the essence of what is very surreal. He has this blurry connotation that is rarely captured in a movie. It looks like a dream sequence and transports you into a dark and haunting memory. The children were extremely credible and I expect something to come to them in the future. Playing very naturally for such young people, I do not know if Bill has shot them or so good, but no less excellent. Bill has scored for me and for KevNJeff's comment on Mr. Paxton's bad action, what can be done in this role. He played the role rather well, in my opinion. That comes from someone who said that Hamlet was good (The version of Ethan Hawke?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his comments. Very good move to make you feel uncomfortable, if that's what you want? Cinematography also scores above average.
