It's cult. My friends and I meet once a year to enjoy this movie. It's very funny and very dry. I have seen this move dozens of times and I have not enjoyed it yet. The actors are funny and it improves with each viewing! If you liked "The stupid space", you'll love it. A great game about the war of the worlds. I love the rampage of Red-Neck to get the aliens, the insect on the hood, the DOD, the populous Annihilator in search of heat, the Mine Field, the Red Camo, which exceeds the speed limit of 1,800 km / h! "I'm going to get the bucket!" Very funny. I would like this to come out on DVD! Forget the negative reviews, see for yourself!
