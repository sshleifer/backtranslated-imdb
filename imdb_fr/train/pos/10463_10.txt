When I found the film in the Christmas schedule, its title did not seem familiar to me since I had not read the novel and had not heard anything from the movie. Yet after reading the content, I decided to spend my Christmas night watching the movie. The effect surprised me completely: I do not remember the last time I saw a movie in which every moment involved me. A wish to sing is undoubtedly one of the films that is now a real surprise that I received from the cinema. Here are some of my arguments for which I consider this film as a highly underrated film of good cinema. <br /> <br /> First, all the content is particularly educational. It has something to offer the modern public - pure and just faith and answers to universal questions. Is there a need for Christ in our time? Does love always count? For what is there faith? What is the logic of burden and suffering in life? Is there really someone by my side, I can always trust? The film provides the answers through the content since everything that happens to the characters can also happen to each of us. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is exceptionally human. The main characters experience inner struggles and face extremely difficult decisions. Is it better that Kyle David Denman) and Teri (Megan Paul) start their lives and forget their family or keep the values ​​that were taught to them at home? Is it better for John (Ken Howard) to leave Ellen (Barbara Babcock), his sick wife, and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock), a woman he falls in love with? In fact, Ellen does not recognize him anymore ... Nevertheless, he decides to promise him his eternal fidelity. If John's rebellious brother, Phil (David Morin), would do better to continue his easy life even though it does not give him enough satisfaction or seriously think about his life. Phil's prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterpiece of the universal aspect of humanity. Anyone could say these words, no matter where, when and how they live. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is an excellent portrait of the family, which is not very popular nowadays: there are still problems, there is always something more powerful that brings these people together . This "something" is love and trust. I know that may sound a bit idealistic. Not all families can count on fidelity and it may not be so simple. Nevertheless, it is a very educational and realistic aspect. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the film as a whole focuses on the mutual help of people. If we want to live a happy life in our society, we must understand one thing: we must help each other. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of such an attitude. At the beginning of the film, we see him talking to John about his prayer. Later, he helps his brother. Alexander is a bit of an "angel" sent to John and his family. Is it not possible for us to become angels to each other? <br /> <br /> Fifth, the artistic features are also worth the attention. PERFORMANCES: Barbara Babcock gives an authentic performance as Ellen and although she has a difficult role, she does a perfect job. Consider, for example, when she appears in school and really wants to teach again. Ken Howard is also memorable as a faithful husband. PHOTO: The most memorable for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves (autumn) while the sun (love) spread everywhere. I interpreted as a kind of symbol: even if there is sorrow, it can always be illuminated with light and joy ... <br /> <br /> A wish to cherish is a wonderful film that m has shown realistically what it means to love, what is the fidelity, it has proven to me once again how beautiful it is to live and believe. In the end, I would like to quote the profound words of the film that I found very touching and I hope you will do too. <br /> <br /> Kyle to his uncle Phil: Yes, he (John Brighton) lives from day to day Bible. But no one forces you to do it. Yet according to what rules do you live?
