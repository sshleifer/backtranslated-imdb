I saw this movie and I must say that I am very impressed. There are not many movies that I like, but I like this one. You should see this movie alone and comment on it, as it's one of my favorite movies. I want to see that again. Action merged with a fantastic story. Very impressive. I like the character of Modesty. In fact, she is very mystical and mysterious (I like that ^^). The bad boy is pretty too. In fact, all this film is rare in "movieworld". I thought about the vote of this movie, I thought it should be a very popular movie. I think it's wrong. It is I who was very impressed by this film, and I hope I am not the only one to assume the cost of watching this one. See and vote.
