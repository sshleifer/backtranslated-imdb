It should be against the law not to experience this very funny show with Eddie Murphy. I have never seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Murphy talks for almost 70 minutes about cocks, pussy, boobs and insults from so many celebrities, including his "family". Among the people who get it by murphy are: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I have never seriously laughed so much in my life. I mean, when a person does not know who Mr. T is, but still laughs so loudly about Murphy that Mr. T, there is something about it. By the time I saw the show, I could not remember who T. was, but I still laughed. Now I know who he is and it makes him so much funnier. Because that's what Eddie does - he can make those impressions so good that no matter who he is trying to do, it's always hilarious. And on top of that, we learn that Murphy is actually a very good singer. Please look at it ..
