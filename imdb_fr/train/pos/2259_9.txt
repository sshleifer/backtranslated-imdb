I bought this cheap from the rest of the rental at our local store. It was almost new and I had never heard of it before. It is clear that no one else had it either. <br /> <br /> I can not believe my luck. You walk the whole field of emotions and try to overcome a complex message - the moral and non-triumphalist position of the Mandela party, no doubt. Despite its considerable length (I had to watch it in two sessions), it was like a book you could not ask. Maybe the songs are not all memorable, but the spirit of the thing shines forever. I can not understand the comments that a musical (clearly designed for the stage) is unrealistic! I saw "South Pacific" and read the book too, and I can guarantee that the musical is not realistic in relation to the book. I will cherish this little find until its exhaustion. One day they will come back with a better budget. <br /> <br />
