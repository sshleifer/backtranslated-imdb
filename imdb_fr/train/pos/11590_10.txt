Oh, the sixties. There were interesting movies. I was more of a movie buff then. I enjoy now renting movies and relaxing at home rather than going to the theater. I also saw this short film, "The legend of the boy and the eagle". I'm looking for this movie for years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I was finally able to gather more information from your site. Thank you ........ I am surprised to discover that this short film was an opening for a photo of Disney. I too did not remember the Disney movie. I did not even remember it was an opening movie for Disney. I really hope they will show it on TV someday. I wonder if Disey owns the rights to this film? Is it available on DVD? It is a must for all generations!
