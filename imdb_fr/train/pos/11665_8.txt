I would not have known this film without his "surprise" Oscar nomination for the best animated feature film. Fortunately, I have seen this little animated treasure. <br /> <br /> The story is about the child Brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of the canton of Kells. The main occupation of the abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from attacks by the Vikings. One day, Iona's famous illustrator, Aiden, took refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the appeal of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan befriended the Aisling white forest goblin as he sought to recover an invaluable ancient crystal for the meticulous art of book illustration. <br /> <br /> "The secret of Kells" differs from most published animations. these days. It's a kind of step back, because the illustrations are made with clean geometric lines and a design without worrying too much about realism, as much as about symbolism. The movements of these lines recall the simplistic but fluid animation style used at the beginning of the "Kung Fu Panda" sequence. However, it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonder for the public. The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence haunt unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to capture this quiet jewel of the movie. It's a welcome respite from all the nonsensical nonsense of the current animated class such as "Monsters Vs. Aliens, etc. The weak Celtic musical score effectively evokes the sense of fantasy that permeates the film. OK, the story may be a little superficial and the end a little bit missing. I would have liked to know more about the book on which Brendan and Aiden worked. But the obvious star of this film is clearly his astonishing stylized artwork, supposed to be based on that of the real Kells Book.
