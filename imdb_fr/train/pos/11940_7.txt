As a baseball player, this film goes against what I expected in a sports film: a sport action with an authentic look, credible characters and an original story. While "Angels in the Outfield" fails miserably in the first category, he is doing very well in the last two. "Angels" is the story of Roger and J.P., Anaheim's two adoptive children, baseball lovers but looking for a family, along with the Woebegone Angels franchise, struggling to attract fans and win games. Driven by the promise of his deadly father to become a family only when the Angels win the pennant, Roger asks heavenly help and gets it in the form of a diamond spirit, determined to reverse the downward spiral of the franchise. And when manager George Knox (played by Danny Glover) begins to believe what Roger sees, the team suddenly hopes to change seasons - and Roger and JP find something to believe. Glover, in particular, gives a good performance, and Tony Danza, playing a dilapidated pitcher, does as well, though he clearly has a ZERO idea of ​​how to get out of the ordeal!
