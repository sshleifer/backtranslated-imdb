Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still activate the world with their smiles. The combined talent of these two wonderful stars makes this combination a film of meeting / new departure. Look at her and expect to have sixty! Mary defies youth-oriented society with wit and charm. A touch of drama adds 2000 realism. A television series follow-up would expand the new characters and give us the opportunity to occasionally see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette!
