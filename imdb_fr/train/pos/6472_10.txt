One of the most beautiful televised dramas of the last decade. Throughout the five hours, perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as they explore many facets of modern British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. Appearing at first as a man with heavy arms in conflict with the heroine, he was clever and considerate as he worked with her to discover the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I think it comes from the world of soap operas. Her performance was beautiful, as she kept her humor and composure while trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of taking care of her mother. I could go on to talk about each cast member who contributes to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would have little effect without such an absorbing scenario that would constantly challenge your assumptions about the characters. It's programs like this that restore confidence in television drama, while making it almost impossible to sort out most of the waste that is increasingly filling the airwaves.
