Those who love Elivra as I did in her role of late-night movie host will love this movie - she's just great - her car is fantastic and she's a bit of Transylvania's Dolly Parton - she's so innocent and naive sometimes - and sexy all the time - more than just a touch of Mae West - <br /> <br /> The sets are well done too, and the comics cast is great, with Edie McClurg at her best - plus Sally Kellerman like Patty is hilarious. Whenever I have to do anything to garnish it, I'll think about how Elvira crunch potato chips - <br /> <br /> This movie needs to be watched again and again - just for fun. Now I have to get the following, the haunted hills of Elvira, and see if it's up to it ----
