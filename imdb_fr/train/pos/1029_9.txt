I would have rated the series as a perfect 10 for a remarkable story and consistent high quality as well as for character development without the last episode of Season 10! <br /> <br /> The last episode of the 10th season "Unending", where (it certainly seems) the Asgard were killed in a very hasty, unconvincing and unceremonious way, left me incredulous! <br /> <br /> At the end of the series, it was obvious that many of the arcs in the story were originally going to take place for at least one more season. I imagine they quickly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG-1 franchise on the next two movies directly on DVD! <br /> <br /> Unless the Asgard are coming back in an upcoming SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the "apparent" extinction), I think fans have been cheated with poor cleaning spare parts! <br /> <br /> Bad end of a series of sci-fi otherwise brilliant.
