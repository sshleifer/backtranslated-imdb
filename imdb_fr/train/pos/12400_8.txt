This is Animatrix's second short film, and the first to be what we could call "artistic". It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in the mass of dense matter, especially with a duration of 9 minutes. I heard that it was "anti-human", or trying to direct hatred against the man, for his "sins against the machine". I do not think it's true he just uses robots to show us that as human beings, we are not particularly accepting or open-minded to anyone other than ourselves. I would say it's a great job. The plot is good ... it's a historical document telling what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. Thus, it contains extracts of fiction reports, etc. The dubbing is very good, if there are not many. The animation is nice and the use of color, despite the generally realistic drawing style, allows for smooth transitions and other surreal images. This has several pieces of strong violence and disturbing visuals, as well as some nudity. The disc contains a comment, not in English but subtitled, and deserves a listening / reading. There is also a making of well done and informative, based on both parts, so I would advise you to watch it after seeing the next one, too. I recommend it to anyone who loves the Matrix universe and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
