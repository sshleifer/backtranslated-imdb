I could write a pretty big comment about one of Gundam Wing's characters, everyone can lead the series with their internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 fantastic tracks that guide us through 49 golden episodes of anime happiness. <br /> <br /> It contains a dialogue that you can roll in your head for months, years ... then go back. new sense of, a masterpiece in the writing of the script (although it presents the typical trait of the anime, namely a disparity between the subtitles and the English dub). It contains an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think of your own opinions. <br /> <br /> Relationships between cold and indifferent men and loving female characters are a distinct aspect of this series. Relations between Heero and Relena, and Milliardo and Noin are joys to watch. The apparent rejection of the male is underpinned by an inner turmoil that makes love (a word never mentioned in the series) necessary for women in a tough soldier environment. Women pursue aspects of men that we rarely see, if at all, which makes men's heads all the more enigmatic. Heero needs the 49 episodes to show compassion, but he does, and when he does, it's very profitable. <br /> <br /> And then there is the giant robot that is fighting. It's fun to watch incredible footage as good as any epic fight scene in Hollywood. Anyone less aware would see a giant robot fight as a silly cartoon function for kids, as it became apparent when I try to recommend this series to my friends, but they are mistaken. Most of the giant robot battles in Gundam Wing contain a heavy dose of pathos, which usually involve young rebels who fight for what they believe against an oppressive society that makes their beliefs obsolete. <br /> <br /> The constant changes of tone and emphasis of each episode make Gundam Wing impossible to be boring, it is a captivating and stimulating study on the potential of the human mind and body .
