The Booth gives a new twist to your typical J-Horror movie. This film puts you in the skin of the protagonist of the story. The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> The story is about the perception of the people who work, live and love our protagonist and how they perceive the people around them an obsolete DJ booth of the radio station. The story loosens the layers of the main character like an onion in flashbacks as the film runs, and we have deduced that things are not always what they seem to be. The film mainly took place in the studio of a small, old radio station, with a very bad story, where the main character was forced to air his talk show because the radio station was moving . It is from this confined space that this film develops and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. At one point, our protagonist can not determine that the strange events in the old studio were caused by a ghost or by a conspiracy of his colleagues or everything was in his mind. What I like in this film is that the filmmakers make you see through the eyes of the main character and make you as paranoid as the protagonist did. This film is a very smart, rather short 76 minutes.
