The Journey of Hope (1990) is a journey that many nomads and poor Turks make to live the good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live as Westerners that they will give up their lives to try to reach the promised land. So many of them are swindled by greedy scammers who make their living by charging huge fees to desperate people who are not winners. A family faces the cold, the treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals to discover that there is not always a bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists worldwide, not only in America. Some people tend to forget it. A movie heart that will let you ask why in the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
