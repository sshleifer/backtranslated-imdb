Henry Thomas was "awesome". His character caught my attention. I was so "in" the story that I forgot it was not real. I wanted him to keep the baby and see who he was special. The other characters in the story played a vital role in the composition of his character. The way they united to help each other was really impressive. I like movies that show the true side of human emotions without having to hit your head, in that you're not smart enough to understand things for yourself.
