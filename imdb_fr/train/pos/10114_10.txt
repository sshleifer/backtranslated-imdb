"The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary on the life of man that brought us films such as "Glen or Glenda", "Bride of the Monster" and, of course, "Plan 9 of Outer Space". This exquisite film far exceeds the failures of other documentaries, such as "Look Back in Angora" and "The Plan 9 Companion". He completes his surviving entourage, many of whom have died since the shoot, and offers an honest review of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic for looking at the dark corner of Hollywood yesterday, sentimental in the treatment of the director (to the haunting music), this documentary is a must for anyone who loves the director who failed in his movie. day. The two full hours of the film bring together Ed's life and his untimely death for the viewer with love and retrospective. It is best to watch at 3 in the morning while wearing an angora sweater.
