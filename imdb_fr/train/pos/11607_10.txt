Picture Bride takes an excellent look at Hawaii's past and the people who lived there at that time. The time, the money earned, and the hours that these people have dedicated to their lives to survive and live have a new meaning for blood, sweat, and tears. <br /> <br /> The concept of encounters what we do the same today via the net. It's just mail. Postal mail very slow. <br /> <br /> The singing of plantation workers reminds me of the songs of plantation workers in the south of their disappearance and their future goals. <br /> <br /> The film shows the hardships as well as sweet romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring. Like the calm of a storm and the sudden chaos of rain and then of tranquility.
