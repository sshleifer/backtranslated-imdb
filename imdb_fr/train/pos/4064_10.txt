I have never met one person (out of hundreds) who hated this movie. I bet anyone voting is a little saboteur, or a victim of one. This film has everything. Ask yourself, "Are you a fan of ...?" Then go see "Laputa". <br /> <br /> This is not my favorite movie, but my favorite, directed by the same person (Hayao Miyazaki). In any case, it ranks among the top five. And I saw A LOT of movies.
