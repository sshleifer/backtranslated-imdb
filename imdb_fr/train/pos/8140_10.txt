I saw this film for the first time on a movie channel (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap bands and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo caught my attention and I wanted to see what it was. Well, from the start, I knew it was going to be good (ATTENTION!) And I was right. The parodic songs alone make this film worth watching over and over again (My Peanuts), but the film's unfolding and broadcasting was excellent. We must love the satire of rap groups (obviously the NWA), some rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching her ass? It's a pity that this movie did not have the credit it deserved because it had been overshadowed by CB4 on their releases, but in my opinion, it's a much better movie. If you know and love 90s gangster rap, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. If you do not like or do not like 'rap', you'll enjoy jokes at the expense of the genre.
