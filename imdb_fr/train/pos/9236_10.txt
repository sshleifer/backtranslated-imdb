Imagine people blaming the original, because it was time for the original Battlestar series to be a masterpiece, even with all the stars, stories and works of art. Lorne Greene was awesome, like Adama and Richard Hatch was perfect, like Apollo and Dirk Benedict was funny, like Starbuck, but I dare say, not as pretty as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I liked the episode with Pegasus and Greetings from the Earth was good. John Calicos was great, Baltar, War of the Gods, the best was Experiment in Terra, I thought it was a tribute to Heaven Can Wait, so you had Battlestar women, do not compare them to Tricia, who is remarkably beautiful as number six, but the beauty of Jane Seymour is incomparable. Not to mention Loerrta Spang because Cassiopea was fantastic. She had a beauty that would disturb a rainbow. I liked both the original and the new. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine if John Calicos had a number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
