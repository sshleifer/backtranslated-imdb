It's one of the brightest films I've seen lately. Go far above any international film of any reputation. I'm really surprised why it did not receive the recognition it deserved. Sonali Kulkarni winning the national award is perhaps the only comforting fact. Renuka Daftardar is simply amazed as she speaks loudly through her eyes. Some scenes emerge: when Gauri returns from the city for Krishna's wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna notices a change in Gauri, but not a single line of dialogue is said. The whole range of emotions is transmitted through subtle manners and eyes. There is another towards the end when Krishna asks Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead. If you are not moved by this scene, you do not have a heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this film for total brilliance and acting skills.
