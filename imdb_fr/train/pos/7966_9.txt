As a child, I found this movie awesome. There were animals, beautiful music and my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still like this movie, for different reasons. He has well trained animals that are subjected to various stunts and scenes that look great in front of the camera. It offers beautiful, well written music that perfectly matches the scenes, with catchy melodies and a heart-wrenching main theme that makes me cry again. Even when people are humming. And he has my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> It's from a book that it's the story of three domestic animals, an intelligent, overconfident and dramatically paternal laboratory named Shadow, a witty and vain cat - but always intelligent - with the fear of water named Sassy and a curious and slightly neurotic ridiculous bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family leaves. Discouraged and anxious, pets prepare and plan a trip through the Sierra Mountains for the journey of their lives. A truly amazing trip. So what, maybe the house is just above this mountain. But if it is not the case? <br /> <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound to people who love the three incredible actors who provide the voice to the main characters, and to everyone who ... Yeah, everyone will watch it.
