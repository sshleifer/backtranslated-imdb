It's a film I saw when it came out and I've seen it a few more times over the years. It's always nice. <br /> <br /> One thing is that comedy does not take sides: it puts the workers and capitalists on the spit. Sid alone seems out of the class struggle, even though he is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning: do not read further if you have not seen the film <br /> <br /> It's a fantasy, although presented quite plausibly. Ask yourself: Could someone support most of his weight in a single strand of fabric? That would cut almost any support. <br /> <br /> In addition, when he's stuck in a driveway, Sid uses a garbage can as a knight's shield. Cute symbolism. <br /> <br /> One day, I'll get it on DVD.
