Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) unexpectedly arrives at his son's house.His son, Klein Klein (Paul Reiser) is very surprised to learn that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) has left his father.The wife of Henry, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and her three sisters are trying to find Muriel while Ben and his father are going to see a farm that is for sale. But it's not the end of their trip. The road trip turns into a long sitting of therapy between Ben and his father.Raymond De Felitta is the director (2005) .Paul Reiser is behind the screenplay and has done a remarkable job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is simply incredible. And he worked with the screenplay for twenty years, no wonder he was so good Who would be the best man to play father than Peter Falk? And nobody, I can tell you.And I really like the story of why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the role.Peter was an actor who made his father laugh.And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie.C is just hilarious to go fishing.And how the old man beats the youngest in the game of billiards then beats him with the stick.The film is often very funny and I found myself laughing many times.But that can also be touching from time to time. You can not tell a story better than the one told here.
