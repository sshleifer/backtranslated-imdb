I think it was very balanced to show what Jehovah's Witnesses did to protect American liberties. He also showed the strong faith of two families who witnessed the first generation. I also appreciated the fact that becoming a Jehovah's Witness affects family members who are not witnesses and that it is difficult for them to accept the fact that they do not celebrate holidays. Unfortunately, families who are not witnesses do not think about having their family witnesses for dinner / family visits or giving them gifts at any other time than for holidays or birthdays. With respect to the medical care that witnesses want and expect from high-quality medical care, what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for negligent medical care and surgeries while non-spousal treatments of blood are pushing the medical team to be highly qualified and well trained. treat your loved ones? I highly recommend this video!
