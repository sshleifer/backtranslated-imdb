Peter Bogdonavich has made a handful of really great movies, and they are all among the best. The actors could not be better equipped to play this light comedy, but slightly bittersweet. It is interesting to note that the light and witty touch that Bogdonavich employs effortlessly gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. Fresh and immediate, the film begins without any explanation. There is no soundtrack to warn us. We meet the characters in action, and while Bogdonavich roams the streets of New York, the film unfolds effortlessly. Robby Muller's camera captures all this with a discreet simplicity that seems accidental, but surely is not. The casting is great. In every way, a classic.
