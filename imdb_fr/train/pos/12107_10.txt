I saw this film when I was a kid in Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a rather scary movie, but not as good as the Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, which is different from what I remember because in the DVD I bought, there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and / or Italian and where no -title is not provided. Then, the other actors answer in English to what was said. A little weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some actors are spelled differently than on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, this film is different in that the character Elsie undresses and provides a nude. shot in a scene and in another scene, Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to kiss her by pushing her on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists. This scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there are additional sequences that could be included in an ultra remastered edition? It seems unfortunate that some of these old, low-budget classics have been spliced ​​up and sold in all sorts of edited versions. Where are the soundtracks and all the unused images? <br /> <br /> Aside from the boring first minutes before Allen's arrival at the castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There are not too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia hit him is good). The frightening atmosphere and the strange, exotic and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the film much better than it should be. Honestly, I can say that if Barbara Steele was not present in this film, it would be a big zero. She makes the film to ten!
