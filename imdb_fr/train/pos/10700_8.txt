It's a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave pretending to know or care about communism and the reality of the Russians or the British, if you accept and the conventions do not hurt you, you can have fun with this movie. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin manages to avoid being completely outpaced by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does a good job as well. The finale is moving, and logical - movie logic, of course. To watch, if you accept the rules of the game.
