'De Grot' is a great Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, "Het Gouden Ei" was transformed in 1988 in 1988 by the mysterious thriller called "Spoorloos" ("The Vanishing"). This one is not as good as this one 'The Vanishing') but there are times when it approaches it. <br /> <br /> The first moments are particularly pleasant. We see a man, later we learn that his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When he gets his bags back, it's pretty clear that he's smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and played. A kind of suspense is created that you would not normally have in an opening scene like this. Later, we will see how Egon contracts in Thailand with a woman, both claiming that they have never done anything like this. <br /> <br /> From that moment, the film is constantly back and forth. We see how Egon, still a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy by the name of Axel (as a child played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. At that time, he sometimes meets Axel but does not really want to deal with him. <br /> <br /> The film is chronological. He shows Egon and Axel as children, only as students, young adults and in their thirties. But from time to time, as I said, the film goes back to their childhood and takes a leap forward. Whenever we see them as children, it explains something that happens when they are adults. <br /> <br /> Minor devastators. <br /> <br /> The title means "The cave" and it is the cave. it gives the film its happy ending, although it is not so happy. As in the beginning, the end is fantastic. The central part of the film is entertaining and distracts our attention from the first scenes, only to come back later. It is the editing that gives the film its happy ending, although we can say that the dramatic ending is happy too.
