Based on Gackt's idea, Moon Child took place in a poor country called Mallepa. In a futuristic scenario, the story follows the lives of the two main characters, Kei (HYDE) and Sho (Gackt), and their friends who grow up together. <br /> <br /> Despite some actions, these could be excessive or perhaps humorous. I firmly believed it was a film about friendship. Even among all the difficulties between each character, in the end, each of them wanted to have someone on his side, to have friends. <br /> <br /> Unlike most vampire characters, Kei described a vampire who hated the idea of ​​having to kill to live. A vampire found friendship in the hand of a young boy, Sho, who is not afraid of Kei. Regardless of what some might have thought, I consider Kei as a father figure for Sho. Kei was there throughout Sho's life, caring for him and teaching him to live in a world where gang power controlled their lives. On the other hand, Sho, who may perhaps be perceived as a young man with an enthusiastic and innocent style, has grown to become a man who has realized that life is not just about fun and games that death exists and that he is able to carry away his loved ones. . <br /> <br /> I like the role of Lee Hom, the actor who played the role of Son, on the screen. The way they met was really cool. His film also plays an important role in the film. The fact that he came from another race, a Taiwanese, had a considerable impact on the theme of friendship in the film. The way friendships were made despite the differences in background was very well described in this film. <br /> <br /> I thought every actor did a great job, knowing it was their first appearance in a movie of this size. Both HYDE and Gackt managed to behave well and created quite credible characters. Unlike movies where a musician had become an actor and filled the film with songs, they did great acting work! Moon Child really had an impact on me, he gave friendships a new meaning and a new consideration, we must appreciate every friendship of our life. The film shows a lot of hope, despite all the bad things that happen in their lives, that there is always hope. Life can be cruel, it seems that hope no longer exists. This also shows a very strong sense of friendship between them, even when Son became the enemy, Sho had a kind of "fun" in their last fight. Each of them wished for peace at the end, no matter how far apart. The final scene showed it to us.
