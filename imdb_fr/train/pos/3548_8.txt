I just saw this film version of Frank Loesser's Guys and Dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen it before. She was pleasantly surprised by the voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she thought the footage of Havana where Simmons and Brando were dancing a storm was excellent. These were quite impressive for me too and were usually the highlights of the film. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this film that began as a story of Damon Runyon takes some time with the slow rhythm of non-musical scenes at the beginning, but takes you in a moment. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not as convincing to me, but she still had her charms, especially during the "Sue Me" issue. Also liked Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, Rock the Boat" and the performances of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. Guys and Dolls is not an excellent musical, but very well with a theatrical appearance.
