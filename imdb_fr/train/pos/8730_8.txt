Many Americans would say ... What ??? to my opening comment. Yes, I know that my comparison is definitely an insult to Master Akira Kurosawa's fans, but if you analyze this film, my comment is correct. We have the peasant who goes to the city to seek help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village. The big difference is the way the story takes. Our samurai, a band of circus artists as in the original, form a very complex mix of personalities, but in the end, this is what the village needs, HEROES. Please review this amazing movie (the seven samurai, of course) and find another movie that stole the story and tried to get the same magical effect as Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece. A tip is the 13th warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to write his best seller, but he did not find the third foot of the cat.
