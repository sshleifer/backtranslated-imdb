The young and energetic producer of theatrical prologues (these staged performances, usually musical, which often filmed the film in the big cinemas before) had to face a distorted competition, fraudulent partners, unfaithful lovers and the talent of 'amateur to realize his dream on FOOTLIGHT PARADE. <br /> <br /> Although very similar to Warner's other musical shows, including GOLDDIGGER films, this film had a particular appeal: Jimmy Cagney. It's a marvel, flexible and supple, as agile as any other cat - a creature he imitates many times during the movie. Cagney catches the attention of viewers and never lets go, fueling the quick shooting dialogue and the old-fashioned plot with his charisma and floating charm. <br /> <br /> The rest of the distribution also gives the best of itself. Joan Blondell is perfect as a blonde secretary with a big heart and an elegant mouth, in love with Cagney (big problem: why did not she receive a number of music?). Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler again play lovers on stage and off; the fact that her talents of singer and actress are a little meager are compensated by her dance; Powell still exudes the boys' enthusiasm in his unusual position as a second man. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee and Hugh Herbert enjoy themselves as a brother-in-law, both wanting to deceive Cagney in different ways. Ruth Donnelly is the rich wife of Kibbee, a woman devoted to her beautiful protégés. The harassed choreographer Frank McHugh is a nod to Cagney's spirit. Herman Bing is hilarious in his tiny musical arranger scene. The Mavens will spot little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin and maybe even John Garfield on musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Busby Berkeley, nonpareil choreographer. Its terpsichorian confectionery, scattered throughout the decade of the 1930s, is a supreme example of the cinematic escape that the Depression public wanted to enjoy. The big joke about Berkeley's creations, of course, is that they were supposed, as part of the plot, to be theatrical productions. But no theater could ever contain these products of the master's imagination. They perfectly illustrate the type of entertainment made possible only by the camera. <br /> <br /> The Berkeley musical offer generally takes one of two approaches: a story (often rather strange) told with songs and dances; or beautiful numbers with geometric design, candy for the eyes, featuring many chorus girls, a camera above the head and a romantic melody. FOOTLIGHT PARADE culminates in three Berkeley masterpieces: "Honeymoon Hotel" and its pre-production code telling the wedding night of a couple; `By a waterfall '- dozens of unclad women, splashing, floating and diving into perfect patterns and patterns (watch closely and see how the synchronous effects were achieved); and finally, "Shanghai Lil" - a fitting tribute to the talents of Cagney and Berkeley.
