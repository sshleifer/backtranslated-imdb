The first movie was a good movie, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic that I found more poignant and endearing. This suite is inferior, but not bad at all. Of course, the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak points and the plot is a little uninspired. But the dogs are very cute here and Eric Idle is hilarious like a macaw. The film is nice to watch with an elegant cinematography and amazing costumes (especially those of Cruella), and the music is nice. The acting is generally very good, Ioan Gruffudd is attractive and Gerard Depardieu, while he gave better performances, plays like the accomplice of Cruella. But the best thing, as in the first movie, is the incredible Glenn Close in a delightfully exaggerated performance in Cruella, even more perverse than before. Overall, nice. Bethany Cox
