GBS wrote his own screen adaptation of this Nobel Prize-winning piece, but did not live until it was produced (he won an Oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914, PYGMALION). When Otto Preminger went on to direct (directed and directed) this production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he noticed that British author Graham Greene had made the adaptation and that it was a wise choice. <br /> <br /> Inspired by Shaw In his own script, Greene uses elements of the theater epilogue to create a device to merge the two acts of the play (one early and the other in Joan's story) into a unified and very satisfying whole. Where the change of tone is stamped with intermission, here it works just as well with a return to the bedroom of King Charles Balois (where the man that Joan put on the throne is dreaming of events that have led to his current situation), and more material from Shaw's epilogue - the introduction of John Gielgud's Warwick Shade (the English "King Maker"). <br /> <br /> The majority of the language is a solid GBS, and representations of Shauvian worshipers (such as Aymler's Felix Inquisitor or Harry Andrews' Stogumber) to relative newcomers (the movie established the career of Jean Seberg) are first rate. It may be confusing to see him play a frail and somewhat idiotic dolphin, who only knows the villains of Richard Widmark's cinema very well, but the performance - strangely top-billed - is professional, although it can be said that she was badly turned. the symbolism of the opening credits and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of the black and white shoot all serve Shaw and the story. Look forward to quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
