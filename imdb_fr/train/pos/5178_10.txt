Before Tuscan Sky, I saw the tender performance of Diane Lane in this film rather lark. Campers are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as an adult. Each of those who come back seems to be looking for something they have lost, which makes it so realistic. You may have had to be a camper to understand it, but in the words of a character noticing that all of his clothes were wet, "it's so camp!" Jokes and quarrels about boyfriends, the lady with the scary lunch and the dawn bell ... it's amp. Once exciting activities seem now banal. A formidable overall distribution makes the most of a two-dimensional role and makes them credible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when he fell in love with her!) Beautiful landscapes, bright colors, comic music (including variations of Hello Muddah) and comic actor's role in famous director Sam Raimi a movie that you can go out again and again like watching an old friend.
