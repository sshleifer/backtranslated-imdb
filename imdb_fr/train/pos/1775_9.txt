I often wonder why this series was so slammed. I thought it was brilliant and also very intelligently written and interpreted. I think that in the time to come, it will be seen in the light it deserves, that is, if they ever emit it. Many young actors in comedy appeared in this film and all continued their momentum. Maybe this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be published. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and especially Julian Rhind-Tutt of the hugely successful Green Wing. The writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best comedy writers of the modern era. Anyone who can produce a comedy like Ted's father could not be able to write something that does not deserve to be published. If it's published, I'll definitely buy it.
