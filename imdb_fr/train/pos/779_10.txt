In northeastern Brazil, the 12-year-old father of the illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells her daughter to the man at the center of a prostitution organization, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to be employed by house and have a better life. However, the girl is sold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) who deflowered her, and he gives the abused daughter to his teenage son to have his first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in Amazonas and explores her owner, the vile Saraiva (Antonio Calloni). When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro hoping to live a better life, she is explored by Central African Vera (Darlene Glória). <br /> <br /> "Anjos do Sol" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil to daughter Maria's fate. Last year, I saw "Lilja 4-ever" which tells an identical story in the former Soviet Union. therefore, this problem exists in third world countries. Director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents a great film exposing reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes. This is the beginning of the promising Fernanda Carvalho, who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child struggling to survive. Most prostitutes are amateurs and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Glória so different after so many cosmetic surgeries. The bitter and hopeless ending of history is also very realistic. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("The angels of the sun")
