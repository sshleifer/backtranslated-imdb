Polanski returns to the themes of loneliness and madness that he explored with such effect in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, in The Tenant. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is the trademark Polanski - dark, dark, disturbing - but there is something I am embarrassed by this film and I am not sure whether it is deliberate or not. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, who directed some of Bergman's finest films, is not doing justice here. His name being one of the things that really attracted me in this film, I was a little disappointed by the lack of really impressive cinematography in the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really leaves the film down is the actor. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten more than he can chew with Trelkovsky's difficult role. Some of the actors are excellent, including Melvyn Douglas as owner and Shelley Winters as a janitor, but others are weak and make the mistake. It is also difficult to overcome the fact that all these supposed Parisians have American accents. <br /> <br /> Quite unexpectedly, there are some beautiful black comedy moments in the film. Anyone who has seen The Killer Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is a good comic actor. However, there are times when it slips dangerously towards a parody of oneself. Trelkovsky's 'sudden' (and somewhat unexplained) 'transformation' is more likely to make people laugh than eyebrows, undermining what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey. <br /> <br /> In the end, the tenant is a pleasant and intriguing experience, even if it is a little too languid for its own good. There are a handful of exceptionally cold moments and an atmosphere always uncomfortable and disturbing, but this film, although very good, does not succeed as well as it could have done. <br /> <br /> Alas, at the end of the day, an "ok" movie from Polanski is always better than most other "good" movies. Worth a visit, do not expect to be blown away.
