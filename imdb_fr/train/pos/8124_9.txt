In addition to the great film METROPOLIS, it is the oldest pure science fiction film. Although the film is sometimes a little pretentious and the acting can be a little broad, it's an excellent film for two reasons. First of all, it is extremely original, both in its style and in its content. Even in the 21st century, I can not think of any film that looks like that. Second, at the time, the special effects were absolutely incredible: using matt paintings, models and huge casts to create amazing scenes from a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow. Of course, you can sit and hit the film because, by today's standards, the effects are only average. But, you must understand that it was at the forefront of technology when the film was released in 1936 and that the public should be really amazed. In many ways, the sets are reminiscent of the "modern cities" presented at the 1939 World's Fair. <br /> <br /> I think the film is also interesting because it seems torn by the question "people are they so stupid? " or are we destined for greatness? "The final result seems to be a bit of both! It's true! <br /> <br /> A final note: I've seen it twice on television and there's not much time on video. times the sound and print quality are nauseating - especially the sound.If this is available on a DVD, I hope it will be much cleaner and will offer optional subtitling. did not stop cutting, I would have really enjoyed it!
