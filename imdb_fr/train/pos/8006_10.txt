It's an excellent game! Okay, maybe he did not have some of the features he was supposed to have, but Digital Anvil still managed to make a good game. There is some similarity with Elite (you can swap, pick up weapons and cargo on destroyed ships, go on a mission), but this game has a strongly scripted mission. It's a big mission. The control system is different, it uses the mouse! Basically, you fly your spaceship around a system and you progress! The game has very good graphics even after its creation in 2003. It should work well even on a modest PC. The story features very good actors from John Rhys Davies, George Takei and Jennifer Hale (she appears in all computer games). Stick to the story, things get better and better. There is even a race section, where you and your opponent have to race between your spaceships on a course (this involves going through rings). This section took me a long time to beat. This adds variety to the game. Some sections are a bit difficult here and there, but overall you can beat this game. The game has an active mod scene on the net. Pick up some mods to extend the game. I have not played any mods yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a sequel to that was canceled, too bad!
