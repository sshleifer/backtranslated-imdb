I had been waiting for this film for a long time and I could finally see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe because I was expecting too much from this movie and that's why I was slightly disappointed. I was not the best movie in Korea, but it's still worth watching. <br /> <br /> The subject was interesting and the film allows you to watch without getting bored even if it is long. But there are gaps in the film and you move from one point to another. However, Jeon Do-Yeon's game is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in film history at the beginning and I think it would not be so nice if it was not in the lead role.
