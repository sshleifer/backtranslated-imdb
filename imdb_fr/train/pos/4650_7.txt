As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I enjoyed the Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) flying scenes in this film. One of the few disappointments was the jammer pod EWS 39, in this case an inert missile Rb 75 (Maverick) painted black with the letters "EWS 39" in white on the side. The real jammer pods really do not look like that, at least not the ones I've seen. <br /> <br /> But other than that, it's a fun movie with a very funny end (last minute). Whoever would like to see various Swedish military units, including the now legendary SSG, should see this one. <br /> <br />
