Good old Graham and black black and white have based people in dangerous times by doing heroic and mysterious things. Barely a shot or a punch and a hundred times more interesting than the glop that Hollywood makes today. Bacall illuminates the screen of course and Boyer is fully engaging. They do not make movies like that anymore.
