Steve Carell makes his debut in his first lead role in the 40-year-old Virgin, having had minor roles in such films as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work in the Daily Show. the comedy that Carell really does. You can say that Will Ferrell has influenced his "comic air" but Carell takes it to another level, all he does is innocent, kind and hilarious. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin produces two hours of non-stop laughter (or 4 hours if you see him twice as I did), perfect distribution and great tracks charmed the audience along the film. The script was perfect with so many beautiful lines that you will want to see the movie just to try to memorize them all. The music is very good for the film and you can tell the director that he knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Filled with sexual jokes, nudity and a lot of language, this movie is not for everyone, but if you like Wedding Crashers, Anchorman or any other film of this kind, you will love the Virgin of 40 years.
