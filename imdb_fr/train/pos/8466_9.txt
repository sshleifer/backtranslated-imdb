Like TALK RADIO, THE BOOTH is actually quite predictable (TALK RADIO, because we know the truth about what happened, THE BOOTH because, let's face it, the genre and the basic setup). It's not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. This means, in essence, that filmmakers do not punish in the end, as they might have done, say, in an American version of this story. THE BOOTH is advancing inexorably towards its (advanced) conclusion, but it is so beautifully designed at all levels that one can enjoy it as one could do on a familiar cruise along a very scenic route. It reminds me of Harlan Ellison's awful news, FLOP SWEAT. Claustrophobia is sometimes almost palpable. Worth a good look long.
