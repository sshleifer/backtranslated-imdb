After a heart attack, a famous conductor decides to return to his home village to lead a quiet life. There, he comes in Dutch with the local church choir, it will change his life. <br /> <br /> I had no expectations when I saw this movie for the first time yesterday; I like to watch foreign films that are not in English and in my life I have already seen two Swedish films, but this one was the best so far. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this film is a jewel, thanks to many things, one of which is the exceptional actor. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as an attentive, almost shy and dedicated conductor, Daniel Daréus. The beautiful Frida Hallgren is delighted by her pretty smile and subtle play. The members of the choir are all well-developed and interesting characters, each with their own story. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story, a beautiful story, about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man dedicated his life to music and tried to create a serene existence in his home village, while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life had been until then. Kay Pollack shows us that Swedes are exceptional film creators. Go see Så som i me himmelen, it's a film that makes you think about life and love, and that is also comforting, in a way.
