Higher and Higher was one of Rodgers & Hart's smaller Broadway musicals. By 1940, he had recorded only 84 performances on Broadway. Yet he produced one of their greatest hits, It Never Entered My Mind. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, except for a minor. song, So Disgustingly Rich, the whole Broadway score was removed when RKO bought the rights to the film. Instead, a new score by Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson was written, mainly to accommodate a certain Francis Albert Sinatra who was making his feature debut. <br /> <br /> Sinatra who had already made some vocal cameos in the previous films sheet of the page of her rival singing Bing Crosby. When Bing made his film debut in The Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra took the role of Frank Sinatra and I can not think of anyone who could have done a better job. <br /> <br /> The chairman of the board is ranked third here behind stars Jack Haley and Michele Morgan. He is the butler and she is Leon Errol's maid. In fact, Errol is a millionaire who has not paid for help for seven months. Mainly because he is about to embark on chapter 11 or so, he informs the staff. <br /> <br /> Errol is a charming old soul to work for and no staff member wants to lose a good thing. They pool their resources and ask Michele Morgan to pretend to be Errol's daughter who is in Switzerland with her mother. The idea is to recover a rich fund in the hope of saving the fortune of the family. Only Michele starts to look at another. <br /> <br /> This is a slight conspiracy and certainly not worse than many musicals, but RKO has invested this film with a good cast of musicians. Barbara Hale and Elizabeth Risdon play another debutante and her mother who suspects that something is wrong, Victor Borge is a fortune that is not looking for anything, Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torme and Mary Wickes play other members of the Errol Personnel family. Not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sang three good ballads that all had commercial success, The Music Stopped, a great way to spend an evening and I could not sleep a wink last night. The last was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song, but was lost by the song you'll never know, Alice Faye. <br /> <br /> 1943 is the year of the strike of the musician's musicians against the record industry. To release their material, Frank Sinatra recorded the songs of Higher and Higher with an acapella chorus for Columbia. Bing Crosby recorded the songs from his film Dixie in the same way for Decca. Both were denounced by union president James C. Petrillo as strikebreakers and no longer crossed the picket line. The strike did not completely stop until 1944, although Decca broke the ranks of the other record companies and settled earlier than Columbia, RCA Victor and the others. <br /> <br /> The strike gave rise to moments of anxiety for Sinatra. He had just left the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra when the strike was called. This closed a place of choice for his artistic talent when he did not know if leaving Dorsey would be a good career choice. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Higher and Higher were received and a legend was launched.
