I read an ad in a horror magazine in the early '90s about Liebe des Totes (love of the dead) or something similar. Of course, it aroused my curiosity so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The King of Death). Nekromantik's films are acceptable, even if they are interesting and unique in their approach to the subject Necrophilia (although they are obviously horror opera entries rather than invoking fear in the mind of spectator, they are actually quite fun.)> <br /> TODESKING, by contrast, is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made. It consists of a series of scenes describing the many facets of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a relief, death as the physical decomposition of the body itself. The film is a metaphor for life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces its viewers to the children they are (we) are actually. The central message of the film is that we can not really understand the nature of death and hence the process of death. It's a very realistic film. Buttgereit never tries to hide death behind white roses or anything. Whatever moral norms you have established, death is inevitable and will sooner or later be a fiction, but YOUR reality. This applies to YOU, dear reader, as it applies to moviegoers. Some juvenile critics seem not to understand this, which is totally excused, because they will live of course forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not an exploitation film. Why? Because death does not exploit us humans. This is harvesting us. We grow up for seven days, then we are brought back to the pre-natal Schopenhauerian state, that is death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of the tales. Whether you choose to consider him as "optimistic" or "pessimistic" depends on you. At first glance, this may seem very dark. Consider, however, that to live, something else must die. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body being consumed by worms, it does not only show the decomposition, but the GENERATION of a new life. Is it not better to die and give life to maggots and birds and finally become a soil, than to remain the dead zombie alive that is one of the favorite animals of the genre? <br /> <br /> When you realize this, you see Der Todesking in its proper context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven are the days of the week (weak, deadly!), Seven times the last hour. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of the Reaper, Buttgereit tells us, because the Reaper only takes what is ripe. And apples that are not picked for food will rot! <br /> <br /> Good life, IMDB friends! <br /> <br /> (And watch this film, which compares only Ingemar Bergmans "The seventh seal" in terms of depth and universality)
