I went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and I did not know if I had made a bad purchase or a good one. This is the end result of watching the whole movie from start to finish. Michelle Rodriquez, (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", 05, gave an excellent performance and her looks are gorgeous, sexy and at the same time a real study of how the game is actually played. Diana did not like her life at home and especially her own father for the abuse he had inflicted on his mother. She decides to take boxing training in a local gym in Brooklyn and is not really well accepted by male boxers. In his high school, there is a lot of friction between his classmates and his guys. There is a lot of action in the women's bathroom and references to the intimate parts of men. If you like boxing and you see a sexy and sexy girl doing wonders in the ring and hitting the boys on their side, you know what, this is the movie for you.
