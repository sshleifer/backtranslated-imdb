You sit there for half an hour and look at a story, believing everything, and then look back half an hour to the same story that is completely undone ... then you get back together. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting feature films of the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I do not know if, apart from Andrew Jarecki's "Capturing the Friedmans", there's already been something like Anna Broinowski's "Forbidden Lie $". He presents, exposes, defends, reveals and contests all that concerns Norma Khouri, author of "Honor Lost", acclaimed and scandalized bestseller of 2001 on honor crimes in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What is pretty incredible and what makes the film is so exceptional that this "exhibition" of Khouri is carried out with the full participation of Khouri. <br /> <br /> For the first part of the film, Khouri presents her story about the alleged murder of one of her friends in Amman, the story of the book. She seems completely credible, convincing. <br /> <br /> Then her story is dismantled, exposed, by eminently believable and compelling people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, investigative reporters there and in Australia, where Khouri lived a moment. <br /> <br /> Khouri returns and denies the charges, passing a lie detector test. There is another segment of devastating exposures - not to be specified here as this would reduce the value of the shock ... and then Khouri comes back and faces the accusations (not all, but essential to the book). /> <br /> And the Houdini act continues, turn after turn, in this heavy PTO fight, surprise after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of resolution. Brilliant.
