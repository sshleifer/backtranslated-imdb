OK, so a 10 for a 2 1/2 star movie? ... well see this one and maybe that will make more sense ... Hitchcock has never better mixed scenes together ... The film weaves scenes together perfectly from the beginning And yet you do not do not feel the scattered feeling that you sometimes feel when a movie shows you the many characters it is trying to develop. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual and they will not let you down when they do. The surreal narrative of the life of screenwriter / producer Phil Hay, combined with an absolutely superb soundtrack, is more reminiscent of the 6 degrees of separation of life than the film of the same title ... I will look for more good things from this producer in the future.
