It is an honest attempt to make a haunting and sweet love story. the obvious inspiration of the hit TV series "Bewitched", this beautiful and sweet romantic comedy is a timeless treasure. comparisons are obvious. jimmy stewart plays a "straight" unlucky but firm. Kim Novac plays a voluptuous blonde witch who captures him through a love spell. but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch, she just runs her own shop and is comforted by the fact that her dear mantle (her familiar feline) is taken care of by her beloved aunt. you will recognize the aunt of "Murder by Death". This film is fun and touchingly sweet, with a spectacular wit and a pleasant witch feel. worth a look.
