I remember seeing this movie at Radio City Music Hall when it was released. At the time, I did not really understand humor, but this film can make me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing, considering that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His mannerisms are first class. ("You know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And addressing the Spanish-speaking guy at the reception: "No! No! No enchilada !!") Absolutely hilarious! <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Richard Benjamin, who played directly with Matthau. <br /> <br /> I wish it to be on DVD because my VHS recording is a bit old. <br /> <br /> no interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen, because it can not in any case match the original.
