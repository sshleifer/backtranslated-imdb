Artimisia was late last night. At first, I did not think I would like it, but seeing that I did not feel like sleeping yet and that nothing else was working, I kept looking and I felt intrigued by the young Artimisia, virgin, pure and passionate. His romance with old Tassi has brought forth recognizable feelings. Even though the film is based on a very romantic level and not on reality, I loved it much more than the biographies and dramas of usual costumes. Super game, great shoothothots, good music and lyrics. I liked it and I want more! :-)
