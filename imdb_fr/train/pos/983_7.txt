I think this film has a lot to recommend, especially a particularly sinister performance by David Morse and a more than passable performance from Mr Foxx, still worthy of the name. Although there are many holes in the plot and the motivation is very, very difficult to follow in some cases, in the end, it's a good time in front of the tube.
