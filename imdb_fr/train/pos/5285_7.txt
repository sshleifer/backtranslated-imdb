One might think that you are ready for a serious visit when the premise of the film takes place mainly between two characters who travel about 3,000 km from France to Saudi Arabia, crossing most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour and there is no stop to stroll at the sight. <br /> <br /> Reda's father is in his twilight and wants to do the Haj. However, as it is out of the question to walk and take the mule, he chooses to drive to Mecca. He can not drive and therefore asks for help from Reda, at the protest of his son, to bring him there in their broken down vehicle. <br /> <br /> But Reda does not see the point in getting him to leave. when his father could opt for the plane. He regrets the idea of ​​putting his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he could not understand. And as a result, we went on this arduous journey with father and son, not being the best friends in the world. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is to witness the development of father and son couples, the challenges they face face to face, the strange people they meet, who have to fend for themselves varied weather and alternate breaks between motels and sleeping in the car. We see a generational gap evident in their attempt to communicate with each other, the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but circumstances show us that Reda is a fish out of the water. Thanks to their many meetings, they associate themselves rather well despite their differences. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps quite possible that this film is distributed here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji and have the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too will feel claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down her father among the thousands of people who gather. The curiosities of Europe may not have been deliberately inserted, in order to develop the anticipation of the final destination and to concentrate on it. <br /> <br /> It certainly sounded like saying and showing your loved ones what you value for who they are. Do not miss this, and yes, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that tonight's session was always full.
