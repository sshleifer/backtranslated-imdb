I really liked this movie. I've seen the original classic a few times, but I do not remember any details. I think this movie is much better than the cartoon, it is not as black and white as that. I particularly enjoyed how they made grinch such a complete character and explained why he was like he was, the villain in this movie was not the Grinch but the Major, very different from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was perfect for the game overall a great movie made for kids and adults.
