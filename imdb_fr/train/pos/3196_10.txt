This movie is amazing for many reasons. Harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and makes a relevant social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a small town kid who is (supposedly) well liked for his many imitations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for which he is very passionate), Gary's actions show that he is in conflict with the conservative social environment in which he lives. As a result, his action is justified for a variety of reasons, so that no one thinks he is in reality a transvestite or some other excluded person of this type. In the second part, Harris exploits the fight between Gary and Beaver in a novice attempt to tell a story from the original documentary. The third and final part of the trilogy is truly amazing for Harris's extreme sensitivity to the subject. Unlike the second part, "The Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a truly troubled character. He has trouble getting accepted into his own community without success. Her secret passion for dressing up like Olivia Newton John separates him even more from people who already consider him a gambler of society. The film is described so realistically that, like reality, it lends itself to many reactions. One can certainly see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic character, but also identify with him as an excluded.
