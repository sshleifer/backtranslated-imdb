A best-selling book on honor killings committed in Jordan is removed by its editors after allegations have been made to its article. associated with other allegations regarding the author's past as a scammer. A few years later, she resurfaced, conceding having taken a certain dramatic license but eager to cooperate with a filmmaker to prove the validity of his allegations. What follows is a fascinating insight into the pathological personality. Someone whose behavior only made sense if what she was saying was true, but who is apparently unable to say anything that is surprisingly dramatic but unproven and most often, verifiably false. It is almost impossible to imagine what Ms. Khouri hoped to gain by appearing in this film: a justification? celebrity? - All she manages to do is project a certain image of herself as a deeply damaged person, and even that can not be taken literally. The director Anna Broinowski appears more and more on camera as her film progresses and is more and more exasperated. but it is finally rewarded with a remarkable tale, albeit frightening and disturbing, to tell - and one of those films that reminds us of what a weird world we live in.
