I'm also looking for this movie for a while and I'd love to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old, in the Netherlands. And I was very impressed by that. It was shown before JUNGLE BOOK of Walt Disney! <br /> <br /> What I remember from this film is fragmented. I remember a young Indian friend with an eagle. It impressed me a lot. For some reason, he was expelled from his village (he did not understand the reason). When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped. At that time, he turned into an eagle and flew with his eagle friend. As an eagle, he always wore his turquoise collar. <br /> <br /> CB
