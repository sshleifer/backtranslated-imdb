After "welcoming home" my 23-year-old daughter to Iraq, a medical support unit at Camp Anaconda, I felt compelled to get this DVD. I wanted to hear the feelings of other veterans to better understand his mentality on arrival and not wait until something bad happened. Regardless of your perspective on war and peace, this film is a good start for all Americans to begin healing the emotional void of our veterans. The overarching statement of the whole movie is "Take Action" on the problem. Incredibly emotional film. I highly recommend this film to the veterinarian, veterans of the entire middle-aged family, and ask them to follow a plan to improve listening comfort to help the Gulf War veterinarians, Enduring Freedom. <br /> <br /> My daughter saw this DVD. Took into account his emotions and really committed to resume for another six years. Her time spent in the sand is that she did good. Local children in Balad have received first-rate medical treatment for a variety of common conditions that are generally not able to afford a free attendant and translator. She was looking over her shoulder during her tour of Iraq. "We've changed some hearts and minds out there" Great DVD, you have to keep an open mind and see all the sides
