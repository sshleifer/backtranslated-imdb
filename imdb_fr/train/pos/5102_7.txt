do not pay attention to the soundtrack, which is already played. <br /> <br /> Still, Debra Winger is still interesting and although it's a role earlier for her, she's very good as a Cissy, girl on the wrong side of the track, lived in the trailer with Bud (Travolta), only to be replaced for a time by city dweller Madolyn Smith as a rival. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous criticism about Scott Glenn, it's used for intrigue only, thrown into the mix to create a suspense; the story is predictable and artificial. <br /> <br /> Moreover, even if I come from the East, many of us did not like "Saturday Night Fever", even if it had its moments, the perpetual stereotypes are undeniable this point . <br /> <br /> To see for Debra Winger; she is still as friendly and never had the Hollywood character we are subjected to today by too many actresses. 7/10
