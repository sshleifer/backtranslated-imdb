I think this movie had to be fun to do, for us it was fun to watch it. The actors seem to have fun. My friends like boys and my boyfriends like girls. This is not really the case with a horror movie. I see a lot of horror movies and I would watch this all together again, or more because we laugh together. If these actors make other horror movies, I'll watch them. The big crazy man who hunts to kill the actors is really a good villain. It makes us laugh more together. If you ask me, I would give this movie a high score. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the market has more movies than the actors, but the main boy is cute. the actor with the big chest must be non real. they do not seem real.
