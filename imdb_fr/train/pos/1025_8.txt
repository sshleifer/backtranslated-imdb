My note refers to the first 4 seasons of Stargate SG-1, wonderfully fresh, creative and addictive. When the cast passed the door, you never knew what was on the other side! From season 5, the show took a different angle - always good, but different. <br /> <br /> The series follows the adventures of a team of human beings (and a stranger) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device the "Stargate". The story of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "Stargate" in which the camera was discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt. <br /> <br /> The episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch). and very creative. Many inventive stories could easily have been turned into great sci-fi movies. What happened next was always unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The characters on which the show is based are also well defined and brilliantly interpreted. Their tone is serious, but the dialogue flourishes with incredible wit and humor. They are just fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Beginning in about season 5, the series began to evolve into a continuous scenario based on fighting a single enemy (the Goa'uld, then the Ori). The parcels become more complex (much more political / strategic) and interdependent. The characters were still good but the show was different in nature. <br /> <br /> One thing to mention is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes. These are simply unavoidable programs. They present the creative and extremely humorous genius that led the series through 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you're a science fiction fan, watch some episodes of the first 4 seasons and you'll probably be hooked. If you like to change the scenarios between two opposing games, you have 10 seasons of series to hope for.
