It was the best Muppet movie I have ever seen! It turns out that I know that Miss Piggy's dream of meeting each other was the cause of Muppet Babies. The songs will stay in my head forever. I only say that because that stupid Nickelodeon Hey Dude show is still in my head. Sorry, a little off topic here. But finally, what pleases me is Animal after the credits saying "Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Hasta Luego! It made me laugh so hard. My favorite is the game at the end. I was surprised that the Sesame Street characters appeared at the wedding. I'm just glad this movie was a lot of fun. I borrowed it from the library, and now I bought it because I can not keep the copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I declare that it is the best movie I have ever seen! As far as I'm concerned, he's even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
