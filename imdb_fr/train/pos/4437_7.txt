This police procedure is no worse than many others of his time and better than not bad. Obviously, he follows in the footsteps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City", but presents himself as a nice programmer. The best thing about it is the unadorned look it gives to a world that has long since disappeared ... the lower class of New York in the late 40s and early 50s. Here it is in all its shady glory, from old school tattoo parlors to cheap hotels to greasy spoons. These old police films are like stories of travels from a bygone era and very bitter for all those who do not like the sanitized and soulless urban landscape of today. <br /> <br /> It is also fascinating to focus on the absolute scientific aspect of solving the crime ... in this case, the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main heroes, Inspectors Tobin and Corrigan, are doing the footwork, but without the tedious and laborious efforts of the "lab boys", they would have nothing. Although the technology is not in the same league, the police here use the obstinate persistence of a CI. An investigator to find their man. <br /> <br /> The way some critics wrote about this movie, you think it was directed by Ed Wood and performed by extras from his films. What a bosh! I liked John Miles when the ex-Marine gang, who became a policeman, became Tobin ... he had a casual, laid-back approach to this role, a welcome change from the usual stone-faced histrionic of most cinematographic cops of the time. . Patricia Barry is cute and lovely as her girlfriend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is stifling and funny like Inspector Corrigan. I rather liked the chemistry of these two and it created something a little different from the type of robotic approach "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> The mystery itself is not too deep and the pursuit and the final shootout are certainly not counted among the classics of crime film, but for its short duration, "The Tattooed Stranger "More than retained my interest.
