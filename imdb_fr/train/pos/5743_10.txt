I loved this film! It was all I could do to not cry while watching, but it's really edifying. I was struck by the performance of Ray Liotta, but especially by the talent of Tom Hulce, who plays Ray's twin brother, mentally slow following a tragic and terrible event for his childhood. But Tom's character, though heartbreaking, does not know self pity and is so full of hope and life. This is a great movie, not to be missed !!
