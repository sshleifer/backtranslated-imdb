This is certainly one of Jet's best efforts. Few actors are able to play the stoic as Jet Li can. The action is a quick shot and special effects enhanced for the sake of intensity. As a result, Americans might be a little caught off guard. A small suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li movie. I think it's a great introduction to Jet's work and I can not wait for more masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) reach the US market. A good mix of rifle shooting and physical conflict will satisfy most action movie buffs.
