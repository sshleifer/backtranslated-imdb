China O'Brien (1990) sought to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This production of Golden Harvet was directed by veteran director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately, he was lucky with Enter the Dragon or he lost the game because he is not a great director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Mrs. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this film was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could have been a classic action rather than a direct action filmed film. <br /> <br /> China O'Brien comes home to help her father. He has problems with the local crowd and he needs his help. She returns home and restores order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they be enough to overthrow Mister Big and his devilish acolytes? <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Cynthia Rothrock, then this movie is for you. I only enjoyed fighting scenes, all the rest is hogwash. Why did not Raymond Chow pay a few shekels and hire a top-notch action director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
