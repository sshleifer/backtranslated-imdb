Paul Lukas played a Russian intellectual earning his living as a waiter at <br /> <br /> "Grand Slam", directed by William Dieterle (1933). It's a surprisingly funny satire of celebrity construction. The waitress and the hairdresser of the Russian restaurant, interpreted by Loretta Young, become the favorite loves of the United States as deck partners who do not quarrel. With the help of publicist and ghostwriter 'Speed' McCann (Frank McHugh, the improbably impassive), they become itinerant advertisements <br /> <br /> for the "Stanislavsky system", a "system" allowing to bid on everyone <br /> <br /> (since the offers are not rational, the complaints about their stupidity are unfounded). <br /> <br /> A duel with the guru of the bridge moved Cedric Van Dorn (it sounds near Goren, no? and I suspect that the choice of the name of the character "Stanislavsky" was also a slam against another system) , a puffed quack played very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk, is broadcast on radio stations across America as a prize fight by Roscoe Karns (Another Great Voiceless Comic from the 1930s). <br /> <br /> The bridge players are even on a roped square, but the audience is <br /> on top of them, unlike in boxing "rings." <br /> <br /> The wide variety of American types prefigure Preston Sturges' comedies, although it is for the making of celebrities, the "Grand Slam" Most calls evoke two best films of the same era (before the Code), with Lee Tracy playing <br /> <br /> publicists who spoke very quickly: "The half-naked truth" and "Bombshell", but the "Grand Slam" has its moments <br /> <br />, especially for those who played bridge with serious pawns <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a clothing horse. (For me, his face seems a bit long and <br /> to chop too.The notion of beauty from another era, I suppose ...) The film <br /> <br /> unfortunately, there is almost no drops Glenda Farrell, who plays the role of McHugh's girlfriend <br /> <br />.
