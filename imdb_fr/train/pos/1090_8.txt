Mr. Blandings builds his dream home is one of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies. Judging by its size, this home would be a dream hotel today. Still, Cary made a good living in the advertising business as he tried to find a slogan for Ham with the brand name Wham. <br /> <br /> Why this film was so popular was the housing shortage of the post-war years. Veterans returning from the war were claiming their rights under the IM Bill of Rights, which included housing loans. The problem was that there were not enough houses to meet the demand. At the time when Eric Hodgins' book and film were so popular that Congress was passed and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Act, which placed the government for the first time in the housing sector. the construction of houses. <br /> <br /> I had an uncle and an aunt who were building their house at about the same time, in which they moved in the early fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, they had two daughters and were trying to get out of downtown Rochester. Their house was not as big as a Connecticut house with 18 rooms, but they lived there the rest of their lives, like Cary and Myrna probably. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was expensive and the costs keep rising, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas among them to offer advice, usually too late. To be honest, he loves Myrna and Cary knows it. Myrna Loy's role is just an extension of Nora Charles. If you can imagine Charles moving into the country and William Powell having Cary Grant's headaches, the movie would still work very well. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings builds his dream home still works well as a comedy because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my uncle Walter and aunt Kate who lived together in the house of their dreams for over 40 years.
