Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for everyone who loves Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The main protagonist of the film is most certainly the bastard son of these two strange fathers. As for the other characters, they are familiar transformations of stereotypes of similar action films. Where this film is original is in the mix of traditional Hong Kong movie style with the Hollywood action adventure. Unfortunately, this was not the case for the films he made in Hollywood.
