The comment of the person that Pat Robertson is evil and that his program is diabolical has nothing to compare with what is evil and the right. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days, people will call evil and evil well! He does not even know that he has fulfilled biblical prophecy! If you do not know God and refuse to know Him now, it does not matter. He still loves you, but when you finally bow to Him, and you will love Him, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone to hell, not even you! You will go there of your own decision and your spitting defines it! May God have mercy on you and give you an experience of the road to Damascus. The Club 700 and Pat Robertson department is one of the reasons I'm still here. At the limit of alcoholism, adultery and probably death, God reached out across the television screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thank God, he did! You have the right to say what you said but you do not have the right to curse with your words. God have mercy on you.
