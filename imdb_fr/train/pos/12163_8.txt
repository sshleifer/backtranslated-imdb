I found the film quite expressive, in the way that the main character was lost but at the same time much clearer on some things in life than the people who made fun of him (his roommate for example). <br /> <br /> he was tortured and you liked to watch him get tortured! he had this perverse side that was scary but we were all happy to see him out of misery. <br /> <br /> it was like a game character or a man panic across a mined terrain or towards an enemy and we like to watch him under sniper attacks or shots but at the end we are happy to see him survive ... <br /> <br />.
