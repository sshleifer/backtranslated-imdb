This is one of those films for which they have been promoting too much. If you watch T.V., you may as well not watch the movie. Almost all the fun scenes are spoiled in the previews, with the exception of Jennifer Annisten, who is the funniest. It's Jim Carrey's typical humor and it's really funny. But do not go see this movie hoping to be surprised. All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or the comedies, it's a must, otherwise watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied.
