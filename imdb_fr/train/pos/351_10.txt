It's a colorful slasher movie. That is just about everything. <br /> <br /> It contains the mystery element that SCREAM has made so popular in slasher films, but I never care about such things. Determining who the villain is is not very interesting since the clues are all misleading anyway. <br /> <br /> The death scenes were inventive and bloody, bringing back memories of 80s horror movies like Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about this movie is that it is difficult to locate the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> People who do not like slasher movies will not like this movie. As simple as that. I really enjoyed it and I intend to watch it again while waiting for the same thing. <br /> <br /> --MB
