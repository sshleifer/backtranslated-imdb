A scientist working in isolation frantically finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. All (pseudo) science and technological advances speak of the 1930s, including the idea that radioactivity could cure any disease if properly exploited. When he summons his rivals - who threw him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him - to witness his discovery, they propose a "joint" expedition to Africa ... of course, they end up stealing a lot of dr. Rukh's original discovery, giving him only residual credit. On top of that, a weak effeminate who looks like a comedian actor's worst Abbot & Costello (Lawton) literally steals dr. Rukh's (Drake) trophy girl falls madly under the spell of this human being. To have pushed horns like a deer was not going to do dr. Rukh (Karloff) friendlier, so he embarks on a secret revenge mission ... killing 2 of his enemies and his friend dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one to have helped him ... finally succumbing to the deadly radiation that had allowed him to start his revenge at first but (to my biggest dissatisfaction) to spare adultery and this poor excuse for a human being she was married. Playing is on the whole very well, with Karloff & Lugosi very good. Check the hysterical scene of the maid ... Other characters do not deserve to be mentioned ... Recommended, a bit like all the old horrors Universal ...
