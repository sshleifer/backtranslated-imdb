Nagra comes from a conservative Indian family who does not really like girls playing football. But our young and pretty star CAN play football seriously. Rhys-Meyers coaches Nagra and encourages him to perform, while Knightley is a teammate and a supportive friend. When sis marriage is scheduled on the same day as the ultimate football match, what can a girl do? Uniquely similar to BFGW, Nagra tries to push the boundaries of traditional family practices. Here, it's dad (well played by Kher) who can see both sides of the issue. Moored a whole point for a late non-crisis sexual hokey preference, if they needed filling, they could have gone elsewhere. Nice final to close the deal.
