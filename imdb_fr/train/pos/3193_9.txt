The short film that starts this film is the real sequence of a guy named Gary, apparently taken at random from the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in the city of Beaver. Gary is a little "different"; he is an imitator and drives an old Chevrolet named Farrah (after Fawcett). A little later, the filmmaker receives a letter from Gary inviting him to return to Beaver to obtain images of the local talent contest he has organized, including Gary's stunning performance in Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh my. The following two short stories are Gary's story, the same one you just witnessed is described by Sean Penn and the second by Crispin Glover entitled "The Orkly Kid". If you're in the mood to make fun of someone, it's definitely the movie to watch. Most of the time, I burst out laughing, especially the performances of Crispins, who could very well fend for themselves. When it was finished, I had to rewind the movie to watch once again the real Gary and all his stupid idiot. Although Olivia was the center of attention, I would have liked to see one of the "fictional" shorts take a dip in the imitation of Barry Manilow by Gary, who was just as ridiculous.
