Since the day I hear about it, that is last year, I want to be cut. Anyway, I could see today, and when the movie started, I thought it started a week earlier, but it improved after about 10 minutes. I thought the movie was very good. but the thing I did not like was how the killer was created. I thought, just before renting, that it would be like a legendary Urban. almost everything in UL's final cup had to be improved. CUT is 100 times better than UL: final cut. The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scenes. Killer kicks MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I give a cut of 8 out of 10
