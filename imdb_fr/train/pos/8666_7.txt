Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking gangster who engages in illegal police or gambling (for reasons that seem obscure to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thug who frequents a billiard room and spends his free time envying Frankie. By being in the right place at the right time, Tony gets arrested with Frankie and is sent to jail ... where they form a bond that may not be a friendship, but it will go for the moment. <br /> <br /> This film came to me under the title of "Frank and Tony", which is disappointing because I see another name is "Mean Frank and Tony Crazy", which would have allowed to sell the film more efficiently. I presume it's a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry", but what do I know? I watched it shortly after another Italian crime movie, "Violent Professionals", and I must say that the two complement each other very well. <br /> <br /> The Italians have always lagged behind the Americans in their budgets and their value of shame with this film. It is considered a "grindhouse" movie, which unjustly retrogrades it into movie B (or worse). With a sharper sound and image, it could have been a success in Hollywood, I guess. I found the story very interesting, the characters (and actors) being better than average and unlike "Violent Professionals", the plot is quite clear - not too many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you like mafia movies or crime movies you should try this one. A film about the crowd coming from Italy (how much more authentic do you want?) Is all you can ask for. Of course, it's not "The Godfather", but it's not supposed to be. It's not a drama, it's a light comedy, an action-packed action movie ... like "Die Hard With a Vengeance" from the point of view of the bad guys. Okay, not really. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, this film made me want to watch other films from the director and the main cast. Movies other than "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and the usual cult movies. What's more fun than discovering a lost classic?
