Well, what can I say after watching this fantastic movie, while my nerves are still shaking! Jacques Audiard, the director must make a name for himself in France, and rightly so. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos is not Penelope Cruz either, but these two actors are fantastic. It is a tense and convincing thriller that begins slowly with a clever character build, then with tension. Climax. Others have written on the plot, so I will not say more than everyone in this movie plays his role to perfection, the director, the actors, until the cameraman, and everything looks so real, no game stupid weapons, fighting when it happens is so credible, the expressions, the emotions, it's almost like we're here as spectators. Indulge yourself, get the DVD, a bottle of wine, turn off the lights, pick up the phone and dive into this hitchcockian thriller :)
