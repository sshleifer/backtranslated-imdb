Simon Pegg plays the role of a grossly brutal and often uncontrollable celebrity journalist from England to work in a major American magazine. Of course, his ways of winning create all sorts of complications. A fun, fact-based comedy starring Kristen Dunst (rather adult), Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. It works mainly because we love Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We understand perfectly why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent mistakes. I liked the movie. That's not all, but it's a good way to end the evening by watching movies on the couch. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
