This film presents the type of overall work desired in each film. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play the husband and wife) have a positive thrill, discussing the "family business" as if it were a grocery store or a laundry. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are also great. They play each other as members of a prominent theatrical troupe, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support others selflessly. And finally, there is Sammy (David Dorfman). What an incredible performance of a child ... and what a disturbing resemblance to Ullman, whose son he plays! <br /> <br /> We tell a unique story in "Panic", and it's a rarity in those days of tired formulaic shit. The dialogue is lively and intelligent, and this relatively short movie nevertheless has the power to elicit a range of emotions in the viewer. There are places to laugh, to be shocked, to be horrified, to be saddened, to be excited, to be angry and to love. It's not a movie that makes you happy, but once finished, you're more than happy to know that you've spent the last 90 minutes experimenting with a really good job. <br /> <br /> go to the theater if we have been treated to quality prices like that. When will the powers in Hollywood wake up? It's a shame when something so good fails to make itself known beyond the festivals and households fortunate enough to have cable.
