I just bought the restored version of a movie that I remember with great affection since my childhood and that was certainly designed to entertain the afternoon. Bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form, deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) perfectly connect events. What's a little disconcerting is how the scenes were remastered. Obviously, the soundtrack of these images had been lost or damaged, which caused Disney to double the scenes with a new dialogue. Which would have been great, except that half of the actors were not there to do it (some for better reasons than others) and that the whole thing is rather mediocre quality. The timing of the lips is rather mediocre and the voice of David Tomlinson was doubled by a guy who does not sound like David Tomlinson at all (there is in fact an allusion to the German, I think). However, it is good to hear the full versions of all the songs (although "Not in the Right Direction" is still missing) and the magic moments of this film are still visible. And I challenge you not to laugh when the young Paul looks at Angela Lansbury and her fools as if innocently: "But what does that have to do with my joystick ??"
