Seven young people go to the forest in search of a bear. Soon they are all harassed and murdered by a crazy veteran from Vietnam. "Trampa Infernal" is a pretty entertaining Mexican slasher that reminds me a lot of "The Zero Boys". The film is fast paced and there are good death scenes, like a slit throat or an ax on the neck. Unfortunately, there is not much gore, so fans of grand-guignol will be disappointed.However, if you are a fan of slasher films, take a look at this rarity Mexican horror movies are rather obscure (I only saw "Alucarda" and "Do not panic"), so this should be another reason to see this nice slasher. My rating: 7 out of 10.Highly recommended.
