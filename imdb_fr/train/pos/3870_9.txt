It's an extremely dense, dark and complicated film that unfolds slowly, revealing unsustainable details, such as attention to a novel, and watching this film "EST" as watching a novel unfold. Even though I mocked the narrator and felt that he was out of balance with the rest of the performances, this film features some of the best ensemble actors I've ever seen, and the lead role, Summer Phoenix , is fabulous. Her innocence and naivety are sometimes implausible, sort of like a mix of Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy this review, but it's still fabulous, partly because it's different from anything I've ever seen before. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly beautiful, shot by Eric Gautier and is part of what is so unique about This movie shows how it never shows what you expect. It's always surprising, and despite its length, the film never reveals more than it should. At 163 minutes, it's extremely concise, which is one of the wonders of this film. Here you'll find some breathtaking, some of the best moments you'll ever see all year long, and all these moments add up to an extraordinary cinematic experience. The family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant and what this movie has to say about the theater has not been seen in the movies since "Opening Night" of Cassavetes, or perhaps "Limelight" of Chaplin. But, believe it or not, this movie is a lot "less" conventional. I never knew where this film was going, and now, having seen it, it still has multiple possibilities. It's a powerful film and incredibly provocative.
