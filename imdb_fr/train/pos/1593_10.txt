The show is about two sisters living together. Holly being the youngest has some problems with adolescence, but her sister Val has problems with her job, her boyfriend, her fianc√© like most women on the planet. They try to support each other, they make mistakes sometimes, but they do not give up and continue. And the show also speaks of friendship. Priorities in life I liked this show so much. It's funny and the actors are really good. I'm really sad that the show is over. I always watch reruns from time to time :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new to comedy but she plays very well. She is one of the actresses I like to watch. I like the relationship between Vince and Holly, they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh whenever he shows up. With Tina Holly, I found a real friend and I really like to go out. Lauren's character is so funny and is a natural talent. I would like to see her more. This show really takes you and makes you laugh. I wish the show was not finished.
