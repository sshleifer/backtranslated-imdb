After confusing Halloween with a replay of WAR OF THE WORLDS, a classic adaptation of Orson Welles to a real Martian invasion, a group of stupid Martians shows up on Earth and does not seek to conquer that his plans go wrong with reality. element and in reality alone. <br /> <br /> This is often very good and fun, with some decent lines (just check out the memorable quotes) to get started. This will probably appeal to science fiction fans. This has stood the test of time for me because in reviewing it recently, it turned out better than I thought. Despite a distribution composed of unnamed stars, it is perhaps the most martian invasion ever filmed. It is interesting to note that the Martians themselves seem to represent almost all the classic stereotypes of science fiction action heroes / heroes (cool 1950s teenager, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and spooky scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Prepare to die! Scum of earth!"
