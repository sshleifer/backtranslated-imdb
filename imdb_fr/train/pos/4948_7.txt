It is a superbly realized, simplistic film that explores a theme and gives each viewer something different from it. The premise is simple: an unnamed celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to look for a role to come by visiting a store and observing people. He is particularly interested in the cashier of the way of the "10 articles or less" (Paz Vega), to whom he finds a kind, strong and curious presence. <br /> <br /> The two actors play brilliantly and bring solid dimension to the characters in what is a character study. Not a conventional character study; they represent each of the whole worlds. The cashier's life is plunged into a rough and frustrating "real world", while the actor is so absorbed by his fantastical existence that he can not perform simple tasks like remembering phone numbers. He readily admits that he makes faces when he talks to people, and the interest of research on real people shows that he does not belong to it. <br /> <br /> But the actor is not only inspired by real people for his work. ; we also see the opposite process. Many characters recognize "Him" and refer to the way he inspired him in his film roles. <br /> <br /> The favorite tale of the cashier "Al Pasar la Barca" describes how a girl refuses to hide behind prefers to pay (for example: to do an honest job) for the passage by boat, would not could not be better chosen. This is the character of Vega, the only store employee who has a brain or an ambition, who is willing to work hard to succeed. (That's quite an aspiration, for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) It's a weird little movie, probably made to very small size. If the slow pace and the talkative approach do not bother you, this movie will entertain. The characters are perfectly contrasted and the effective game makes them endearing. A beautiful watch.
