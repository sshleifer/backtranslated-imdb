For fans of 1970s Hammer horror movies, this film should be a treat. The only thing I did not like in the movie was the fact that Peter Cushing was lost in the worst episode. In general, however, it is a small, solid and spooky film. If it's not the best Amicus movie, it's certainly one of them. The best episode, rightly kept for last, is the one starring Jon Pertwee as a horror movie actor - he's really excellent. As good as Pertwee has been in this role, it's hard to believe that he has not done more of this type of film. All in all, it's an entertaining film that scared me like a child and still gives me goose bumps.
