I loved this film. I thought it would be easy to look at and easy to forget. I went out after watching this to buy the DVD, it's not easy to forget! <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant and the casting could not be more perfect. Every character has its moment, and I laughed all through this movie, the timing of the comedy was perfect. <br /> <br />
