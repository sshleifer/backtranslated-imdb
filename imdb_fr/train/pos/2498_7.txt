I found it in the box "Danger After Dark" and I watched it only because of my interest in the performances of Hyde and Gackt. I was expecting a cheesy horror movie that was a huge party gore and with a very bad dialogue. Which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in America. Instead, I was intrigued by the good development of the characters and the way Sho (Gackt) evolves as a person in the movie. The acting talents of the two stars were surprisingly good, considering that they were not professional actors, and the director did a remarkable job with all this, fixing it in the future, without the flying cars and the panels holographic display. <br /> <br /> By the way, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other film in which I saw it is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada. In this film, he seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is brilliant, exuberant and hyper, serving as a kind of comic relief with her antics. Shogo was the big guy on the island who killed without thinking. So watch his performance, if you know Battle Royale, you will be very surprised by him. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by the summary on the back of the box. because it's not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire. This Hyde character is a vampire is almost a historical fact with what is really happening in the foreground, and you will love the last scene. It is a very moving image at times, photography is really well done. It's definitely something to take next time you go to Blockbuster.
