I have not seen a movie with Nolte yet that I did not like. However, having said that, he made a lot of films and I saw a few. In my mind, I keep the pictures of his performance here and that of "The Thin Red Line". Nolte has a full range of acting talents. When you have to scream, he roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are those that I cherish in the actors: when he emotes by gestures of the face, hands and body, without saying anything. After concluding that, overall, our generation of actors had no idea what an actor can do without speaking, having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of Keaton and Chaplin, this generation of actors relies too much mechanical magic of computers. Of course, it is also a sign of the times in which we live. If Chaplin had lived in our time, who knows, he could just as easily have become a CGI tool enthusiast. <br /> <br /> I have not read Vonnegut's novel from which this film is presented on screen. However, the plot is not so exaggerated or complicated that we can not follow the path laid out, even with all its surprises. Of course, at first, it seems absurd. However, that is not impossible either. <br /> <br /> Think about it first: A spy in the heart of the Third Reich: The extraordinary life of Fritz Kolbe, the most important US spy of the Second World War by Delattre and Prichard (look on Amazon for more details). Consider: Undercover Story: Drill the Reich: DVD of American Spies Inside Nazi Germany (I saw this here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml? id = 75054) appears to be a production of History Channel. <br /> <br /> Is the story ridiculous? Far from looking yes, impossible, no. Back to the plot. Nolte's character is recruited and accepts an incredibly dangerous mission. Unfortunately, the script does not give us reason enough to accept. Was it a kind of passivity that he let himself be swept into this role, as he says because it was the best story he ever wrote and he had to play the role? It's hard to imagine that none of us would understand. But it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is excellent in the movie. Alan Arkin, always fantastic, is very good in a small movie. role. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked by the end of the movie (no, I will not spoil it) and it made me feel bad about the choice. Did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had talked about all that was needed and that there would be only chapters added to a life already filled with many burned pages? Hard to say, but it really makes jolts. <br /> <br /> Nolte gives one of the best performances you can expect .... the film's premises make you wonder about a lot of things. It's very fun and challenging. What great movies should be. A bit long but it's worth it. By the way, the movie music contains selections from one of the best living composers: Arvo Part.
