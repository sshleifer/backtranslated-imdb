This film is one of the most underrated films of his time. When you watch this movie, you are filled with action, and when something does not really happen, the humor does not match. A brilliant writing for a film that was designed to offer us a bloody mix, a game show in which criminals are the candidates, and a near future where the general public is all thirsty for blood.Also Arnold does not leave us I do not want to spoil anything for you, but I'll tell you when Arnold will give his "line I'll be back" He'll get the best answer from everyone in this movie. I hope you enjoy this jewel as much as me.
