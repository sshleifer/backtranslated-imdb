Although the premise of the film is rather lame (one is diagnosed with "hornophobia" a diagnosis for Ollie), the film is a nice little film. It's also a lot better than the movies they shot after this one - probably since it was Laurel and Hardy's latest film produced by Hal Roach. In fact, it would not be a bad idea to see NONE of their latest films, because all the chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their roles only for pathos - what the real Laurel and Hardy movies would NEVER do . They had a small advantage that was missing in all subsequent films. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie work in a horn factory. It sounds pretty funny, but it's not. Unsurprisingly, with all that noise, Ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and has to miss work. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his last film with the team) recommends a trip to the sea. However, they do not like sailing and Stan has the idea to rent a boat moored at the dock - they can then get all air of the sea they wish without the least embarrassment! Once on the boat, a dangerous escaped criminal gets on board the boat and they all leave by accident. Fortunately, this part of the film was actually well paced and the end went very well. <br /> <br /> Even though it's not a complete Laurel and Hardy movie, it's been much better than many of them since it did not have annoying and distracting music numbers. (as in THE DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES IN TOYLAND). Plus, there's always a good amount of physical comedy - something you will hardly see after this movie. This was partly due to the deterioration of boys' health (and the growing size of Oller), partly due to the general insipidity of the latter films.
