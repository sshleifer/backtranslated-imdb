Gundam Wing is for me a good anime. A little slow (especially in the middle of the series), but especially nice. Now, before anyone jumps on my record and calls me a "winger," I have to admit that I've watched all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, The 08th MS Team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that the story posed some problems and that some characters may seem like "scams" (ie Zechs Marquise to Gundam's character), but this is an alternative show based on the original series. like SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this series, be sure to watch the original Gundam first, then be aware that you are watching an AU series.
