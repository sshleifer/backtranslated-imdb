I rented this movie last weekend, mounted the sound of the surround sound system and got an exceptional sound of special effects. This film is an excellent movie rental, the special effects are enough to scare my fiance, but I noticed that some seemed surprisingly generated by computer. I did not go to the movies to see that, but it's a scary end of the night, I do not want to release a movie. I would recommend it!
