"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 film from Ted Turner's library; Disney did it again in 1994, this time with the California Angels team (now the Los Angeles Angels) (Disney owned it and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team), also, good use of words, huh? ????). <br /> <br /> This film was about a couple of orphans who wanted to start a family. A man promised a family to boys, only if the angels had won the pennant. So, he called God one night about it. The boy who prayed could see the help arrive on the way (and ONLY this boy); for example, when the first angel had fallen, a player hit a ball so hard that not only the bat broke, but also the ball !!!!! For much of the post-All Star season of 1994, the Angels were at the top of western LA (my Rangers team is on the list and still is) . However, they lost a match because the boy was at court instead of the White Sox / Angels match (at the time, there was no central division in baseball so Chicago was in the west) and no angel was there to help. So, a new rule has been created: no angel can help in league games. But wait! In the last league game, the Angels won !!!!! It was a miracle! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: it's a good movie. I mean, I've been praying every night in the last couple of years asking for help with school and things like that; look at me now! My job was good !!!!! So, for one, it shows that if you believe, God can send his angels to help you with any problems you may have in life. And second, it's a family-friendly baseball movie that's always exciting. It's also an old Disney movie; I just saw this recently on New Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Angels in the outer field" will change your life forever once you've seen it !!!! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
