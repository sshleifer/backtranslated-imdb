In my case, I liked this film because when I saw it, I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated films that made me think about his themes even long after my end. He talks about death, vengeance and hell so that you become like a punch in the face, even going to suffer with the dream sequence in the middle of the film. That's what makes this movie so good: the unique ability in Don Bluth (director) to play with people's feelings and make them love or hate a character in no time. That, and the fact that there are so many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, that in the sad but happy ending, you have to say "I have something in my eyes" to hide the others you cried . All I said are just some of the highlights of this movie. For the rest, you have to see them yourself in an extremely honest movie. Don Bluth, thank you.
