It's a film that can make you want to see it again. I especially liked the way it ended. I did not see the end coming, but when Laws did not fly the first time, we'll be sure he'll be back. <br /> <br /> The story is captivating and could have been more psychological, but I understand it needed a story to capture the viewer and action was needed for that. <br /> <br /> Hard to believe that Michael Jr. can be as indifferent as his younger brother and mother were blown away. But I can understand that the scene did not really catch our attention because it had a bigger story to tell. <br /> <br /> Some have complained about Hanks' death. I think it's not justified. If his character had been a little harder, he would not care if his son was pulling a trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this one. Although it was released in 2002, I saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
