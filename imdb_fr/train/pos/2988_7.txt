The original with Barbara Stanwyk is saved only by Stanwyk's performance. The story and the other performances are too cute and the movie itself is too dated to be really appreciated today. The version of Bette Midler is much more interesting. This is Stella Claire, a free-spirited, single woman who becomes pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in an underrated show). She raises her daughter Jenny played so nicely from Trini Alvarado and comes to the conclusion that Jenny's father can do better for her and finally makes a decisive decision. Throughout the film, there are many laughs, tears and memorable moments, mostly between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason is Jenny's future mother-in-law, who, while wealthy, has a very good influence on her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just good movies with a lot of emotion, you'll enjoy the STELLA version of Bette Midler.
