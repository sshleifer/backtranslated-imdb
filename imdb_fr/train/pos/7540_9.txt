I really enjoyed this film. I have always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this film only highlights it. She represents a housewife in an African American family who is advancing in the social chain because of the success of the husband (Danny Glover) as a lawyer. She settles in a white neighborhood where people are friendly, but a little embarrassing to her. The various events that occur during the film make some laugh, but mostly appeal to other emotions. This film is less a comedy than a drama. I give him a strong 8/10. I highly recommend watching it on TV or renting it quickly.
