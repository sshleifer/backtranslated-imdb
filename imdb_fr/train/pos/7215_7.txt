FULL OF SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> This is a fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on Ira Levin's play about two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) who plot the murder of his wealthy wife (Cannon) to get the property . and insurance. The plot succeeds, but Christopher Reeve, the youngest and least established of the two writers, decides to play murder from the murder itself - with only slight changes in the details. Reeve allows Easthampton, Long Island, to become, for example, Southampton, Long Island, in the scenario. The rest of the play's plot is a deadly gift and to tell the truth, Reeve does not fear a little gossip or even an investigation into Cannon's seemingly accidental death. This will increase income and his own Warhol quotient. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, the playwright who makes megabucks and whose last four productions have been bombed and would like nothing more than to come back to the new room, perhaps with Reeve's help, who would redeem his reputation. He can not allow the scandalous play-a-key of Reeve to be produced. So what else? - he tries to kill him. In the end, they end up killing each other, the manuscript is seized by their neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and she earns a million dollars by selling it on Broadway. <br /> <br /> It's fun for a number of reasons. One is the conception of production. This multi-storey, multi-storey house with its large windmill, located on nine of the world's most valuable lands (Easthampton!), Would be a collection of splendid digs anywhere. You could not afford to buy a children's tent in Easthamptom. The house is not too big or baroque in its decor. It's just beautiful, although it's a little tidy for my taste, this kind of house so clean that you're afraid to walk on the thick carpet for fear of leaving a footprint. <br /> <br /> Next, the acting game could hardly be improved. Caine, Cannon and Fred Jones are superb. Dyan Cannon gives a perfect performance. The anxious wife, whose pants are so tight, seems to have been sprayed, which is good considering its strengths. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable niche in his role as an affable but psychopathic assassin. Irene Worth, as a psychic neighbor Helga, was sort of hard to define, a mistake. Certainly, she - or someone like her - was necessary to the plot, but, my God, what whip offending her character, walking around and claiming: "I feel pain in zis woom!" I guess to make her a little more interesting, she began to sweat and wear a mocking cap with bike reflectors. Nevertheless, she is a nuisance from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> We must love the dialogue of bitch Ira Levin. Caine, helpless, begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote this piece. "Because it's there, Sidney!" said Reeve, and Caine shouted, "These are mountains, not coins! The coins are not there until a fucking hole writes them!" Caine's call to the police is also excellent after his wife died of fear, as expected. He gets into a torrent of sobs, barely able to speak, as he reports the incident and begs for an ambulance to be sent immediately. When he hangs up, his face resumes his habitual placid expression, he gets wet in his handkerchief and leaves, again on business. <br /> <br /> The climax, although ironic, is confused, noisy and full. fireworks, devoid of the perverse charm that Levin and Lumet brought to previous scenes. The score is mainly composed of light riffs on the harpsichord, perfectly adapted to the film. <br /> <br /> You will probably appreciate it.
