There is a very intelligent humor in this film, which is both a parody and a tribute to the actors. However, after a while, it just seems like an exercise in style (despite big gags like Balasko continuing to play Dussolier and a very good acting game) and I wondered why Blier did this movie. Everything is revealed in the end, when Blier, who directs Claude Brasseur, receives a call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from the sky, and has the opportunity to say how much he misses. An effective and obviously sincere emotional hairdresser. But there is not really enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to make the rest of the movie interesting throughout the performance. Some scenes and sequences really nice, however, and all those who love these "sacred mosques" of French cinema should take full advantage of this film.
