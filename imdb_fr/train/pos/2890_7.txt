The animated Disney's 12th classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story. Although it is a little dated, it deserves a place in the list of Disney classics. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Disney's best works, but it's satisfying. One of the most "simple" works of Disney, certainly, but keeps some magic and some enchantment (for which the old Disney is well known). It was an important film because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If it was a failure, there would be no more Disney animated classics. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is sort of a return to Disney's first animated classic ("Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs") as it brings back the kind of fairy tale. The story is not clear, but I guess it's somewhere in France because it's based on a tale by Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many friendly characters, such as Cinderella, the prince, Bruno (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), the fairy godmother (for a fairy she is really funny) , the birds, the king and the grand duke. <br /> <br /> Jaques is very intelligent and funny. I like his voice. A really this quality of mouse. Gus may not be so smart, but he's humorous. <br /> <br /> The king is hilarious, but I think what makes him so funny is his short temperament. The Grand Duke is a very cool and funny guy too. These are two of my favorite characters in this movie and responsible for most of the most fun moments. <br /> <br /> The Prince is certainly one of the most charming of Disney. No doubt that Prince Philip of "The Sleeping Beauty" was inspired by this prince because they look a lot like. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (the mother-in-law) is not supposed to be nice. because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not much better than her. However, the mother-in-law is not as boring as her ugly, selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is sweet, kind, pretty and kind. By the way, I think that her beautiful pink dress is much prettier than that given by the fairy godmother. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (the cat) is hilariously naughty. The way he walks, his nose in the air and his arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny. Ironically, he looks a lot like the mother-in-law's personality. He always agrees with the mother-in-law's attitudes towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he is a devilish and mean cat. Still, it is not boring. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but enjoyable, even if it's not one of Disney's best. The best song of this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are many talented actors, like James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. . <br /> <br /> Despite its simple appearance, the film has beautiful illustrations and beautiful details, although it is never an "out of the ordinary" event. However, the King's Palace is a spectacular masterpiece, truly majestic and colossal.
