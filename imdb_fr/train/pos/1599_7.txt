"Moonstruck" is a charming little film directed by the narrator, Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, A Fiddle on the Roof, The Hurricane). The movie is awesome on many levels. It shows a good deal of Italian culture, a touching romance and (most importantly) a hilarious comedy. <br /> <br /> One of the aspects of this film that I liked the most is the relatively unconventional appearance of the actors. Nicolas Cage seems really weird for most of the film, and Dear ... well, Cher always looks a little strange. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun and easy-to-recommend movie. <br /> 7.4 out of 10
