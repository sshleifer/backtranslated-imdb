Richard Dreyfuss plays in "Moon Over Parador", a 1988 film directed by Paul Mazursky with also Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays a New York actor, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean country of Parador to make a film. When the dictator dies suddenly, the head of the secret police (Julia), who really controls the dictator and the country, asks Jonathan to play the dictator, after finding their likeness. Soon Jonathan is installed in the palace in the role of Alphonse Simms and Madonna (Braga), girlfriend of Simms, prostitute, who realizes that the switch promises to help him in any way possible. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, who appears in drag as Simms My mother shows us how the CIA operates in third world countries. The character of Winters, supposed to be a salesman, is actually a CIA agent. The film, however, flirts with but does not really work on very serious ground and is rather a commercial, and funny moreover. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss does a fabulous job as Jonathan the actor and Alphonse the dictator, creating two distinct characters and nailing both. The beautiful Sonia Braga is great as Madonna and Raul Julia plays the role of a funny funny role in the role of Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. It's one of those performances where you never really know what the character thinks - he can be nice or become a psychopath at any time. Charo is present as a maid and manages to be funny and discreet at the same time. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, not a big blockbuster, but a lot of fun.
