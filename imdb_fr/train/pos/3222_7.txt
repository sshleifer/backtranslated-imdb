The first two sequences of this film establish the two conflicts: the thematic conflict between Private Todd and his repressed humanity, and the physical conflict between Todd and his genetically modified replacement. Both sequences are exciting in different ways. <br /> <br /> The people's scenario weakens somewhat by solving the first of these bows at half of the film, which means that the second half is little more than a frenetic action. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, we congratulate the decision makers for having created a genre action movie with a little heart and even a little soul, and especially for Kurt Russell, who transmits a lot with very little . <br /> <br /> Not an excellent movie, but worth the trip.
