For those of you who do not know the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in her films - the Western assault on traditional Serbian values ​​- you will not be able to understand her stories. Kusturica chose to mandate this continuous theme, expressed through a fantastic and scandalous comedy. Since his fantastic work and Magnum Opus 'Underground', the films of 'Kusturica' 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a miracle', and recently with 'Promise Me This', his burlesque carnival style emphasizes westernization Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and its assault on the traditional idiom. In the case of "Promise Me This", the paradoxical world of the city (urban space) and the village (traditional idiom) is contrasted. The world of the city reflects Western attributes that have consolidated the spatial and temporal framework; Organized crime, sexual exploitation, torn identity and vehement disregard of traditional values ​​- expressed to the young kidnapper. The end of the film further illustrates this notion as we observe a funeral mass and a wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a rough collision; appropriately, the marriage, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, that is traditional values, is about to collide with the mourners, thus illustrating the death of tradition in this context. However, Kusturica examines this theme with brilliance through a unique stylistic singularity. With his scandalous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in his representation.
