His choice of films, the basic "vanity" of the production (which places it in the sets or simulacrum of the films he comments) and his performance are brilliant! But if you want Freud, know that you get Lacan's version by Zizek, which should not be confused with Lacan himself. As usual, Zizek delivers complex ideas brilliantly and convincingly. The problem is that it is also mercurial enough and that there could be more in its enthusiasm than in its content. Cinematically, it's a little gem. Psychologically, people of all persuasions (Freudian, Lacanian and Jungian) will scratch their heads, while looking for popcorn. Zizek is a phenomenon and an icon of pop to itself.
