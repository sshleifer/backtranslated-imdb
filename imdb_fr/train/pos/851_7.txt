Pierce Brosnan has sipped his latest Martini and returns, in a parody parody, as the aging and fiery Julian Noble assassin, who particularly loves teenagers, bullfights and pantyhose. During a work in Mexico, he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a banal businessman from the suburbs of Denver, who is in town to do his little business, in a hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and Julian's rude and insensitive remarks, they become friends. <br /> <br /> Widely worn by the performances of Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, director Richard Shepard revealed that he did not write the film thinking about Pierce Brosnan, but I can not to imagine without him. He proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or spies of the Cold War. The scene in which the two men meet in an icy hotel bar (beautiful and beautifully photographed scenery) is truly a play of dramatic art. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and, although it has probably been carefully written, the two actors largely improvise, but they do it perfectly! It's almost like a new standard for screen gaming. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS improvising and add one of the most subtle foundations of many genre shots and the own typography of the actors (James Bond of Brosnan in particular), and you will get one of the couplings the most delicious Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story runs out after a while. After an hour, the film runs out of steam. Nevertheless, and I can not put my finger exactly on it, I really enjoyed that. It seems quite fresh and original, with imaginative use of sets and lighting, as well as allusions to Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters do not have much to do, but this movie offers something new. In this respect, he manages almost effortlessly to mix all the classical genres into a very entertaining parody. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
