Toronto Film Festival 2005 Report It's official; "Takashi Miike" is screwed. <br /> <br /> The annual screening at midnight of the new film "Takashi Miike", "The Big Spook War" or "The Great War of Yokai" or "Yôkai daisensô". Call it what you want, it's a fanatical adventure. <br /> <br /> Colin Geddes, the intrepid programmer, said that this film was originally intended for children in Japan. Think of the "Lord of the Rings" or "An Endless Story" for Japan. After the screening, I can understand where they were going with this, but damn it's "Takashi Miike" after all. He directed the movie "Ichi the Killer" of 2001, during the screening at the festival. And no, it was not just a marketing ploy. <br /> <br /> Summary of the plot: A young boy with a troubled family life becomes "chosen" and falls in the middle of a war of the Great Spirit, where meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions throughout his career. <br /> <br /> It's not really for kids, but not for kids. Certainly, see them being afraid, without doing anything, with some of these spirits (even the most friendly) exposed. It does not look like anything I've seen in the cinema before. A fantasy naturally, very funny material (but dark). You will not be bored, you can guarantee it. Will it ever affect North America? Doubtful. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
