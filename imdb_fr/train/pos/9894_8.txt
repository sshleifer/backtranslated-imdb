"Slaughter High" is a totally ridiculous film starring a young high school student, Marty, who is being jostled at all times by jokers. The joke turns out badly and ends up being burned savagely. Five years later, his executioners all attend a meeting - the ten of them of course, and down and here Marty assassinates them one after the other.The British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") directs the distribution as a heroine (who dies anyway!). The game is completely awful, there are not many grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore freaks: a guy explodes, another victim literally receives a bath of acid, a couple having sex in bed is electrocuted, a guy gets run over by a tractor, a girl drowned, and a doctor got a hyperdermic needle in the eyes. The killer wears a decent and rather terrifying jester mask and the frame (a beautiful old castle English) is really nice.However, the dream finale is quite pathetic.All in all, it's true "Slaughter High" is a trash, but I enjoyed it only. For fans of really bad movies slasher.
