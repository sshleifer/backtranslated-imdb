I do not think most people give this film as much credit as it deserves. I like low budget horror movies and that takes the cake, especially for the originality. Yes, the Scarecrow is a Kung Fu fighter, but why not? No one else is ready to go that far. I really have not had so much fun watching a film since Candyman. So, the city chooses a child who calls him a scarecrow, even his mother does not care about him. Then he gets killed and the spirit is infused into the scarecrow, who then leaves for a slaughter. Its disappearance is relatively easy to assume once the film begins. The dedications in the end go directly to a group of horror directors, but with most of the dedication to Dario Argento, I find really cool those people who want to make movies of a more recent genre. Arnold has a lot of scams in the movie, with a lining that makes you laugh like a stick and kills the sheriff with a stick. I would say, grab a pizza with friends and laugh at your dollar with this movie. I like it for its originality, the most fun.
