In a word ... incredible. At first, I was not too eager to watch Pinjar, because I thought it was another movie that lamented the score and showed bias towards India and Pakistan. I was so totally wrong. Pinjar is a heart-rending, emotional and intelligent film with no visible flaws. I was haunted after watching it. It has long dragged in my mind; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion, everything was so real. <br /> <br /> This is truly a masterpiece that is rare to see in Bollywood nowadays. He has no prejudices or prejudices and has given the score a human story. Here, no country is described as good or bad. There are evil Indians, wicked Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, significant (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunting. Everything in the movie was amazing ... and the acting game took my breath away. All the actors were perfectly chosen. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch an intellectual and truly wonderful movie, look no further. This film gives everything. I recommend it with all my heart. AMAZING can not describe how excellent it is.
