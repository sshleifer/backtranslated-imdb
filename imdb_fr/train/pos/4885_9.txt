Spoilers possible: cameos appearing late <br /> <br /> We rarely see so many actors of remarkable and memorable characters (almost entirely actresses to be precise) in the same film. Although some only appear for cameos, each of them is a jewel. The British make this mix of comedy and real pathos better than anyone else at the IMO. It is therefore not surprising that most of the actors are British. <br /> <br /> The music is excellent; No doubt many had to be nicknamed (does Leslie Caron * really play the bass so well? Maybe - who knows?) But Clio Lane was undeniably herself: her warm and visceral sound always makes me crank like many other jazz singers. <br /> <br /> As an older musician, not quite so old and certainly not in this class of course, it was also a heart-warming film - a great movie for anyone wondering if they are in their profession or vocation whatever it may be. And of course, a great celebration of the life of the stage. <br /> <br /> I miss a bit of opening, but a 9/10 provisional - and this certainly gives you want to see everything.
