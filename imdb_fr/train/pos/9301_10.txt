Originally, I saw this very dark comedy around 2000 on cable TV. What a surprise and delight! Everyone is secretly armed in this movie! Dreyfuss plays the "mental" gift (remember the New York gift that was supposed to be schizophrenic, art imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are at their best and should not be played with! So proving that beauty and toughness go together! Then there is the big scene of "bullshit" between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where they verbally play the "bullshit" of the world. This film is both subtle and bald. For all shootings, this can be a very silent movie. And you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or near final role. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It's not a movie for everyone. But if you like a movie that has a lot of puns and keeps on going without spoiling everything, this is the movie for you. Roger Ebert deposits on this film. He is completely wrong. It's a beautiful movie! Maybe not just one for Ebert. I consider him a 10 because of the quality of his work and the fun of the screenplay, without really being a comedy movie. I like it so much that I bought it on DVD because it is just not very visible on the cable TV. Now everything is mine!
