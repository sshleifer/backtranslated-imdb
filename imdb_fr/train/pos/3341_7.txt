I saw this movie on Thursday night after a really boring day. I had no expectations, the ones I had were rather negative. Being the only movie in which I have ever watched Jimmy, this is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah (?) ... do not ask why! But seriously, this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always nice, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can not I meet a cute nerd like that? :) Movies like that are excellent. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday a Thursday. I'm not even a sports fan, but it's something that fascinates me in American movies with baseball. Probably the fact that we do not have this sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment.) Haha
