I remember enjoying it more than Nausicaa from the Valley of the Winds at an age when this tale was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected his release to the United States to avoid confusion to his broad Hispanic audience, has the caricature of the first production of director Conan. In fact, Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan - who jumped from a thousand stories carrying her daughter in her arms and landed on her feet, then started running. This makes him the most animated character and the most pleasant to watch. Technology fans in Nausica may be disappointed by flying insects and Laputa's retro technology. The only exception may be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, Laputa's theme is not directly related to environmentalism. If he has a theme at all, it's anti-war. The importance of living naturally - this is related to the flying castle, is discussed questionably, and is not really followed. Overall, I now consider the piece to be a cross between well-being and the old-fashioned.
