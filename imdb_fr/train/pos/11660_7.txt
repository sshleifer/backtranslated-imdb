A beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic Celticism. Describe the story around the famous Kels Book, allegedly composed by monks from the small island of Iona, off the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of a young apprentice abbot who goes to the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, the ferocious headless horseman of pagan mythology. Hoping to find a lost artifact. <br /> <br /> The real beauty of the film lies in its animation. Shaded cell in a brilliant and inspiring style of deep complexity, which gives an appearance of less simplicity. Drawing inspiration from the artistic style of Cartoon Network's brilliant Samurai Jack series for its brilliant use of brand making and depth of background, The Secret of Kels creates an ever-emotional Celtic world living under the shadow of the Viking invasion. <br /> The story is perhaps extremely inaccurate and the lifestyles devoid of realism, but these facts are completely irrelevant since the film is situated in a world of fantasy and revivist mysticism and Celtic. The forest girl is a great addition and, in my opinion, gives the exact picture of what it is sliding from branch to branch. Appear and disappear like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary Cheshire cat of Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kels is an absolute treat. For all genres and all ages, it's a beautiful family movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect to be amazed, but rather pleasantly impressed!
