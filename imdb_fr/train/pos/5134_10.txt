This short film was nominated for an Academy Award and I wish it were won! Basically, a jam session filmed between very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is amazing! Hollywood has quite often adopted jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but it is a rare aspect on a film during an improvised jam. This has been added to the film's preservation list and rightly so. TCM uses this function periodically and fills it every March to pay tribute to the 31 days of his Oscar. Downtown to the ring, swish, just the net and the shot is so smooth, the net barely moved. Very firmly and highly recommended !!!
