Wow! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (she speaks Russian), I'm going now. In her short skirt, high boots and pronounced bust line, she's a real baby, even though her zombie-like eyeshadow comes and goes. These 30 minutes are probably the sexiest in the series. Note the realistic and revealing wrestling match with Bronson until he strikes her without lying on the chin, ruining all the fun. Ok, I should probably drop my hormonal response. <br /> <br /> It's a half-hour very well produced by this underrated force behind the series' success, Buck Houghton. Naturally, producers want to start the third season with an above-average input. It is America after the nuclear holocaust (we know it because it is part of the invasion force) and there remains only the American Bronson and the Soviet Montgomery, as well as twenty tons of realistic wrecks. They wander in alternating moods of destruction, while we wonder how long it will take biology to override politics, which is of course ultimately the case (Lucky Bronson). And that's about it. No real speech except what Bronson has to say, which is pretty exaggerated. Nevertheless, the scenario remains entertaining and rather daring, even suggesting that not all Russian women looked like truckers (a popular stereotype of the Cold War era). <br /> <br /> rather curious that Bronson (Buchinsky), looking very Slavic, is portrayed as American and Montgomery as a slave like a Slav. As for the appearance, it should be the opposite. I suppose the producers did not want to give the American the physically weaker role of the woman, regardless of appearances. Anyway, there is little fear or usual TZ atmosphere, but the episode remains very closely watched for 30 minutes.
