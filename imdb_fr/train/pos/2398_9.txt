I really enjoyed this movie. It took a pretty dark story - Shakespeare's Macbeth story - and wrapped it in a quirky modern thread, often funny and poignant. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of New York and modern Macbeth Scotland together under one roof. The opposing worlds act to bring to light the plot and the comedy of the play and we must like Harold Perrineau as the choir, a part that does not exist in the room but really helps to make jazz. up. The end is distinguished among the little Indians I saw for its closure and originality.
