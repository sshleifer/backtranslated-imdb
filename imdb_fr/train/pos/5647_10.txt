I do not want to annoy everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but it's one of the best series of all time! It was a shame that it was canceled and I hope that someone will have the sense to take it back and start the series again. The good news is that it is released on DVD! I rushed to the store to pick up a copy and I'm happy to say it's as good as I remembered. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and scary character, and all the actors were very good. It's a shame that the network did not pursue it. Shaun Cassidy is a masterpiece. Anyone who likes gender and who has not seen it must do it. You will not be disappointed. My daughter, who was too young to watch her when she was on television (she is 20 years old), is starting to be very interested and will soon be a fan. She finds him "very crooked" and enjoyed the episodes she saw. I can not wait to see the episodes that have not been aired. <br /> <br /> This show is awesome !!!!
