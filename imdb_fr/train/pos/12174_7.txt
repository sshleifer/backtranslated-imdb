I think the problem with this film is that it has about 2 minutes of really, really funny moments and that it makes a very good trailer and that a lot of people have come with the expectations of the trailer and this times the film does not live up to the trailer. It's a bit slower and slower for a so exciting premise, and I think I see in the comments that people have a relationship of love / hate with this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it might have been to see the casting talent, I think it's still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she is so stunned and carefree that, among all the conformists, she shines and all the public falls in love with her with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's colleagues filled with testosterone, his elegant mother-in-law, his fraternal friend Jim and his future wife all do a great job of adapting to the stereotypes of conformity and boredom that force Stiles stand out in the first place. <br /> <br /> Lee does not respect his criteria, I do not think so, but you might consider this an additional difficulty. This may be a source of disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film itself, despite a bit of slowness and some jokes that do not seem as funny as the title of the writer, remains quite funny and I found smart movie. The themes of compliance and "taking the safe route" seemed to align intelligently on several levels. For example, there was the whole question of how he would imagine scenarios, but he would never act until the last scene, or how he listened to a radio show on the highway and talked about how everyone was complying or how everything was going. The characters of Julia Stiles said and echoed the following themes: one person was the safe choice, and the other was the risky choice. <br /> <br /> The other advantage of the movie was that it was more of a ball comedy. in which Jason Lee must continue to lie in the film and who, by sheer nonsense (example: the type of pharmacy that turns out to be a good leader) and some skill on his side fare for the most part. <br /> <br /> Although it was not as funny as expected and there was a bit of talent squandered, but overall, it's still a good movie.
