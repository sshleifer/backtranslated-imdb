I can not believe my eyes when I read a lot of comments and criticisms. Like it's a mediocre movie of ordinary guys. <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome, funny, crazy, violent, but with a minimum of gore and all the way. energetic at the base. Loved every bit of it. I can not remember anything crazy like this one makes you laugh and show the martial arts. And now, the most important thing (at least for me): these are free computer effects. When I watch Hollywood actors staring at an action "fuflo" (a Russian word meaning "bull * beep *") high resolution modern and damn budgeted, I understand that any child * beep * can do it. - You can adjust the wires to the body, add cute PC effects and insert them into the action movie. Here it's different. I do not think there will be even a dozen action stars physically advanced in the world, able to repeat the fight that takes place at the end of the film or the piece of "Chinese football". And it's just a little Hong Kong cinema made for fun, without pretending to be "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with an English soundtrack is not a problem for this film. It does not spoil the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I can not help but mention a very neat theatrical play. Some of you, I guess, will not like it. As for me, it's amazing. Take a look at the Dragon's friend who bravely talks to the criminals and suddenly gets a punch in the left side of his head. His facial expression turns into something whimsical and he approaches Dragon with a baby expression. And take a look at the threatening size of his mouth - it's almost from one ear to the other when he grimaces. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people from all over the world. . Very grateful to our Russian industry for the releases of Jackie Chan's classic films. His modern films are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype. <br /> <br /> Total 10 out of 10 - a legendary film of its kind. Thank you for your attention.
