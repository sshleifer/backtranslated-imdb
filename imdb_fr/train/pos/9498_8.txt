"To paint is to see, so remember better than what you saw." This is what painter Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman) says in The Failed Light. The film takes on the old-fashioned Hollywood style, starring Ronald Colman and a supporting cast consisting of Ida Lupino in her lead role, actor Dudley Digges. (who also co-starred with Colman in Condemned.), and a strong performance of the wonderful actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The title and opening sequences of the film reveal just about the fact that Dick will lose his sight. He is blinded by a powder dump while he and his childhood friend Maisie (Muriel Angelus) play with a pistol. Later, an injury sustained during fighting in Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he is already blinded by his ambition and does not reach his maximum potential before his sight leaves him. Enter the bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and her self-destruction is started. Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays very well with Colman. Her evil pie reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Well done and well directed, this is one of my favorite melodies of Colman.
