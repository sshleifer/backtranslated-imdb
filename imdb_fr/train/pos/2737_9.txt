The film was captivating from start to finish and his black-and-white photograph of the American heart is stunning. We feel that we are at their side as they cross the great land of the sky, then go to Mexico and return to America. Towards the end of the film, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears running down his face. In the end, we follow them up the stairs until the last moment. <br /> <br /> The two criminals, played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as well as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock are visible in all the streets of the city. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with stars in his eyes on the wrong side of the city. This point is emphasized in the film and it always surprises us that criminals are not different in appearance from others. Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition. These two crazy men kill a whole family in search of a safe that is not there. Once on the run, they start making bad checks and drawing a trail for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many support actors. I like John Forsyth as a detective in the case, Alvin Dewey. In addition, Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as a prosecutor. <br /> <br /> I have often wanted to see this film all along its course, only to have caught it by small strokes; I finally got it after buying the DVD. The result is the best classic detective film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this brilliant film. For me, that's what movie making is all about.
