They shot this film on Long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently, there is a party scene where they all drink beer (they told me it was colored water, it had a disgusting taste and it was very difficult to swallow, again and again, especially in funnel scenes). Yet, none of us has ever heard of the release of the film, in any form. He never went to theaters (obviously) and, as far as I know, he was never shown on video, and I'm sure he was not released on DVD. Yet, it seems that some people have seen it, even if it is probably very infrequent. So, there must be something. I would definitely buy this for my brother, but I can not find it anywhere. Does anyone know when, where and how to buy this movie? And what format would it be?
