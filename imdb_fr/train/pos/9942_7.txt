A good Korean film about taekwondo, but also about what it takes to be good, like a thug can beat a guy in his sport because there are rules, just as there is life and there school and this movie has nuances notion. <br /> <br /> The martial arts in the movie are not very good, but they are passable and enjoyable. Friends who realize something they once mocked become stronger through the mind and heart. This film is not meant to be taken too seriously because it has a sheet of wallpaper, but it also carries a message. <br /> <br /> Another good movie from Korea.
