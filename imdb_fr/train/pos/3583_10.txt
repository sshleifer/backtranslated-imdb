It was a good movie but it had the worst end that I know! The actors were great and showed exceptional talent. The whole story was twisted and unpredictable, which made it entertaining. As good as the movie was, the entire movie is judged by the end, which was terrible! Maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending.
