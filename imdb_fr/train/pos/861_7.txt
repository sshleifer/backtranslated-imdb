What can you say when you see a good French film that tries to draw a captivating story in tune with the social context of the characters? The key point is that we believe in these characters and that once they meet, we want them to stay together. It's simple and really effective. The background story is less important. Why is the scenario on the side of a half-developed thriller? This helps not to get stuck in these social events that most French moviegoers like to do. Not too ambitious, right: On my lips is only a French film entertaining, with a good characterization. <br /> <br /> For all the intelligent black spots of the scenario, the end is far too easy. This happens as easily as in Rear Window (an obvious reference and certainly not a film noir) but in a less convincing context. Where I am surprised is to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. He brings very little to the story. when he appears alone, we wonder if we have not forgotten a part before. Jacques Audiard is not yet a newcomer. Strange and strange.
