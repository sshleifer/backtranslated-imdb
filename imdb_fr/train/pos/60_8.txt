"Home Room" like "Zero Day" and "Elephant" were inspired by the recent wave of shootings in schools. But unlike the other two films, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (neither shooters nor those who were killed) following a shoot. Making it less exploitative and more useful because little effort is lost to ask questions for which there are no answers. <br /> <br /> Do not give up on this little movie for the first 20 minutes, it's supposed to put the real story but plays like a rejected episode "Hill Street Blues". It is lame but supports, at least, it covers the race length enough for the film to be classified as a feature. I recommend going completely to that and moving on to the hospital scenes. There is nothing here that can not be taken from the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Like many good little movies, it was creative. a one-man-show like Paul F. Ryan was both the writer and the director. Although this arrangement does not guarantee a good movie, it is usually a good sign as it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that often lacks dramatic features with big budget. Because the "Home Room" scenario is his real strength, he is happy that the author has also realized the production and ensured that his vision is visible on the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan has a huge chance with the end testing the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance. He directs it to the edge, but against all logic lets you cry instead of crying. Why does the end work if the audience needs a reward at the end of this kind of trip, the song they're singing (Sarah McLaughlin's "Sweet Surrender") and the great last-minute editing? . <Br /> <br /> The other strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as main protagonists. Although Phillips is an alienated teenager and Christensen is the smart daughter of a good family, they bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and is of little interest to Ryan. What is happening here concerns both, despite the lame story that a police inspector would question the city trying to link Alicia to the lone gunman. If they ever cut and cut the film, we would have to condense the secondary story. <br /> <br /> The story of two extremely disparate girls helping each other and helping each other is not a new idea and Ryan could easily have directed this film. clich√© and predictability. But instead, his scenario engages them in a fascinating and compelling combat match, slowly emancipating themselves and sharing moments of vulnerability, and then fall back on themselves. Deanna's "I'm dying inside" line is tearing you apart - I can not think at any point in another film that I felt as intensely as this one. She desperately needs a connection that Alicia resists just as desperately. Deanna only progresses when she retires. The viewer never ceases to expect a group hug that never seems to occur. <br /> <br /> In the end, not only does this generate a lot of suspense, but lets you admire the two characters and the two actresses who animated them. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
