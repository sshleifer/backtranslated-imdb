It was in 1988, when I saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (on Austrian television). At that time, I was already a very big fan of Spitting Image (since then he won the Montreux Festival bronze rose in 1986). Of course, I recorded every tape show and watched it again and again, especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember that scene when Ronnie stood in front of a Abraham Lincoln painting (thinking it was a mirror) and said, "I need a shave". Or the most fun of all, when he played ball with his dog - but vice versa! <br /> <br /> It's such a shame that Spitting Image seems to be falling into oblivion; it was one of the most fantastic and intelligent TV shows ever made. Compared to other satirical shows, it was definitely the best of all. <br /> <br /> Well, almost 20 years have passed since then and I wish I could see the show again. Is it possible to buy it from someone ... somewhere?
