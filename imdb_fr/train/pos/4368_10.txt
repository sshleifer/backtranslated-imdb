It's a very exciting and romantic film. I have seen it many times and I do not get tired of it. Everything is realistic and it's a good plot. The actors are excellent: Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> In fact, I prefer this film to Braveheart because Braveheart contains a lot of historical errors. There are many exciting scenes - watch the Bridge Scen and the last fencing scene. It's really good and surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> The music is lovely ... it really suits the movie. The setting is amazing.
