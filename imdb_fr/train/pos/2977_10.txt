There are so many words that I want to use to describe this film, but I can not really do it, right? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and pee. I'm serious. Do not watch this film if you are easily offended by blasphemy, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and all that is associated with nature. As a woman, and this may not even be a factor, I can watch this movie again and again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely great. With all his other debut, I think Baseketball is the winner of the award. I laugh now thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie !! That's all I'm going to say. It's a bit difficult for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a cursed word in almost every line that escapes them when they speak. So, I keep it professional. Best film. Heck yeah !!
