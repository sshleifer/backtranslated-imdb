Which soundtrack of the 80's has been neglected. I imagine John Travolta sang some of the songs, but looking at the movie, it seemed to be all 80's cheese stuff. Obviously, movies using bulls, bartenders, and immature relationships were in fashion. The best was his ugly Texas accent. Compare that to Friday Night Lights. I suggest watching Cocktail and Stir Crazy to really begin to dive into the nonsense of the movie. In addition, Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is a terribly bad movie. I was so shocked to realize that I had never watched her. A stranger film of this genre should include Cadilac Man with Robin Williams. Remember that all these big stars have played an important role in these Cheese films. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
