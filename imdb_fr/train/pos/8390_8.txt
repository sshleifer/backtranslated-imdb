My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Cinema and alternative cinema (small room, with uncomfortable seats, the audience had to wait while the films were changed) were perfectly matched. <br /> <br /> Many shots were used in the film, but Fassbinder found them really amusing. The sound was also brilliant (sometimes stronger than the dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to be in the right place. And I liked how post-war was presented. Really funny! <br /> <br />
