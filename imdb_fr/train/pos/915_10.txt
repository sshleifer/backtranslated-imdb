All the talent that Mr. Sooraj Barjatya showed in his first 3 films, I thought all of this was an accident because his fourth principal, Prem ki diwani hoon, was so bad. But I must say that it was not an accident. This guy is talented and the way he did it is just great. From the first scene, it concerns you. the sequences between shahid and amrita are impressive. The chemistry between these two actors gives a glimpse of the one between srk and kajol. As usual, Alok Nath as a good and loving father is fantastic, Anupam Kher also. But it's a Shahid-Amrita movie. Amrita looks good in most scenes, although Shahid looks a little young to get married, but he does a good job with a shy but morally strong groom. this film will be particularly appreciated by those who have lived so beautiful moments of their life. All in all, it's a brilliant film. hat to Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
