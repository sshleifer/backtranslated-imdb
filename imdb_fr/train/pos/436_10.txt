I loved this film. I'm not even sure what it is, but I think it's wonderful and should be available on DVD. The women were strangers, and they understood each other well enough to spend the time they spent at the Villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, have done a great job. The characters were all so different and yet an intelligent story that made it work. There is humor, drama and relationship problems in time. It requires 10 lines, but I just can not think of anything to say, so I'll keep talking until I get 10 lines. So, sorry for that. What more can i say? I have not seen it for a long time. I can not wait to see it again but it is not available.
