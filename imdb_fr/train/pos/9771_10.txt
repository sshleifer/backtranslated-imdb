Convincing and innovative! At the beginning of this criminally underrated film by Whoopi Goldberg, the authors draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and Orson Welles's classic "Citizen Kane" of 1941. Writers are right in drawing a seemingly disparate parallel, but viewers are too often persuaded to see a Hollywood film too enthusiastic to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two films. In "Citizen Kane", Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and subordinates, much like Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This film talks about finding love in everyone's differences. It is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. Whoever paired Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex formulated a dyad for the ages, the only justifiable comparisons being Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates. If you wish to witness an edifying philosophical examination, in celluloid, of some of the deepest impulses of humanity; Bergman-esqe but not so depressing, Theodore Rex should be seen immediately!
