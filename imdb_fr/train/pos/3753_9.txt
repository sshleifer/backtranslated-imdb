This short film that inspired the upcoming feature film - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that opposes similar caricatures giving rise to multiple authors. The short film features Edward Spatula who, after being fired from his job, joins the fight against the evil spoons. This premise allows for fun content from the start, but is barely present for the rest of the feature. The 15 minutes of this film are absorbed by a funny comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately, there is not much else below. The plot in place does not really have time to show. But it's obvious that his plot is better than many high-budget Hollywood movies. This film deserves to be watched at least a few times. Take for what it is, and do not expect a deep story.
