Although I have long been a fan of Peter Weir, I did not watch any of his Australian films before watching The Last Wave. And it was a pleasant and unpredictable surprise. <br /> <br /> Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer invited to defend five aboriginal people accused of murdering another aboriginal. For David's peers, this is clearly a case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence. But David believes that there is a mystery under murder, linked to tribal rituals. In the course of his investigation, he discovers not only things about his clients, but also about himself. <br /> <br /> To reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. I can only say that this film goes in directions that nobody will expect. <br /> <br /> Many elements make this film a fascinating film: the role of Chamberlain, for example; but also the depictions of David Gulpilil, who plays a young aborigine who introduces David into the tribal mysteries; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an old Aboriginal who is a spiritual guide. The relationships between these three characters make the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> But there is also the way Weir suggests the supernatural in the film. David has dreams that warn him of the future. Australia is experiencing extreme weather conditions, with storms, falling hail and even a mysterious black rain that may be just pollution. But it is also related to the case that David defends. The relationship between these events is one of the great revelations of the film. Weir manages to create an atmosphere of terror and oppression, suggesting future horrors without revealing anything concrete. <br /> <br /> The Charles Wain score is fantastic, especially the use of the didgeridoo. The photography is also very good. Russell Boyd, Weir's long-time DP, who won an Oscar in 2004 for Master and Commander, describes a dark and terrifying world full of mystery. <br /> <br /> I also find it noteworthy that do not become an indictment against white culture or a sapped celebration of their traditions, like Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai. This movie is too smart to be so simplistic. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating and disturbing viewers who expect to end a movie with all that makes sense; but for those who do not fear any strangeness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a good movie to watch.
