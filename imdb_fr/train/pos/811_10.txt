When I think of the Return of the Jedi, I think epic. Yeah, the Ewoks were there so what? This is an interesting addition to the film (not to mention that they look like the Vietcongs who also managed to shoot down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (played by the incredible actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is so perverse that Vader looks like Mr. Rogers in relation to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, what an amazing end to such an iconic character. Vader is really a Greek tragedy of modern times and I think people can now understand and appreciate it especially after the release of Revenge of the Sith. His redemption at the end was moving and really brings you a happy but sweet-bitter feeling. The best part of course was the special effects. It's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with its graphics. The scenes of Jabba's palace (Leia is gorgeous in this metal bikini) and of course the epic battle to three in the end are still beautiful to watch. In all the deep moments of Jedi's intrigue and emotion (mainly between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia), incredible special effects put an end to one of the most popular franchises in the world. history of cinema
