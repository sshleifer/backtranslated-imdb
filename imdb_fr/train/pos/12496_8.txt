It's been years that we watch all the horror movies coming out, Hollywood movies like Saw 2 to the terrible independent films absolutely incomparable ... we suffer through all the bad movies in the hope of finding small jewels like " Dark Rest ". <br /> <br /> We managed to attend the screening of this film at Shriekfest 2005. The audience loved and won the Best Film Award. <br /> <br /> Even though he may not have the budget or star power of studio films, he has a lot of weight in the scary atmosphere and category of fears. The acting and cinematography are excellent, but it is the direction that makes this film worthy of the name. The story and the characters are developing at the right pace to create fantastic alarms. <br /> <br /> Publishing and visual effects are also top notch. And although many horror movies fail to use music to their advantage, the score of "Dark Remains" only adds to its goose bumps. <br /> <br /> I know the film has been featured in many festivals, but none have been near me, so I can not wait to see when the DVD will finally be released. Believe me, even if you are tired of the current state of horror movies, try this one ... you will not regret it!
