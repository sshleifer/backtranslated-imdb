A fascinating but disturbing look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie), aunt and first cousin of the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a dilapidated, rodent-infested mansion considered unsafe for the city. It quickly becomes very clear that these two are very eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the poorest, because she acts in the spirit of the mentality of a ten year old girl, even if she is currently 53 years old. The content is composed of about two things. The first is about conversations between Little Edie Lambs and Big Edie for chasing all her potential contenders and ruining her future career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, absurd and often fun. The second part consists of long singing attempts by both parties. Of course, everyone thinks that his singing is perfect and only the other one sounds bad. In an incredible scene, Big Edie physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to force her to stop doing it. Very captivating, however, we feel that this is a serious exploitation that takes place here and that the subjects are too far to know. Filmmakers seem to treat this as a circus circus show, coming every day to record (and laugh) whatever strange behavior may occur. In the end, this image is sad because it shows how the world has simply passed these last two. Their hopes and dreams are as dilapidated as the house in which they live. Despite their arguments, these two more than ever need each other. For without the other, there would be no refuge against loneliness. The most amazing line comes from Big Edie which many cats relieve throughout his room. His response to a complaint about the smell is simply incredible.
