I loved this film. It is rare to have a glimpse of postpartum Vietnam, and this film without fighting scenes, with exciting bombs and shots, did it. I did not know it would affect me so much. What an amazing look at how veterans feel. Frankly, it was hard to watch. We all understand the fight and the type of Apocalypse Now drama, but it's so different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They can not. This made me aware of a large group of men arguing lost in America. Not able to identify, can not sleep, can not have romantic relationships, can not handle the "normal society". They feel totally separated. It is a huge tragedy, and it is not sufficiently taken into account. Yes, we have changed our attitude towards veterans of Vietnam, we love them now, but what? It does not seem to have made any difference to them. It's too late? So it was a good movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticisms.
