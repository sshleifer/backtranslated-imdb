The key to joy and beauty, pain and sadness of life lies in our ability to accept that life is what it really is, so that we do not constantly struggle against this compelling truth. In doing so, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity but so hard to grasp for most of us. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way. It's a beautiful but simple story, plus a fable, which plays very well. Watching actors is more like being in a room with real people than watching actors. <br /> <br /> I struggled to write a review of this film so that others would be motivated to see it. I am at a loss. The story is about men in a bath house. It looks like a real turn off, right? But nothing could be further from the truth. The American title of this film is The Shower, but it is almost an antithesis of one of the main themes of this film, the bath. I am always lost. Talking about the story or the characters will not do them justice. <br /> <br /> I will tell you how much I enjoyed watching this film and how touching and touching it was. I was also very entertained. I really care about the characters and what happened to them. For any story, it's the highest praise. <br /> <br /> If you are moved by movies like The King Of Masks or Not One Less, be sure to check out The Shower. Netflix has it and the video and audio quality of the DVD is excellent. I watched it in the original lanquage with well-made and well-placed English submarines. <br /> <br />
