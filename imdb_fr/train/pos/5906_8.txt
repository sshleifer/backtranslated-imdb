Doghi is a wonderful film and Renuka Daftardar is excellent. The same goes for Uttara Baokar, who is generally excellent in most of her roles. With Kairee, it's an example of Marathi cinema at its best. There are some parts in the two films that tend to be didactic - it would probably have improved the movie not to have the few scenes in which the social message is hammered. These scenes probably emerge from the filmmaker's political concerns but the film is realistic and move enough to not need it. But aside from such small concerns, it is a film that deserves to be seen more and more and that I strongly recommend. The anxiety of Sumitra Bhave and her humanism are apparent.
