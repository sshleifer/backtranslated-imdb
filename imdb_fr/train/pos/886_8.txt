It was one of the DVDs I recently bought in a series of six films called "Frenchfilm" to refresh our French before the holidays planned in the beautiful Provence of this year. So far, in addition to improving our French, we have significantly improved our understanding of French cinema. <br /> <br /> What a breath of fresh air for the old, predictable, unimaginative, dynamic crash-bang wallop produced by Hollywood. What a good example to follow for scenario writers, actors, directors and directors of photography. It was so exciting to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them being forced to make glossy magazine covers. <br /> <br /> The other thing I liked in this movie is the slowness of his character and his plot that left you guessing how it would all end. Is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly na√Øve benefactor with the kind of disdain that an ex-inmate would post? Our poor little half-deaf, deaf and sexually frustrated heroine, will she prove that she has the solution to her dreams and the situation that fate has inflicted on her? The viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors slowly and convincingly address the events that challenge them and shape their feelings towards each other. <br /> <br /> Once you've seen this movie, you may want to see me again. I still have to understand the director's psychological motive for the subplot in the role of parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a look. The plot takes a bit of imagination when our hero gets the chance to help our misused and overworked heroin in the office. You must also be open-minded to believe in his brilliant reading on the lips and in setting up some of the action. But if you like thrills with this example of the best of French cinema, you will come out more than satisfied. Four out of five stars for me.
