I only saw it last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival at Laemlee's on Beverly. This film received the most applause from all the films of this evening. Since two video clips opened first, I did not know what to expect as they were very fast and grabbing attention, I was not sure I would be ready for a short film immediately. But to my surprise, I really enjoyed that. I thought the main actor demon was really good. His performance impressed me so much that I checked his name. I was surprised to see it was the guy from Witchblade. It has become really good especially since! Either that, or we had given him ugly roles or the director pushed him very hard for this short film. The girl did a good job. I guess it's difficult because it was his first performance and being so young. The father did well too. There was a lot of nice work for a short film, both for this one and for the next movie "Mexican Hat", which was also nice, but I liked it most because it had the most depth and emotion and that I really cared about the characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was pretty illustrative and dark! It dealt with real subjects using a more imaginary approach to keep ADD people like me interested. We will not even talk about the last movie of the block that I left. My only complaint is that I only wish I had seen more demon character and a little less start, which is why I gave it a 9 out of 10. I also thought that the end credits went a bit slow. Otherwise, it has been beautifully narrated, directed and edited. The timing was very nice with a complete change compared to the MTV Quick Edition made on everything today. There will be more people coming from this director in the future as well as the actor. I will now think of him as an actor Sorrows Lost and not in Witchblade.
