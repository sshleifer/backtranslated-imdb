I like this film, but the music of all the alumni gatherings is just stupid. <br /> <br /> The fateful game took place in 1972. This means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all the music played at dances, etc., dates from the 50s and early 50s. 60s. <br /> <br /> Just coming to attend my 30th high school meeting, I can assure you that the last music will be played at a meeting or dance of the old high school people are the music of their parents. <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding relevant music from the 1970s. We all know how much music has been saddened. But it was not completely lost, and the producers of the film should have taken more precautions. I found these dance scenes very much opposed to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> This was a bad decision of the director and / or the producer.
