I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film were first-rate, including the most important, for me anyway, the script and the acting game. This is certainly one of the strongest roles of Richard Widmark. He is totally convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could have tackled this role. This is the first time I remember Jean-Pierre's work. She's so impressed here that I'll definitely be looking for her other job. Thelma Ritter, in an unglamorous role, deserved the Oscar nomination she received for playing the informant. This film works on all levels. Black and white photography is perfect and history captivates the viewer from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult novel. Highly recommended, 9/10.
