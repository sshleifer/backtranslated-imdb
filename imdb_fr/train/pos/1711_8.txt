The second film by Abhay Deol, written by Imtiaz Ali, first film directed by Shivam Nair. Soha probably has her first (?) Fleshy role as Megha, a girl who ran away from her home and is waiting at the marriage registry office in Delhi for her boyfriend Dheeraj (Shayan Munshi) to meet her. She waits and waits and is finally seen as a damsel in distress by Ankush (Abhay Deol). They spend many days together to get her out of the most painful situation that has settled down and finally fall in love with her. Then the boyfriend comes back! Aage pardey by dekhiye! Sounds familiar? This is another adaptation of Dostoevsky's sleepless nights with a tiny loan from The Notti Bianchi (very tiny though - Ankush separates the lovers by telling his boyfriend that she is dead!). But it is a more earthly and realistic adaptation (duh) than the much vaunted Saawariya. I wonder why no one introduced us to this gem when we all talked about Saawariya like crazy a few months ago. <br /> <br /> The parameters of Delhi are beautiful. from the roof, Connaught Circus, streets with rickshaws (what? The colorful fixtures of the hotel are enough to tell you that it's a shabby joint with rooms to rent by the hour! <br /> <br /> The more I see Abhay, the more I like this young man. In this second film, he is good enough as a witness to rent to whom a beautiful woman gives a goal in life. Soha looks beautiful and when she smiles, she fits the role, but I found her unconvincing in the most serious moments. I'm not sure she has the right to be a great actress, or maybe she'll bloom late like her brother. The music of Himesh Reshammiya is not so great and in fact, the film weakens at the level of the songs, they interrupt the narrative somehow and do not associate well with the characters who try to sing them. The support cast is excellent and I'm addressing this adaptation to White Nights. BTW - the fact that I like the cute dimples of Abhay Deol has nothing to do with my note.
