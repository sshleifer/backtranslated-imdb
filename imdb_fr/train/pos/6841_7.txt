It's probably one of Brian De Palma's best-known films, but it's not his best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better films, but this film is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very influenced by Hitchcock and this film is a takeoff of Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who thinks she has an affair and after her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, turns down an offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery and ends up sleeping with him. After that, it's better not to know what's going on, but there's a murder, and Nancy Allen is a call girl who looks at the murderer. Dennis Franz is the detective in charge of the case who really does not trust Allen and she has to find the killer herself. It's a very good movie, but it's not one of the best in De Palma.
