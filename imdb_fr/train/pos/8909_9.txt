It's a fairly well known project, so I'm not going to go too far. The basic story is about two teenagers discovering a thin layer of extra-terrestrial gooey paste that arrives on Earth through a meteor. Human contact with this viscous ball burns the flesh like an acid. It also absorbs human bodies, which makes it grow. Nobody believes teens (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do, it seems that the blob can not be stopped. It's really well done for his age and unlike many other movies of the 50's, the pace is pretty fast. The story is unique and a must-have for any fan of old sci-fi movies and monsters. If you can dig the gooey gore of the 80s horror, do not miss the 1988 remake either.
