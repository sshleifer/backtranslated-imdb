If you like romantic comedies, you'll find the story of two 30-year-old singles falling in love with the AHL's pennant party. On the other hand, if you're waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you should probably stay away. The plot contains the obligatory type to meet the girl's friends, the girl meets the guy's friends and the guy meets the girl's parents scenes. There is even a guy who meets the scene of the dog It's quite normal in a movie like this. However, what I liked was that the plot has been integrated into the decision-making process of people who are starting to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and that it is actually a little weird. The plot is centered on answering questions; how much weirdness is too much and how much love is needed to overcome these quirks? It's interesting to see that the characters work like that because basically (if we admit it), we all have quirks. Barrymore is doing a very good job in his role and Fallon has somehow surprised me - he's good too. I give it a rating of 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add a point if you are a baseball fan or involved romantically with one. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a fan of the Yankees.
