Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors in the country, has shown that he is equally comfortable with movies. With "Panic in the Streets", Mr. Kazan gives us a first version of what would come later, with perhaps his masterpiece, "On the Waterfront", although the two films share only the scenery water because they have a different view of subjects. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan fired on New Orleans. Daniel Fuchs' adaptation of Edna's and Edward Anhalt's stories, which are at the base of the film, is remarkable in that it takes us to places no tourist has dared to visit during the visit from "The Big Easy". One of the great assets of this film is Joseph MacDonald's beautiful black and white cinematography that shows New Orleans at its best. In addition, the music of Alfred Newman and the song of Billie Holiday confer a pleasant aspect to the procedure. <br /> <br /> This film could have been shot in New York or in another big city in the north of the country because it features characters speak more like a "broklynese" than maybe a southern accent than the we could hear in this part of the country. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear from the film, Jack Palance, who debuts on the screen, smothers the screen every time. We see it. He was so intense! At the same time, this tough guy shows his tender side when he goes to see his sick partner, who, unknowingly, is suffering from a deadly disease. Blackie comforts this man who strokes his sweaty face and runs his hands through the greasy hair of the dying man with abandon. It should also be noted that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel seem to have made their own stunts, which is refreshing because both actors give it a real appearance. <br /> <br /> The film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film. We see a family man painting furniture with his young son. Later, he and his wife discuss the fact that it seems they can not make ends meet with his salary, a problem that many families face every day. Richard Widmark, playing with a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays with more cunning and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, as a wife, looks like a suburb of Connecticut. <br /> <br /> The film is enjoyable thanks to Mr. Kazan's leadership and the excellent distribution of his work.
