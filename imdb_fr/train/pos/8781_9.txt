I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such, there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing movie ever made. This is Robert Wise / Paul Newman's film, "Someone Pleases Me." This movie is perhaps the number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is the number 2 closest. <br /> <br /> The film not only tells the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at crucial moment of transition. In the late 1800s, boxing moved away from the brutal rules of the rules of the naked fist to turn to the more gentleman days of the Marquess of Queensbury's gloved rules. And the sport moved away from the time when it was an illegal show and turned to a time of acceptance and respectability. <br /> <br /> "The gentleman Jim" is not a realistic look on these days. It's romantic and yes, even a little hokey sometimes. But always deliciously. Errol Flynn is perfect as a "gentleman" Jim who is really not a "gentleman" at all, but simply a talkative of a working class. Alexis Smith is quite charming as a woman of the upper class with whom he has a romantic relationship (and we all know that it is of course the love that will win this game at the end). <br /> <br /> the end of "Gentleman Jim" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous phrase was NOT "I can lick any man in the world" of course ... romance again ) passes his belt to Corbett. It's really one of the best scenes of any sporting movement ever made. Realistic? No, but wonderful. Hey, if you want realism, look at "Raging Bull" instead. It's a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Mr. Jim" is a lot more fun.
