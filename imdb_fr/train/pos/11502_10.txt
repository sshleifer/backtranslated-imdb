Forty urban explorers / photographers and long-time fan of Kolchak's original series: Night Stalker since my early childhood, one aspect that has not really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration that Carl's character has company during the series. He always managed to go to a big abandonment, a sewer or tunnel after another. Armed only with his trusty pen (OK, so he had a few bursts in the tunnel of primitive monkey episodes) and his camera, he never took any other equipment to protect himself or facilitate exploration. <br /> <br /> Like Many here, I recently bought the DVD box of the two pilot films and subsequent television episodes, and slowly revisiting all the shows. And although I remember watching them in the early '70s, when they first aired, it's been more than 30 years since many of them seem so new. Campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and very entertaining. They do not do these things these days. Now these are all regurgitated spin-offs with predictable characters and intrigues. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16 year old daughter is sitting to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them (she likes the genre). This gives me hope and faith that the series will continue to be passed on to new generations of fans for years to come.
