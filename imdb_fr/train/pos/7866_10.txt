PAGE 3 **** on 4 stars <br /> <br /> Madhvi (Konkona Sen) enters the house of his boyfriend and is empty. She looks here and there, then goes to her room and you see the picture: "Ah! another girl ?? This villain two times and yes, in fact, his two times, but it's a GUY this time. And I say 'Brilliant!' <br /> <br /> END OF THE SPOILERS (The scene above is not really a spoiler ... but for me it was so much that I did not want to take any risk) <br /> <br /> > When asked how this movie was, my friend replied "oh, it's just a talk about the P3 people," which made me think it was wrong to watch a stupid movie, if nothing more. When I went to the theater, I said to myself: "I'd better take a pen and a paper to note the bad things of this film", but I was proved that I was totally wrong ?? and still others because I could only collect the goods. This movie was great. Great, not because the movie looks like a quirky and noncommercial scenario, but because of the intelligence of the screenplay and the way this movie explains how to brilliantly manage a film that could have been a stupid and senseless movie if he was presented in the wrong hands. <Br/> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is grace. She is so beautiful that she played her role perfectly as if she were born to play this role. One of the most charming actresses I have ever seen. But this is not the only good performance in the film, there is Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. In particular Sandhya Mridul who just triggered the screen. (And guess what even Tara Sharma, unusually accentuated, normally speaks) <br /> <br /> The film starts with some silly old nights from hush-hush celebrities from the film industry and the like, and you get an idea of ​​what this movie will be about. And for about half an hour through the movie, you feel pretty much the same thing. But then, the film accelerates and takes a good story without ever giving up. Even Boman Irani accepts this statement ?? 'It was a good story, Madhvi'. (Thank you). What is good is that it addresses the stupidity with which these people are stylish, does not, and also addresses social issues and does not make them boring. In the end, all this is a roller coaster ride and Madhvi informs us that just smiling to all these people. Just the reason I like watching movies. Ecstatic film. The scenario is beautiful, intelligent and spiritual.
