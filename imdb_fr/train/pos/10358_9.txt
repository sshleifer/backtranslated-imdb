I remember seeing this movie that was shown on the Lifetime television network many years ago and I thought it was an interesting story. Several years later, I see him again and fall head over heels in love with this film. The story of the film is fascinating in itself. The cast makes it even more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely at its peak in this picture. She nailed Mrs. Chamberlain's mannerisms, her accent and even her look. It shows the pain, pain, surprise and anger that Lindy had to endure and it's hard to remember that it's NOT Lindy. In my opinion, this performance of Meryl was better than that of Sophie in turn, and should have earned him his third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain and, for some surprising reason, the academy has not recognized his candidacy at least. In all, this film received only ONE Oscar (Streep's Best Actress.) However, he has received several Australian Oscars and nominations. <br /> <br /> Decidedly a film of first order: he says to obtain great performances of the entire cast.
