Great drama with all areas covered EXCEPT for scripting that was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like Pitt's character interviewing the president, or Pitt being murdered instead of just describing it to us. Scenes like this would have prevented the audience from sleeping. Cutting a few unnecessary minutes could have left more room for more touching scenes like this. The film trail has kept this one in all its splendor, though seeing Pitt here makes the movie so interesting to watch. the big fans of fising, early The styles of the 20th century and Montana will really like that too ........
