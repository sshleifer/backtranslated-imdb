A true story of a real revolution, April 25; a revolution against a 41-year-old repressive regime, which imposed a colonial war on its military, for the maintenance of an empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, S. Tom√© and Principe, the first and last of the Europe's great colonial empire) 600 years since its inception at the time of the conquest of Ceuta in 1415; a revolution of the army for the people and for a democratic Portugal; The most surprising part of this revolution is that there would have been no people killed (except those who died in the hands of PIDE, the state's political police), during a brutal shooting against an unarmed mob demonstrating outside his headquarters headquarters. The day of the revolution, April 25, 1974, was screened on the film). And all the revolutions have its heroes, one of them was Captain Salgueiro Maia, a soldier returning from the war, whose convictions with the rest of the army, it was that they had led (since 1961) a hopeless war and that a soldier was sometimes to disobey his country.
