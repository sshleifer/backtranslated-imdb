The story and the characters were some of the best I have ever seen. the graphics were good for PS and cinematic scenes and the reviews were amazing. I beat the game at least 3 times and I loved every second. I felt that the problems faced by the protagonist were credible and realistic and I think this deserves a continuation. or at least one remake. If they did it again for ps3, I would buy the system only for this game. Maybe mgs4 is amazing. The idea and execution of the dragon system is sufficient to justify a lease. magic wand) and the plot make this game a definite purchase.
