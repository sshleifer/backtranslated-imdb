This film was the first British teenager film to really address the reality of the violent rock and roll society, rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life. To try to celebrate the work of the Liverpool opening liaison officers, the opening title indicates that 92% of potential offenders, who were treated under this program, did not commit a second crime. However, this simply becomes a pretext for the drama in the next teenage years until the epilogue of the film where we are told not to feel responsible or sorry for such offenders, even if they may seem confused. <br /> <br /> Stanley Baker plays a difficult detective who reluctantly takes the position of juvenile liaison officer. This hard character is a typical role of Baker. Having been on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as a firefly and not relishing the distraction of the transfer. However, as in all good police dramas, he returned to his original investigation. <br /> <br /> His first case took him to the home of two young children, Mary and Patrick Murphy (played by real-world brothers and sisters), who committed a small robbery. There he meets Cathie (described in a satisfactory way by Anne Heywood), their older sister with whom he ends up getting involved lovingly. It quickly becomes clear that the sordid environment of this type of downtown is fertile ground for juvenile delinquency. <br /> <br /> The eldest brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the leader of a rogue rock and roll gang. McCallum takes a catchy ride as an Americanized mixed kid, who owes more than Marlon Brando, like no other British star. We think of Brando's character, Johnny of "The Wild One", who led a group of rebel bikers dressed in leather, in much the same way that "Johnny" of this film directs his gang. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the preaching of Dearden's previous police drama, such as "The Blue Lamp," is not so obvious. Instead we are presented with several well-drawn characters from both sides of the law as the delusional drama and the romantic interest between Heywood and Baker in the foreground. <br /> <br /> The plot, though sometimes predictable, delivers memorable scenes. The disruptive influence that rock and roll would have exerted is played in a scene where Johnny surrenders to the music, resulting in a threatening advance of the police sergeant. The most memorable film, however, is the classroom climate scene where a group of terrified schoolchildren, including Mary and Patrick, are held hostage by Johnny. Obviously, in the light of Dumblaine's massacre, this scene seems horrible. As a result, the film is rarely broadcast or available to the modern audience.
