I was bored one night and Red Eye was running and wondering why. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean I just started the movie was so brilliant. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The film also has two major tracks in the film with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> The acting game is just awesome and you'll have the mood of the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> The music is just excellent. make you feel comfortable. <br /> <br /> I love how the film was so well done and never gets boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is simply phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent thriller. <br /> <br /> Overall, I love Red Eye so much that I can watch it again and again. <br /> <If you like Red Eye, I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie
