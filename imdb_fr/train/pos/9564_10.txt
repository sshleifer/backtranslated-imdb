This must be the best movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine breathtaking cinematography with breathtaking acting and a captivating storyline, and you get a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog had prevented me from sitting on the edge of my seat during some scenes, backing up in horror for others, and leaving me drowning in my own tears after the tragic end. <br /> <br /> The film left me a deep impression. His scenes of shocking violence contrast sharply with scenes of love and tenderness. The film does not deserve Cat III (nudity); there is no nudity scene, and "love" scenes do not even involve a kiss or a "confection". <br /> <br /> The message that this film presented to me? All human beings, however violent or cruel they may seem, have a tender side. Edison Chen does a superb job playing the role of murderer Pang. <br /> <br /> I note this movie 10/10. It's a must-watch.
