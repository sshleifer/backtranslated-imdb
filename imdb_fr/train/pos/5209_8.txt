I saw this intense intense film tonight. This is the most important and best work of Richard Gere and Claire Dane. Gere deserves an Oscar for his fine portrayal of a man forced to retire early as a sex offender registry administrator. Claire Danes is captivating as Gere's chosen wife replaces him - a woman he tries to teach as much as possible while investigating a final case in which Gere's character is convinced that one of those he is In charge of monitoring could hold a girl hostage. The subject is shocking, sex offenders and those who watch them, but this movie will not be forgotten anytime soon. I know that Gere's portrait will haunt me for a long time. Since Anthony Hopkins, the portrait of a serial killer does not have a terrified screen portrait and has engaged me so much. The movie begins with a shocking statistic so do not miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable. The most beautiful role of Richard Gere proving that man can act. Danes can also and extraordinarily well in this often difficult film. <br /> <br /> This is a brave film and Gere gives a deeply felt performance on many levels. Give him the Oscar now ... he deserves it!
