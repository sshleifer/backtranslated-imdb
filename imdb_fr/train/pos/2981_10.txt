Why shit is this movie rated so low? I saw this movie more than 25 times, I know EVERY line of this movie. It is obvious that I like this film. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new Team America puppet masterpiece) play the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish". Primarily, they are simply called Coop and Remer throughout the movie. From the beginning of the film, it reminds us that the corrupt and greedy world of overpaid sports begins, they even create one called "Townsell". I have to quote this part of the film because it's true with some sports debut: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, St. Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus a season as better at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally be able to play here in the beautiful city of Miami. "His agent looks at:" Minnesota ". Let's not forget this important element of the film. So, it all starts with the fact that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize that they are still nothing as they talk to their former classmates. On the outside, they create the BASEketball sport after being challenged by what was probably high school basketball heroes. After being ashamed, the sport will become professional in about a year. Meanwhile, they manage to recruit their third teammate, Squeak, one day after the invention of the game. Over the course of the film, we discover that Coop, Remer and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes that remain. The story follows with zany blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders and a humor so absurd that you will want more. Look at it man, it's hilarious.
