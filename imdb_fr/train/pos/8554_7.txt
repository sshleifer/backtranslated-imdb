Wow, it was another good result of the original American pie, not as good as the camp band, but certainly a lot better the naked mile. Dwight and Erik Stifler direct the comedy in this one, but I actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked kilometer. The script was written much better and the comedy was more fluid, however, most of the comedy was sex, but it does not matter because that's why we watch these movies , is not it? <br /> <br /> The Rock Dwarf also had a very good appearance, considering the intense efforts he made at kilometer and a half, his scene with stifler was great and made me laugh with laughter when I I saw it. <br /> <br /> The film was in my opinion a clear improvement over the naked mile, if you like the previous movies of American Pie, you should like the beta house, unless you see all the fallout American pie money.
