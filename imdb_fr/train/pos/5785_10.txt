While browsing the comments left for this show, I could not help but notice that a large percentage of the critics had not actually watched any episode of the show, or of their own free will. The thing about Kerching! is that it's a children's show, FOR CHILDREN, so obviously if your oldest is going to look corny, forced and probably stupid. I even found a person who said that the sets were stupid, but I remember, at the age of eight, wondering why Taj had ikea icecube molds on his wall and ask me if my parents would let me stick on mine (they did not do it). Yeah, it can be boring, the acting might be better and some of the characters are doing really weird things with their hair, but as a children's show, I rate it 10/10. Compared to what they're showing in today's place, well, let's just say I wish it were aired again. DVD release, anyone?
