This is an excellent film by Sammo Hung. In fact, it's a big piece of Hong Kong action movie. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in Macau in search of love and mingling with a vicious pimp. The performances are excellent and the characters are nice and well defined. The story involves and has enough romance, drama, comedy and suspense to keep the observation between the fight scenes. Sammo Hung proves here that he is probably the best combat choreographer in the industry. The action is simply amazing, esp. the fight with Lau Kar Leung and the final. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are extraordinary. A must for any action fan.
