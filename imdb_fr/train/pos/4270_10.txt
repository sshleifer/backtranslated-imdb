Ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies and comedies, but tell me which makes you smile every time you watch it. But the truth is that humor in this comedy is special. It is a carath√©risic for Serbia. And all the former republics of Yugoslavia know it very well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (eg: In Europe) can not enjoy it as much. Because the subtitles ruin the hole. But they should at least try !!!! Yes it's ironic! It's the best movie in Serbia's history and the world does not understand it! :-) If you have the chance to see this one, do not blow OK!
