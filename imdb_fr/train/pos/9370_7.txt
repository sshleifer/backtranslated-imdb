I had never heard of this movie before I saw it, I wondered if it was an independent film. I was right, but with a good cast, I decided to risk it. Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job and meeting bar owner, Wayne Brown (JT Walsh of Pleasantville), who gives him a large sum of money , mistaken for a hit-man hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct it, takes the money and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she offers him a counter-offer, he decides that he must leave. When Wayne knows his true identity, he pursues Michael shooting with a big weapon until he gets into a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the big hit for which he's been confused, and he's making a quick retirement. He goes back to Suzanne's home and, knowing that they are both in danger, plan to leave the city together and add another complication by falling for each other. Before leaving, however, Suzanne insists that they go to steal a large amount of money in the safe. Of course, things will not go well, and Wayne and Lyle catch up, and Lyle forces them and now forces Wayne to get the money buried. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve. Michael and Suzanne get on the bandwagon together, but obviously she cares more about money and she gets what she deserves too. Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as MP Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as truck driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from maybe a lame lame one, are all good and dandy, and the movie has a good black film feel for a black comedy thriller. Very well!
