"A family affair" takes us back to a less complicated time in America. It makes you think how different everything was at the time. It was a more innocent time in our country and we are seeing a "functional" family that takes care of everything. The film also marks the beginning of the series featuring the Hardy family. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by George Seitz, is based on a successful play. Judge James Hardy and his wife Emmily are facing an internal crisis that needs to be resolved. The married girl Joan goes home after committing a social mistake and her husband holds her responsible. At the same time, another girl, Marion, brings home a handsome man who will clearly run up against his father. The happy teenager Andy seems to be the only one without problem until his mother asks him to escort Polly to the dance, which he hesitates to do. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Judge Hardy will prove why he knows better as he implements a plan to bring everyone together. After all, he is a man who understands not only the law, but also how to deal with external forces that threaten his reputation in the community and what will make his family happy. <br /> <br /> Lionel Barrymore plays Judge Hardy with conviction. He is the glue that holds everything together. Spring Byington is seen as Emily, the mother. Mickey Rooney has a small role in this movie, but he is, as always, fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as girls, Marion and Joan. Sara Hayden and Margaret Marquis are also featured in the film as Aunt Milly and Polly, the girl who surprises Andy with her beauty. <br /> <br /> "A family affair" is a good way to observe our past through the positive painted image of an American family.
