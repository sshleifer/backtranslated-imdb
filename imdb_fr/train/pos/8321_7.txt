It's a nice film, even if the principle is ridiculous. It was a guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to get roles in this kind of movie (another example is Joe vs. the Volcano). That's what makes her a star, in part. Of course, Walter Matthau also had that ability, and he really gets into the role, creating a fun and heart-loving Einstein. I guess you could say they are both able to portray lovable characters, although they are adorable in different ways (adorable young women vs adorable curmudgeon).
