I found it very touching because Spike and Heaton stayed together throughout this film, without saying that there was not a lot of betrayal along the way. I thought the lawsuit was set aside, the relationship between the two was in the foreground, I think. I had already guessed that Heaton had such good intentions. My favorite scene was when Heaton and Spike were stuck in the swamp and Spike was running away. I usually thought that Spike would not come back. I must say that if it was not our film studies professor who made us look at it, I probably would never have seen it. Overall, I found this movie very good and I would recommend it to all British movie fans.
