I just got to get the DVD of Heavenly Region 3 of the five venoms and what a great job they did. A fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must for any Kung Fu fan. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple and has already been mentioned, so I will not come back on it. Needless to say, these are the fight scenes for which many buy the film, and they do not disappoint. The only problem is that they are a bit rare and seem too repetitive. Bruce Lee could take these things and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All kicks and punches are accompanied by the very important "type of writer" who slams and who gives the air of "whooshes", which is a cool effect although amusing! <br /> <br /> I give a B + to this film. Good but not great. In a way, I think it could have been a little better. Golden Swallow, from the same director ten years earlier, also had a better story and action.
