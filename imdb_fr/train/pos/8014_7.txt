But if you like muppets, I challenge you to dislike this one. Basically, the same regurgitated plot (this time in New York, not Los Angeles), it has a lot of fun cameos and hi-jinx muppet. Many muppets leave the movie early because it is centered on Kermy and Miss Piggy. I turned out to have enjoyed a lot. Fun to watch with your children.
