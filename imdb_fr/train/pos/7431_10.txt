I am and I was very amused by the movie. It was my favorite movie of all time in 1976. Having grown up in the 70s, I was so in love with the look and behavior of Kris Kristofferson, of course I'm not a movie critic, but for the time I think it was very good. I really like the combo of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I have seen the film many times and I still love them like Esther and John Norman. I am a very big fan of Kris and I see him in concert when I can. What author of talented singer songs, not to mention, actor. I've seen it in many movies, but always think about A star is Born.
