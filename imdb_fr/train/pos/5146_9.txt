Born of a German mother and an English father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp), I come from a unique situation. One of his relations with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the winners of the Second World War on the other. This mini-series can not delve deeper into every aspect of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general idea of ​​the situation of the time and, as far as possible, of Hitler's state of mind. In this, the series is doing pretty well. Carlyle is very good, like O'Toole, I would have liked to have more information about relations with other members of the party, because Hitler did nothing of himself. He had people around him who followed him to the letter often without asking questions and certainly without asking questions later in his murderous career. What was going on in the minds of Goebbels, Goring and Hess? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope this will encourage more people to research the subject. It could also lead people to understand why someone like Saddam Hussein can not be allowed to stay in power.
