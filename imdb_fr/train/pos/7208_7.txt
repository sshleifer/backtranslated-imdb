Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a wonderfully outmoded Michael Caine) would kill for a successful play. Enter the young prodigy (a solid prefect) who has just written such a play. Play as the hysterical wife of this Bruhl (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a very funny Irene, Irene Worth), and you will have a wonderfully amusing thriller. "Standards", "Deathtrap" is nonetheless a very powerful comedy thriller and full of twists based on a fantastic game by Ira Levin. Performers obviously have a full day playing with the material, with Caine in particular delivering brilliant first-rate lines. <br /> <br /> The film loses some steam midway through and the end is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original piece, but overall "Deathtrap" is solid, well played and fun.
