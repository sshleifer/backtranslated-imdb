Probably the most beautiful achievement of Bigas Luna because it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The delightful Mathilda May, who has spent most of Tobe Hooper's "life force" in buff, is the subject of pre-teen lust for young Biel Duran. He can not get May's breasts out of his mind and he's so eager to breastfeed and suck on his own mother's breasts. His pursuit of May is the film. As in Luna, works such as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings a slightly distorted sexual sensitivity to his strange but beautiful tale. The usual suspects will be offended, but those who are open-minded will appreciate this sparkling erotic poem within the womb. The images of Jos√© Luis Alcaine are beautiful and Nicola Piovani's score is sweet and rich. A magnificent cinematographic confection with a deliciously anarchic sensibility that the Spaniards do naturally.
