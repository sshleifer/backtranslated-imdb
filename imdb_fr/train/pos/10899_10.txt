I laughed so much during this film that my face hurt me. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy, Jack Black, in that role. Gandolfini gives his typical performance. The whole cast is funny, the story is pretty good and the comic moments are great. I went in this film without much expectation, maybe that's why I was so surprised to come out of the movie completely delighted and apparently exhausted. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and / or support their family members. The best part of this movie (for me anyway) was the subtle humor that took me completely off guard and made me laugh long after the rest of the audience stopped. Namely, the scene involving the illumination of the Christmas tree. Go see it and have fun!
