I loved this show ... a smart acting game, a smart dialogue, a great storyline with real people .... bring it back or make it available online ... really miss it .. Hope Davis really shines in this show. I like the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... It's really logical in this crazy world. Get rid of those silly reality shows and give this show a second chance. Please, bring her back. When he came out of the show, I looked online and liked the way I could watch it with minimal interruptions. In fact, ABC Online makes it easy to listen to shows when you miss them at prime time. No more endless recordings. . Whenever you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
