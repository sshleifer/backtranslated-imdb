And I gave him a ..... ..... / <br /> <br /> Why? Because it has rocked. At a time when there were so many OTHER toys / games related shows, this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories. As others have said here, he was ahead of his time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's why the show was doomed. They released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series so far. I hope more out. <br /> <br /> How does this compare when looking at him now, 20 years after his first appearance? I do not know if I still love it despite the animation sometimes clumsy, and this IMHO is a defect. The writing was almost perfect and far ahead of the competition ........ <br /> <br /> I hope to have more DVDs or even a set of all the episodes in the right order .. The DVDs are good but I do not think the stories are in the right order, but despite that the series has rocked.
