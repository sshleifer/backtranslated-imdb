That's what t.v. should be. And Pushing Daisies lives up to these expectations. Pushing Daisies is one of the rare shows that stays true to prime time, which is honest, good for the whole family and inspires your imagination. These are not the normal angles of action, sex, money, or murder of all other television programs. It's a sobering and laughing show, but while the basic plot may seem impossible, the concepts are real for all of us. Want something you can not have, hope someone wants us, flee your past and look for family, even in the most unlikely places, etc ... <br /> <br /> I realize that ABC has essentially canceled this wonderful show at this stage, and will most likely replace it with a show beyond the point of integrity. I guess everything comes back to the money ... it's a shame that there is now no other show on ABC that really makes you feel good after watching.
