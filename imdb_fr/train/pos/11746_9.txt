Amazing actor, music. A simple and clear plot, but it attracted me and kept me captivated throughout. I do not know why it was so fantastic but it was just that. So many characters were so real. It moved me and made me think that I would like to look more like this. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a school trip as a forum for such an incredible plot was a great idea and so many people were like the people looked like the ones teachers meet every day in the classroom. <br /> <br /> The film addresses issues of religion, prejudice, drugs, friendship, memories, difficult experiences and the diversity of life.
