This film is beautiful. What sets it apart from the science fiction of the 50s is that the alien has no features, no face, no eyes, nothing, but he can not be killed. I particularly like the idea that this movie does not take place over a few days, it takes place in one night, supposedly after midnight. It is also frightening that once the blob hits you, you can not get rid of it. you are stuck in it, because it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body. My favorite science fiction movie of the 50s, and what is sometimes considered the most important. I can see why Steve McQueen has been propelled to the rank of star. All this and a catchy theme song! How can you go wrong?
