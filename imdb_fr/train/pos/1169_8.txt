An elegant, sullen and innovative bloodbath, focused on revenge. As corny, of course, and sporadically very corny. It reminded me a lot of The Big Heat because the plot of revenge is triggered by the same event and the girl gets closer to the good guy because of the same bad behavior of the villain. It's a shame that there is no Gloria Grahame but so fantastic that it is Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could there be someone as handsome as Alain wearing a cashmere sweater and a trench coat? Still, he's totally beefy and icy. Nowadays, nobody can touch it - although someone like Jude Law can try, I suppose. Difficult for a girl to look good with him. The music was great and perfect and there were several excellent car chases (and these are usually not my cup of tea) - especially a bum in the woods. People also met their victims in a creative and bloody way, for example in a Junkyard type cruncher. But beyond the cheese, the overall atmosphere was touching and it went well. More creativity, excitement and freshness in this "forgotten" movie than most of what I've seen recently.
