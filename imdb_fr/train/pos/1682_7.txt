After immersing himself in the pool of the giallo with the masterly film "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh" (1971), the director Sergio Martino continued the same year with another thriller with suspense, "The Case of the Scorpion's" . Tail. "Like his first effort, this one is played by the handsome macho George Hilton, who was then to play in Martino's satanic / giallo hybrid," All the colors of black, "the following year." Scorpion's Tail "also stars actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who would embody an unhappy couple (to say the least!) In" Your vice is a closed room and I have only the key "( 1972). (I love this title!) I suppose Edwige Fenech was busy the month they shot it! Anyway, this movie shows the elegant orientation expected by Martino fans, as well as a sinuous plot, well-finished murder scenes and a beautiful filming from Athens The story is this time about an insurance investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, looking like Farrah Fawcett's prettier and smarter sister) who are training in a series of horrendous killings at the following a plane crash and the $ 1 million estate of a beautiful widow. I really thought I had this picture halfway, but I was completely wrong. Although the plot has all its meaning in this giallo, I may have to revisit the film to appreciate all the subtleties. The highlights of the painting, for me, were Anita's cat-and-mouse fight against the killer at the end, an intrusion into a particularly suspensive house and a keen fight atop a tiled roof; a lot of good deeds burst in this movie! The people of No Shame should be thanked for this new DVD, with nice subtitles and interesting extras. It turned out that the great Whotta team was determined to bring back these lost Italian gems from oblivion.
