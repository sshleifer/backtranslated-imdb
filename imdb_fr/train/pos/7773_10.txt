Fabulous movie! Rented the DVD recently and was floored by this magnificent work. Douglas Sirk was a film genius and he got performances from Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nominee) and Lauren Bacall that words can not describe. Paul Verhoeven brilliantly paid tribute to this film by inviting Dorothy Malone to play Sharon Stone's assassin guru in his Basic Instinct. What a joke! <br /> <br /> In turn, the film is hilarious, captivating, camper, biting, trashy, fascinating and rolling eyes! It's really the grandmother of all the big and small soap operas but none had the brilliant style as you'll see here: the work of the camera is smooth and polite, the use of color is to be cut the breath, the initial montage The title song is unforgettable, the unidimensional characters are unforgettable, and the final image will make you scratch your head to explain how the censors let it then make the final cut! <br /> <br /> The films considered can sometimes be a boring chore, Written on the Wind contains so much and goes so fast that it's a shame when it ends. Thanks to Mr. Sirk for the achievement - and to Todd Haynes for catching the eye - for what has now become one of my favorite movies of all time! SEE THIS FILM !!!
