Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of "Episode I of The Ghost War: The Phantom Threat", assertions and counter-claims about how Episode II and Episode III are going to take place have given pride to "original" films Star Wars, integrating them into a coherent whole, rather than separating old and new films into separate trilogies. The new films have given new perspectives to older films. This new perspective allows us to better appreciate what has often been considered the weakest of the initial trilogy: "The return of the Jedi". Often ridiculed for its "cute" appearance, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the almost perfect "The Empire Strikes Back". Indeed, the element "cute" ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series. Did George Lucas place hairy thumbnails in the movie only for marketing opportunities? Only he can answer that question. <br /> <br /> This pretty factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle AND an evolution of the saga. Following the conclusion of "The Empire Strikes Back", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his friends from the Rebel Alliance to Tatooine, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the pirate of space who is became the Rebel hero captured by Jabba the Hutt for late debts. <br /> <br /> Skywalker is a man changed since his departure from Tatooine with Ben Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil empire. Now covered in black, Luke's discovery of his origins left him confused and torn apart. His psychological constitution is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest. Although he may still want to assist his rebel friends, he longs for another chance to face the evil Darth Vader again, despite his uncertainty as to whether he will destroy him or turn to the dark side for join Vader alongside the emperor. <The first scenes of Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba's lair to his floating palace to the "all-powerful Sarlac", an intenstine who lives in the sand. CGI's enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of Sarlac, giving it a dummy and exaggerated appearance. <br /> <br /> The Tatooine battle scene is exceptional and is one of the most memorable scenes in the film. saga. Luke almost destroys Jabba and his acolytes by himself, proving that his prowess as a Jedi is now almost over. <br /> <br /> When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit Yoda who is sick, the viewer is disappointed. Yoda lacks separate screen time. Undoubtedly the star of "The Empire Strikes Back", Yoda is virtually erased from history as the progression of Luke's fate is played on the screen. <br /> <br /> ROTJ is really Luke's movie, maybe even more than the original. His journey brings the film as he gets closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate. The other rebel characters are certainly working in his shadow. The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is almost non-existent, unlike "Empire". In fact, only the character of Leia is developed in ROTJ, the character of Solo seems to fade because the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films. <br /> <br /> Their roles are dedicated to working with the Rebels to destroy a brand new death star that is almost complete. This time, the emperor himself supervises the final stages of construction. The Empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself plans to bring the now powerful Skywalker by his side to work alongside (or does it replace? ) Dark Vador. The emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than Governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) of "Star Wars", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. Accurately portrayed by Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate. <br /> <br /> All other actors are well anchored in their roles. Hamill surprises while Luke, wiser, makes his impatient teenage character, impatient student and enlightened warrior, one of the few character developments in the series. Ford's role is slim, because all his charm and charisma were spent in the first two films - he was after all the real star of the first film. Fisher's Leia is rather an accessory, at least until the end of the film, where she learns things about herself that she has never been sure of ... R2D2 and the series are more like a family than a casting. <br /> <br /> Despite the wild battle of the film between the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a sequence of three-way battle: on Endor, in space and on the death star , each with very impressive special effects. As always, the music is brilliant and perfectly reflects the mood in each case. Just as the "Blue Danube" worked perfectly for "2001 Space Odyssey", the John Williams score is as much a part of Star Wars folklore as the lightsaber and the Force. <br /> <br /> Lucas left the end is open to interpretation, which means that there could have been more episodes. Indeed, science fiction fans have repeatedly created their own versions of episodes VII, VIII and IX. ROTJ works when you get the chance, and cute, hairy animals are a good finish for the show. <br /> <br /> When the six episodes are presented together, this saga could be the best ever. Is it already? The addition of episode I changed the landscape of the series. This is why the "Return of the Jedi" can now be considered from a different angle and benefit from a new appreciation nearly 20 years after its publication.
