Let's start by saying that the English title of this film, "The Power of Kangwon Province", is an absolute abuse of language. This is because in the Hong Sang Soo movie, there are no plans real wars, unrest and conflict. a province is neither appropriate nor valid in the context of this film.If we had to judge this film by its title in Korean, "Kangwon-do ui him", it will appear as a cryptic statement about the emotional troubles of its young people protagonists including Hong Soo Soo has also produced an extremely prolific visual document on the erratic choices of people in their lives. This is a young couple who constantly show their moods, whims and fantasies. If making a film out of nothingness can be claimed as a meritorious virtue of the filmmaker, Hong Soo Soo must be hailed as a brave filmmaker whose films speak volumes about the omnipresent nothingness of relationships, feelings and life of human beings. . this is the only fair conclusion that can be deduced from this particular film.
