In 1954, Marlon Brando was the popular actor after his performances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra had yet to reinvent himself on the big screen. But Sinatra's performance as a former Nathan Detroit helped restore Sinatra to his fans. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent version for a great game on screen and the choices of main players and support are fantastic. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? It was his one and only singer role in the role of Sky Masterson. In addition, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (who plays again his role in the girlfriend of Nathan, Adelade, who suffers for a long time) are the main actors. A special mention goes to the great Stubby Kaye (as Nicely Nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, no version of Rockin 'The Boat comes close to Stubby. Sheldon Leonard, who will become famous as a television producer of shows such as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, does "Harry The Horse," BSPulley is great as Big Julie, "and even Regis Toomey offers his excellence in as "Brother Arvide". <br /> <br /> This is one of the fun musicals to see, good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brando Soooooo "Luck is a lady tonight" and my brother. .. "it's your dice"
