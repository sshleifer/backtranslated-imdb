I'm not sure this comment contains a real spoiler, but I play it with caution, so do not read it if you have not seen the movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and everyone I work with - and that's the point. I spent a lot of my professional life in the movies, without being an actor. These people are the heroes of this film: the gaffers, the extractors, the directors, the lighters and the writers, the costumes, etc., and everything is said from their point of view, at least to a great extent. Most actors are nuts and absorbed to the point of absurdity, that's what this movie does so well, but you must have worked with actors to recognize that this film is a drama in real life! Spoiler alert possible: in a big stage, the two main actors, the two actors, discuss how to discuss something personal, quite "out of the blue", with another actor, and they start to invent lines, to repeat them and to criticize each other's performance. <br /> <br /> Since the release of this movie in '91, it has become fashionable to do so, especially on television. But hardly anyone has done it so well.
