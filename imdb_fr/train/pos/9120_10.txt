This film speaks a universal language. it can be linked to oneself, to the community, to society, or to the whole world. This allows not only to open several questions, but also to try to discover and ask the right questions in order to reach this point of conviction / self-ownership. The representation of stereotypes in the film addresses the archetypes that surround us, which must be recognized as the repetitive cycle of destruction, the opposing force of innovation, creativity, and growth. Factors that disrupt the natural flow of things must be highlighted and addressed. The Idea is definitely a movie to experiment with and not just to watch, because it draws on its inner voice / consciousness through the look, it gives the feeling of being opposed to that of watching.
