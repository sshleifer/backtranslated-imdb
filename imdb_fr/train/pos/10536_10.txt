Yes ... I'm going with the 1-0 on this and here's why. In recent years, I've been watching a lot of comedies and I only left with a few light laughs and a few late fees for video rentals, because the movies were so easy to forget. Then I come across "Nothing". It seemed interesting, but I was not expecting much. I was wrong. It was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever had a chance to watch. Dave and Andrew form a beautiful comic duet and the humor was catchy enough to remember, but not too complex to the point of missing the joke. I do not want to make any comment on the current scenes, because I think it is a film that deserves to be seen for once. With more and more useless concepts coming into the movies (you know, like killer military planes and "fresh" remakes that ruin old classics), this movie will make you happy to say you can laugh at "nothing".
