Eric Rohmer "The Lady and the Duke". could have used a better translation for the title. "The English woman and the duke" might have been more precise. While it's obvious that this movie is not for everyone, judging by the comments from this forum, it's worth looking at because, despite the complexity of his story, Mr. Rohmer has created a film that could be seen as an art exhibition in museum. The mixed technology used in the film is finally working well. <br /> <br /> The strange story of Grace Elliott, a noble woman who had been the mistress of the King of England and the French Duke of Orleans, is holding our attention. The decor is Paris during the days following the French Revolution. The country was in turmoil and the power was in the hands of the people, which made fun of the aristocrats. The pictures show the agitators running with celebrity heads just after their trip to the guillotine. <br /> <br /> The relationship of grace with the duke had ended, but she remains a true friend of the great man in danger. himself to lose his own head. Grace goes through all the horrors around her without being able to escape. She even has an enemy at home, in the form of the cook, Pulcherie, who would not hesitate to denounce it at the slightest provocation. <br /> <br /> The viewing of the film sometimes gives the viewer the impression that one goes to the Louvre by looking at these immense paintings illustrating this crucial period of French history. Rather than finding the process of confusing digitization, we found that it improved the film in many ways. <br /> <br /> Lucy Russell, as Grace Elliott, does a remarkable job in describing this woman who saw a lot during her lifetime. Her French seems excellent, because it seems that she speaks it fluently. As Duke of Orleans, Jean Claude Dreyfus made a fantastic contribution by making us believe that he was the noble himself without any effort. The support cast was also great. As a group, Mr. Rohmer gets a good performance. <br /> <br /> For history buffs, "The Lady and the Duke" will be an interesting movie to watch thanks to Eric Rohmer's vision.
