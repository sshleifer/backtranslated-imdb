I saw this film at the BIFFF festival in Brussels in spring 2004. What a surprise! This German production, an elegant and imaginative shocker, is one of the scariest films I have ever seen. Be warned: it's not a joke! This terrorist has a large group of good actors (for example: Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, a beautiful scenery, a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy sfx like movies of Italian horror in the eighties. The flesh torn to the bone ... and the blood blush ... this wild Heart Stopper will grab you ... and give you dark dreams ... Must see!
