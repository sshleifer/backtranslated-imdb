There is an old adage about Joe Johnston's new catchy film that says, "The man who thinks he can do it and the man who thinks he can not do it is both right. " It is a very presumptuous statement that refers to personal motivation and belief in an individual, which, in this film, remains true even after roadblocks and family problems prevent it. <br /> <br /> "October Sky" talks about Homer Hickam, a young man who believes in himself, grew up in a strict and traditional family in the fifties. Homer loves in a small mining town where almost all men grow up to become minors. All his friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell all think that their life after high school will be the same as that of others. Homer is not worried about this future. <br /> <br /> One night while everyone is watching the sky, a Russian spacecraft called Sputnik passes over him. This is something new for Homer and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From that moment, his view of life will never be the same again. <br /> <br /> First of all, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the field of rocket specialists for a profession. Stunned by what he says, his family abandons him and continues to live as usual. However, his friends think that this idea could have some potential. After all, Quentin is very smart about this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When the four friends begin to test model rockets and blow up a white picket fence, which seems to be the case they are afraid of forest fires, they are forced to end their progress. <br /> <br /> The performances of this film are absolutely fascinating from the beginning to the end. All actors play as if it were real gibberish here. Stand out in all the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. It's very good that this is a reward for the academy if the judges remember the beginning of the year of the release of this film. <br /> <br /> The characters are also extremely developed. Not only do the filmmakers explain clearly and clearly why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the public how they manage to get into the rocket. We clearly understand all the motivations and beliefs of the characters, especially the father, who relies on an eternal tradition. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film loses some of its momentum midway through a recycled, romantic sub-plot involving Homer's love interest and how his brother stole it from him. This type of film is becoming more and more common in high school films, even though this film is intended for high school students. The actors look at each other without thinking, as if they were in a trance. I accepted it without complaint in "Inventing the abbots" in 1997, but I'm tired of it. <br /> <br /> But this is only a minor complaint. With a seemingly authentic period, an Oscar-worthy cinematography and extracts from the real life of Homer and friends at the end, who realize all their dreams, including Homer, it's the first big film of 1999. <br />
