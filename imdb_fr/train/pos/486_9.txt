"The Luzhin Defense" is a movie worthy of the past. It's an intense and smoldering film that caught my attention all the time. John Turturro is absolutely amazing in his portrait of a great chess master and eccentric, and Emily Watson bewitching as a gentle but rebellious girl from a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is evident from the moment their characters meet in the story. Overall, this film is one of the best in-depth look at the life of a great chess master. Turturro and Watson give it a totally informal and uncliched atmosphere. Most people will come out of the theater thinking and feeling somewhat touched by this shining look at the most unlikely love stories.
