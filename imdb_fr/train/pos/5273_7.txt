This was directed by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon for many horror film fans after leading the famous and famous Holocaust Cannibal. However, do not expect to find such prominence in the movie reviewed here, as it is incredibly tame in comparison and more like a Conan-inspired outing for a younger audience. <br /> <br /> Such a description can instantly most fans of Swan & Sorcery, inspired by Conan, but before turning the head, that said, this movie is so much fun! <br /> <br /> It is mostly played for laughs and features two huge and very likeable heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. the barbarian brothers who both seem to be celebrating with their characters. <br /> <br /> B-Movie favorite Richard Lynch appears as the main villain of the play. It's also great to see the roles of Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> In addition to that, the ladies are breathtaking to watch and well-kept over the course of the movie (a staple and a well-liked ingredient in the genre!) <br /> <br I can say, - it's simply a fun and light interpretation of the genre and I recommend it without reservation!
