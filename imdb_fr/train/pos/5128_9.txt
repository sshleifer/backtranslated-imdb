Let me first say that I am not from the south but that I am American. I do not like country music but I can handle it. I would never wear a cowboy hat but I would wear hats. I do not live in a caravan, but I eat tuna salad and own a house. What does this have to do with this comment? Many if you are one of those who only say "country", people like this movie. This film is loosely based on the principle "They loved and lost". James Bridges directs an American love story as real as possible. In the era of Jerry Springer and the mindset "Let's put it to the skin", this film sounds more real than ever. <br /> <br /> Bud comes of age and begins life with the help of her aunt and uncle. He settles in the big city. Bud is drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape that a blue-collar man can afford. He quickly meets Sissy, who has a similar background. Both men have a flash romance filled with painful ups and downs. <br /> <br /> (* This plot takes so many turns that you have to sit down for a few minutes before you get hooked.Marriage is a point that is often missing here.At the beginning of the film, they get married and We're looking at The transition from single to married The film highlights some of the current difficulties of women when they marry an elderly man, and also highlights the male ego with women and competition.) <br /> Bud is disputed and is excited when Micky puts in an electronic bull. Sissy also has ideas for fun, but she is quickly reminded that she is married and must begin to "act like her". The emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the intrigue continues, especially when they separate and Sissy falls for an ex-prisoner with a penchant for abuse and cruelty. She soon realizes that the grass is not always green on the other side. <br /> <br /> It is shocking that anyone can compare Bud to Vinnie Barbirino. John Travolta gave an outstanding performance that deserved recognition. He was credible and real. The scene where he shaves his beard and you see him first at the bar ... continues to give me goose bumps. Note that I'm not a big fan of Travolta, but come on, I see why Sissy was so crazy about her boots so early in the movie. Deb Winger was so real that you found herself sympathizing with her when she gave Bud a note of emotion, after having infiltrated to clean her house during their breakup. <br /> <br /> The support cast was amazing. Wes played by Scott Glenn gave a top-notch performance that made you hate and curse him while abusing Sissy. Madolyn Smith-Osborne, as Buds's mistress / friend, was so authentic that big, American-breasted girls begged to wake up flat-breasted to wear the clothes she wore in the movie. My greatest congratulations go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Bud's aunt and uncle. They seemed to be aunt and uncle of someone somewhere in Texas and, whatever their role, they made the movie so much bigger and more realistic. The Dolly Parton contest and the unforgettable scene where Bud and his aunt are outside after the death of one of the characters are two memorable scenes. The dialogue between them is touching. <br /> <br /> If you can look at it as it is, a true American love story. Then I recommend you take it for what it is ... a movie before time gives us voyeurism in a world different from ours, but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment. If this world is like yours, you will benefit a lot more. Finally, the music, whatever its date, will not fail to send you back in the past if you are over 30 years old.
