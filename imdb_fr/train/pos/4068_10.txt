Breathtaking, this is without a doubt the best animated cartoon ever made. I discovered the castle in the sky in the late 80s as a child, and it left a lasting impression. years passed and I forgot the title of the film, and it was only by chance that I surfed on the Internet that I found this masterpiece. After reading the reviews and reviews of other people, I am not surprised that he was acclaimed and touched by so many people, because he leaves an impression. a truly fantastic adventure, a must for all children and adults. It is better not to tell the story, so I would say that watching this movie will be a clear and open mind. if you have children, give them, I promise you that they will love him. There is not much to say about this piece of art, but if you have not seen it, look at it and enjoy it.
