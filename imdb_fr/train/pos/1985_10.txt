In general, I am not a lover of musicals, but if I had to choose what I would prefer, it would certainly be Oliver. This film is so well done, the characters are well represented, the costumes are well placed and the game is good. are superb, my favorite being Ron Moody's Reviewing The Situation'sung which gives a brilliant portrait of Fagin.I was not old enough to see Oliver when he came out in the late 60's but my sisters were For weeks I had to endure them by singing bloody songs, usually it was' Who will buy my wonderful roses'so I already knew all the songs before seeing the movie. It's a timeless musical that you absolutely can not do again, I do not think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, as he wrote to Oliver to describe poverty in London, I do not think it would have worked so well . the orphanages, the working houses and what the poor have used to survive, and the film depicts It is also a good reason to watch this movie: Bullseye the Old, English type Bull Terrier, notice his long lean legs he was raised out of the breed many years ago. They had to hunt up and down to find a specimen like this. him, and he is exactly what an English Bull Terrier would have looked like in the Victorian era. Note that he has scars (which are probably makeup), Bill Sykes probably used it for dog fighting or for the rat pit. A Victorian Terrier bull had a record number of murders in a rat pit . His dog is handsome, and notice that he disobeys Bill Sykes after killing Nancy, he obviously has his principles, not the one Bill Sykes thought he was. It's an excellent musical to watch if you like musicals, and if you do not like musicals, try it, there's something for everyone in this movie.
