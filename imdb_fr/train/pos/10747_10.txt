Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to make a documentary about the novice firefighters in New York. What they had was the only footage filmed inside the World Trade Center on September 11th. <br /> <br /> Having already worked with the James Hanlon ladder company, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak, while Gideon stayed at the fire station in case something interesting would happen. A plane flying over the city at low altitude distracted Jules, who pointed the camera a few seconds before the plane crashed on tower 1. <br /> <br /> Jules asks the captain to follow him in towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire, which he refused to film. He stayed a few hours on the site, filming the reactions of firefighters and other people present. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers took great care not to make the film too violent, dark and bloody. But the firemen's language is a bit rude and CBS showed a lot of bullets that broadcast it without any censorship. The Naudet brothers mixed images they filmed with individual interviews so that firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a feature film with a similar title, most DVD sales revenue is donated to 9/11 charities. Very well done, emotional, moving and totally devoid of political propaganda, is the best documentary of this type to date.
