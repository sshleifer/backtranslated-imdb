... would probably be the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). apart from a great fan service for fans (well, it was redundant ~), that's the story that blew me away. congratulations for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know that some people will not agree with me about it, but it's none of the big three actors (the guys who played Sho, his son and Kei) who gave the best performance (for me , in any case). it was Taro Yamamoto, boy # 5 of Battle Royale! <br /> <br /> do not get me wrong, I love Hyde, I venerate her voice, but the problem is that some of her scenes are a bit "depressed", but I loved this scene where he danced with the body of the dead guy kills the other guys. and Gackt was not too bad too, I preferred that his character is a little distant from the beginning. I can not say more about my past on Lee-Hom Wang, I do not pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with the distribution of stars. <br /> <br /> This film paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (excuse me for my spelling if it's wrong). Although the full song lasts about nine minutes, you will not notice the duration, as you would like to listen to Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a must see not only for fans (huge fan base ~), but also for those who love science fiction, futuristic movies, Asian style.
