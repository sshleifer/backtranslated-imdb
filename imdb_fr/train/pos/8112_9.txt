The geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells realize this extraordinary film of anticipation, with an ambition and reach difficult to find today. They predict the Second World War and the way Britain was attacked, as well as the fact that the war would be followed by a space race. They change the timing; in the film, war and space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it's amazing. We even see a helicopter (the film is older than them). <br /> <br /> Unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists who look like Romans with bubble helmets: if you can see through these funny costumes the advanced architecture of the masters of the 30s, the vision of a rationalist society of Well, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and John Cabal as an archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being, the one who chooses to shape reality and not be shaped by it. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 of 10. Inspiring like this final monologue of John Cabal.
