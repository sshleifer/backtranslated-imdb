... the Romeo Division is changing the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me say that this short film has blown me away. I saw it at random when I was in Boston at a film festival and I thank God every day since. I really, really believe that I was part of an event, like reading a text in tarantino before everyone else or see the first projection of Mean Streets. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure which festival the short film is for. or what the creative team has within reach for future products, but I hope to be able to participate. <br /> <br /> Again, it's a really amazing movie.
