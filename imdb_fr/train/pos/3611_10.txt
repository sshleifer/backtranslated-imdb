I saw this movie after watching Blue Crush and other Michelle movies. I thought she had a dark future in this area. I was extremely wrong after seeing her performance in "Girlfight". I was amazed at how she captivates the emotion of a fighter, but also a warrior.In this film, she confronts her father about the treatment she and her brother, as well as the how she transmits anger when she gets touched. and hide from love, or because she has power, she will not win. I think this role is perfect for Michelle even if she has no previous experience, the director has seen the talent, I blame myself for not seeing the talent in it.
