I will not spoil the content for anyone who has not yet watched this humble masterpiece of Kay Pollak. <br /> <br /> A world-renowned conductor brilliantly portrayed by Michael Nyqvist seeks the peace of stress by returning to his childhood village. The villagers, who have followed the genie in silence, are slowly trying to share his greatness. <br /> <br /> Each role in this film has a specific purpose and shows remarkable potential for each actor. playing their own chord in short but precise words, a symphony of love. <br /> <br /> Not love in the sense of the relationship, but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried in each of the characters, each revealing his present story, their needs, their skeletons, desires and many more. <br /> <br /> I will not forget to mention, the two main roles played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotion feedback. They touch each other with a pain related to their own disability to love each other. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult editing, in one of those films that end up being catastrophic. or fantastic. And fantastic, that has become from start to finish, not a second less or more than enough, you still have a sense of change and a taste for more. <br /> <br /> To date, one of the best movies I had the pleasure of watching.
