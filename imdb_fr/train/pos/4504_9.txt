Here, I thought that "Nanook of the north" was the last word of archaic semi-doc "eskimo" movies. How wrong! As a sea kayak enthusiast, I stayed up to 330 hours to watch this in the hope of getting a glimpse of hand-crafted "skin-boats". The film did not let me down. Any student building kayak / umiak should have a look to see here. (Note to other members of the SKers group: they seem to be using Norton Sound kayaks with single-blade paddles.) <br /> <br /> But the film has far exceeded this narrow interest. Even if there were, as some have noted, the film is so heartfelt that it is only a minor inconvenience. It was (from the point of view of this very amateur anthropologist) probably the ideal moment to make this film. Early thirties: The talkies are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) Are letting Inuit speak in their own language. And there are so many things that were still, despite the melodrama infused, authentic. They really hit this polar bear, this whale, and these caribou. A fifty-something version of this film would have been so old-fashioned with "stars", Technicolor, etc. The version of the seventies? Do not even. "The White Shadow in the South Seas" (1928) is a very good complement to this excellent film. Geographically, the inverted image of "Eskimo" also deals with the incessant and profound disruption of Western culture and technology among an unsuspecting people.
