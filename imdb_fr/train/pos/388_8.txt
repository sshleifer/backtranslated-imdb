...and I like it. A lot of special effects, and for a film that does not make mega budget, this movie does a really good job creating a masterpiece of fantasy. I'm one of the guys who did not understand the story at all, but it was still a great movie to watch. It's really in the standards that surpass Bored of the Rings, and tied with movies like Harry Potter. Which says a lot about a film, made with a fraction of the budget of these international successes. <br /> <br /> One thing I really like in this movie is that it extends so much the envelope of the upcoming adventure movie out of Hong Kong. The subject is exotic and original. The quality of the production is different from anything you see in Hong Kong for the fantastic action movie, and playing is fantastic. <br /> <br /> One of the best films to come out of Hong Kong, here is the fantastic Infernal Affairs of Hong Kong movie and I hope they will continue to work in this area until they surpass the Hollywood adventure movies. <br /> <br /> Simply fantastic.
