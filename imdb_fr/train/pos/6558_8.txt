I do not agree with the previous comments about this movie. I think it was cute and fun and the message was good for girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap whore to be cool. You can be smart, beautiful and classy at the same time. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good and the story suited the target audience. In all, my wife, my daughter (10 years old) and I thought it was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. It also encouraged my daughter to start reading the original mysteries of Nancy Drew who, I am sure, will love as much as the Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was hard to make her sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away. I can not think of a better result for this film than to revive interest in this classic series.
