First love is an extremely difficult subject to be convincingly addressed in the cinema: the resulting all-embracing passion usually ends up being a faint imitation or, even worse, a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Lifshitz manages to avoid all traps and delivers a moving, sexy and deeply captivating story of love, disaster and possible redemption, while tangibly addressing some of the deepest themes of human life. <br /> <br /> The main story is that of Mathieu, 18 years old, lonely, introverted boy who meets Cédric, brasher, more extrovert but just as isolated, on vacation with his family. As the summer warms up, they fall in love and, when the holidays are over, decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends in disaster: Cédric deceives Mathieu who, upset, tries to commit suicide. He survives and, to get an idea of ​​his life, he returns to the seaside town where they met for the first time, this time immersed in the cold of winter. <br /> <br /> If the tale was told like this, it would never have the impact it has: a large part is implicit, everything happens in a non-sequential way. <br /> <br /> Complex storytelling is essential to get a deeper sense of the passions experienced, through the counterpoint and temporal perspective. Fortunately, the three time lines used (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are coded in color: hot yellows and oranges for the summer, a blue almost scary for hospitable scenes and bright browns and blues for the winter seaside. <br /> <br /> The two main actors give excellent performances, whereas it's a pleasure to see Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) fully used (I'm more used to seeing him in Gael's rather soft dramas) Morel), Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) deserves a special mention: you can feel his loneliness, then his passion almost incredulous, then his character collapse behind a wall of aphasia. Beautifully constructed gestures go far beyond dialogue. <br /> <br /> The themes are almost classic in French cinema: our difficulty to really understand what another feels; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning ?? The title of the movie "Almost nothing" refers to all this and even to one of the key scenes of the film: In trying to understand why Mathieu tried to commit suicide, a psychiatrist asks Cedric if he has already deceived him? ? "No, well, yes, once, but it was nothing" (no, well, yes, once, but it was nothing). Cedric still loves Mathieu ?? he took him to the hospital during the suicide attempt (none of the ones we see) and desperately tries to contact him again once he is gone? but can not understand that he lost it forever, for something that did not seem to him (a meaningless matter) was all for Mathieu. <br /> <br /> Although the film is darker than the rather unfortunate poster of Pierre and Gilles suggests, it is not without hope: we see the slow and painful attempts of Cédric to get back in touch with life, first by the cat he adopts, then by working in a bar in the neighborhood and finally by contact with Pierre, who could be his next love. But here, the story ends: a teenage passion, during the year, another beginning perhaps. So what was it? Almost nothing? Certainly not when you live it ??
