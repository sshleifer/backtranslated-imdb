Damn it's so hysterical! Why are American comedies not written like this? For anyone who thinks that comedy should be stupid - there is more wit and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a bookshelf of novels! Hugh Laurie is a complete madman. I could not believe it was the same guy as House! There are so many beautiful replicas and gags in this series that you can watch each show dozens of times and always discover new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and put on butler Edmund. This is my favorite of the entire Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is as wonderful as ever as a slightly obtuse heart of the series, "the oppressed mass," Baldrick. Some of my favorite phrases: "When we have a problem with a Wellington, he really puts his foot in it" and Baldrick explaining how he got his name and his cousin Macadder "the best kipper seller" and a Scottish homicidal fencer.
