I saw a preview of Freebird at the Isle of Man TT, as I had heard about in some motorcycle magazines. Although I was mostly racing, the attraction of seeing Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes, I love Quadrophenia like everyone else) was enough to get away from the beer and party. Finally! we did it! We, the British, have actually made a great movie about the bike (and no, it's not like Torque). This is where the best British comedy is. Note that this is Phil Daniels' best performance on screen and, as for Geoff Bell, a new British legend has made his name. I loved Gary Stretch in Shane Meadows' fantastic Dead Mans Shoes and here he gives a touching performance that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation. This is a movie not only for us bikers, but I think for everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope the response on the continent will be as brilliant as the Isle of Man. I will not go into the details of some of the classic scenes in this movie (beware of the store), it will spoil the fun, but I would say, go see, enjoy and enjoy one of the best movie nights you have had in a moment. I really think it could be a cult classic. As they said at TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
