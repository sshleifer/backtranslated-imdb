Beginning? Wow - Cross-Eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable independent films I've seen in the past year. It is difficult to believe that Cross Eyed is the first film of the writer. I mean - I logged into IMDb to find more movies from this writer ... because Cross Eyed has this unique signature - you want to see what this writer might have to say about it. Nowadays, it is rare to see a well-written, well-done, well-edited and well-played movie. For me, Cross Eyed sums up what cinema should be: combining the best of all elements of the film to create a clever, artistic and poignant tale. More please.
