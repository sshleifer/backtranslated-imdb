Let me say right off the bat that I have cerebral palsy and have gone into this movie hoping to have the main performance in mind. I came out of the theater half convinced to have interpreted the role of an actor who suffered from cerebral palsy, even though I knew it was not the case. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I think that's her name) as a young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, reckless, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and petulant, in other words, human. This film, with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portraits of life with CP. Not a complete portrait, but beautiful examples of people with disabilities as human beings. Very strongly recommended.
