Claire Denis's chocolate is a beautiful but frustrating film. The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, offering the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interactions. However, the development of these characters is often insufficient. For example, one of the central themes of history is the inability of young France to build strong relationships with others. Although this performance is perfectly executed, especially in the way Denis frames the story with scenes of the return of France in his childhood home, the lack of intimacy of the girl with the other characters in the film prevents a viewer to invest a lot more in its development (or lack thereof) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of the characters development of the film makes it difficult to participate in the badly organized plot. The film raises a lot of tension between the characters, especially between Aimee and the men of his life, but never completely resolves these social frictions, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. The last scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you are looking for an adventure or theater film, Chocolat is certainly not the best choice.
