The story is a little scalded, with the sudden reversals of the fortune of the main character, but Leslie Howard and Bette Davis describe Philip Carey, the naive obsessed lover, and Mildred Rogers, the object unworthy of his affections, raise this film well above the standard melodrama. <br /> <br /> A sensitive, cultured Philip, who, for most of the photo, is linked to his craze, then to his pity for Mildred, looks like a character that Howard had to play a few years later - Ashley Wilkes, the gentleman of the South too refined and decent to do it at the time of the reconstruction. In fact, Philip seems resigned to disappointment even before Mildred enters the scene - he does not even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him that he will never do it as a painter. It is perhaps this passivity, these reduced expectations that push him to endure as long as he the selfish Cockney waitress. <br /> <br /> Although Leslie Howard is memorable, we now think of "Of Human Bondage". as a photo of Bette Davis, perhaps because of the well-known story of her fight with Jack Warner for the role of Mildred, and perhaps also because the audience prefers characters with boundless energy . Mildred may have a hoarse voice, but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained-glass angel, which makes it a little understandable why Philip has let himself go for so long. Although the man eating Mildred may sometimes seem unidimensional, it sometimes arouses sympathy in the viewer when, when she gets sick, she realizes that Philip is the only honest man to have ever loved her. One can also think she has something to say when she accuses Philip of despising her for not being "good enough". (The scene in which Philip and Norah view romance magazines as junk for cooking women seems to confirm this). <br /> <br /> Most of the secondary characters are also effective, especially Norah, the romantic writer who loves Philip, but knows how to do it. she can never compete with Mildred and Sally who have the beauty of Mildred and Norah's decency and present themselves as the deserving woman Philip is rewarded in the end. The only character I found hollow was the eccentric father of Sally, an aristocratic father who looks like a character from another era. <br /> <br /> A classic that deserves its reputation.
