This great film is composed mainly of documentary sequences that are currently contained on a DVD with Prelude to War. The great American filmmaker and storyteller Frank Capra directed these films that simply and clearly draw attention to the main factors behind the Second World War and the rise of Hitler. <br /> <br /> Every schoolboy, every American should watch them. movies today because they are so relevant. The story repeats itself again and again! The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the Nazis to infiltrate countries through sympathizers, then communists and now Muslim terrorist groups, continue to play to the advantage of these evil groups. <br /> <br /> Staying away and leaving Hitler as early as 1935 aggressive - France, America and England have caused the death of more than 50 million people. Americans, French and British today would willingly let Hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break the treaties. <br /> <br /> These great movies are perhaps too simplistic for history buffs of the Second World War. They do not tell the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because at the time, America was teaming up with them to fight Hitler. This film tells the facts and motives that led to the terrible war.
