"Black film" is an expression too used to describe movies. Every police drama seems to be a "black". But "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is really a good example of what the genre is. <br /> <br /> Very briefly, an overzealous detective (Andrews) accidentally kills a mediocre who works for the gangster. The murder is attributed to the father (Tom Tully) of a woman Andrews meets and falls in love with (Tierney). To save Old Sparky's dad, Andrews captures the rest of the crowd and surrenders himself. <br /> <br /> The morally culpable cop is motivated by the impulses of the past. His father was a thief who was killed trying to get out of prison. But that does not excuse his actions after he accidentally offended the no-goodnik in self-defense. He immediately goes to the phone to report the incident, but hesitates. He is already boiling with the department and this could end his career. Then, at the wrong time, the phone rings. Andrews' partner and Andrews tells him that the suspect they are hanging out is not at home. He hides the body and then disposes of it by dragging a guard and throwing it into the river. <br /> <br /> What motivates a man to do something so stupid? Okay. His work was in danger. But now he has committed several crimes. At least I think they must be multiple. I counted obstruction of justice, assault, scrapping a body without a permit, garbage, clothing in the first degree and false testimony against its neighbor. <br /> <br /> In the end, we do not know if it's root for Andrews or not. The suspect did not deserve to die, that's true, but it was after all an accident, because Andrews did not know he was a war hero and he "had a silver plate in his head" . It may be that kind of ambiguity that made black what it was, such as the characteristic lighting. If Black involves nothing more than black and white photography, murders, criminals, mysteries and suspicious women, we should include all of Charlie Chan's films in this column. <br /> <br /> Andrews is pretty good. He is a kind of Mark MacPherson (of "Laura") become bitter. He never laughs and smiles rarely, even sitting in front of Gene Tierney's restaurant table, a situation that can cause smiles for many men. He has no sense of humor. His nonsense is shot. When he pushes a stool into a cab and he says to him, "Be careful, I almost bang my head," said Andrews in response, "It does not matter, the taxi is insured." Andrews may seem a little wooden sometimes but it's a role that calls for a stubborn and humorless determination and he manages it well. Its minimization is perfect for the game. Small jerks or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states and I suppose the director, Otto Preminger, prevented him from pronouncing his ball as "BOO-let" and the police as "POE-lice". I could never decide for Gene Tierney. She plays well in the role of Tom Tully's daughter, a model, but she looks like Marilyn Monroe in that you can not separate the adopted ways and the actual personality traits. Did Tierney really have such an innocent, almost holy person? When she answered the phone at home, did her voice have the same quality of vocals as on the screen? Poor Tierney had psychiatric problems before being effective in treating bipolar disorder. And Andrews too, although he's a nice guy, seems to have gotten into alcoholism before finally getting well and making public service announcements. <br /> <br /> Peter Muller's DVD commentary is unpretentious, informed and sometimes amusing. <Br/> <br /> Anyway, it's a good movie and a good example of a movie noir. The good ones are not all good, even if the bad guys are all bad. Maybe this ambiguity is what makes it an adult image rather than a popcorn movie. For children, one shot is shot on the screen and no one can explode on the head. Sorry.
