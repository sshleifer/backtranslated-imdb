Every big gangster movie has currents underlying human drama. Do not expect an emotional story of guilt, revenge and desperation from "Scarface". It's a story of fierce greed, corruption and power. The darkest side of the legendary "American Dream". <br /> <br /> Whoever complains about the "grain of honey" of this film misses the point. Superficial characters, old-fashioned music and old-fashioned fashions fuel the critique of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the life of these characters is important, not at all on the human level. In fact, the film is almost borderline satire, ironic given all the gangsta rappers positively inspired by Tony Montana's lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This is not the greatest effort made by Brian DePalma, treated (especially the memorable finale), but often sank into misguidance and misleads. Fortunately, he is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably a good therapy for him, given the coke habit he was facing at the time). The themes are consistent, with a focus on Tony Montana's life and the evolution of his character, beset by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, in harmony between humor and drama. There are many lines that have since been distorted into popular culture in one form or another. <br /> <br /> The help of the cast helps to make it as it is, but it's really Pacino's movie. One of his earlier, less subtle shows (something much more common on his part at the moment) is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet it is still observable here, in a very amusing (and voluntarily exaggerated) form. It's hard to imagine another Tony Montana after watching this film, probably one of the most imitated performances to date. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable at first sight, but I realized how much she plays the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. Supporting players are also very good, especially Paul Shenar in the role of suave Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> Powerful, sometimes humorous, sometimes shocking and always controversial. "Scarface" is one of the movies of the 80s (all that could mean for you). An essential and accessible gangster film, and a landmark of pop culture. 9/10
