Take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original, it's more like a popcorn thriller. Visually, it's amazing. Everything else was just ok. <br /> <br /> For what it is, I find the movie awesome, but I love everything Burton did. People need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world, because of this movie. It was not meant to be a remake, and it is not. <br /> <br /> The end was cool. . I took it as a parallel universe.
