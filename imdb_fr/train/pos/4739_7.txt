Very good martial arts film and Jet Li is the best since the master himself Bruce Lee .Li is excellent as a discreet librarian / cop who saves all the time. He has a captivating and credible presence and look as a king of kung fu with whom you do not like. Francoise Yip is simply beautiful in this original hybrid way that is unique because of her mixed heritage, her innocence and a look all at the same time that I found unforgettable. The bad guy, the man in sunglasses and long hair was fine too but I can not find his name in the credits, can anyone help me with that? Thank you ! Enjoy Hak hap or Black Mask, in all languages, a good entertainment!
