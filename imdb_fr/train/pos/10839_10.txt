I spotted this film in the video store a few years ago and I rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much that we bought the VHS and have been enjoying it ever since. <br /> <br /> The plot has been discussed in depth, so it is not necessary to return to the moment. The fact is that this film deserves repeated viewing. The Americans, in particular, are not going to have all the jokes the first time. I know I did not do it. <br /> <br /> This film is funny, touching, sad, all at once. When Ray offers toast at his daughter's wedding, it makes him cringe. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" as he tries to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally stuck by the woman in black, it's too funny for the words. <br /> <br /> And music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard in years. I danced in the living room for "Everywhere in the world". <br /> <br /> Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy was justly congratulated for his rendition of Ray, a man who made too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the adorable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has an attractive sled look that makes women want to take him in his arms. But all the actors are also brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ignore everything you've read about this movie and watch it. It's a little gem.
