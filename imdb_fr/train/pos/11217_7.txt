Being an otaku since the time of Robotech, I can always say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite anime of all time. Considering that it was done, the animation is of superior quality. There are no loops or sequences in which the quality of the art decreases. Although the last episode is in black and white, it does not detract from the pleasure of watching the film. Although this has been described as "sappy", we must not forget that women do not react in the same way as men. As the main character is a woman, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to the "macho-man" tactic to gain the respect of her peers. Noriko's seiryuu plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is like a three-dimensional cartoon can get; his personality captures the essence of a witty girl who at the beginning seems utterly helpless but ultimately succeeds by the force of her will. The only complaint I would make is that the mecha looked a bit like teddy bears. Even the Gunbuster uses a rather dubious technique of "Laser Homing" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than to make sure that the machine wraps an immense velvet cape around the true Dracula style ). I doubt that this scene was designed to be funny, but it made me crack. Nevertheless, I would rank Gunbuster in the top 20 cartoons of all time.
