It may be the best film ever shot. If that's not the case, it's certainly one of those burned by your students, because what Brian De Palma delivers here is a superb work of cinematic art. First of all, the director's gesture, Brian De Palma, proves once again that he can be one of the best directors of all time. There is the superb performance of Al Pacino that delivers an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana). many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (the one with the chainsaw, the one in which Tony sits in a bath as big as the living room of most people), there are many beautiful doubled ( count how many times the word "f * ck" is used), there are the beautiful little details (the pan-American globe shouting "The world is yours") or the great discomusic of Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be named that is not sublime here and it's easily with "The Godfather", "The good guys" and "The white heat" one of the best gangstermovies ever made!
