It's an old-fashioned and wonderfully entertaining children's movie, surely the most appealing novice witch of all time. Unlike many modern stories that seem to feast on black witchcraft, it's simply a magical tale of hocus pocus, cute, light and charming. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in 1940 in the English village. of Peppering Eye, where three children of Cockney, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rollins, are evacuated out of the danger of air raids conducted in the cities of the Second World War. By mistake, they are sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by correspondence to become a witch apprentice. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed button to travel to London on their flying bed. There they meet Emilius Browne, the fake director of Miss Price's correspondence school for training in witchcraft. Miss Price talks about working on spells designed to bring life to inanimate objects. Meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called Bookman and his partner, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is of course wonderfully endearing as an eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, director of the late school of witchcraft, who became a street magician. This actor had already been chosen as father of children in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this film is a story that reminds enough of the previous Mary Poppins, two fantastic fantasy stories for children. Maybe this film does not have a music as memorable as Chim-Chim-Ch√®re, but it contains some attractive tunes. Some have been critical, but the film has some great special effects. Overall, the story is an enchanting family entertainment. It is unfortunate that modern children are too sophisticated for this charming and captivating story, which should please the child in all of us.
