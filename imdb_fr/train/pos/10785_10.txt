I saw this when I was small and it was excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and Meecy mice were cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross in the role of Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. What is Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy? What is sad that this little foo foo rabbit that crushes Meecy's mice on the head and then by a fairy will give Little Bunny foo foo some wishes, he will then become moron. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle and Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is great, kids will love this show, new words, songs and watch them play.
