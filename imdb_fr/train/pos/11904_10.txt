I gave him a 10 because everyone seemed to like him and it would have been morose not to do it. The reason I bother you is to add a personal observation about Castle's work. <br /> <br /> I saw "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (the version with the intelligent color sequence where everything except blood is in black and white) a few times and "The House On Haunted Hill " Many times. <br /> <br /> Even though I'm not old enough to have seen them when Castle was at the height of his showman tricks, I can appreciate them for their own merit. And although most call it mediocre, schlocky, hammy, etc., I think they do it a disservice. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of "Homicidal" is REALLY shocking and works nowadays - and the principle of "The Tingler", although stupid, was very original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was a TRIUMPH. After using Frank Lloyd Wright's home as an exterior, the great Vincent Price and a solid cast, as well as good scores and good production values ​​- when I saw it for the first time in a late packed show in the night in the late 60s, this caused a public reaction I had never seen before nor seen since. <br /> <br /> This was the time when the heroine was alone in the basement (if you have not seen the movie, stop reading NOW) and we are waiting to hear the hero of the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Without the telegraphy of what is going to happen, the camera slowly recedes, forcing the audience to turn to ... I say no more (my statement "spoiler" above only covers CE movie). <br /> <br /> The problem is that I believe that this scheme was deliberate - and not accidental - and that when that happened, the entire audience was analyzed men!) It took about ten minutes to the public to calm down. <br /> <br /> He could have been a flamboyant showman, but "House" and the other two films I mentioned were good movies. Castle might not be a Hitchcock, but he was not Ed Wood either. <br /> <br /> It's easy to focus on someone's quirks and forget to examine his TALENT. So I hope this documentary has recognized it. I can not wait to see it.
