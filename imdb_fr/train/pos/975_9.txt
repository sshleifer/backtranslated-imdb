Also known as Big Spook War. The Great Yokai War is Miike's attempt to make a family film and do a good job. The problem is that I can not imagine that many parents want to submit this film to their children. The best children's movies are those that scare or have a slightly disturbing imagery, Neverending Story and Return to Oz come to mind, but in the case of the Great War of Yokai, Miike is probably a little too far. In fact, during the screening, I was at the person who was presenting the film and I told both families that the film was probably not very appropriate. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the young hero of the film who introduces himself and explains about his current family problems. This brief moment of worldliness is broken when a cow gives birth to a calf with a human face that screams that something horrible happens before falling like an abomination (it is quite possible that the pure horror of the creature is a weird homage to Quato). <br /> <br /> After an incredible presentation of the main villain Kato and his servant Agi (a surprisingly attractive Chiaki Kuriyami), through an apocalyptic army. The story returns to normal for a moment, but there is no doubt that all logic is lost and the boy joins a group of Miyazaki who deny the fight to eliminate the evil wizard. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is pretty basic and surprisingly disconcerting at times. The elegant choice seems utterly out of place in a film that regularly breaks the clichés, but is helped by a simple and inspiring vision of a magical world. It's really a Miyazaki movie turned into a live action movie, although it's a much more piquant and vicious movie than the usual Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> This film is simply a joy to watch Yokai's drawings is colorful, and largely practical, while the robotic evil monstrosities, without displaying the best CGI of the world, have a practical and a threat that gives them a much tougher threat than you would have imagined. <br /> <br /> evenly excellent, they give their characters a perfectly natural appearance, which is commendable considering that most of them wear full body make-up or latex suits. Even Agi, with a ridiculous hive, seems stifling and lethal thanks to the amazing action of Kuriyami. <br /> <br /> Even though the film contains many elements that place it firmly in the realm of family film. cute creatures, junior heroes, a devilish villain, a sense of mischief and adventure, and a lack of revealing violence. There are elements that make you wonder if Miike should have made such a movie. <br /> <br /> The robot army is a truly terrifying threat. Everyday objects are transformed into monstrous beasts that look like skinless T-101s with added chainsaws. . These animals tear apart characters in pieces; Suck creatures in their blood-stained mouths and remove the children from their homes by sweeping them under the nose of their parents before engaging in a small patricide. <br /> <br /> The creation of the creature is also difficult for young minds. The Yokai, essentially the heroes, are introduced into a giant oven filled with a form of liquidated hatred that corrodes the flesh of the Yokai and forces their angry soul to own pieces of metal. If the children thought that anakin was burning, wait until they see a man-sized hedgehog burning to death in a tank of molten hate for a minute before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle. There are also sharp limbs, in one case a severed hand that flutters in front of the camera dripping with blood, a good amount of sexual energy (Agi is wearing a dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to have the sole motivation to sleep with Kato, the princess of the rivers wears almost nothing and has her thighs trimmed by the young hero in several scenes), and a general humor that will go straight to the heads of those for whom this technicolor wonder seemed to have been conceived. <br /> <br /> Spoilers An example of this being that the Yokai are interested in the final battle only if they think it's a big party. The ensuing battle is more of a festival than anything else, with beer, crowds and surfing. Also, a scene where Agi beats the tarmac of a pretty furry creature seems to be designed to appeal to crowds stunned by the bidding of pokémons. <br /> <br /> End Spoilers At the end of the day, the great Yokai War unfolds easily. Miike's strongest recent movies. Even if he misses the perverse charm of Gozu or Ichi, for example, he continually pushes the public on a path of general madness. In fact, this is Miike's most disturbed film as he embraces wholeheartedly the pure magic of the subject. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth being watched by Gogo's ass.
