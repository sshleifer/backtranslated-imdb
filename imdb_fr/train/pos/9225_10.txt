The beauty of Bo Derek and the revolutionary direction of John Derek make this film interesting. <br /> <br /> Bo, more beautiful than ever, is a recently widowed woman who is undergoing visits from her "dead" husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo has to get a young man's body so that his ghost husband can reconstruct his transformation of the spectrum into bodily life. Can she find a suitable candidate? How is she going to do so that Tony can do his thing? <br /> <br /> With Bo's attributes, John's unique direction, Quinn's cinematographic presence and, thanks to John, a very pretty exotic look for the entire movie, this movie is fun to watch.
