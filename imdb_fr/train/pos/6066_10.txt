When I first saw this movie, it was a long time ago on VHS-Video. I liked this movie because it was funny and exciting. A few years ago, I saw another movie called: * The incredible adventure of Andy Colby * This movie contains elements of * The wizards of the lost kingdom *. They called him "KOR the Conqueror". I started looking for the movie "KOR" for many years, because I wanted to see the full movie, not just the parts that were used in the film * Andy Colby *. No store had this Kor-Movie for rent and no store knew this movie. For many years, I watched my old VHS tapes at home, and what a wonder ... I had this film for many years at home, but the title of the film was different, because in Germany, it counts 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I still have a lot more time watching * KOR the Conquerer. The music is excellent during the troubled film, but the best part of shooting in combination with the music is this moment, when KOR is drunk through the green forest. Background music had a kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson and also the boy who played Simon in the movie. Both did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004.
