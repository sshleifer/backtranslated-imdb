I'm joking about weight loss; Well, you could lose weight, you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I like this movie. He has the same sense of youth and innocence found in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet illustrates the beauty of the simple things in life and the frequency with which we forget them. The film reminds us of what it means to see the world through the eyes of children and all the magic, mystery and horror they perceive. Jake's Closet presents a story of a humanity that is unique in its compassion that anyone who has had a childhood can both understand and fall in love. Watch him with friends. look at him with your loved ones; build a fort - optional wine.
