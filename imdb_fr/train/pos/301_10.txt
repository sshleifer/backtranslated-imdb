"They all laughed" is a superb Peter Bogdanovich who finally receives the recognition he deserves, and why? There are many reasons why it is located in New York that sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack, the attractive star of Ben Gazzara and the late John Ritter who is superb. and of course, no classic is complete without Audrey Hepburn. the film is a light and inspiring romantic comedy that is in the lineage of the thirties, the film is essentially about the Odyssey detective agency led by Gazzara, who, along with his fellow detectives, smokes and excites Blaine's roller skate Novak (the co-producer of the film) and John Ritter, the Gazzara falls essentially under the spell of the wife of a tycoon mogul (Hepburn) and Ritter, too, of the beautiful Dorothy Stratten who sadly murdered sadly after the production.
