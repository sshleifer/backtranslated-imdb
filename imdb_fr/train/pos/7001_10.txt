I have never commented on a movie before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I read comments saying that this movie stays with you. That done. It's been almost 24 hours and I'm still completely touched. This film let me question myself. How can I compare myself to a character like Ben who is totally disinterested. I loved this film. I love movies that make me doubt and question me until the end. I mainly feel two emotions, happiness and sadness. An incredible movie and very sad too. I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end they were forever. If you have not seen this movie, take it and watch it. Just make sure you have no distractions. You will want to see every nuance in this picture. One for my library.
