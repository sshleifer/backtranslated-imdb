I love all the movies of Michael Landon Jr. And the casting of Dale Midkiff by Michael Landon Jr in the role of "Clark Davis" could not have been better. Dale Midkiff has the means to remove this character. <br /> <br /> This film fascinated me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The death of Missie & Willies, little girl, with the timing of Clarks The visit was only the moment chosen by the gods. How they handled death and how Clark helped them do it was that of a father's love. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 films left before this one [Love comes slowly, love lives and long adventure], I think you can see this movie and understand it easily. Quit and want to see the 3 previous movies because of the story that all the characters have behind them. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director <br /> <br /> I look forward to many more movies from him in the future.
