Recently released on cable TV, the film opens with a disclaimer that puts it away from any cooperation of real people. It is in itself an eye-catcher. However, the script and the roles of the main characters are superb and I found myself plunged into absurdity. The purpose of this dialogue is to allow a clear, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film is about a meeting someday between two real musical legends that capture the essence of their lives and their philosophy in a story that offers an explanation of their initial "split". What is really impressive is that the actors give seemingly realistic representations of the characters they interpret, their faults and all that remains, at least this viewer was let believe that I was witness to a real event in almost every detail. The great skill of this piece lies in the fact that with a clever writing and a good interpretation, a film that essentially talks about "two of us" can give an excellent image. Worthy of at least 8 out of 10.
