I went to see Fever Pitch with my mother and I can say that we both loved it. It was not the typical romantic comedy where someone wanted the other one, and blah blah blah ... You did not wait for the first climatic kiss or they finally meet. It was more real, because you saw them through the relationship, rather than the whole movie talking about their closeness. People could really understand the film because it did not seem like an extraordinary situation or an impossible situation. It was really funny and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. Overall ... I would definitely recommend it!
