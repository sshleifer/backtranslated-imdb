This film was a box office disaster, and the reason behind it is the innocence of the film, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of this story is very good, the director did his best. Abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role, he did his best in comedy or in an emotional scene. Soha looks so nice in the movie. Rest Star Cast was just ok. The music and all the songs are good, Himesh is impressive as a singer here. Do not miss this film, it's a wonderful film that makes us feel good. Abhay better work till date. I will give 9/10 to Ahista Ahista.
