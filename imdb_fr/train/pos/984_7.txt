I came across "Bait" on the cable just one night early and thought, "Hey, why not?" I'm glad I gave him a chance. <br /> <br /> "The bait" is not perfect. He suffers from an unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional silence. But overall, this movie worked. All the elements are perfectly aligned and they realized what could have been a rather ugly film. <br /> <br /> I think most of it is due to Jamie Foxx. I do not know who tagged Foxx for the main role, but whoever made this movie a big favor. Believing and incredibly likeable, Foxx slips into the film, smooth as butter and funnier than hell. You can say that he works on his instinct, and that instinct does not fail him. <br /> <br /> The intrigue, though unimportant, is pretty much related to each other, and there is even a bow of character through which the character of Foxx develops as a person. . Again, they could have passed without any of this, but it makes things even better. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised the low rating attributed to this. Maybe I just got that good night shot, or vice versa, but I would give it a 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
