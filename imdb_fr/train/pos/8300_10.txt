It is not surprising that Busey later developed a tumor in the sinus cavity. This film is also a poor decision, but I really enjoyed it. The first 5 minutes are the 5 most uninteresting minutes of all movies; boring, bad-dialed, and then, with Spiderman's attitude, Busey screams the best and the worst of all the movies ever created ... "your worst nightmare, hawthorn!" I spit some of my egg, laughing so hard. This line resonates so well that it exceeds even the famous line "Hi Freeze, I am Batman" of Clooney. Busey is increasingly angry at people who remind him that he killed his former CIA partner ... what he did by accidentally pulling him on the chest (all this was made possible by an idle flashback sequence that lets you look dry seems exciting). There is an ashtray for the nads, punches in the face, and a "it's not my fault and you know it!" Well, the footage shows that he's missing the villain and is hitting his boyfriend, so ... Other screams must be his ex-girlfriend who drops a grenade to the ground to allow him to escape - a plan that defies all logic, physics and absurdity. Finally, when McBain jumps from the Thunderblast during an intense guerrilla war and starts running and crossing a small object, I almost get wet. Some of Busey's best works by far, rent or buy today "Butthorn!" My vote is a perfect 10 (on the poo counter that is).
