Awesome, awesome, awesome! That's all I can say about this movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text, so I'll elaborate. The cast was great (Jerry O'connel is so cute!), The music was great (the sixties had the best music ever, IMHO), the historical material was interesting and the way they trained the actors the 90s seem to be really there in the 60s. And above all, the stories of the main characters made me cry, and that's the greatness of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: GREAT!
