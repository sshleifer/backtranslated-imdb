Daniel Day-Lewis is Christy Brown, a cerebral palsy sufferer who uses "My Left Foot" to write and paint in this incredible 1989 film. The film also stars Brenda Fricker as Christy's mother, Ray McAnally. , Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Conor. Their brilliant performances, superb screenplay and Jim Sheridan's wonderful direction help to paint a living portrait of Christy Brown, artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49. <br /> <br /> Brown was born in a lower middle class Catholic family where her mother was constantly pregnant (22 children in total, 13 of whom survived). His father considered Christy a mentally handicapped and physically disabled, but he did not allow his son to go to a house. The children in the family greeted him every day when they left for school, and his mother fed him and spoke to him. <br /> <br /> In the film, Fricker conveys the meaning of a woman. who, although surrounded by a large family, needs to talk to someone. Christy does not answer. Finally, he finds a cart to ride, and the children of the neighborhood, who know him since he was a baby, include him in all their activities. The only part of his body that works really well is his left foot, and when the kids discover how much he manages to hit him, they put him in football games just for that purpose. One of the most enjoyable parts of the film is the relaxed way other children treat it. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful scenes, but none as powerful as Christy writes "Mother" on the floor, holding a piece of chalk between her toes. "It's a real Brown," said his father, lifting him on his shoulders and taking him to the pub. Entering the pub, he announces: "My son is a genius." Things change when Christy grows up because he has the desires and emotions of a young boy. He develops crushes, is rejected and goes more in himself, turning to painting. He ends up attending therapy at a nearby clinic and works with a therapist, Eileen (Fiona Shaw) at home. He falls in love with her. When he discovers she is engaged, he becomes almost crazy. But he survives to live, to paint, to write (three books in total) and to love again. <br /> <br /> Since this is a movie, some things must be left out and the characters must be combined. Brown has not been diagnosed with cerebral palsy for some time, which has been left out of the movie. The therapist Eileen is actually a combination of three important therapeutic figures in Christy's life. Although we know that his mother thought he had a good spirit, in fact, she worked very hard with Christy when he was a child and taught him the alphabet, and so on. Before Mary, Christy had a 12-year relationship with the woman to whom he dedicated "My left foot". And the typical Hollywood ending, 9 years before his death, where the negligence of his wife could have been a factor, does not end the story. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, Christy Brown's biopic is incredibly powerful. especially because of two performances: Hugh O'Conor as a young Christy and Daniel Day-Lewis as an adult Christy. O'Conor's facial expression and the way he drags his deformed body are heartbreaking. We are exhausted for him and heartbroken at the same time. <br /> <br /> And that can be said of Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors in the world - he gives Christy all his brilliance, a fully concrete character to be an intelligent human being capable of to swear, to be angry, to be bitter, to be drunk, insistent, lecherous, funny and loving. A well-deserved Oscar won the same year that Tom Cruise was nominated for "Born July 4th". I remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that Cruise was so sensational, what was wrong with the Academy? Uh, nothing to change. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker is amazing as Christy's mother, who never ceases to believe in him and what she knows how to do and who keeps his family and husband together during difficult times. What's wonderful about Fricker's performance is that support, love and work ethic seem to come naturally to the mother. The character would never consider herself a heroine or a person out of the ordinary. Fricker shows us a religious but not a fanatical woman who believes that her homework on earth is to be a good wife and a good mother. And anyway, even when her husband is unemployed, throws his daughter home because of pregnancy, whatever, she's doing. She saves money for Christy's wheelchair, she gets pictures of her daughter and the baby, she starts building a room for Christy at the back of the house. It's all part of the work day. A performance worthy of the Oscar she has received. <br /> <br /> Brown's life was more complicated than this inspiring film, but it's an extraordinary achievement for all participants and an event not to be missed.
