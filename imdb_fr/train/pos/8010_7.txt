I thought before that this movie was the most lamentable of Muppet's films. I would now like to withdraw this statement. In my opinion now, MUppet's ugliest movie was the TV movie. It's a very merry Christmas: it's a wonderful life that has been a real scam. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles more pleasant than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs are this song "You can not take any answer", the one that the Muppet Babies sing and the songs of the grand finale. As I liked the TV show Muppet Babies, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence here (that's what inspired the show Muppet Babies). <br /> <br /> The show MANHATTAN MELODIES is in itself the real Muppets Sesame Street even appeared for the wedding. As Kermit says in his last line, "What better way to do?" But I wish that what was between the beginning and the end is a little more fun. There are pretty cameos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence from Rizzo and the Rats (choreographed by the great Jim Henson himself) and the film certainly entertains. I must say, however, that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are MUPPET's three definitive films.
