This film has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I saw this movie for the first time a week ago. Since then, every day, I see the opening and each time, I am as moved that the first time I heard David Niven say the immortal words of the pilgrimage of Sir Walter Raleigh: <br /> <br /> Give my shell Saint-Jacques of calm, my stick of faith on which to walk, my script of joy, my immortal diet, my bottle of salvation, my robe of glory, the real pledge of hope; And so I will take my pilgrimage (??) <br /> <br /> Do you know why it would be a truism to say that the lives of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger are perfectly justified for having created such a wonderful opening? Because they had already been admitted to the Paradise of poets long before shooting this film. <br /> <br /> I imagine both of them in judgment on the day of death and nonchalantly saying to a furious God: I beg your pardon, sir. So, do you want to know what we did in our lifetime? Well, well, you'll see: we wrote and produced: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, red shoes? Do you think enough sir? It is quite obvious that these two great artists have already fulfilled their duty to God, Nature the Muse or whatever you might call when they shot A Matter of Life and Death. The fact that the lives of others are justified for their actions would not be obvious to everyone, even though I feel that my life would make sense if I had never done anything but see this film. <br /> <br /> Of course the elders will be tempted to say: they do not make movies like this anymore. They will be partially wrong; They have not made such films before. <br /> <br /> I have already quoted Keats here, but I will repeat his words: A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
