Surprised to see the score rather low for this film. I just saw this movie for the first time in 10 years and was reminded of why I love it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, kids, to a time when Michael Keaton was a straight up comedy guy, and you could find some joy in this movie. It's a sweet comedy - the kind that Ron Howard is the specialist - but if that's what you like, you should find out. The discreet charm of Keaton is perfect for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a little old-fashioned, because it is at the last stage of the global pre-economy, when it still mattered where a company was based. That said, it amuses laughter as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other, with considerable benefit. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering it. The scene in particular you really liked, but that's because the whole film provides a slow but steady stream of laughter. It's like a I.V. drop. And I think so.
