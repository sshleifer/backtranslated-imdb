Now it's more like that! The first film had wacky dialogues and weaker actors, but it seems that the team behind this film has united for the future and produced a comedy solid, quite pleasant, hilarious and creative that will keep everyone on the screen. edge of the stage. All along. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it's full of great things, bursting with creativity, and it's less a parody about 80s movies at the same time. The scenes in hell are superb, as are those in the sky. It's not the adventurous lacks that this one promises, and you'll never see another movie like this. Even the final act of the film is not as serious as the first, as it is generally comforting and enjoyable in its extremely clich√© repertoire of family happiness. And even Keanu Reeves, despite being around 30, is not that bad here. <br /> <br /> That seems like a good deal.
