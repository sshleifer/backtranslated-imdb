As a fan of Pokémon, I really liked this movie. He introduces new legendary Pokémon (like every movie) and adds depth to the relationships between his characters. However, I do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to benefit (this includes most adults). Some lines were vague, but it can be a bit inevitable when you copy the movie in English. The animation was beautiful, although there were some pieces that did not look good. And although the villain is a little nerdy, I think the movies have been successful in getting through various types of villains, and I guarantee you that they are not all like this one. Those who did not like it, I say, but Pokemon fans will love it.
