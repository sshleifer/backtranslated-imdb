Russell, my favorite, is beautiful in this movie. But more than that, the film covers a huge range of human passion and sorrow. From marriage to homosexuality, everything is approached and respected. The film makes the viewer understand that the tolerance of other humans is the way to save humanity. Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil. I play their scenes again and again. Anyone who has ever been in love will be empathetic with these people. All the characters are molded and described in an excellent way.
