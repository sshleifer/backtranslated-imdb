The best of Zorro series and one of my favorite series, period. This is a series that is just after the birth of Mexico. The new nation relies on the gold produced by this city so that the republic remains solvent. However, god of gold, Don del Oro raises the Indians and steals gold. It's Zorro and his gang of men to the rescue. Reed Hadley is a Zorro winner and he is a good figure as he enters a nice selection of notes (most have been reused by the last series of Zorro and other series). The story is moving and it is not clear. who is the real bad guy? There's a reason why I've seen most of the shows I've seen, it's just a great adventure and action movie. The only thing I can compare is Zorro's brand with Tyrone Power or one of the other fanatics of the time. It's great and highly recommended.
