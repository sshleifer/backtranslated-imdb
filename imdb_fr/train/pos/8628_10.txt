"Der Todesking" -The second feature film by Jorg Buttgereit (the first was notoriously "Nekromantik") has no central character, but a thematic continuity in the act of suicide.Divided into days of the week, it includes a series of plays, each representing the self-destruction of a stranger. Yes, production values ​​are low and it bothers, but in many ways, "Der Todesking" is extremely effective. It makes you think of what is sometimes more important than pure entertainment. Unlike other works of Buttgereit, it is not very gore, but there are unpleasant images like a scene of castration in the episode of Tuesday, a decomposing corpse and various acts of suicide. and full of pain! -tonishing if you want my opinion.10 out of 10-look at this shock of post-modernism! Disturbing art in its purest form!
