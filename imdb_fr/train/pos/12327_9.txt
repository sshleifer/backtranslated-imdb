In 1987, Hong Kong presented to the world such films as "Encounters of the scary kind", Chow Yun Fat, in the iconic "A Better Tomorrow" by John Woo, "Zu Warriors" and the classic "Mr Vampire". The video was an international success, but it was with "A Chinese Ghost Story" that Hong Kong cinema had its first major theatrical success in the West for many years. <br /> <br /> Western film lovers had never seen anything. I like this. It was a film that took various ingredients that Hong Kong cinema had used for years (flying swordsman, wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural) and assembled them to create a unique film by its appearance, touch and execution. Forget the unnecessary and useless consequences it has generated, it is the best and the most original. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching (still best known as action choreographer for films like A Better Tomorrow 2 / by Woo The Killer 'created under the watchful eye of legendary producer Tsui Hark , a masterpiece of Fantasy / Horror cinema, and with such a group of experts at its disposal (no less than 6 martial arts coordinators), the chances that the film is anything but wonderful would be unthinkable. > <br /> The editing of the incredibly prolific David Wu (who wrote / Directed "The Bride With White Hair 2" and published classic titles such as "A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3", "Hardboiled" and the cult hit "The Club") is simply a work of genius, and his choreographed, perfectly choreographed sword fighting talent is one of the best HK movies ever created - fast, weird, but never confusing. represent, even today, the pinnacle of their art. <br /> <br /> The team of filmmakers also made miracles. It's a film where each shot is a carefully done painting. Where marvelous blue-toned nighttime sequences, wrapped in a ghostly mist always present, are the breathtaking platform of our history. It is a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty. Even the dresses and silk clothes worn by Hsiao Tsing become living elements of the film, whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes, the ever present silk scrolls on the screen. Even a simple scene where Hsiao Tsing changes dress is transformed into a thrilling beauty as all the skills on the set combine to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act. The sets are also amazing, giving another worldly sense to the forests, and to the temple and the harshness of the burned and draped land of the flag for the incredible finale. Zhongwen Xi's production design deserves praise of the highest quality. <br /> <br /> The music of Romeo Diaz and James Wong is another important factor in the film's success. Hong Kong's films have given us fantastic music and songs that have contributed a lot to the success of a sequence, but in A Chinese Ghost Story, music is simply essential. From the opening song, the music becomes as important as the characters. <br /> <br /> The score is a perfect mix of modern and traditional instruments. Drums, bells and guitars have a lot of impact on the action sequences, but it's the slowest and most romantic songs that make their appearance. Right here; flutes, strings and choral effects create what is perhaps the most beautiful piece of music heard in a HK movie. Add to that the feminine voice, a surprisingly beautiful song that plays on the creation of Tsau-shen and Hsiao Tsing's love (we never see, but the effect is wonderful.) It's a romance of lovingly innocent film ) and you have a shining example of the power the music a movie can have. <br /> <br /> And of course we have the acting talent. Leslie Cheung (`A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2 'and a very popular singer) is outstanding as an innocent tax collector. His work in comic sequences (fortunately benign) is never exaggerated and his scenes with Joey Wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joey Wang (who would later be more or less relegated to supporting roles in films like the classic "God of Gamblers" by Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau) has never been so radiant as what she did here. She is the quintessence of ethereal beauty. His portrait of the tragic Hsiao Tsing is magnificent. She shows her characters that she is sad about what she has become and what she is supposed to do, but she also has a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she attracts men to their terrible death. Former actor Wu Ma ("Mr. Vampire", "Swordsman") is very entertaining as a wise, brave, but still grumpy, Yen. He draws a thin line between the eccentric and the boring with practical ease. And what could have been so easily a character that could have hurt the film is both wonderfully entertaining and memorable. <br /> <br /> But what about monsters and monsters? I hear crying. They go from the rather raw but amusing stop motion / animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple (which makes it a big gag of force with constantly thwarted attempts to chew on Tsau-shen, which is strangely unsuspecting), rather ridiculous, but surprisingly effective . Complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads, and a pretty remarkable work of wire. Most of them have, to date, never been exceeded. <br /> <br /> But the most remarkable effect and creation is the deadly tongue of the spirit of the tree. We first meet this thing with a hasty 'Evil Dead' style camera effect that extinguishes the throats of its victims to offer it a deadly French kiss that turns victims into zombie envelopes. But later, it is presented in all its crazy splendor. It can become so big and long that it crosses the forest after prey, tears trees, wraps around buildings and wraps around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks !! It can even open to reveal a mouth full of fangs! It is a scandalous idea not to work with the deeply romantic main plot. But this is the case, with a fantastic and unforgettable effect. <br /> <br /> This is a classic example of making a film in Hong Kong. A real team effort that gave us a really innovative film. It's a film filled with wit, invention, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, sumptuous graphics, beautiful music and, most importantly, charm, one of the most moving novels of cinema.
