This series adds new information and a new background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author, archaeologists and other anthropologists. It gives life to the book and gives even more meaning to the next opus of the author, * Collapse *. <br /> <br /> Diamond himself is a kind and caring person, and not just a disinterested or disengaged academic. This series clearly shows that his book was not simply a response to a need to "publish or perish," as the adage says about the academic world, but a thoughtful answer to a question from someone he respect, "Why did you, the whites, have you got it?" a lot of freight, and we have so little? "Because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community, Diamond was looking for an answer that would not insult that intelligence or community." I like to think of his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as "South Park's "" Blame Canada ":" Blame Wheat! "
