Superbly developed characters in many fun, witty, nonsensical and Serbian mentalities. The film is an excellent comedy, nice, interesting, unpredictable. Best point in a movie: the characters, then the humor, the story and the dialogues. Humor has an "inner development", rare in Serbian films. It is therefore a consequence of the characterization, it is well motivated, spontaneous and convincing. In addition, he is lively, intelligent and lucid. Most of the films, unfortunately, had built humor (imagine a joke and put it in the mouth of a character) or an ordinary situation comic, burlesque, farce. Part of "immortality art" is incorporated into this film. Small masterpiece difficult to access.
