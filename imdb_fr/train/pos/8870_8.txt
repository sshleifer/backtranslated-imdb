When John Singleton is activated, he is * activated * !! And it's one of his best movies. Not quite as tight as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close (and with much of the same stellar cast). This film was very well written, very well edited and very well shot. There is very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (for example, where did Fudge get the money to spend 6 years at university and many things expensive? of a rich past ... And why Professor Phibbs A teacher of his stature * should * have one ... And as long as we are there, for an engineering student, whether he is nice or not, Remy is a rather stupid character - I would think he would have a little more in the way of basic intelligence - he speaks and acts like a total jester). <br /> <br /> But other than that, the movie was very clear. A good choice of characters and points of view; and Singleton does not take sides in the story - many characters are unfriendly and he does a good job in separating the Panthers and Supremacist scenes together to show the madness of both sides. <br /> <br /> cinematography was excellent; I particularly liked the scene where Kirsty Swanson becomes intimate with Taryn and Wayne, each scene being very well spliced. The scenes of Malik / Deja were also very well filmed. <br /> <br /> The dialogue has sometimes been a little hard; this film sometimes had the tendency to be * really * preacher, and to hammer the points it was above your head when the points were as clear without the brutality (we really did not need the American flag with ' UNLEARN 'tapped on it, give credit, we are not morons ...). And to top it all off, although most of the time, Singleton uses melodrama pretty well, sometimes he gets too agitated (like Deja's death, which is fine until she screams "WHY !!!" which ruined everything (effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But the acting was generally at the top. Fabulous performances by Omar Epps (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could play ??), Michael Rapaport (really surprised me ... after True Romance and Beautiful Girls Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * exceptional. <br /> <br /> Disadvantage Jennifer Connelly was flat, although it was not completely her fault: her role was stereotyped and one-dimensional Generic to the highest degree And Tyra Banks The role was simply horrible, she moaned and groaned and groaned, another one in the long line of mannequins transformed into actresses who failed miserably (only a few prove the exception to this rule). br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Hou la la! An amazing soundtrack (which is really worth buying!) That goes like a glove to the film.Every scene has a twin song (well that the songs of Tori Amos have begun * true I'm bored at the end ... not his best job). Liz Phair, Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... how can we be wrong? <br /> <br /> In total: a very good watch, a very strong distribution, a superb scenario, an excellent film. 8/10.
