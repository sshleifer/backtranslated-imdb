Does anyone know the exact quote on George Ede's "time and love" alias, Father Fitzpatrick moving, that must be you? He was talking to Charlie and Annna in the church as they were leaving? Otherwise, I'll have to rent the movie. It was a good movie. I also liked Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met my only true love (my soulmate) and although I had the experience of meeting him when I least expected, I was not ready for this kind of emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Although we got married, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought. I became complacent and took his love for granted and he resisted for 7 years. <br /> <br /> He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry and incredulous about the way things have gone. I had very difficult lessons to learn and we are now separated for 3 years. <br /> <br /> This film was very important because I'm still waiting to be reconciled with my one and only true love. I can NOW enjoy this distinct feeling in me and the quote from Father Fitzpatrick has been true to me. <br /> <br /> I know that when he has healed enough to trust me, we will remarry. <br /> Never be satisfied and take true love for donations! This is the most difficult lesson of my life. <br /> <br /> In addition, the music of this film is exceptional and significant! This film is profound and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth the wait, if it is supposed to be, it will do it, whatever happens, IT WILL COME! Nothing is impossible, even when it's the second time! Thank you!
