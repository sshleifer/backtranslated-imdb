My 2 year old son loves the Doodlebops show, he seems to keep his attention for a moment. The characters are interesting, vibrant with the primary colors and everything. There's not a lot of educational content that the target audience could benefit from, but they seem to have a theme for each show and try to teach kids about sharing, respect and other basics, so I like that. It is well produced with high production values. But it's really just an average show like most TV shows these days. We do not buy from the point of view of merchandise and ask our son to wear all that is Dooblebop. I do not think we would spend money on a show if they came to town. Going to the zoo or science center is a much better experience for everyone involved and, in my opinion, this money is better spent.
