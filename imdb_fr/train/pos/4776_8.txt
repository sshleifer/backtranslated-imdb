I watched this movie at a usual time, which is very late at night. Usually, if a movie does not interest me, I begin to fall asleep and I have to loot the fridge to stay awake. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought that was what I had to do since the rhythm of this movie started slowly, with the fact that his shots tended to linger with the character during A long period. But after a while, I begin to know more about the film, while his character tells more through his story. In the end, you feel like you've known him all your life. The film held my interest so much that I did not even know that the sun was about to rise. <br /> <br /> Little weird style of Lynch, but there are enough weird characters to make the movie fun.
