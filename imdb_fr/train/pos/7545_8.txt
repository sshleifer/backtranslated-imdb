I really liked it even though, reading the reviews, it was quite disturbing for me..But as a fan of anime art, I can quite understand this perfect artwork, even if some were against my cultures and my beliefs .. of art .. !! The beginning of the film is very strong, strange and confusing. It is difficult to understand the content that makes me respect the one who did it. Only an extremely open man can make such a daring film ... it's definitely not for the kids ... even though the characters are cute and adorable, they live on unsettling adventures that can not be erased (sorry if spelling is false) of the memory of those.
