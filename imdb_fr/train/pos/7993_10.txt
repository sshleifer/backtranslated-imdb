There are many reasons to watch this film: to see the reality of Latin America's kidnappings, the corruption of the police at the continental level, among so many realities that we live the Latins. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wahington's performance was brilliant. This guy continues to be an excellent actor and continues as well. Dakota Fanning barely 10 years old, an excellent actress has become and I congratulate her. The rest of the film was wonderful, I have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope it happened to those who produce in Hollywood to make a film completely in Venezuela, where they show better our reality with regard to delinquency, drug trafficking or political problems. They have made few films that they film in Venezuela (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) that they should produce more, as they shoot in Mexico. I hope it leaves in the soundtrack, it's excellent. My vote is 10/10
