It's a very dark and intriguing thriller of horror type based on the idea of ​​religious murders. The plot centers on a deranged man who lives in Texas, USA, who suddenly launches into a killing with his two young sons after being instructed by God to redeem the world from the wicked. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton, who directs This film plays the deranged father who is known as Hand of God Killer, while Matthew McConaughey plays his best performance to date as the eldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton who decides that he can no longer bear the burden of his deadly childhood alone and uses flashbacks to tell the story to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> I can not think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to his seat from beginning to end and this is certainly one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you will not be able to do it because of the power of this movie. <br /> <br /> The directors filmed this film very well and they contribute to make the plot a reality. Playing in this movie is great but if there is a disadvantage, some parts are very powerful and can disturb some people. <br /> <br /> Although the concept of this film is very dark, young children portray the idea through brilliant acting. It really is a thorny movie and it is guaranteed that you are always at the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror movies, disturbing and powerful, or to those who just want to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
