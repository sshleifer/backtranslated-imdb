It's a very funny, easy-to-watch movie that keeps you entertained almost all the time. The director's work is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark. The film is a typical story of police partners as a deadly weapon, but the jokes and comedies are Argentine. The problem is that one of them is a psychologist interpreted by Peretti and must accompany the detective Diaz (played by Luque) in his tasks while also assisting him (Diaz is troubled because his wife has deceived). Some dialogues are hilarious around the world: understandable and laughable anywhere. It's very good overall, it deserves an 8, but I have awarded 7 because it's a bit late. On a personal note, I must add that it is a "bravo" for Argentine filmmakers, given that the little good happens in the future.
