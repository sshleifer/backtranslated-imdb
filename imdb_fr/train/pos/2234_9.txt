Although the special effects and technical attributes of this film may actually be derisory for some, I have never been able to erase the images that this film has etched in my youthful and impressionable mind when I first saw it at about 8 years old. The story of this girl's survival and the hardships she has endured has been engraved in my memory for all these years, and I have thought on more than one occasion of how she overcame situations far beyond anything I've seen. <br /> The fact that this is a true story and the fact that I was only a child when I saw this for the first time is perhaps the reason for my high score for this film. Whenever this film was broadcast on television in the '70s and' 80s, I would be stared at television, drinking in every scene with an interest that I could not explain. I suppose that looking at this for the first time as an adult (and with a blas√© vision of the world) may not be so nice for some. In fact, I did everything to get a copy so I could show this film to my son. <br /> <br /> This film, like many others, is not suitable for everyone. If you are impressed by remarkable stories of human survival, if you like Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or the Amazon, then I think you'll like this movie as much as I've enjoyed it for 30 years.
