OKAY. I am biased. I live near Shrewsbury in England, where this film was shot. It's always the same now. I remember filming here very clearly and fake snow on the streets for days. Often, when I walk in Shrewsbury, I see a street or house and it will remind me of this movie. <br /> <br /> Scrooge of George C. Scott is a more realistic character than many other versions of the screen. . His physical appearance is not the typical miser. Scott is tall and imposing. A man who finds those who are smaller than him inferior. <br /> <br /> We all know the story and the quotes. The book is one of the most expensive works of the English language. And I do not think many cynics would say that people are not capable of change and redemption. This version of the film describes all this very well. George C. Scott may be American, but he plays the role of English greed with wonderful skill. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. If you have not seen this version, I highly recommend it. It is usually available for a very small amount of money ... or are you too mean?
