Thank you Jymn Magon, for creating the 2 best Disney cartoons. This show has improved a lot over the years. When I was a child, I did not like it because I thought it was a Ducktales scam, which was my favorite Disney thing at the time (like Grandmoffromero). Then later, it was good but not great. But after reading the reviews, I decided to give him another chance and I bought the DVD and watched the entire driver the first day I got it, and I was very pleasantly surprised. It's still my favorite episode, although the series is up to the task. And at the end of disc 1, I knew it would be a top tenner. <br /> <br /> The characters are so complex and charming. My favorite must be Wildcat. He is absolutely hilarious and adorable. My next favorite is Baloo, the best driver in the series. I understand why Jymn built the series around him. Then it's Kit Cloudkicker. He and Baloo have the best relationship of the series. After that, Louie. Jim Cummings perfectly imitated the original voice. After him, Rebecca. She made me laugh a lot and I think she and Baloo are getting married. And finally (for the heroes), Molly. Although she is my favorite, I still love her. I think he's a very cute character (much better than Webby from Ducktales). And the bad guys were very original. Don Karnage and his hijackers always make me crack, Kahn is cold and ruthless, and the Thembrians are always at least fun. <br /> <br /> As said before, the stories range from hilarious Bear, Romance of Red Chimp) barely touching (The Old Man & the Seaduck, Paradise Lost), to fun, fun and exciting adventures (At the looking for old mistakes and my favorite For whom Klang Bell). These are just a few of my favorite episodes. Anyway, Talespin is the best of Disney, apart from Gummi Bears. Some reasons for this? GB had a decent amount of my favorite character (Cubbi), while TS did not have enough of Wildcat. But in the end, Talespin remains a classic. BOTTOM LINE- 10/10 6th best cartoon of all time.
