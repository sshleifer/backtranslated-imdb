Petter Mattei's "Love at the Time of Money" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a living portrait of human relationships. It's a film that seems to tell us what money, power and success bring to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /> <br /> As this is a variation of Arthur Schnitzler's play on the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time of New York, where all these different characters meet and connect. Everyone is connected in one way or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Elegantly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are led to see how these people live and the world in their own habitat. <br /> <br /> The only thing we get from all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness that everyone lives. A big city is not exactly the best place where human relationships find genuine fulfillment, as we can see, most people we meet. <br /> <br /> The acting is good under the direction of Mr. Mattei. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented actors bring these characters to life. <br /> <br /> We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and look forward to his work.
