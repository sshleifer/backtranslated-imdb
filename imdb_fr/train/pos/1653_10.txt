I agree with all who say that this series was the best of the kind "spy". My husband and I were captivated by this film during its first broadcast in the United States and watched each episode. At that time, I tried to buy the series (I recorded everything), but the WGBH told us that it was not available. I even thought of writing to Ian Holm to know if he would have a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complicated plot). If the original version is available on DVD, I will be among the first to get a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of Bernard Samson, a vulnerable but courageous man, was incredible. (He's still amazing.)
