Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo are the protagonists of this fun movie. The late Fred Gwynne is truly wonderful as Herman Munster who lives with his grandfather Munster (Al Lewis), his wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that includes an entire section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the city, everyone blames them. Both must now erase their names before it's too late. You will laugh like me.
