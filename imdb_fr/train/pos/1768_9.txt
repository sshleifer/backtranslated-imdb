I have not laughed so much about a movie for a long time. I went for screening and was delighted because I was dying to see him. I had tears in my eyes from laughing all through the movie. The spectators all shared my laughter and applauded and screamed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Steve Carrell (whom I had already been a fan of). He proves in this film his formidable talent for comedy. He has a style I have never seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God, Will Ferrell did not come (love him, but have seen him too much this summer). <br /> <br /> There were elements of comic genius in this film. Partly thanks to Carrell and partly thanks to the writing (also Carrell). The depilatory scene and the speed corrector with the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely going to see '40 Years Old Virgin 'when he comes out My advice: go see him for laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie.
