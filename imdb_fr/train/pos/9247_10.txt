I was expecting this film to be an ordinary romance of the 1930s. The boy meets the girl, they fall in love, the boy loses the girl, the boy wins it at the end. It was not like that at all. Clark Gable plays Eddie, a crook with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrows. He hides cops when he breaks into Ruby's apartment (Jean Harlow) to find her covered with bubbles in the bathtub. Instant chemistry.She has a hard time getting caught for a while, but a girl can not resist that smile for so long. The heat between them is obvious, and some scenes are definitely pre-production code! When a blackmail job goes awry and Ruby finds herself in a boarding house for "troubled girls", she is miserable and, thanks to the grating that her roommate gives her, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays perfectly with Ruby. She never lets Gable get all the right lines! There is a particularly moving scene where she plays "their song" on the piano and is played to perfection. The last fifteen minutes make me cry every time. A really sweet novel.
