Which is good: some small inventive and truly scary effects that will put under the skin of the most seasoned horror fans. Do not rely on stabbing the soundtrack for his "play" moments. Even if you have seen everything, there are still some elements in this movie that will make your jaw drop. <br /> <br /> What could have been better about this: The acting game has sometimes been flat and unconvincing. There was a quality of "filming on video" in some places (although, above all, it created the atmosphere that he aspired to), and the work of the camera is full of useless close-ups of actions devoid of meaning. Although the effects are truly scary, I think they may have gone to the well once again with some of them. The end seemed hasty and ignored what could have been more impactful moments. The viewer is free to understand many things for himself, not as a challenge on the part of the filmmakers, but because he has just missed it. <br /> <br /> A good little independent horror movie that easily has several steps above average. It's worth the rental.
