WINCHESTER 73 tells the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) obsessed with the desire to recover his precious good, a recurring rifle manufactured by Winchester. The rifle keeps changing hands, and Stewart persists afterwards. Anthony Mann is more a detective film than a traditional western. Cowboys often look more like modern-day gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of dubious virtue who goes to a ranch with a man (Charles Drake) whom she could marry. She ends up cracking for Stewart, but not before going a little bit. Winters is the most complex character in a movie full of unusual characters. Watch the young Dan Dureyea as the hazel killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role. Will Geer plays Wyatt Earp.
