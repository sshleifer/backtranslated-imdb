This is a well-ordered crime drama that has 65 minutes of animation. It contains all the necessary ingredients: a mysterious body, an elderly policeman, Corrigan (Walter Kinsella), exhausted, and his junior acolyte, Tobin (John Miles), a dark assassin and a love interest for the Tobin in the form of a Mary (Patricia Wright), a botanist, helps solve the crime. There is also a great final of shooting that takes place in a stonemason's yard. <br /> <br /> Beware of a beautiful blunder at the beginning of this movie where Lieutenant Corrigan refers to the woman who died under the name 'Tatooed Tilly' BEFORE the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo (confusing huh?). Also later, when Tobin chases the killer through the courts, he is suddenly shown to be heading in the wrong direction at some point - no wonder he did not catch him!
