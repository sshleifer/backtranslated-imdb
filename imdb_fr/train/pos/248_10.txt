'Ned Kelly' is a beautifully made Australian film honoring a true Australian hero. We are immersed in the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and other members of the Kelly Gang, as Ned's actions explain and perhaps justify. <br /> <br /> There is an exceptional casting, which all give stellar performances, which brings the film to life. (Excellent job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe, playing very well the role of discreet and loyal lady. I was swept in the moment. For a moment, I almost thought the gang would win the Glenrowan battle. Alas, it was not the case. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are fictitious and are part of Ned Kelly's passion. , was slightly disappointed by this. Maybe the film could have lasted longer to cover more Kelly Gang / Ned's life - I felt that not enough was covered. <br /> <br /> Despite some flaws, this is a moving film that moves all kinds of emotions. (And hey, I guess this movie would be better to watch than Mick Jagger trying to portray Ned ...)
