I know sometimes it's really really lame ... But the acting is incredible and Melissa Joan Hart is as cute as a button. I really like this show and I'm almost embarrassed to do it because the show has a representative. to be really cheesy, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes the budget can be quite small - sometimes the actors change and you just have to deal with it ... Like Sabrina's father, there are 2 different guys in the movie ... I mean, could not they just say he was an uncle or something? Still, I can not help but love this show. Harvey and Sabrina are a really cute couple and Salem is absolutely hilarious. I really recommend it if you are looking for light and fun entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... an episode HILARIOUS. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not really a fan of the twists of the seventh season ... Once in college, Morgan joined the group and his dialogue is painful and very badly played ... Moreover, it is ugly, so the jokes about how she only survives because of her beauty have been lost to me ... But I think it was set up to have a really good eighth season and I was really sad to see one of my favorite shows canceled!
