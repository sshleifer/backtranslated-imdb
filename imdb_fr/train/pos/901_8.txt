Well ... Vivah is a good movie, but typical of Sooraj Barjatya. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The film is more than good, but not extremely good. <br /> <br /> The big advantage of the film is the staging, the music and the game of Shahid and Amrita (especially the last scene). The film begins with a common factor of Indian film --- A girl is hated by her stepmother. The story is that the movie is a bit common, but it's good, good enough to make the movie a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> The downside is the current story of the Bollywood movie. Overall, I would say it's twice to watch a movie, if you want to see the typical Indian family values ​​and love of course!
