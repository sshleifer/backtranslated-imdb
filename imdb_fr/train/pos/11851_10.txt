At a time when Hollywood is making money showing our weaknesses, our despair, our crime, our drugs and our war, this film is a reminder of the concept of "the indomitable spirit". If you feel beaten, this movie will free your mind and you will skyrocket. We all know how difficult life can be. We sometimes need to remind ourselves that perseverance and courage will allow us to cross. That's what this film did for me and I hope that will be the case for you.
