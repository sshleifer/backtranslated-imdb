Surprisingly well done for an independent film, An Insomniac's Nightmare paints a striking portrait of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. Wonderfully well written and directed, it creates the atmosphere of a dream while the viewer is led through a night in the life of an insomniac. <br /> <br /> With Dominic Monaghan in the role of Jack, we can see everything he sees. while dragging the long hours of a lonely night. The narration is almost hypnotizing and, from the first lines, it is impossible to turn away. Fascinating and slightly disturbing, it shows how one solves one's lack of sleep, between mental health and madness. <br /> <br /> At each turn, the Insomniac Nightmare is provocative and engaging. This comes highly recommended.
