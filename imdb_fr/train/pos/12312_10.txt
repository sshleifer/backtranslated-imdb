I can not believe that a movie that can be done as well in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west of the country. Do not repeat other comments here. The score is very good and moving. It literally means "please, dawn never comes" - when it comes, the beautiful ghost and the lover will be separated forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look great. I enjoyed Joel in God of Gamblers and many of Leslie's films, including Better Tomorrow.
