Greetings again from the darkness. What a relief ... a thriller that is really exciting! The new "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates screen time with this nice little thriller classic thriller of the famous horror film director Wes Craven ("Scream" and "A Nightmare" movies on Elm Street "). Craven even proved himself as a passenger on the plane. <br /> <br /> What makes this one work is the realism of the first 15 to 20 minutes when we see McAdams interacting with 4 or 5 people or on the phone. She is natural. When she meets Cillian Murphy (the scarecrow in "Batman Begins") in what seems like a coincidence, the film really takes off. Watching the two guys yuppie flirt while the public knows that something bad is getting ready, enchants movie making! The boarding sequence on the plane is fascinating and the 30 minutes and more on board are extremely claustrophobic. Craven lets us guess the implication of others and if someone will come to his rescue. <br /> <br /> As with many thrillers, the only disappointment is during the climax, when the lamb turns into a superhero. An interesting plot leads us to believe that little Rachel has the frustration to get there, but we can not help but nibble a little. The most overexploited scenes involve angry customers, a boring passenger, Cillian's injury and currency effects at the hotel. The strength of the film lies in the development of characters and psychological games between the protagonists. Unfortunately, screen veteran Brian Cox is underused, but on the whole it's a thriller with above-average suspense, to behold, with the exception of the final.
