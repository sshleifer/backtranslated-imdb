This film, as economical as it is, is one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. If you accept the fact that your budget is low from the beginning, you will understand how good a story is, how scripted it is and how great the filmmaker has been in producing something so wonderful with little money. <Br /> <br /> All the elements of a big movie come together. The visuals, although shot digitally, were beautiful in places. The weird and dreamy feeling of the movie is particularly well captured by the talking dog, this scene was just amazing. It's such a thrilling job, but not pretentious, and because of that, I have a lot of respect for this movie. It is highly recommended for those looking for something unique and captivating, and different from most repetitive movies on offer.
