The good thing about this movie is that it's alone - you must not have seen the original. Unfortunately, this is also its biggest drawback. It would have been nice to include some of the original characters in the new story and see how their lives had developed. Sinclair, as in the original, is excellent and offers the movies the best comic moments as he tries to cope with delicate and embarrassing situations, but the secondary cast is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth is to be commended for his brave attempt to move the character and create an original sequel, but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original.
