When I sat in the cinema, I was in a good mood and I did not intend to change it. But this film is a dramatic center. I was sweaty and needed a shower afterwards. So what do we have? Theoretically, the story of a Turkish teenager living in Copenhagen, Denmark, who comes of age. I quickly realized that the plot seemed pretty much borrowed from "Bend it like Beckham", where an Indian woman played football and spoiled her sister's wedding. Here we transferred him to a Turkish girl who spoils her brother's wedding by doing Kung Fu. And we also have a love story and a contest. After accepting this, it turned out to be a gripping and emotional drama that featured beautiful Kung Fu (I'm not an expert though). Leading actress Semra Turan is not only the champion of Denmark, but she also delivers an excellent performance, so it seems reasonable to assume that here we have some autobiographical impressions, taking into account that this is her first film and education as an actress. The rest of the cast agrees, good camera, intense Kung Fu. Footnotes: - The Turkish male audience was respectful and therefore had to do something good. - The audience began to applaud when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who beat her brother severely for revenge. - Xian Gao, Chinese film instructor / actor Kung Fu (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) starred in the main role <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see him at the movies, you will probably have a good and intense experience and I do not know if it works as well on small screen
