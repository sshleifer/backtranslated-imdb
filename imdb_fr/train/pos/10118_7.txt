I really like Miikes movies on Yakuza, this one I saw about 2 years ago and that really sucked my head. Never before seen something so sick and twisted. The story is good and the actors are doing their job very well. I have not seen the British or Japanese version, but I must say that I think the German DVD is a little censored. If you have not already seen the film and are living in Germany, it may be better to look for a DVD in the Netherlands or Austria. The DVD I-ON contains a lot of very hard and unpleasant scenes, but in the showdown, I felt that something was missing, namely one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> In summary, a good movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that's what I love Miike!
