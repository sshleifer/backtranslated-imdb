It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she smiles a lot. Also liked to hear him sing. Nice change to see her out of her CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film itself was entertaining, but it seemed to ignore some explanations in many parts. Several characters seemed to be miserable for a minute and happy the next and it was up to your imagination to understand why. Each character was weird and in some cases I could not wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This film was not filled with sober and clean people, but rather complicated, complicated people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them.
