Tom the cat, Jerry the mouse and Spike the dog (here called Butch, his third name, his second "Killer") decide to sign a peace treaty for everyone to love each other. It's weird and a bit unnatural to see them all boyfriend buddy like that and their friend seems to think so too. But in the end, thanks to a disagreement over a steak, everything is back to normal and everything is as it should be. This short film is the second of three on the new Spotlight DVD to be published and I do not know why this one was. This caricature is available on disc one of the DVDs of the Spotlight collection of "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My Grade: B
