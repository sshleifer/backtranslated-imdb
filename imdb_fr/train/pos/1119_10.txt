Sandra Bernhard's 1990 film came in succession to her 1988 off-Broadway theatrical production ... which she and others in the film call her "one-woman show". "<br /> <br /> There have been several changes in the monologues and one-liners, and the film's version is visually transforming the story, making Sandra a fabulous existence as a performer on stage in New York. York, during what she calls her "superstar's summer" to an illusory and almost desperate existence at her home in Los Angeles - her fictional manager in the film says that brings Sandra back "to her roots, to ... clubs of high-end dinner like the Parisian Room. "<br /> <br /> We need to make a point here." Sandra tries to appeal to her liberal worldview and sometimes harsh criticisms of American pop culture to an audience that does not fully see her. In LA, she plays in front of a predominantly black audience and tries to recount her ideas while all that these people seem to want is "Shashonna", a stripper who looks like Madonna, and even then, with Shashonna who dance on rhythms that resemble those of "Like a Virgin", there is not much to say about the public's enjoyment of the show.The scene in the club throughout the film is more A funny scene to capture is that of a round man who helps Shashonna get up from her pants. <br /> <br /> But if she falls, Sandra does it with style and force, transmitting everything, from false trust to the perforated vulnerability ... to the point where it is naked (literally), p ugly for acceptance and still swimming in the pool of his own transparent celebrity. His representations of interactions with artists like Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (what we believe likely) Warren Beatty are fictional and hilarious. <br /> <br /> Sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment, playing a discreet yet mystifying rendition of Nina Simone's "Four Women", dressed in a mufti and another African costume, singing lines such as "my skin is black," "my hair is woolly," and "they call me sweet thing. "<br /> <br /> She resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of the art of the underworld in an extremely amusing description of the frantic auction of real estate for Andy Warhol:" Leave Andy the wisdom and sensitivity of hours and hours of hard work and hard work dedicated to the Indian product ... that they have been fortunate enough to take advantage of everything that's happening in Santa Fe. "<br /> <br /> She exposes the excesses of Hollywood, comforting a helpless friend then reprimanding him by saying "Sir, if it is about Ishtar, I get up Right now, and get out of your life forever because it is too complacent , same for me! "<br /> <br /> Sandra illustrates women's expectations in the era of feminism Dressed as a Cosmo girl, Sandra recounts her fantasy as a young executive secretary and marry her boss, and finally concludes by relieving: "I will never be a statistic, not me. I'm under 35 and I'm getting married! "<br /> <br /> Sandra advocates the opening of sexuality in society:" When it touches you in the night, are you ok , or does it seem real? I say that sounds real ... POWERFUL real. "<br /> <br /> Finally, she calls for a gradual change.The American company channels the big names of disco, Patrick Cowley and Sylvester, and proclaims:" All world will end up laughing! "<br /> <br /> All this comes in the form of lavish, schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances composed by Billy Paul, Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nyro, to name a few At the same time, Sandra's idealized and fictional incarnation - her mirror image generated - floats in the city, a handsome black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading Kabala, studying chemistry and listening to rap music NWA In Without You I'm nothing, Sandra Bernhard explores emotions and existences with which she had only played as a regular guest in Late Night With David Letterman, her almost childlike enthusiasm for shock exposed to in the 1980s, is set aside in a subtle way, and his confidence in materialism and American celebrity is refreshing. This approach to comedy would forever change Sandra's direction and mark a more mature and sympathetic artist to come. <br /> <br /> If you like subtle humor to the point of getting into jokes about glamor, celebrity, sex, loneliness, despair and superficial expressions of love and kinship, this movie will will keep you awake. This may not be done to be funny in all areas. Maybe it's a bit disturbing or even dull for some. But consider the void of the world that Sandra paints for you and you will understand how she is really funny and brilliant. <br /> <br /> But see without you, I'm nothing with a friend "aware" because it's really funnier that way. Before you know it, you'll be exchanging Sandra's spades and bewildering the hell out of all the others.
