This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions, shootings, bad guys and the worst. It's fun to see James Belushi use his humor to get out of the mess he's been in since he stole $ 12 million from the ultimate Boss "The Skipper". That sounds cheesy. Yes of course. Have I had fun watching this movie, which is much better than any garbage made directly on DVD, but if you get to understand the stupid plot, you will find that this movie still has some surprises. You can argue that the twists are predictable, but the fast pace of this film does not give you time to think too much, which is a blessing, because this film is not intended to reveal the ultimate turning point . Only the title is a bit misleading and maybe that's why so many people hated this movie. They were probably expecting a movie about mobsters instead of crooks crossing over to cross each other.
