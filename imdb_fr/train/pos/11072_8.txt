it is very simple. Jake goes to jail and spends five years with crooks and chess masters. they feel compassion for his story of loss and failure, and a total misery he lives, because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and his mastery of the rules of small crooks. they decide to give Jake ultimate freedom: from his deepest fears, from what he believes to be himself. for that, they take him on a journey where he must let go of all fear, all pride, all hope - to be reborn as true master of his will. <br /> <br /> it's a smart movie about the journey of enlightenment, the infinite bets and the games we do with and in ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.
