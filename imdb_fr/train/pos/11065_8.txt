This comedy with a lot of pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail. There have been many such films with more notable actors trying to achieve this elusive mix that has never come close to the depth and delicacy of it. This is probably because the exceptional actors with the remarkable performances of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly captures your interest and your emotions and keeps them throughout the film. Initially, the action seems rather shifted and imprudent, but we learn little by little that these two rather pathetic wounded try desperately and involuntarily to treat themselves, even reluctantly, one compared to the other. The wrenching facial expressions of Rogers touched by touch and Sheedy's outbursts of anger are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them. You will be concerned about these two friendly people who are suffering deeply and hope that they will succeed because doubt reigns and everything is suspended by a tenuous emotional thread. Let's hope that viewers will see more about Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy, as this film proves their merit as accomplished actors without a doubt.
