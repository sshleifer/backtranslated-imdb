"Such a Long Journey" is a well-crafted film, a good filming and a showcase of good performances. However, the story is so mixed with subplots and characters so special that it becomes a kind of valet and master. In addition, the Western audience will probably find the esotericism of Parsee's rather obscure culture a bit difficult to obtain in less than 1.7 hours. Recommended for those interested in India.
