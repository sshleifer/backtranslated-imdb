Finally! A decent British comedy that is not centered on mockney robbers or on a TV show. John Ivay's film is a psychoactive discovery story, dressed in a biker outfit. The three protagonists are gentle imbeciles with a penchant for failure and each at a turning point in their lives, giving a trio of sensitive and emotional sub-intrigues to assemble the comedy. The chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and creates a touching camaraderie with hilarious dialogues and classic comic moments. It's part of Withnail and me, the American werewolf in London and the Quadraphenia (but only because of the gangs of cyclists and Phil Daniels). In fact, Phil Daniels' adorable thief reminds you of Danny Withnail's reseller and myself, with his scientific approach and his scientific commitment to drugs. This is an excellent film, especially for those who have already consumed psychoactive substances in the past and who will tell many moments in the film. The brilliant scene of the Welsh convenience store, who likes to buy cravings while walking in mushrooms, is one of my favorites. This sweet comedy will warm the hulls of your heart and make you laugh out loud. And you do not need to ride a bike or even love them to enjoy. But it will add if you do it. Brilliant.
