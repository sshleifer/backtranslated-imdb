We start all our exams with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 films a year over the past 15 years. Recently, we had the honor of receiving free lifetime movie passes for all movies, anytime! So, we can see what we want when we want it. The key point is that CRITICS counts for ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are really no different from you or me. The only difference is that they write about the film and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they like it or not. Therefore, we are convinced that, if you remove for two hours of entertainment, you will have us! We never listen to or read the reviews. We only care about our friends and those we know love the same things as us. Enough of that. <br /> <br /> This film is very good. not only good but very good. Critics are a bunch of morons. Just because there is nudity and language, they hated him. It was worth the price of the ticket and that's all you can ask for. Is not it true? All films can not be nominated at academies. Sharon Stone is beautiful and does a great job in the movie. It mystifies me as to what critics want.
