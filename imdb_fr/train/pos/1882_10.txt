<br /> <br /> What can I say? It's one of the most perfect movies ever made. It's a return to glitzy, romantic romantic comedies from the 1940s. But with a modern twist. The screenplay is full of wit, charm, humor and tenderness, cinematography is breathtaking (NYC has never been so beautiful), and of course the cast! Dudley Moore turns in the performance of his career as a Loveable, drunk Arthur Bach. He is also full of nostalgia and realism. One of the best words of the film is his poignant "Not everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets." The great Sir John Gielgud won a well-deserved Oscar for his magnificent performance as Hobson, the valet and concierge of Arthur. Even if he saw it as a "decisive role", he brings to the character all the talent, experience and bravery of a devious tragic and comedian expert. The support troop is also out of this world, from Geraldine Fitzgerald's impressive grandmother Bach to Stephen Elliott's monstrous mobster. <br /> <br /> The score is also extremely memorable and perfectly complements the film.The only real problem of the unfortunate film following it has spawned.
