It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments about this celebrity movie. I laughed through the whole picture, as did my whole family. The film was clearly defined as an old gangster comedy - the players were hysterical - I bet they had a good time doing it. Of course, Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great - and what about these Everly sisters, each of the two Falco and the divine music all along. Rob Reiner is an excellent limousine driver who laughs and Gabriel Byrne, a laughable neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the character of Sleepy Joe and all references to the morgue and gravedigger. Paul Anka was his usual entertainment, with the added attraction of chasing fear after Byrne decided to duet his "My Way", which will welcome Vick home. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a comic tribute to Frank Sinatra and his friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I am also of the opinion that no one of any age would even think of imitating the actions that happened in this film - it's a joke - not a terrifying "gangsta" movie. The cars and clothes were impressive, as was the "Vic's Place" decor. <br /> <br /> In truth, I consider the "Mad Dog Time" as a musical, less harmful than many cartoons, crime dramas, and talk shows. I would recommend the video for a family entertainment night.
