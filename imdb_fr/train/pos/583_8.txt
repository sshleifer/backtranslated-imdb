In a small town in Montana, two brothers are growing up. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Reverend Maclean and they grow up with his lessons on religion and fly fishing lessons. In this film, fly fishing is a bit of life. <br /> <br /> The story is good and holds your attention, although at times you need a little action. The film probably has those moments because it's not really about the events that happen, but about the message. Some things happen though. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years, he returns and engages with a pretty girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul became a journalist and is known as a "fishing reporter". He is famous and he seems to have a good life, but he drinks a little too much and plays too much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well done, it has a beautiful score and all the actors are good. The most beautiful thing in this film is cinematography. The mountains, the woods and the river are all very beautiful. If the film was only for these things, it was enough to watch it. Fortunately, there is more.
