All actors, from Sugiyama to Aoki via Toyoko, are known everyday. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly believable. The score is so moving that it made me cry. The choreography was beautiful without appearing sporty. The dance and the graceful charm of May gave me goose bumps. Tamako is such a wonderful character. You can almost see the schoolgirl charmed on her face as she remembers seeing "The King and I". The character of Aoki is both hilarious and pitiful. Masako is so natural that the lost wife, we almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a guardian.
