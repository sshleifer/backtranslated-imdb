I noticed that a lot of people are posting on "Kerching!" Council seems to hate this show, which surprises me in fact. I think it's one of the best shows for British kids. It's unfortunate that it ends because it's very funny (even if it's a bit corny) and the characters are great. The main character is a bit like Del Boy, although much smarter. With his 2 best friends, he tried to earn a million pounds for his mother by launching an online business and adopting the pseudonym "Rudeboy". His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is simple-minded and has a comic relief character). Throughout the series, some characters are gone and new characters have entered, but it has always been fun and rewarding.
