Abu, THE BAGHDAD WHEEL, helps King Ahmed return to his kingdom from a wicked wizard. <br /> <br /> As Europe went to war and important parts of the world were in flames, Sir Alexander Korda's London Films unveiled this sumptuous escape meal of the legends of the Arabian Nights. Filled with swords and witchcraft, he gave the public in 1940 a brief respite from the headlines. It is also an excellent cinematographic realization featuring a good actor and a smart scenario. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt wins and merits, playing the wicked magician Jaffar. His piercing-eyed Saturnian face is reminiscent of the gruesome roles he played with so much flavor during Silent Days. Here is a bad guy to watch. As a little thief, Sabu plays perfectly in this third film. Although not a hero in the typical sense of the term, his character is certainly heroic in deeds and actions. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast does a remarkable job. John Justin is both energetic and sensitive as an unenlightened king who needs to learn more about the realities of hard living. Sabu gets a big share of the action (when he's not turned into a dog), but Justin is athletic enough when he needs to. The charming June Duprez plays the Princess of Basra, an endangered species, coveted by two very different men. Rex Ingram, who will appear late in the film, acts as a genius with a positive attitude. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes takes full advantage of his beautiful voice as a storyteller. Miles Malleson acquires another eccentric role as a Basrah childish sultan, constantly evoking his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the film's script and dialogue). Agon Morton Selten represents the benevolent king of legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional theater actress, plays the dual role of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed Silver Dancer. <br /> <br /> The film was started in Britain, but Korda was moved to southern California because of the war, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The artistic direction, in the vibrant Technicolor, is the most attractive, especially the fairytale architecture in blues, whites and pinks. <br /> <br /> ***************** ******* <br /> <br /> Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in the stables of the Maharaja of Mysore after being discovered by the company of Korda and placed in front of the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) are his best films and he finds himself in Hollywood after their completion. After a distinguished military service during the Second World War, he resumed his film career, but he remained incessantly confined for years in ethnic roles in undiscovered minor films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) being the only major exception. His latest film, A TIGER WALKS (1964) by Walt Disney was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu died of a heart attack at the end of 1963 when he was only 39 years old.
