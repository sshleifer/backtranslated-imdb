"Heartland" is a wonderful representation of life on the border. The hard work and individual strength needed to survive the harsh climate and lack of medical care are combined with the camaraderie and interdependence of the settlers. The drama was particularly significant because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people. No one was glamorous or seemed to have spent time with the makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is simply beautiful. She is an example of the strong and persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and who left no problem opposing their new life in a new country.
