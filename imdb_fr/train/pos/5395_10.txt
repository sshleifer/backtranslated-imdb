I remember watching this movie, the thought was so interesting. I really wanted to know what happens next. I was amazed at how much they could fit into an 8-minute short film. We start in a schoolyard. . Two friends are discussing jumping class. Kid B tells Kid A "Do not go to class today." And kid A refuses, saying he might miss something really important. So boy B jumps and boy A goes to class. When he is there, the teacher informs him that today they will learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. She gives a pamphlet to everyone and when she gets to child A, she goes out and tells the boy next to him to share it. Well, the kid does not want to share, so kid A is looking for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he receives a shocking revelation about the true meaning of life. I suggest everyone to watch this short film. It will only take you 8 minutes of your life, but the message is so important that it could help you all your life.
