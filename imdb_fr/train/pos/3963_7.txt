The story of the FBI, told from Agent Stewart's point of view through flashbacks, is intimately tied to his personal story. Stewart and Miles (his wife) are very good, as is Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes any involvement difficult. It's like watching pieces of a dozen different movies while we spot a group of gangsters. Some of the episodes are too long, others too short and others are out of place (school sequence of Stewart's daughter). Overall, it lasts far too long. Nevertheless, it is worth taking a look for its beautiful production values.
