"The Bourne Ultimatum" begins recklessly mid-way and, at the speed of the shot, explodes from there, while Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely superb) tracks the brains of the black-ups of the CIA who have turned into an ideal assassin in a final attempt to learn his true identity. A frosty David Strathairn like "the man behind the curtain" is added to the list of regulars, including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (nonexistent). <br /> As the second entry in the series series, I would have liked Paul Greengrass's portable camera to become static, at least during the few minutes of idle time. However, that being said, it is an ideal way to capture the feeling of tension, claustrophobic, intimate melee combat scenes and works equally well in hunting scenes that take place primarily on foot and on rooftops with sometimes a big pile of cars. -up. One of the fun aspects of the Bourne series is the constant manipulation and transfer of technologies and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. Bourne films seem to exist in a sort of hyper-reality granular full of technological magic. It does not make sense that everyone seems to be right in the right place at the right time, but I'll be damned if it's not great to watch them happen. <br /> <br /> In the absence of Franka Potente and his emotions, the screenwriters try to create an emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but it is so narrow that it never leads to anything. Yet this can be forgiven because unlike "identity" and "supremacy", this "ultimatum" reveals everything and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's a fun and satisfying conclusion of the series, and if they have any sense, and Damon realizes his wish, it will be the perfect end.
