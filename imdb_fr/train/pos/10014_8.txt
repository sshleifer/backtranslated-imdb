The Night Listener caught my eye, with Robin Williams shining as a radio host in New York who falls in love with his friendship with a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin) who is very sick. Williams never met the boy in person, because they were only in touch when talking on the phone. However, Williams' ex-boyfriend (good job Bobby Cannavale) raises doubts about the boy, prompting Williams to arrange a meeting with him in person. The following has a permanent impact on Williams in an unexpected way. I will leave that to you. Toni Collette is also playing. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie. Toni Collette painted a memorable portrait of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also played the role of Williams's friend. Night Listener is inspired by real acts and keeps a dark and almost scary silence. Sometimes it's predictable, not thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the movie and just for the sake of logic, but it still appealed to me. I appreciate Williams in roles like this, more than his comic characters, so it was an added bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
