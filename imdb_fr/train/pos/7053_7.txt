Do not confuse "War Inc." for a chiseled satire or an ingenious comedy full of jokes for news buffs. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> It's an old ball-comedy comedy, with ridiculously fortuitous plot twists, original characters (with some details in the entertaining performances of John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a direct approach to political content. <br /> <br /> You see, the political arguments of the filmmakers are things that almost the whole country already knows to be true. Yes, we understand that the companies that profit from the war are corrupt and incompetent pigs, the political leaders in charge are even more incompetent than the buffoons, and US imperialism has never seemed so rude and so disconnected than it does now - but <br /> <br /> Here all this noise is the decor that they dull - sometimes in a great way - as a backdrop for a crazy boil, like John's character Cusack (the -man with a heart) tries to change his life with the help of the good journalist who does not trust him (Tomei) and the young starlet of the Middle East who wants to cancel his marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays her assistant with an almost caricatural enthusiasm. Ben Kingsley seemed lost in his role as a ruthless little CIA boss. <br /> <br /> That's all, and it works. It's simple, but if you can not see the reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved is doing a good job, there's no corruption and people Middle East wish our Western culture preaches theirs, so you may not find it so funny. <br /> <br /> For all of us, it was a light comedy of a political nature.
