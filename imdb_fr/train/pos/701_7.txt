I did not know what to do except then I think it was much better not to have been an exception. Do not get me wrong, it's not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and screenwriter, so I think she deserves a lot of congratulations for making this film. You can say that it was an act of love for her. The cast of actors (apart from Dominic) is a bit cheesy and the quality of the film is not great either, but for a low-budget movie, that's fine. There have been times when the script is convoluted and there are parties hanging around, but I do not think it greatly affects the ability to understand the film. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I beg you to deprive yourself of it. The gag was fun, I will not spoil it, but there is a particular scene that makes buying the DVD worth it, so you can watch it again and again. If you like the movie, take a look at The Pink Mirror, a movie also directed by Jagged Edge. I know that Dominic fans will enjoy this little piece of paradise.
