If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without having to sing with a song every twelve minutes - then this is the Disney movie for you! My sons loved every minute of this movie and I must admit that I laughed a lot all the time. There are no sappy songs that can stand in the way of a wonderfully told story, and the characters are all adorable and identifiable. This should be part of Disney's "classics" because of its beautifully illustrated landscapes and uninterrupted enthusiasm!
