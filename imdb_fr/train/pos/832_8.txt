It is interesting to note how Brosnan's performance is much more realistic than the original James Bond novels compared to bond films. He is neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic and womanizer. It's a perfect break for him, even to the point of making fun of the link icon. "I'm a mess, a parody of myself," he says. It's not better than that. I just finished reading Dr.No and that's about what Ian Fleming had described James Bond. Personally, I never liked Brosnan as Bond because he was too close to the icon. He had nothing to personalize with the character, unlike Roger Moore or Sean Connery. Its pleasure to see Brosnan play a character at once steeped in reality and flamboyant against the wall. A shallow character trying to understand himself about deeper emotional and psychological issues that he has no background knowledge of. It's an impressive performance, and having Kinear to put it to the ground is only poetic. This film reminds me a little of the dynamic established between the main characters of "My Blue Heaven", but more authentic in their adaptation mechanisms.
