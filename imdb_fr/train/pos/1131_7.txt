It's a really fun movie. One of those on which you can sit and watch without thinking as the plot gets more and more twisted; more and more funny. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (in his honor), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... These are all known and quality actors who play the role of stars / producers of television series. If you've ever watched a soap opera and thought, "How on earth did they get that idea?", You'll love this movie. I have seen it many times; and every time I look at it, the more I appreciate the humor, the more I realize how well it is played. Do not expect the quality of an Oscar. It's a fun movie to entertain, not an artistic attempt to find "the inner man of man", etc. Sit down, relax and laugh.
