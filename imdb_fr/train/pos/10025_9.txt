It must be a unique twist of two kinds of never seen. The kind of giant monster movie with the kind of living mummy movie. This unique blend makes it a unique and compelling story. The actors are remarkable, including TOM BOSLEY who, as far as I know, has never participated in a horror movie before. The effects are impressive and the idea of ​​a giant mummy filled with little mummies is cool. My only complaint, I just wish we could see more of the giant mummy, but other than that, I think they did a great job. The dialogue, the characters and the story were perfect. The acting was wonderful. It must be the best movie to come out of the science fiction channel. You heard me, the best movie in the science fiction channel. I give FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10.
