First of all, I would like to make a correction to another criticism of this film that said that the last musical to win the prize for the best academic film was "Gigi" in 1958. This is false information because "West Side Story "was won in 1962," My Fair Lady "won in 1965 and" Sound of Music "the following year. That said, this movie is absolutely fantastic! The story of the novel has been somewhat modified, but it's more because of the limitations they had on a scene that they did not change for a filmed version. However, that does not bother me. In fact, I think that all production flows better than the novel. I like Nancy to bring Oliver to the bridge with her and be killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie are the ones that make me laugh. I like when Mr. Bumble and Ms. Bumble start out of the governor's office early. The underlining for this moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger of any version of the movie, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin (this character is much better designed than in the book), and Shani Wallis, who is the strongest and most distressed version of Nancy. The only reason I give this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers that are "Concide yourself" and "Who will buy". I always hate when the choreography in musicals is supposed to look like people doing everyday chores. It sounds awful and corny, especially when they dance at the London Meat Co. They should have done a regular choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.
