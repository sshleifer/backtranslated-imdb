I just finished watching this movie and I must say I was so impressed. Everything was superb. The characters game, the story. A credible child who has become brave, always ready to help others. His mother must be proud. I could not leave this movie with my eyes, for fear of missing something. This is the fable / tale of the prefect with morality, cute and scary elves and "monsters" but nevertheless comforting people. A child stung and bullied at school who becomes a hero. Chosen to be a rider at the local village festival and a trip to Goblin Mountain where he discovers the Yokai, which are amazing creations that Brian Froud would be proud of. And the evil Kato and his opponent who definitely needed a hug. These evil people capture the Yokai and throw them into a red pit with unwanted objects, such as motorcycles and other mechanical objects, that melt into a horribly violent robotic monster whose only job is to kill. Takashi, a young boy, is the one who will become their savior, alongside a red / dragon man, a turtle and a River Princess, as well as a cute little creature who, if it had been America, could have turned it into a stuffed animal and sold it at all good toy stores. The lines are good, especially the Do not try this at home, kids and other jewels that make you smile. Suspend the belief and look at it with a child or alone and enjoy! Although I have to admit that the end was a little sad. And not necessarily. Long live Furdion
