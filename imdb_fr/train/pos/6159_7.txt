This place in England in 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). She does not want them but reluctantly accepts them. She seems to be studying to become a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft. (OK - I realize it's a family movie but - College of Witchcraft ??? Come on !!) Before you can finish the course while the college is closed because of the war (???) and that she is looking for the head of Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And she and the kids move on a bed using a magic bed button. <br /> <br /> That's what I saw for the first time at the age of 9. It certainly does not fit like an adult! The story is stupid (even for a fantasy), children are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly obnoxious. Also Roddy McDowall is third bill and only appears in two short scenes! There is also a trip to Naboombu Island which is run by animated animals. I thought it might be fun, but the animation is mediocre (for Disney) and there is a very violent football game and way too long between the animals. There are some saving graces here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just great; the songs (while being forgettable) are pleasant; The long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy and the special effects awarded at the Oscars are still impressive in the end. But the line of weak history, the mediocre animation and the inimitable children really lower this one. I heard the extended version is even worse! I can only give a 7.
