JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who started working for the agency before being called FBI. These include the Ku Klux Klan, Prohibition Era gangsters, German and Japanese spies of the Second World War, etc. years of history; far superior to all movies made these days. <br /> <br /> Of particular interest to older viewers familiar with Washington, DC. In a scene from the movie about 20 minutes --- where James Stewart tells Vera Miles that she is expecting her first child --- the scene was shot in the Herzog seafood restaurant located in the former waterfront of Washington, the only movie in which slot appears. Shortly after assuming office, President Kennedy ruled that southwestern Washington, an area 99% black, was a horror and needed to be demolished. By decree worthy of its unchallenged kingship, the entire region, including the popular waterside restaurant district, with the exception of 3 historic churches; was reduced to rubble. Black residents evicted from their homes were rehoused as best they could and without the help of the federal government; in the same way, the companies simply ceased their activities, little relocating. Restaurant Row was turned into a sidewalk and Washington had no waterfront (restaurants, seafood kiosks, boats, etc.) for about 10 years. As a resident for life, the Herzog restaurant scene was our number one reason to revisit this beautiful movie.
