There are other reviews here, so I do not need to say how awesome or what it is ... My problem is: I heard about this movie ago very long before it is broadcast. I do not even remember how, I just know it was on the internet. Distributors went bankrupt before it hits! For months I had a moped and complained. Please note that on this page there is a link to buy this movie and that the only highlighted area is VHS on Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Babelfish from Alta Vista to translate. I know it's in PAL format and they changed the text on the screen in German and there is a little bit of narration at the beginning which was also nicknamed in German, but also hilarious and camp that this movie is it just makes it more fun! If you want to see this movie and you have a place nearby that does conversions, it's worth it! It took about twenty dollars to come from Germany to the United States. Believe me, this may seem like a huge expense for a movie, but if you like misleading b-movies, you'll blow up your budget to get conversions for your friends!
