If you like John Candy's subtle (yes, I say subtle) actions and reactions, you can not help but love this movie (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale). The indifferent (and misinformed) observer always saw Candy as a general actor - a big jester. And sometimes he was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But, if the opportunity arose, it could be really precise and subtle enough. It's a shame that he has played in so many roles that have only shown his broad side, because we will never see more of each other. Oh, yes, the movie. One can watch "Going Berserk" again and again (I know I have) with the frequency of "Caddyshack". It's just that good. The plot, although a little complicated, is actually deep enough for a joke of this kind. This allows Candy and Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy, still underestimated, to bounce off Candy ... and they bounce HARD. Well worth a look for anyone who liked SCTV or Candy's other work.
