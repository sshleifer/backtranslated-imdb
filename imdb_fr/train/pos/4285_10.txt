This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian theater and film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. And yet, his appearance as a drama turned into a feature film does not detract from its value. A masterpiece not to be missed (preferably with subtitles and not doubled). <br /> <br /> In an old bus en route to the capital Belgrade, an imminent war decides the behavior of the passengers. Two gypsy musicians sing their miserable lives but also foresee a tragedy to come; their songs divide and connect the scenes in this extraordinary road movie (the Kostic brothers of real life are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic, a farmer who traced the road, gives a real performance). <br /> <br /> The spectrum of the characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war, an overview of the collective personality of the nation: everyone is aware that the war is about to begin but try to live life as best as possible, hoping that ignorance can stop the tragedy. The director Slobodan Sijan uses a simple film language to paint a picture of society torn apart by the previous war (World War I), but it also highlights personal portraits: the singer's provincialism, the inexperience of the newlyweds, the seriousness of the veteran of the Great War en route to visit his recently enlisted son and the dark predictions of a man who appears to be a German spy. <br /> <br /> Brilliant in his narration, with a memorable soundtrack (including the songs of Gispsy) and an adapted atmosphere, thus photographed and edited, this feature film (the first feature film by Sijan) is not as an introduction to a series of film-bitter comedies by the director that will define the Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od id ida", and "Davitelj protiv davitelja" preferred by my other director).
