I am a little in conflict about this. The series is horrible, the acting is awful (even when we have actors such as Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in an episode), the dialogue is stupid and the premise / morality of each episode looks like something pulled of a film. Educational cinema of the 50s. It is out of the question that you are frightened for a moment of these episodes. Robert Englund's cameos are short, useless and old-fashioned, in a kind of Bob Saget on the kind of funniest home videos in America. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's one of the funniest things ever on TV. The fashion of the 80s, the soft focus makes that the actors look like their roles on the set of The View at any time, the premises lend more the material to the auto-parody than to the fright, we find ourselves so with an episode where a high school student is afraid that if he fails his SAT, his girlfriend will throw him and his parents will deny him, another fears being locked up in prison because she is an unsatisfactory mother (her husband is interpreted by Brad Pit), another fears that all parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home, another fears not to be confused with his social disabled twin, another fears not to break up with his mother and stepfather killed to have a party at home. The list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Since these are dreams, I guess you could look beyond the ridiculous landmarks and devices, but they are so out of the left field that it's impossible for the writers to actually scare the public. You have characters dressed as a nightmare-inspired spell of the '80s, wandering in a perverse dialogue and making illogical decisions that serve no purpose other than moving the story to the next point of strange plot (in general, as a peripheral character What is unusual for a sensible person while our main character is stunned and too shocked to do anything about it). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something that will scare you, stay away. If you are looking for, however, one of the funniest things of the 80s. Look at it. <br /> <br /> It was recently aired on Chiller TV (just about every day) and I'm looking at it earlier, out of morbid curiosity, and now, just to be able to laugh every day. With Arrested Development and Extras off the air, this is officially the funniest thing on TV.
