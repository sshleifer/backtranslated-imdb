I finally had the wish to see this one in a cinema. I had seen Fritz Lang's video on video a few years ago. I was hoping that the ideal screening conditions would make their magic. <br /> <br /> The conditions were ideal at the Cinémathèque Ontario. Pristine full print. Intertitles in German of original Gothic script with simultaneous translation in English, precise without being too literal. Accompaniment to the piano live. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the film dissipated for a little while but finally failed to capture, at least for me. <br /> <br /> This film has no real connection to the Wagner Ring cycle, as I have done before. knew but some can not. Wagner had adapted the 13th century. Niebelungen is bound to its own ends. Part I of Fritz Lang's epic - "Siegfried" - has many elements familiar to Wagner's listeners. <br /> <br /> "The Revenge of Kriemhild" is the story of Siegfried's wife, Kriemhild, his marriage to King Etzel (Attila) Hun and his desire for revenge against Hagen and Gunther, the Nibelungs renamed, for the murder of Siegfried. The spectacular conflagration in this film has probably evolved and developed into the Wagnerian myth to become its Götterdämmerung, its Twilight of the Gods and the end of Valhalla. This film remains terrestrial. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is spectacular. Massive ensembles rival those of "Cabiria" (1914), which inspired Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916). Their decoration sets a new benchmark for barbaric splendor. There is a huge group of Huns and Art Deco Burgundians scarred and scabby. And battles. Battles that never seem to end. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful in his revenge plan. She manages to destroy everything around her. His loyalty to Siegfried, his martyrdom, does not seem to stem from love or devotion as much as from anything closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth exclaimed, "Leave me here." She knew she was not emotionally prepared for what she had to do. But Kriemhild displays no normal human emotion, and nothing is comparable to the female principle. She is already "top full of the cruelest cruelty", to use Shakespeare's expression, from the beginning. Margarethe Schön and her director convey this with a glimmer. I do not want to exaggerate, but this glow is practically the only expression that has ever "animated" Kriemhild's face. It's the ultimate in performance of a note. This is clearly an intention, however, not just a case of bad action. <br /> <br /> The proposed offer is then a one-dimensional sketch of a revenge fury. Some might consider Kriemhild as an empowered heroine. I just saw the film as misogynist.
