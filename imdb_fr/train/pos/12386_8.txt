'' The Sentinel '' is one of the best horror movies ever made in the film industry! I think it's very scary because very few movies really are. Alison Parker is a model with some fame. She attends a lawyer, Michael Lerman, and has for best friend, another model, Jennifer. Everything was fine in her life, until she decided to live alone for a while and rented a beautiful old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is his neighbors, who are VERY strange. Suddenly, Alison begins to have health problems and faints frequently. She also remembers painful facts about her past that cause her to have nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason, and this has to do with the new house she lives ... <br /> <br /> Personally, I find "The Sentinel" a very scary movie, and with "The Exorcist". "These are two of the scariest films I have ever seen. When we discover that Alison's house is solely occupied by the priest and herself, my blood froze! It's also horrible to see that she has to become blind at the end of the film to become the new sentinel who keeps monsters out of our world.
