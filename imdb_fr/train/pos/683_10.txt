I like ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that can not be explained. Now I have seen a lot. As efx special has more and more control over today's movies, sometimes to find a real gem, we have to go back in time when writers and directors really had to use their heads to create real ghost stories. Now, this very rare pilot episode of the Ghost Story television series "The New House" was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It was once in 1972, ... I was only 9 years old ... but nothing since, even compared to that. With all the remake going on in Hollywood, someone should do this one "as is" without efx more special than the original. This episode was terribly scary. I am lucky to finally find it on DVD today and very rare and hard to find. The only other 2 ghost stories to come closer are ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in "The Changling". I wish someone could make more ghost stories like this.
