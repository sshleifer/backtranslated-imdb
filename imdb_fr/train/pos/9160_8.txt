In all the comments praising or condemning Dalton's performance, I thought it was excellent. He does not play Rochester like a rather rich and spoiled boy, but like a mischievous and powerful man. I liked this version, although the filming on the video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with Jane and St. John were never perfectly gelled. I give this an 8.
