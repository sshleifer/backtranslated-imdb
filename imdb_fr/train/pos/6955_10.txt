My Super X-Girlfriend is a hell of a roller coaster. The special effects were excellent and the costumes worn by Uma Thurman were hubba buba. Uma Thurman is an underrated comedy actress, but she proved the opposite to everyone and played her role as crazy girlfriend. She was simply FABULOUS !!! Luke Wilson was as good as the average Joe, but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. The support troupe was also superb, especially Anna Faris who was extremely good (much better than in the Scary Movie franchise). <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman directed this film very well, because if it were not for him and Uma Thurman, this film would not have been so successful. This film is clearly a 10/10 for its casting (Uma Thurman), its director, its scenario and its original scenario. This film is very strongly recommended.
