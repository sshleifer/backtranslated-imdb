This film, later popular at the time, but loved by fans, has become a classic. Mixing so-called "surrealist" footage shot at John Lennon's and others with live footage from Marc Bolan & T.Rex at their best, this movie is not only a must-see for anyone who loved Marc Bolan, but gives a fascinating insight of the time. . <br /> <br /> It was at this time that Marc was dating Ringo Starr of the Beatles [who did it] and you could even find a brief view of Reg Dwight [Elton John] the ivories in an incredible version [and never officially published] of Tutti Frutti and Rocking Versions and Ballads of Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also wonderful scenes starring Chelita Secunda [would have created glam rock] with its use of glitter, etc.], Mickey Finn and even the Catweazle actor !! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the garden when Marc leaves the dining table, sits cross-legged in front of a string section and knocks out acoustic versions of classics such as Get It On and The slider. <br /> <br /> Highly, highly recommended !! FIVE stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
