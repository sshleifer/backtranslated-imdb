First listen: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> Scenario, comic actor and timing very impressive in this film. Today, 40 years old, he has lost none of his power. Neil Simon provides an excellent overview of human nature and its relationships, as well as methods to create a real comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give excellent comic performances. Neil Simon is inspired by real events in his life to write the play on which this film is based. <br /> <br /> One of the best Hollywood comedies written and performed of all time! <br /> <br /> Amazingly, only nominated for 2 Oscars: "Best Adapted Screenplay" and "Best Editing". Hollywood rarely awards comedies, regardless of their quality.
