This document really opened my eyes to what non-Americans thought of the 9/11 attacks. This film was skilfully staged and presents this disaster as more than an attack on American soil. The consequences of this disaster are announced by many countries and perspectives. I think this film should be more widely distributed on this point. It also helps in the healing process to finally see something other than reporting on terrorist attacks. And some pieces are really funny, but not abusively. This film is highly recommended and I convey the same feeling.
