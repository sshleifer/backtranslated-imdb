Surprisingly, not so good and well animated for one of the Disney suites directly to the video throw. As in the previous sequel (The Lion King 2), I was delighted that Disney brought back most of the original dubbers, which makes all the difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation. The plot strolls for a moment, but we are distracted by a series of endless jokes ranging from hilarious to boring. To break the intrigue and isolated jokes, they presented us with stupid music sequences, which, like jokes, range from entertaining to a little trick in the fridge. For the most part, the MST3K-like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and do not add much to the movie except serve as a vehicle for a one-hour flashback. The new characters are at least nice, and the old characters are doing their work, so I can not blame them. Overall, this film is not bad and it is a nice frivolous load between the most serious titles of the Lion King.
