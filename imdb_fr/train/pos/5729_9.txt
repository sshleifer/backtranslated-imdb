It's a bit of a puzzle for many of Lynch's art crowd. They tend to try to write this as a kind of side project and Lynch's meaningless. As if it is Lynch who lets gas go between his true works of cinematographic art. Well, maybe it's a fart, but it's one of those intriguing farts that you seem to feel and that you're embarrassed to admit you appreciate. <br /> <br /> Dumbland is beyond this art. What can you do with aspects of modern life without laughing at it? If you took it seriously, you would go crazy. You hang it, smell it, taste it, feel its agony, its irrational stupidities, then express it in the medium of your choice. It's called art, and art is not stupid. But it's Dumbland.
