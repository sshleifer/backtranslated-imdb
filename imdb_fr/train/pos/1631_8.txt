This film has everything. Visible gags, subtle jokes, puns and worms. It is a group of boys of different ethnic and social classes who come together to defeat a common enemy. If you look at this more than once, you will see that you quote it as Animal House (and yes I also like Animal House). I put in the top 15 funniest movies. The major of a boys' military academy is paranoid that every child is bad and wants to cause trouble (in this movie he is right). He is sadistic, indifferent, cruel and must be eliminated. The group of boys who do not get along at the beginning ends up teaming up to survive and get rid of the Major with a wacky plan that only Mad Magazine could write. A must see - you will love it!
