Kay Pollack (the man behind this film) is a great man who tries to share his philosophy of life in different ways. He has written a bunch of good and well-written books on how to control your senses and keep your soul happy. The message in most of his books and this film is that your thoughts are actually what's causing your problems and that the reason for your anger is rarely caused by what you think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy but almost never do it. <br /> <br /> To watch this film and learn something very important for life, you have to keep your mind very open and LISTEN to all the "hidden messages" (or directions to get through life) that most parts of this movie contain if you listen and watch. Look at it with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn to live and make the most of it ... <br /> <br /> So while watching, keep the spirit: <br /> <br /> "The spirit is like a parachute, it does not work if it is not open!"
