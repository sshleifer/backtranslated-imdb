Emma is a real romance. If you like fluffy stuff, loaded with spirit and madness, you'll love this movie! This is true for the novel, which is very important, with some twists added for fun. Gwen is not one of my favorite actresses, but she does justice to a role that required everything she had to offer. She shines in a role I think no other actress could have done justice to. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, as a hero. you're shocked I've never considered it openly beautiful, but damn it! What the right role can do for you! He looks so good that the sensitive M. K, treat, that I literally look at him in a new light. He makes an excellent romantic advance. The charm and character he brings to his role are wonderful! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings the rest. a good casting. A good film. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie, with pride and prejudice - and most importantly, buy the books. It improves the film to extraordinary heights
