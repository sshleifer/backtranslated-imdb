A remarkable documentary, vividly depicting a country deeply divided in itself (for more evidence, check out some of the comments on IMDb ...!). Compares extremely favorably to Oliver Stone's "Comandante" (which consists mainly of a thorough examination of the nostrils of Fidel Castro's nostril). I do not know if Chavez is all that he presents, or another in the long line of Latin American populist "caudillos". I do not know whether he will be able to meet the enormous expectations he has clearly established among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It is hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but I certainly now have a pretty lively idea of ​​what is at stake and the impression to be in the middle of a sudden. Someone says in the movie "we make history", and that's exactly what the film feels like capturing. Exceptional things.
