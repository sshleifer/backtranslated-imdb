What can I say, I grew up watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun, and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj has always been different. Movies are part of our lives in an age of evolution, Soraj creates something that is hard to find. Love and common family who loves and great. Vivah is a trip for a couple who wants to get married and who likes to get married. Shahid did a good job. Anupamji as always brilliant. Amrita Rao resigned differently even though I had the impression that the other did not suit her. We saw it in Ishk Vishk, Ab ke Baras and Main ho on Na. So leave different roles that she is not associated with. She is excellent in Main ho on Na and ishk vishk, but she might have been able to put a little more into the role. Anyway, excellent work from Barjatya. This film rejuvenates the values ​​we have forgotten. Sweet movie of the year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure it's a remake, but anyway a brilliant and original story. Soraj's films have been brilliant from the beginning, so we always expect something different from him. Excellent work from the team and everyone. Beautiful family film to enjoy with your parents, your brothers and sisters, your friends and your loved ones. I give him 10 out of 10.
