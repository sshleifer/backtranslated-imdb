"9/11", hosted by Robert DeNiro, presents images of the exterior and interior of the Twin Towers in New York, September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Never too terrifying and bloody, but powerful and moving. "9/11" is a real treat. People who are not moved by this TV show are safe from nothing. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
