this film is absolutely hilarious. Basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer turned into a snowman after a chemical accident in the movie B. He then heads to the city and begins to terrorize the inhabitants. It's up to the local police chief and other characters to try to stop him. It's done on a small budget and it shows, but the big advantage of this film is that it knows its garbage. Styrofoam and polystyrene imitations of the giant snowman are classic, and this is the intention: it is one of the few films whose budget is the main selling point. In addition to the comic side, there are other great moments of comedy - listen from the start the voice of a scary father his children, and the funniest rape scene ever engaged in a film. fantastic shit
