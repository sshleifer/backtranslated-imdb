I watched FIDO on a movie channel and I must say that I became an instant fan. The film is like a comic that perfectly captures the surrealist aspect of the 1950s. You know the busy decade in which they danced for Elvis while dropping nuclear bombs into the desert. People were so na√Øve at the time that it was scary and the idea that these pure people would find normal to have zombies as pets really works here. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to this Canadian production, colorful cinematography and excellent distribution, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the kid. <br /> <br /> Too bad, this movie was not as popular. It deserved more recognition. It's a lot better than the material of Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team. Never mind. It's an instant classic nonetheless.
