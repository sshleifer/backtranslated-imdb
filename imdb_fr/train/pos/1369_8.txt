I loved this film and I am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it, it seems. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? These kinds of movies are never. But strangely, there is a message. It's that we all have the potential to be what we want to be. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is awesome in this film. I always thought she looked a lot like Katharine Hepburn. So it's nice to see that Hepburn and Posey both directed librarian films (Hepburn's is The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a score of 8. This is not an excellent film from a cinematographic point of view, although there are beautiful shots in it . But it's incredibly charming and fun.
