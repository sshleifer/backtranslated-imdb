In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to escape from a POW camp by using a gymnastics horse in the yard. In 1950, it was decided to film his story, which kicked off a particular genre of British film, the story of the military prison camp that reached its peak in Danger Within (1959). <br /> <br /> The wooden horse is one of the quietest movies I have ever watched. There are no big dramatic moments, but a regular scenario ends up creating a tighter climax, because the story does not leave room for an unlikely drama, sudden jumps or music torn off (or almost!) . <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a cast of curiously discreet extras and (I suspect) non-actors. All, without exception, are constantly mono-tonal and silent. They keep the emotion of their roles. As many of them, until recently, are former officers, I suppose they have reconstituted their roles as "officers and gentlemen" in the time of the war. <br /> <br /> This unemotional approach takes nothing away from dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most War Escape movies, the story does not end with barbed wire: it is this fact alone that keeps me stuck at the end.
