It's a classic film in its history, acting and presentation. Wonderful actors are filled throughout the film, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart being the main characters. In real life, she admired a lot and loved Jimmy. She actually gave him his first acting roles and helped him to be calmer with his appearance on the set. The "chemistry" between the two was always apparent, and so warm and pleasant to see. She was such a beautiful young woman and so sweet in her portraits. The story of these two young people and the way they meet at the end is charming to watch and is pure magical entertainment. Heartwarming presentations are also given by the other actors in this wonderful film / story. I give my heart to Miss Sullivan with a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, which appeals to all generations. A must for everyone!
