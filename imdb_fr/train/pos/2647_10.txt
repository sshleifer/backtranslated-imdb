This film can be interpreted on several levels. Do not listen to other comments criticizing the film and saying that it is a story or a story played and that it is all about drugs. He has very clear superficial metaphors about drugs; However, the rest of the movie (and why I think it was done personally) is really not about it at all. It's really mocking the psychology and conditioning of society. This shows, for a fraction of a second, that the main character's brother is watching these sick videos online. Why? My interpretation is that it is to show that all this macabre we are exposed to allows us to be more mechanical in our professions instead of seeing people as people. In terms of logic, it is also intended for people in the federally mandated 1% smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems at the level of macroscopic. You must apply Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (as well as all other laws and principles of uncertainty) not only to physics, but also to life and leave space to modify your plans and adjust yourself along the way. One of the best movies I have ever seen. It could go way above your head; it's not for you but for those who have trouble living, who do not work as a math problem. When critically analyzing a movie or writing your review, try not to read the back first (written by marketers and parapsychologists).
