Walt Disney's "The Rookie" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league piccher who made one of the most incredible returns in the history of the sport, ending almost 10 years of retirement and making his Major League debut in 1999 at the age of 35. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief summary of Morris's childhood, which includes a series of mutations - his father is a military . And even when his family finally settled in Texas football, Morris's passion for baseball remained strong. <br /> <br /> The childhood segment then turns to about 23 years of adulthood, Morris (played by Dennis Quaid), now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School ( in reality, it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). It is mentioned that he tried a career as a baseball player but that it did not work. <br /> <br /> Morris's team struggles to do that and he teaches her to give up her dreams. They turn the table to him saying he should try for a Major League team. On several occasions, when he launches the practice, they express their wonder at the speed with which he throws. Morris does not seem convinced but accepts an agreement with his players in which if they win a district, he will try to play for a Major League team. <br /> <br /> Big Lake wins a district and, staying at the end of his contract, Morris attends a Tampa Bay Devil Rays test. Phenomenally, he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than during his career in the minor leagues and at an exceptional speed, even for a thrower of the Major League. After another try with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays. <br /> <br /> This leaves him with a difficult decision: to stay in his comfortable life or once again to pursue his dream in Major League through the minor league tries to earn little money and spend months at home away from home. And the decision is even more painful than during his first stint in the Minor League because he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris signs with the Devil Rays, starts at AA level and quickly rises to AAA Level, a level lower than Major League Baseball. But as the season ends, his chances of being "remembered" are becoming increasingly slim. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I like this movie. There are a lot of great performances and nice characters, and it's easy to find yourself very entertaining for Morris. In addition, the film does an excellent job in describing professional baseball at the major and minor league levels. And most importantly, it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve. <br /> <br /> Yet the film has some flaws. Although generally accurate, it exaggerates and even makes some things. See http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Moreover, with the exception of a scene in which he prays with his players, the film completely ignores Morris's Christian faith. But considering the zeal of the left wing of Disney, it is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Presumably, many exaggerations / fabrications have been made to make the story more dramatic. Yet the 20-minute documentary on Morris that is included on the DVD contains information that makes his story more dramatic but are excluded from the film. <br /> <br /> For example, from the birth to the final installation of his family in Texas When he was 12, Morris moved 14 times. And his initial career in the minor leagues ended after four surgeries in which he lost half of his left shoulder muscle, making his throw even more inexplicable at 98 mph. <br /> <br /> Fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it is good not only to watch "The Rookie" but also to watch the documentary of the DVD, to consult the aforementioned link leading to inaccuracies of the film and probably also to read the biography of Morris, also entitled "The Rookie". I did not read the book but I hope one of these days. <br /> <br /> But overall, "The Rookie" is a very good portrait of a miraculous story and is a powerful testimony to the power of the dream and the triumph of the common man. 8/10
