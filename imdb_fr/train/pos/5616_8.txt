What can be said, really ... "The Tenant" is a first-class thriller, mixed with suspense and complete paranoia. It's a complicated movie - every detail seems to have been included for a reason - even if the plot is meaningless, and much of it is never even objectively treated. Trelkovsky (Polanski), a gentle Pole who got an apartment because of the previous tenant's suicide, leaves us more and more unstable to guide us into a world of increasing fear and uncertainty. After a party organized by a group of odious work colleagues, Trelkovsky is subjected to a scrutiny, apparently inexplicable, by the other occupants of his building. the rest of the film tells of his mental deterioration and gives us a deep state of mind comparable to David Lynch's later efforts. "The Tenant", however, is darker and more sinister, impressed by an unexpected comic relief, good performances and a truly mesmerizing score. It's a movie that has more experience than what was described, so presto.
