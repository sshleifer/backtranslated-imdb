"Panic in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but it disappointed me a bit. The central theme of a city plagued by the plague in our time is fascinating, but the film does not explore or really develop it. It's well done and fun, but it's not as interesting as it should have been. The scenario of this one is really weak and reduces the whole film. None of the central characters is really convincing or credible. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film is very well done and it compensates for the weakness of the scripts. The staging of Elia Kazan keeps the film in suspense and advances at a fast pace. There are some remarkable sequences, especially the memorable hunting highlight. Several years later, when his scenario was associated with better scenarios, the man could not generally be wrong. <br /> <br /> The acting game is also very good. Richard Widmark has always been an important man to watch and do what he can with a character. Paul Douglas spends his time shouting a bit too much but is also doing a decent job. The extras in the cast are the two bad guys. Zero Mostel, best known for his comic roles, is actually one of the movie's toad characters. Jack Palance is, unsurprisingly, a paralyzing villain. "Panic in the Streets" is disappointing but still deserves to be observed. (7/10)
