For Romance's sake, as a married man. The following two films are recommended. <br /> <br /> 1. Short meeting of David Lean (1945), United Kingdom <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to a station, something may happen. And it happened! She was so eager to be there, in a small tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married ... the man was alien to the fantasy woman <br /> <br /> 2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun of Fei Mu (1948), China <br /> <br /> A woman surrenders at the market to buy fish, groceries and medicines, passing through the ruins of an old wall in a small town, there is a lot to think about, the melancholy of her life, her sick husband pitying and with no future ... Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened ... the doctor was a honey high school woman fantasy <br /> <br /> In both films, great British directors and Chinese, the passion against the stress was so intense that the intimate feelings had finally not evolved into physical contact. This leaves you with a good aftertaste, sniffing it intensely without biting it.
