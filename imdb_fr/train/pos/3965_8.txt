The film as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as a Hardesty Chip, with very successful co-stars from Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, has been constantly monitored and approved, as well as every aspect of the film, including clothing. It was closely monitored and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that J. Edgar Hoover had anything to be proud of. His management of the office from 1924 to his death was one of the best investigative services in the world. But as early as 1959, Hoover was already beginning to fear being expelled and had already started collecting files on powerful people to secure and protect his little kingdom. And he was determined to make sure no movie would show a single wart about the desk. The film shows only continued success and overlooks the failures that have occurred and the role of the office in the witch hunt of the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with the tongue firmly in the cheek.
