I loved "Dan in real life". A wonderful love story, like You have a mail or While you sleep, but not ridiculously full of visual gags and crude jokes, and not so romantic that it makes you want to throw up. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular columnist who fails to straighten the bar. Until the day when, during a meeting or a family trip, he meets and connects instantly with Marie (the always beautiful Juliette Binoche) a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed by a vague filter reminiscent of the starlets of the classic cinema. The chemistry is about a cup of tea and a muffin, but Mary must be absent for a previous engagement, and they must separate. <br /> <br /> Later, we are greeted by Dan's friendly and supportive parents, who not only share a hearty breakfast, but also enjoy the gentle, intelligent use of Dan, dorky, in the heart of many jokes of single. What I liked the most was that, although the family's characteristics might be perceived as odious by some, I thought it was a very good portrait of a large family that did not venture by a gross exaggeration. The Burns family is just a group of close and loving people who are really interested in the best for Dan. There are wonderfully awkward family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is curious, but never mean or talkative; weird, but never weird. <br /> <br /> And then Dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend, whom he brought to the family reunion. And so begins a roller-coaster of sober nostalgia and funny budding. <br /> <br /> I could go on but I thought this movie was just great. It's not particularly "hip" or "clever", never too verbose and obsessed with dry or biting humor as many comedies are in modern cinema. There is a good balance between narration visuals and a funny but real dialogue. in fact, at the beginning of the film, the initial spark of love begins with a fanciful discussion in a classic Hollywood conversation in which the characters say what they think aloud. <br /> <br /> So I probably stumbled and rehearsed, but I strongly recommend "Dan in Real Life". It's a great appointment movie, believe me, you'll laugh, and only if you're a geek like me, you'll have tears in your eyes. Filled with fun and magical love, "Dan in real life" will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 out of 4 stars Grade: A
