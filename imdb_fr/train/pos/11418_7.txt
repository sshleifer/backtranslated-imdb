I saw this film for the first time during the International Film Studies course. I am a "non-traditional" student and, perhaps for reasons of years lived or accumulated wisdom, I enjoyed the slow and thought-out rhythm of the film's narrative. Languid with the heat and dust of an arid climate, the story is deeply psychological, filled with a multi-level symbolism and an articulated inversion of the theme of the "Other" in a country that one does not not include. the resulting understanding is loaded with unresolved memories and the subjectivity of the stranger. Directed almost 20 years ago, he is also a precursor in a genre of many other international films that explore the themes of colonies in colonized spaces, without understanding the nuances of the cultures in which they entered. Much more generously filmed - and heavily financed - works that have been made since take up the same themes: Indochina, Nowhere in Africa are two compared to those of Chocolat that may seem pale and boring. It has no adrenaline action or extreme violence. The struggles are mental, emotional and subtle. But, having said that, it's a good movie that deserves to be watched.
