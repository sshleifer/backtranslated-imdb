This is by far the biggest stand up show of all time. I've seen a lot of stand-up shows, attended a lot of stand-up shows, and watched Comic View from Bet, but I've never seen anyone who could match Murphy's skills in this program. The impressions are excellent, the sketches are excellent and the timing is perfect. You can even say that the crowd is really interested. A few years later, when he did Raw, it was also great, but it's number 1 in my book. It also shows that at one point, especially in the early to mid-1980s, Murphy was funny. What I like most about the show is when he tells the family barbecue again and "Ice cream !!! Mooommmm !! The ice cream shop is coming !!!!" Another big part is where his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
