Hurray! A space film that does not take itself too seriously and everyone can participate in the exciting tour that is the space camp. The film begins slowly, the usual mixture of idiots and frequent travelers mixing in a soup ladle. But when things get complicated, the tough guys get by and this is not an unlikely change in the characters, because you can believe that there is some responsibility in their young minds. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in The film shows that Kate Capshaw is extremely annoying as an instructor "I'm right and you're wrong". I would recommend this as a great night in the cinema and a vote 7.
