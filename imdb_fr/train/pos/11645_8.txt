I was in France, around March 5th, and I like to go to this film festival. I knew the Latin American Cinemas of Toulouse, but I've never been there. I decided to go there and I caught Cero y van 4. The film is beautiful. It had no impact on me, nor on the Mexican users, because it was subtitled in French, but it is shocking. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire of urban violence, kidnappings and crime on the street. in Mexico. It's a raw portrait of the city. From a metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a superb Mia Maestro, who was also a satire of kidnappings, almost, but with a more serious tone has, and I think so, a kind of connection with Cero y van 4. A sort of redemption story how much is it? Man on Fire, who was incredibly strong, was not a satire, but a crude portrait of the streets of Mexico. Or it's like the brave. A film that shocks and hits hard in the guts. It looks like The Usual Suspects, it has some twists, but it makes it even more believable. Verdict: A film that shocks and makes you believe that there is more security in the streets. Amazing dialogue, impressive direction and amazing performances. Cero y van 4 is a movie you will not soon forget. Leaves you trembling and stunned.
