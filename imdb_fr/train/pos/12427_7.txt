This film has a lot of raw potential. The scenario is precise, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (even if it risks losing the voice-overs), the staging and cinematography are surprisingly good, even if some experiments simply do not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. A geek-boy, always a geek-boy; and the sad and simple fact is that he is unable to play anything other than Fox Mulder. He posture, he tries to be smooth, he poses, he tries to be macho. In the end, he tries too hard. He overhangs his character, he goes beyond his lines, and he is simply dominated by all aspects by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who are each in a class above him in terms of acting talent. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There were one or two unstable moments where he dramatized his role too much, but you can tell he was having fun with it. He watched the game and became the character both physically and atmospherically. Angelina Jolie was also really good. She did not have much of a role; In fact, I thought she could have used a much more powerful model ... her character was not developed enough, although she did remarkably well with what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was obvious (damn, maybe that's why Uma left him ...) In the end, it was tough, but a solid effort on the part of a good casting and good secondary roles. If David Duchovny had not torn his role, it was much better. 7/10.
