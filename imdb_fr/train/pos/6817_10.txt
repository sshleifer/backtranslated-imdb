I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy film, about the true meaning of the family, the history of our country, the fun action in the movie. I look at the top @ about 4 times a week and I love it! I would have liked a sequel to be made to see more of Susan's father in the past and watching how Susan went with her new little sister and having no phone, computer, gameboys or anything of the 21st century . I hope everyone enjoyed the movie as much as me. I guess you could say I'm a fanatic fan and I do not mind. The little boy of Robert Lincoln Walker was just adorable. I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he has played in movies or TV shows?
