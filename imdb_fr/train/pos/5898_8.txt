Penny Princess finds the American worker Yolande Donlon the heiress of a small kingdom located in this triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland meet and are called Lampidorra. It seems that Lampidorrans owe bills all over Europe and that the main occupation of the country is contraband because of its geography. An American multimillionaire buys the place, but dies before he can win the title. His closest heir is Donlan. <br /> <br /> But of course, the estate must go through a testament in America and what must the Lampidorrans do? Especially since Donlan, who became a princess, banned smuggling. <br /> <br /> Enter Dirk Bogarde, who travels to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It looks like the Lampidorrans have some sort of cheese they call for fun at Schmeeze. With some obstacles on the road, Schmeeze solves all the financial, geopolitical and romantic problems between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /> <br /> How does Schmeeze work, well it's the gimmick of the whole movie. But here is a clue. In Lover Come Back, Jack Kruschen might have found Schmeeze's secret while he was busy inventing the VIP style for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Penny Princess is a delicious mix of British comedy romantic farce. Yolande Donlon once again plays a role that Marilyn Monroe would have played if the film had been shot on the other side of the pond. Dirk Bogarde played well the role that, at the beginning of his career, was thrilling in the heart of his heart, long before anyone suspected him of playing the actors. <br /> <br /> This film was unfortunately shown at three in the morning on TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
