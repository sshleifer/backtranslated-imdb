Full Moon High (1981) 3 out of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Kelly Roz <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is your average high school guy. Get ready for the big game back home, girlfriend problems and hair regrowth in unknown places, you know the habit. But hair in strange places becomes a little out of control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with a perverse crate of furballs. Now condemned to travel the world forever as a werewolf, how will Adam get girls? <br /> <br /> We do not often talk about "Full Moon High", but it's a funny and ridiculous horror parody. Larry Cohen (Q Winged Serpent, The Stuff) incorporates as many gags as he can possibly propose as writer / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows good timing in the lead role. If you happen to be a fan of periodontics like "Airplane" and "Student Bodies", I think you'll have fun with this festival of laughter.
