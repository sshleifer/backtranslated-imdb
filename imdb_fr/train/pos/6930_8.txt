This is a very unusual and unique little western, which was created mostly because of its story that revolves around a unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and all those who come to pose it at one time or another. of the film. <BR /> <br /> It's mostly a very entertaining movie to watch, but not without being a true western. The film was shot in the typical style of the 40s / 50s, so fans of the genre should not be shocked by its somewhat unusual main premise. <br /> <br /> Because the rifle is In fact, being the main plot device of the film, it allows the story to follow several characters throughout the film, which are all related to each other , of course, and the story ends up running full. Without that, this film would have been quite messy to watch, since the story often jumps from one haphazard opportunity to another, with ever-changing characters. It's amazing how they even managed to put Wyatt Earp in all of this. But it's not really a criticism. I liked that the film and its story were original and that the film seemed to move from one event to another. It gave the film a bit of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's also a very beautiful film. I liked the sets used by the film and it seems quite surprising that this is actually the first western director Anthony Mann. Fortunately, he will later direct westerns, which often puts James Stewart in the foreground. <br /> <br /> It was a rather daring choice to choose James Stewart as his main role. He is one of the sweetest and most polite actors, making him a leading actor. Therefore, calling it a tough gunslinger seems like a rather strange choice. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and it shows how versatile and truly capable he was as an actor. <br /> <br /> He also has some other surprising actors in the film, who are not often related to this genre. Shelley Winters plays the female lead. In addition, well-known actors, Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis, appear in small roles. <br /> <br /> A real western with a lot of action and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
