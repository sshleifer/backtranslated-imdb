Max Cindy, by Jessica Alba, and Cindy Original, by Valerie Rae Miller, shine in this action-packed and atmospheric series. Wonderfully politically incorrect. The quality varies greatly from one episode to the next, but in general the level is high and when that is not the case, Jessica is always worth considering. Valerie's African-American urban film sometimes drags Dark Angel into the territory of sitcoms.
