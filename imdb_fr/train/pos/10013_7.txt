As one of the previous commentators said, it's the bottom of a good movie, but something is happening on the way to delivery. Such a waste because Collette's performance was mysterious and Williams was credible. I just waited for it to get better. I do not think it was a bad editing or it needed another director, it could have been the film. It was a Canadian film, something like the first seasons of X-Files. Not cheap, just hokey. In addition, it needed a little more suspense. Something that makes you jump from your seat. The film reached this moment then faded; a bit like a false climax. I can see how being too suspense would have removed the "reality" of the story, but I thought that part had been reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This film must have a director montage that tries to solve these problems.
