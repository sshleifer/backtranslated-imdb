A remarkable documentary on the landmark achievements of the Women's Lawyers Association (WLA) of Kumba, southwest Cameroon, on the legal protection of the rights of women and children against acts of domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to Sharia law, one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights on women and children. After 17 years of failure, WLA leaders have recently begun to win some victories. The purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories. <br /> <br /> The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a public prosecutor and BÃ©atrice Ntuba, a high magistrate (president of the court). Both films are played in this film, which may contain spontaneously filmed images, although I suppose that a good part, if not all, consists of subsequent reproductions of real events for the camera. Four cases are examined and all complainants are also involved in the film. <br /> <br /> Two cases involve repeated abuse of a woman with forced sex in a case; another involves forced sex with a 10-year-old girl; and another is the repeated beatings of an 8-year-old child by an aunt. One of the battered women is also asking for a divorce. We follow the cases from complaint investigation to trial results. The results in each case are favorable to women and children. The guilty parties are punished with heavy prison sentences and / or fines; divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive pursuit of the swinging aunt shows that these women criminal justice officials are neutral with respect to the enforcement of the law. It is also worth noting the respect with which all parties, including those convicted, are treated. It's a very important film and well done. (It is interesting to note that Ms. Longinotto, one of the directors, also co-directed the 1998 film Divorce, Iranian Style, which dealt with related themes in Tehran.) (In broken English with subtitles in English). My rating: B + 8/10
