Woah! Is this something I can say about this movie? Personally, I am one of those who loves cats, which would have been a major disadvantage for the film, but I loved the fact that all cats have their revenge at the end. <br /> <br /> I liked it. the film, but I must admit that it was because I found Brian Krause playing Charles Brady very very irresistible, I guess the lust got the better of me while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There was one thing I was disappointed I already watched Charmed and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs. Her kissing scene was OK in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compared to her kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if it's because Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe more a little more, c was the only disappointment in the movie but I guess it was done for Brian Krause in his skinny jeans he wore in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're used to seeing Brian Krause in the role of Holly Marie Combs, Heavenly Husband and father of his son, your for a big surprise with this movie, it was nothing more that a boy angle. Although now that I think about it, it would be good to see the character of Krause on Charmed taken back by the evil making it as if his was in Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I must also say that the music was excellent in this movie. movie too!
