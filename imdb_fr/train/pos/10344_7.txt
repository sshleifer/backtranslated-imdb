Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-perform "The Amazing Mr. Williams", a mysterious comedy of 1939 quite good, although forgotten, probably because of the incredible number of films released in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job, while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed. What happens in this film is no exception: he is called to a murder scene while he is about to walk down the aisle again. <br /> <br /> The two stars were great in comedy and worked well together (and often), and help make this battle of the sexes fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are at their disposal for excellent support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas does not make a lot of women. <br /> <br /> a little on the long side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here was Melvyn Douglas, one of our biggest actors. He literally sailed effortlessly through dozens of films as another man and best friend before becoming his own in movies as an old man. He was not lazy, but rather a very hard-working actor (who made it easy) who had a career on Broadway at the same time as his film career. It was simply not chosen to play a leading role in the movies or give very difficult roles in the studio system. I challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in "Hud" and "I never sing for my father" and call him lazy or refer to his smirk.
