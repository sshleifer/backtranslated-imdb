Can hardly imagine a better movie than this <br /> <br /> Hey, before you throw all "Chick Flick" on me. I'm a very big Strong & Masculine, Macho Man, who thinks it's one of the best movies of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The acting game was superb and the story wonderful. It is a wonderful medicine for heart and soul. The acting could not have been better or the best cast of the movie. <br /> <br /> I've known for a while that Mercedes Ruehl, with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench is one of the greatest actresses of all time. And of course, Cloris Leachman (also in this film) could in my opinion overtake them all in the magnum of his talent and the varied roles in which it has appeared over the years. In any case, it was an incredible casting. This film was like a book that you can not file and when you have reached the last page, you want more ... even more. I can not for life to understand why this movie here on the IMDb rating only 3.9 <br /> <br /> This note here is quite unbelievable for me. Or maybe not. Maybe in fact I understand it very well and that's what makes me really sad. It makes me so sad that films like "American Beauty", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" are skyrocketing, while they are at least in the opinion of the viewers, while they would have at least received the notice "R" ranking ... R which is for "Waste". Hey ok, I realize that there are many different stories in this world for different audiences, but it's a sad comment when this charming, powerful film ... extraordinarily, directed, directed and written seems to be out of date. <br /> <br /> It was obviously at the Oscars too ... It's sad. And how predictable. My summary is that if you want to see a story powerful, happy, sad and beautiful? look ...... preferably own this movie ...
