I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw the secret ballot (2001). Now I know about four times more (I doubt I learned a lot of Not Without My Daughter (1991)). <br /> <br /> Offside is a splendid low-budget Iranian comedy about a group of girls working individually) to attend a decisive football match for their country's place in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to attend football matches. The country's armed forces have been mobilized to save women trying to enter on their own. Some (teenage girls?) Try to party by dressing up as boys, but get caught. The film takes place mainly in this enclosure where the girls are stopped by soldiers waiting for an unspecified punishment (although the girl disguised as a soldier declares that she was at a badge of execution!) br /> <br /> The film explores the absurdity of the situation. The thought that excludes women from football matches is tantamount to saying that it's a torrid experience for the fair sex - a philosophy that was not unknown in the West less than 100 years ago. This joke comes to mind when a girl has to go to the bathroom, so a soldier escorts her to cover her eyes so she can not see the graffiti. The conflict is not just about the battle of the sexes: at one point, there is friction between a rural soldier and urban girls. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this film was not too esoteric from the cultural point of view. the comedy was lost on this neighbor and cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You must be in the mood to do it, but no one should avoid this movie because they think they will not get it.
