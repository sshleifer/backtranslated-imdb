Belushi in her most ungrateful role and Courtney Cox in front of Friends plays a small role. I often think that Belushi is underutilized in Hollywood and this movie role is one of his best. For those of you who are watching his TV show, he's a very different and friendly character. The film itself is not overwhelming, nor the message new, but rather sweet and endearing. The support group of familiar faces and unfamiliar names is a perfect balance, though Lovitz's lamentations may become wearisome and Michael Caine's charming spiritual guide may have a slightly sinister or even well-intentioned edge. Hamilton, like Belushi's wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her. In addition, Renee Russo is wasted and unconvincing by the "queen of the ball" who escaped. Nevertheless, a good way to spend two hours.
