I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after his return. So when I saw part of this movie one evening on a pay-per-view channel, I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle had experienced and felt while he was preparing for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I must say it's the most heartbreaking movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD immediately after renting it. I have never experienced it with any other movie. As far as Vietnam films are concerned, I think it's the best, although Platoon is nearby. On top of all that, I think it's also Colin Farrell's best performance as an actor. I like him in most of his films, but in this one he was amazing. I gave it a rating of 10 because it's one of my five favorite movies.
