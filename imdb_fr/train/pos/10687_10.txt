I must admit that this film shocked me completely. On the one hand, I went to see him on a whim, expecting something mediocre, but considering that, the most shocking thing was that it was in a populist American cinema. It's British comedy at its best - dark, weird and funny in a way that American movies are never. I must not stop recommending this to everyone; I went to see him with several people, English, Europeans and Americans, and some of us liked him (mainly the first two groups), but some hated him and found him worthless. If you think you like that kind of thing, then leave. Otherwise, do not do it. 10/10.
