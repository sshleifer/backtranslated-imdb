The film may be a bit far, but if you like the show, that's what you expect. This is not a bad movie. it's actually pretty good. If you do not like the show, do not watch the movie. It may start a little slowly, but then it starts again and is quite funny. There are even some "heartbreaking" scenes towards the end. Once all the protagonists have gone through these scenes, they reach you. In addition, Jerry discovers in his opinion why his show upset people and justifies the existence of his show. He has a very good point. We care so much about the private details of celebrity life, so why is it not true that these people also tell their private lives on national television? If they were celebrities, that would not bother us at all, we would eat them. Do not we like his guests to do this just because they are poor white baskets and that reminds us that there is really poverty in this world and not just rich, glamorous movie stars living in a world where life is good?
