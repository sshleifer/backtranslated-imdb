I like this film because I grew up around harness racing. Pat Boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was attracted to trotters because, unlike thoroughbred jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, 1944's The Home in Indiana is a better film, but it's also a very different movie. April Love is light and easy to watch, it's a good movie. (Disappointing, however, that Pat Boone's religious / moral views forbid her to kiss the girl - a drastic change from the current tariff.) Home in Indiana with Walter Brennan (filmed in black and white without any indication that anyone 'one will ever sing a song) captures the stress and struggles better thus making the ultimate achievement more satisfying but requires a greater emotional investment.
