John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best film I've seen in a long time. This gives the viewer a surrealistic picture of life in Baltimore (I live in the vicinity of Washington, DC), with a similar use of Warhol's colors, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker becomes taller than his city can bear, and he is separated from his loved ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his artistic director loving men. The picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth - a bit like a strawberry ice cream on a hot summer's day - and while the taste was rather flat and simplistic, it made the whole thing deeper and more critical. It is a celebration of life, of freedom and of the right to bear arms ... and all that this country defends. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
