I remembered this as one of my favorite books as a child and wanted to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now. I knew the movie was coming out soon, so we went to the library for the book and they gave us passes for the next day! We rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare. Was not necessary. The only thing in common between the book and the movie is the name of the main characters, the fact that there is a gamble and a lot of worm eaters. Oh yes, I almost forgot, the kid who cooks most verses likes to present his masterpieces with a French accent. How children know each other, the number of children involved, how the bet is born, the number of worms to be eaten, how long to eat the worms, how they are cooked, the progress of friendships, the point culminating scenes, etc., NOTHING is the same. But one way or another, it did not ruin the movie. The characters are all nice and the movie did not leave me disappointed. Word of warning for parents, there was a moment when you could hear the adults in the room take their breath collectively. That's when Billy's younger brother called his penis a "dick dick". The embarrassing part came when my daughter asked those who sat around us, "Does anybody know what a silly dick is?" lol. This and an occasional "shot of mouth" are as rude as this film. My daughter thought she might get sick around worms 3 and 4 (and was holding the empty container of nachos just in case) but all was well for worm 6. She and I really enjoyed the movie and had a wonderful time to share the experience.
