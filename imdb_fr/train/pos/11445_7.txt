A new way to enjoy the work of Goldsworthy, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in motion. By watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation of every stone, leaf and thorn he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspire and affect his work. Although I am happy that the film covers the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I think it was a bit long. The filmmakers did a great job in bringing Goldsworthy's work to life and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch.
