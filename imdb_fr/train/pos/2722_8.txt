This recreation of the famous 1959 Kansas murders, based on the Capote book, is crudely filmed by Brooks and the black and white director of photography Hall, giving it a documentary atmosphere. There are good performances of Blake and Wilson as killers and Forsythe as a cop chasing them. The scenes leading up to the murders, filmed in the house where the crime was committed, with a hissing soundtrack, are quite intense and frightening. Brooks directs with great verve and uses several interesting transitions between scenes. The only complaint is that it is a little too long, with the denouement trailed and a little preached.
