The Running Man is one of those movies that, if watched too much, would become boring and depressing even. <br /> <br /> I advise you to watch it once or twice a year, with some friends and a few drinks. In the current climate of television dominance and capitalist fashion in society, the media really function as a revisionist social comment after the boom of the 1980s. Forget it anyway! There are other bright and better reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger is at the top of his form as Ben "The Butcher of Bakersfield" Richards, and the inclusion of the Bond-belting one liner was completely inspired-thety are a really dary leg (with his diatribe on Killian around a camera the main highlight). <br /> <br /> The design of the stalkers is authentically American and reflects the characterizations seen in the TV show 'Gladiators' of PC and WWE too. The macabre end of Buzz-saw is going to cool all the spectators (by way of remark, why is his death particularly disturbing in what is apparently an optimistic actor with a bitter sense of humor?) <br /> <br Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are excellent as supportive muscles (and are Arnies buds in real life), and Mick Fleetwood even participated! What more can you ask for? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the Running Man if you are looking for a good action action scene, with a glossty finish and great characters. Do not expect to receive an education (at least on the surface value). <br /> <br /> Quality, I really like it. You go too, unless you are a thesp. 7/10
