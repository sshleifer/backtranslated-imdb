Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the best in film history. <br /> <br /> I think we can all feel the feeling of "Gypo" because we have all struggled to find what is right or wrong. This is one of the first studio art images produced by a major American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> Joseph H. August's cinematography is at its best here. However, the beautiful part of August has been largely forgotten; he did not receive the Oscar nomination he rightly deserved. <br /> <br /> It's a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all expressed with as few words as possible.
