OH WOW. I saw this film at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were present and were available to answer their questions. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL FILM! Although taking place in Ireland amidst Catholic / Protestant antagonisms, the story could have happened anywhere between two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of the speed with which people can get carried away when given the opportunity to give vent to their hatred and anger has been beautifully woven with a moving love story punctuated with humor and pleasure . If it does not get noticed in the United States, it would be really unfortunate. <br /> <br /> As for the stars and the players who support them ... FIRST RATE. They called Orla Brady the Irish Meryl Streep, I heard. In my opinion, she is better than Meryl Streep. They should call Meryl the American Orla Brady! In addition, Liam Cunningham's faithful and powerful portrayal of a simple, private man aspiring to a political war was brilliant. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS FILM.
