Unfortunately, this movie was never burned on DVD. I saw it during theatrical release in 1983, and again when the VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a copy of this tape at a flea market, I immediately bought it . I was not deceived. First, the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to see. But then, the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to think about your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The film speaks of many things. It is the way in which the World Bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist stratagems to force them into debt that they can never repay. This is the way our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards, mortgages and car payments. It is about trying to preserve an innocence that we may never have had and that we may not be able to really save. It is good and bad and sometimes difficult to distinguish one from the other. This raises many questions but does not give answers. I think sometimes it's good. For this reason, it's a movie that is definitely worth saving and watching.
