Without a doubt, Beat Street is the best movie on the breakin scene. Everything is there, the clothes (puma), the music and especially the dance! The scenario is basic, but hey, why tell a story? The purpose of the film is to show what the children of that time were doing, which was important to them. This shows that teens in general are good, all that matters to these everyday children is music, dance and friendship. After watching the DVD recently, I was pleasantly surprised to see how much it had stood the test of time! The clothes did not seem old-fashioned (perhaps because Puma now has a strong comeback), the music always seems fresh and the dance is always captivating to watch. A film that anyone between the ages of 10 and 25 should see in their youth culture.
