Of the three remakes of W. Somerset Maughan's novel, this one is the best, and not particularly because of what John Cromwell brought to the film. The film is worth the detour because of the decisive performance of Bette Davis, who, as Mildred Rogers, showed the film industry that she was a star. Finally, his difficulties with Jack Warner and his studio paid off royally. <br /> <br /> The film is dominated from the beginning by Mildred. We realize from the beginning that Mildred does not care about Philip and will never do it. She does not hide her contempt for that kind soul who has fallen in love with the bad woman. He will be humiliated by Mildred again, because she does not hide her awareness of what she really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey, in addition to being disabled, is a weak man. When he tries to hang on to Mildred, she rejects him. It's when Mildred returns to her, when she is frail and defeated, that he is up to the situation, overcoming his own dependence on this terrible woman who stole his will and manliness. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis gives a fantastic depiction of Mildred. It was one of her best roles and she ran away with it. His dislike of the kind Philip is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When she tells him that she is washing her mouth after kissing her, this is one of the most powerful moments of the movie. Leslie Howard played down Philip and made him look even weaker. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen play minor roles. <br /> <br /> This is the series of Bette Davis, and do not forget it!
