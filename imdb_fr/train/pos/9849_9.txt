When I saw the trailers, I wanted to see the movie. And when I had, I had a feeling a little dissatisfied. It was a good movie, do not get me wrong, but I think the good sides were already in the caravans, if you know what I mean. It was going very fast and it was going on, so I was never bored and I liked watching that. The humor was absolutely great. My first contact with laziness (..or something like that).
