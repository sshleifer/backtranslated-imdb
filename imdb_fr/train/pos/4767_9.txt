I do not see how this show looks like CO. <br /> <br /> First, the focus is on teens and their parents trying to get through life. North Shore talks about a hotel staff trying to run the hotel and socialize at the same time. Secondly, CO is in California. North Shore is set in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why would Fox make a show like one of his other shows on the same network? I think it's a great show with good actors for the most part. He has a good script and a good plot. I like the events that happen and how people support and solve them. The most recent episode was surprising how the story unfolded. It was not predictable like most stories on most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps it on the air.
