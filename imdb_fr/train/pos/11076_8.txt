I will start by saying that this has been solved by almost everyone! The fact is, it was not what we expected, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone expected was that the cozers geezers and the good liners "do you like the dags?" etc., but it's a lot more mature than his previous work. I agree it's confusing, but all the facts are there for us. Just watch them and listen more carefully, this film requires your attention! Look beyond the cool and dazzling look of the film, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and I think we will all have a deeper understanding of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this has its Influences of modern classics (Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, etc.), but it is on the whole original in both directions and pacing with an incomparable musical score. I think if everybody watched this movie again and again, he would understand it a lot more and perhaps appreciate it for the nice piece of modern cinema that he is and I also hope that Ritchie will continue in this vain attempt because I much prefer this to his mockney. "Masterpieces".
