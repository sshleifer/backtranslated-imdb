This film is much better than the version of the asylums mainly its war of the worlds. The tripods look pretty cool, but their walk and death could have been better. The action scenes were really cool. Walking ... Walking ... Walking ... Walking !!! oh my god stop walking please or I'm going to kill myself. The scene of the Thunder Child was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship had hit tripods. Good movie, I recommend it to people who have read the book. The music is great and the directors look very cool. <br /> <br /> Good soundtrack 99% to book Violence cool Tripods and handling machines are cool to watch against <br /> <br />. a little acting cheesy looking London
