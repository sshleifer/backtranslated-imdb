Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda have all made Hamlet, but Branagh is the only one who understands it. <br /> <br /> This is the only film from "Hamlet" containing the full four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece gives a unique feel to the whole story. <br /> <br /> Few directors have been able to achieve this without boring their audience, but Branagh's skilful use of bravora film style and stunt casting allows people to see the importance of the scenes that are usually cut. <br /> <br /> Gerarde Depardue (Ranyaldo), whose main purpose in the film was simply to say "yes my lord," as Polonius begs him to spy on Leartes. It also included Billy Crystal as a gravedigger, Robin Williams as Oric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as an actor. <br /> <br /> Branagh's performance of the Act 4 Scene 4 soliloquy (which is once again cut out) is nothing short of a cinematic wonder as the camera slowly retreats as the intensity increases. It's a scene that literally made me want to get out of my chair and start applauding. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the only filmmaker to understand the importance of each scene in this film and to convey that importance. at the general audience. <br /> <br /> A show not to be missed for anyone who loves good storytelling, brilliant acting and incredible direction. All of these elements are part of the greatest triumph of William Shakespeares.
