One of the great advantages of most of the great Chinese movies you can find, if you are lucky, in the video library is that they are very accurate stories of true and true stories. Farewell, my concubine, the emperor and the murderer and this movie are perfect examples. The filmmakers take a true story and work hard to create a film accurately without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial reasons - the hallmark of many Hollywood films, and in particular Disney movies. <br /> <br /> We follow this story. the last years of a famous local street artist dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. After losing his only son many years ago, he seeks an heir to pursue his rare and dying art in a society that forbids women to have such work. Master Wang is sold to a son by a slave trader. All is well as he prepares himself happily to transmit his art. But we discover that the son is a girl. From there, the story becomes very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang from Sichuan Opera - a regional lyric style related to Peking Opera. Farewell My Concubine fans should take a close look at the portrait of a man playing the female role in Chinese opera by Master Liang. This may help them to understand that the actors in these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati, but people so conditioned psychologically that they were totally unaware of their own sexuality.
