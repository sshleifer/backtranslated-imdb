Okay, I admit that the cast of the film is REALLY weird - part of it is due to the plot, but I've always had a hard time believing that Pierce Brosnan is playing this role (though really did a good job). <br /> <br /> It is based on the true story of an Englishman who went to live with the Indians of Canada in the early 20th century. He claimed to be a Métis Indian. In fact, he had done so well and thought so well that many people came from all over the world to listen to his lectures and get caught for his treks in the wilderness - even though he was not a Métis Indian and all his knowledge was fired from books or fake! The film focuses on that and what happened when the hoax was discovered. <br /> <br /> The acting and the set were great and I really liked the movie (once I suspended my disbelief about Brosnan). The cast was not generalized - probably because it was pretty cerebral - not a James Bond movie, nor a love story - just a really strange movie about a remarkable man.
