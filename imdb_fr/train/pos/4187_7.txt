This is a good example of a movie noir. The setting is the early 50s, as communists were trying to steal arms secrets from the US government. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is the unscrupulous suave pickpocket. It gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing A-List about it. What is interesting is that he was not only an anti-hero, but that during the film, an inimitable anti-hero. It's not very normal. Jean Peters gave a mediocre performance as the whore with a heart of gold. This great actress, Thelma Ritter, shines like a stool-pigeon. <br /> <br /> The plot has had its share of twists, sarcasm and difficult discussions. There is a fight scene near the end of the movie (in the subway station) that was rather aggressive and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think Black fans (like me) will enjoy this movie. For non-black viewers, this may seem a little dated and any Commie is a bit exaggerated.
