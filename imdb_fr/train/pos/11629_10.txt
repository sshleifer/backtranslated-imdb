Red Eye is an exciting film from Freddy Kreuger's creator, Wes Craven. Wes Craven describes the story of a regular hotel worker, Lisa. After attending the funeral of her grandmother, she decides to take flight of red eyes. As she waits, she meets this man named Jack Rippner (how is that?) And they become friends. Ironically, both are sitting next to each other on the plane. That's when the horror begins. This film is exciting and for people with weak hearts who do not like horror / exciting movies, let's say it's possible they can pee in their pants. This is an excellent example of producing bone shaking. Wes Craven did well with this movie. He has chosen the right actors, like Rachel McAdams, a smart and sexy girl who knows what she does and who is wary of everything when she plays in a movie. Cillian Murphy, the scary and horrifying actor who can cool you down because his incredible role is the bad character of this film and that his face can really widen your eyes. Wes Craven has done a great job and I hope he will make more movies like this one.
