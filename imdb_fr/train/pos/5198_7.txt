What can we say about Mr. Moore? He is the godfather of rap, he is the king of Z level blaxploitation movies, and here he is again his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This film is a real roller coaster ride of politically incorrect humor, trippy kung fu, nudity, cheese, violence and many other things you will never find in most modern movies (nor in any movie , haha!). Do not miss the stand-up routine he gives early! Anyway, D2 is definitely a fun way to lose about an hour. Dolemite: "He thinks he's naughty and he does not have a class, I'm going to blow that shotgun up to his * beep * a **!"
