I loved this film! I'm a fan since I'm a big fan of Disney, but I really enjoyed myself. The action starts at the beginning of the film and continues! It's a bit of a departure for Disney, they do not spend as much time developing the character (my husband pointed out) and there are no musical numbers. It's strictly an action adventure. I really enjoyed it and I recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, young or old.
