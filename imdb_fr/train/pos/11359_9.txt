Citizen X recounts the tragedy of the search for a serial killer nicknamed "Rostov Ripper." This film illustrates the long road that it took to apprehend an assassin. The film shows how politics may have helped the murderer continue his rampage for more than 12 years. (Perhaps more than 50 victims, mostly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rea as lead detective and Donald Sutherland as head of the overall investigation were excellent. Jeffrey DeMunn as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of movie that will hypnotize you and will immediately allow you to search the Internet for the real case. It's a film not to be missed. He debuted I believe on HBO and never had a theatrical release to my understanding. A good film
