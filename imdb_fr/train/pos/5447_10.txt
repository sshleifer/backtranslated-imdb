Personal tastes prevail when it comes to movies such as this precious little jewel. Going back to the eighties, in the early eighties, I discovered this film, like so many films released at the time, "Night Patrol", "Bad Manners" or even "King Frat", the works of art and the texts on the back of covers were tempted to you. <br /> <br /> Of course, movies like the ones I already mentioned, as well as films like "Screwballs" and many others have captivated the imagination and, thankfully, many years later , I still remember with tenderness and some disdain, the many films that help maintain my love for a genre such as parodies or pastiches. <br /> <br /> Achieved many years after the great success of "Animal House" and after seeing how he had behaved. Over the years, I now know there would be no way this film would ever overshadow the box office, but it would not stay in the memory, much like that of National Lampoon's Vacation. <br /> <br /> Honestly, anything with the National Lampoon logo was not a resounding success, but Class Reunion remains one of my favorite movies of all time, with instantly recognizable characters, such as that Bob Spinnaker distractedly played perfectly by Gerrit Graham, so good in "Terrorvision" by Charles Band, still engraved in the past glories of his youth. Or, how about Stephen Furst's frenetic and uncomfortable turn when the lazy drunk sex of high school was completely delusional, Hubert Downs. <br /> <br /> Sweet as. What makes me think. As I said before, personal taste does not stand up. People can be so cruel and will never be rewarded or compared to those of his peers in the world of comedy. This has merit. This is one of John Hughes' previous texts, which then made one of my favorites of his work "Weird Science", as well as a superb theme titled by the great Gary Bonds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What's more, it's a film just waiting to be rediscovered again and again.
