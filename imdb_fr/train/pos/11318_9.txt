Here is a powerful and haunting Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's novel The Factor Always Rings Twice, directed by the great Luchino Visconti. What's so interesting in the film is that in every way it transcends its sources to become bolder and more original (it is interesting to note that Camus also attributes Cain's novel to the key inspiration of his historical novel The Stranger). The film has more power and intensity than the novel, because Visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of Cain's narrative structure, but offers a more complex exploration of the genre. Cain's very American novel is also uncritically fascinated by the construction of whiteness (the main character Cora obsessively fancies identifying herself as a Mexican and embarrassed that she married a Greek immigrant), which is irrelevant in the Italian rural context that Visconti is working in. This allows class antagonisms to play a central role and to dance among the embers of the passionate and condemned love affair of the two main characters. This film is a complex experience, rich in emotions and rewarding.
