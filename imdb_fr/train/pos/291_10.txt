Zombie Chronicles is not a topic of conversation, it is obvious, it is not an award-winning film, but an entertaining B movie directed by Brad Sykes who directed Camp Blood, which was another entertaining, low-budget film. The acting is bad, like most cheap movies but that's what makes it more fun, the zombie makeup is cool and efficient especially with the budget, the gore is also excellent and disgusting, the film is a little like a zombie version of Tales of the Crypt, since we have two stories about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and let you guess, especially the first. Zombie Chronicles is way better than some low-budget zombie movies, if you like cheap B movies or cheap zombie movies, check out Zombie Chronicles.
