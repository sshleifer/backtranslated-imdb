One of the last classics of the new French wave. The filmmaker Jean Eustache was inspired by the simplicity of cinema at the beginning of the century; for history, Eustache was inspired by the torments of his own complicated love life. So much can be said about this film - a brilliant observation; self indulgently overlong; sometimes hilarious; emotionally exhausting ... etc. etc. In my mind, all the complaints that can be made against this film are easily overshadowed by its many strengths. All film students, writers, or simply anyone who wants to manage a 3-hour film without abrupt cuts, without overwork in video clips, without twists like a soap opera, and without banal dialogue should in no way prevent from seeing this film. Everything is to be admired: the writing (concise, intelligent, surprisingly funny), the action (everyone, simply, is perfect in its respective roles), and the simple direction (the spectator feels like an occasional observer in the film) unforgettable film. It's definitely a movie that stays with you.
