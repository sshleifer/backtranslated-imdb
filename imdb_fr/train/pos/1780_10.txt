My mother and I were returning home from a trip to the northeast (mainly to Massachusetts) when we decided to take a detour to attend a film festival in Boston. Now, since I do not know much about cinema, I thought it might be a little educational. The first film we saw was this one, DIVISION ROMEO. Now, I do not know about you but I thought it was great! I come from Texas and from where I come, we do not see too many moving pictures, so it was a nice surprise. My mother insisted it was too violent, but said that I did not know much about what she said, but it was a great picture. I was shocked by the fight sequences, they were great. Plus, I'm a big fan when good guys win, so I was delighted when the Romeo ladies killed all the bad guys. It was the real brilliance. I do not know when the video will be released, but if you have the opportunity, you should check it. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. A word for the wise man though, he is rather violent and there are many words of swearing so that you do not want to let your children look. It's more for adults.
