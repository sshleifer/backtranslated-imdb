Frankly, I do not understand why this movie was such a "flop" in advertising. Sharon Stone has certainly not lost her charisma and "touch" since "basic instinct". I voted for this film 10 and I explain why: the game opens in London this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the BI1 events. Again, she turns out to be a brain manipulator of her own class - undisputed. She "steals your brain" as Catherine with such skill that in the end you do not really know who the real bad guy is. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical part of the film: only the real setback is the crew of B-rate actors. Sharon Stone is the only big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas, etc. in the first part. I also think that BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone had been a little younger, but she is still beautiful in her appearance and only improved in terms of her charisma. His B-rate "assistants" are not that bad either, although I would have liked bigger cast names. <br /> <br /> I think there are very good improvements in the basic plot. I think it's a much better thriller than much of the hilarious shit that Hollywood so easily distributes today. The plot is great, it's easy to see technically, you do not snore halfway through the movie and most importantly, health is on.
