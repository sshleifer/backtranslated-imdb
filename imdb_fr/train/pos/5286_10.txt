Part of what was great about Looney Tunes' classic cartoons was their irreverence and the fact that they were not afraid to do what they wanted. In this case, Marvin the Martian's mission is to bring back a landowner. Indeed, he meets Bugs Bunny, who warns against a mutiny of Marvin's dog. After Marvin finally trapped Bugs - using a bazooka ejecting a camouflage jacket! - Bugs has planned more things for the trip back to Mars. What I mean is that if you thought that Pluto's planet status had been upset by the solar system, then you have not seen anything yet! Yes, "The Hasty Hare" is doing everything possible. The way they buy Acme products in space is probably beyond most people, but the bottom line here - I mean "hare" - is to have fun. And believe me, you're definitely going. After all, a short break has never hurt anyone.
