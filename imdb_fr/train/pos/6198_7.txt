I'm one of those people who go through a broken glass to see a Hal Hartley movie. From TRUST and IRIS to HENRY FOOL and (which I prefer to Hartley) NO SUCH Thing, Hal's unique films are an acquired taste. It seems that his strong point lies in the mixture mystery / espionage in equal parts. Comedy is not necessarily in your face, and often runs through a scene before materializing. And this is the case of FAY GRIM, following Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey plays Fay Grim, abandoned wife of Henry Fool and mother of Henry's only son, Ned. Fay lives a quiet life until she returns home one day to find a CIA agent in her kitchen. His name is Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, THE MAN OF THE YEAR) and he wants Henry's notebooks. There are many notebooks by Henry Fool and they were all believed to contain only crazy wanderings. Apparently, they have a lot more to do. Secret searches on weapons or paths leading to terrorists? Who knows but Henry. Agent Fulbright tells Fay that her husband is dead, but this is quickly supposed to be a trick to get Fay out of her house and pick up Henry (and it works ... but not as they think). <br /> <br /> Fay fights multiple spy rings to collect Henry's notebooks and pick him up. She also makes an agreement with the CIA to get her brother Simon (James Urbaniak) out of the prison (he helped Henry escape from the country in the original Henry Fool movie.) Multiple, overlapping events follow one another quickly: spy networks are shooting at each other. to death, we discover that Henry is being held "safe" by a jihadist, Fay frees his brother but unconsciously puts his son's life in danger, and the CIA bows out for putting Fay in danger. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Hal Hartley likes to play with themes. And he does it to the extreme here. Even character names (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have implicit meanings that are quite amusing. The old band's spying films also get a lot of time on the screen, as the guns flare up in stop-motion sequences, without ever hitting our heroine, even if it's in the line of fire . <br /> <br /> Now that I've praised this creation, I would say that Parker Posey's excessive portrayal of Fay Grim is not the best part of the film, which is a shame given the time it goes on the screen. I realize that was probably what Mr. Hartley wanted: an undisturbed woman with hand gestures to the extreme Italian. But it was always painful to watch sometimes. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, fans will probably devour Fay Grim and ask for more. Although it's not my favorite Hal Hartley movie, I know I'm ready.
