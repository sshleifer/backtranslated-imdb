What could be more sordid than the idea that private detectives mingle with the women they are supposed to spy on? And most dialogues are perfectly commonplace. <br /> <br /> But the actors turn the dialogue into something logical. You can see real people behind unreal lines. And the staging is beautiful. Each scene does what it has to do and ends without dragging on too long. <br /> <br /> I showed it to several friends in the mid-80s because I was puzzled by how such bad material could be turned into such a movie. good movie. Friends liked it too.
