I was about 11 years old and found that I lived 0.48 miles from the uncle's house. Uncle's house is on Westway Dr, Deer Park, TX. they have added houses since the movie was made. I do not know the number of the house but you can go and get it. I am now 21 years old and I like to watch this movie. the bar on Spencer is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school for them. I passed the house last week. The house is still beautiful. My father and uncle went to the street where the house was and watched the actors come in and out of the house doing the film. where John goes through the cracks of the railroad, they grew by 225. When I hear about John Loesing, his son, I start thinking about when he created an urban cowboy. He was 26 or 25 at the time.
