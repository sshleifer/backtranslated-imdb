Excellent film by Thaddeus O'Sullivan, which features many British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a thorny subject and captures the desperation and sinister atmosphere of Belfast in the 1970s. Surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify both sides in this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father who tries to raise his family without being dragged into trouble. On the other hand, it is a loyalist gang that intends to spread the violence. Very interesting and, thankfully, entertaining. Do not expect laughs, though. 7 out of 10
