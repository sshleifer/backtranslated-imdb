I guess every time I see one of those old movies from the 80s, it brings me back to a simpler time, no matter what their current appearance. This film is a good one. I remember seeing him as a little kid and thinking it was the greatest movie of all time. He has all the heroic characters that a young cowboy wants to be. Now, as an adult, I can look back, laugh and stay sad, but this time, I know what's going on. I found something weird. How many people can settle in Houston and meet Sissy, get married, settle in a caravan, argue, cheat, kill an uncle, and then get back together after a month? Only in America.
