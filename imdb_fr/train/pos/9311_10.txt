It was the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was also the best movie. The original Sci Fi films are supposed to be bad, that's what makes them fun! The line "I like my dinosaur meat well done!" is probably the best quote of all time! In addition, the plot looks like something of a dream induced by the pot. I can imagine now, writers waking up after a long night of gaming and dance revolution, then gathered their ideas: Space Marines arrived on an alien planet, infested with dinosaurs and sheltering medieval houses. protect a scientific team that studies the planet. Best idea ever! In fact, this corresponds to the complete checklist of the original Sci Fi movie: firearms dinosaurs medieval time epic space travels <br /> <br /> Go so watch this movie, but do not buy it .
