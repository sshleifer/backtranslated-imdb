**Warning! Light damage ahead! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I realize that it is difficult to ruin a historical documentary, but I do mention some of its backgrounds and methods.) <br /> Outstanding documentary not only to cause remarkable images, but also because of the story behind it. Because the Naudet did not want to tell the story of September 11, but rather that of a novice firefighter, the emotions of men and the connection of the viewer with them are more real and more powerful than in a classic retrospective. <br /> <br /> In cinematographic sense, "9/11" is a textbook. If the events were a real scenario, they would be beautiful because the characters are established and then cast a curve to which they must react. This is all the more surprising given the pain and emotion of the raw images that the directors had to go through to reconstruct this story. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film gives a glimpse of life inside a fire station; in particular, how does a recruit fit into a veteran crew? This part alone is very good and if the documentary had been allowed to follow the course, it would probably have been solid. The brothers seem to be realistically portraying the process of becoming a New York firefighter. <br /> <br /> Then of course, all hell is unleashed. The chaos following the WTC attacks is clearly perceived, as various characters we have come to know are plunged into terrifying situations. Seeing not only the attacks, but also the first-hand reactions is a very moving image of extreme human emotion. <br /> <br /> After the war, when we discover that firefighters are lost and found, is a human tragedy at its peak. Life and death are at stake. Unlike many movies, not only does the viewer not know who will live and die, but he really cares. <br /> <br /> The only negative point I have to say about this is that the words of Robert DeNiro (that I like) were uninformative, useless and had no progress in history . They were probably added simply to attract more viewers. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The best documentary I have ever seen. Nonpareil representations of raw human emotions and drama. 9.5 out of 10.
