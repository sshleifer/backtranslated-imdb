Nowadays, very few artists can keep me captivated throughout the film by their mere presence. Judy Davis is one of those people who has built her career successfully by creating stubborn characters, but very vulnerable to the heart. She plays roles that most performers treat melodramatically, and adds an intense, deeply emotional intensity that diverts attention from everything on the screen. <br /> <br /> His talents are well illustrated in "High Tide", a film that corresponds to him a second time with the director Gillian Armstrong, who gave Davis his first big hit with "My Brilliant Career". In this film, Davis played a young woman determined to succeed in the world, despite the suffocation she felt from her community and her education. In "High Tide," however, Davis's character, Lillie, is about the opposite: she gave up hope for her future when she was young and, after giving birth to a child, fled her responsibilities and for life without direction or meaning. When she finally found her daughter years later, the idea of ​​taking care of her child is petrifying; she knows it's her chance to atone for failures, but how can she be honest with her daughter while gaining her respect? <br /> <br /> Gillian Armstrong's films usually tell stories of characters who desperately want to communicate with each other. others, but face barriers due to their own habits and addictions. "Oscar and Lucinda", for example, spoke of a man and a woman who desperately needed each other's love, but were always caught off guard by their thirst for chance, represented by their Here we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother's inability to engage in a serene life and by her struggle to redeem herself, although she is fully convinced that he is too late to change for the better. It's not just a film with a great performance at its center, but also a rare achievement: a fully convincing buy-back story.
