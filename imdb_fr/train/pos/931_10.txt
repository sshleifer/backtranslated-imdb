I like all versions of this story, but this one is my favorite. George C.Scott gives the character of Scrooge a depth that others do not give. The film shows more why he became so bitter. The changes in Scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and incidents they present to him. <br /> <br /> This movie has by far the best Tiny Tim. He has the right age rather than being played by a teenager almost like in other movies. Anthony Walters still has all or most of his baby teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is wonderful as Bob Cratchit. He is such a versatile actor. He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He plays this role with dignity, not as an impassive man, frightened by Scrooges, but as a man who graciously accepts him because he has a family to support himself. Susannah York and the other actors do a remarkable job to bring the characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Christmas ghost gift I have ever seen. Most often, he is played as a Santa-type character. In this, he shows his anger at Scrooges's attitudes and really makes Scrooge come back. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets really revive Dickens' London. A wonderful movie.
