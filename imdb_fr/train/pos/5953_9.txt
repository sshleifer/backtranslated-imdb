I understand that Paramount wanted to film this with Rodgers and Hart's score, but could not solve copyright issues. Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote the greatest number of Bing Crosby songs together, wrote a beautiful score. <Br/> <br /> I read Leonard Maltin saying that this film "perfectly matched Crosby" and that I could not have expressed it better. No, it's not Mark Twain's satire, it's a Bing Crosby movie and in 1949, Crosby was Hollywood's most profitable star. For once, Paramount used technicolor and Rhonda Fleming has never been so beautiful on screen. It was a woman for whom technicolor had been invented. <br /> <br /> The origins of William Bendix in Brooklyn stand out a bit, but the comic effect is good. The trio of Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke has everything to please Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his patented optimistic philosophical numbers with If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon. <br /> <br /> The third song he sings once and for all by himself and with Rhonda Fleming. This song was nominated for the best song, but was lost by Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> It's also good that Bing managed to record Decca's score with Rhonda Fleming, Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that it shows Crosby's comic talents without Bob Hope. I like the images of Road, but Bing was a comic talent and this film demonstrates it better than any other. <br /> <br /> Crosby is at the top of his game.
