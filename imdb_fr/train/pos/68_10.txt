Why does a series of stupid, boring and depressed movies like "Star Wars" stir up all the hype, and a truly incredible movie like this is completely unnoticed ... it's beyond me ... This movie will open you up really look at the world. We live in a dark, disturbing, sad and scary world ... <br /> <br /> Unlike the boring "Elephant", this movie is not one of these "typical day up what some pull the trigger ".. this movie focuses more on what happens AFTER the event ... <br /> <br /> Deana, performed by the very hot and very talented Erika Christensen, is a straight happy and healthy. A student with very good friends and a good life ... until she was wounded on the day of the shooting, being shot in the head .. Fortunately, she is not killed, but is seriously injured and has to stay in the hospital for a while, causing her to have a lot of emotional pain, in addition to the physical pain ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Alicia, played by the very beautiful and talented Busy Phillips, is a nasty, rebellious, rebellious, antisocial gothic girl who does not have a single positive trait on her ... and she is unscathed when the shooting took place ... because it's turns out to be friends with the shooter and knew he would do what he did. ... so she's taken to the police station and asked questions ... When she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen, they're constantly coming to her house to try to convince her to say something ... and she still has not done it, so the headmaster of the school makes her attend the funeral of one of the deceased students, and after she leaves. .. the director decides that's enough, and the force is going to visit Deana at the hospital ..

Deana tries to welcome her in a friendly way, but well Sure, Alicia only responds with cruel and hurtful comments and a harsh statement about her condition. only here because she is forced and has no intention of being friendly with her. But sooner or later, this intention will change ... (and that's all I'll say :) It's really one of the most moving films of all time, as well as one of the darkest and most more disturbing. That would tie that with "American History X", which is just as disturbing and moving ... <br /> <br /> WARNING: Watch this movie at your own risk! It contains scenes and very graphic images! EXCELLENT and criminally underrated movie! I am so ashamed to be almost the only one to know it!
