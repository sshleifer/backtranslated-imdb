When an actor has to act as an actor, fictional or factual, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. In A Double Life, Ronald Coleman outdid himself as Anthony John, the tortured dual personality. He put in this character all his talent and sincerity. The facial expressions, the manners, the gait and the posture spoke eloquently of what Anthony John was living while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also behaved very well as a Shakespearian actor in these short scenes of Othello as part of this jewel of a film. Scenes of Coleman's face while Othello was tortured with doubts about Desdemona's fidelity were in themselves scenes to look at. Add to that the despair of his character off stage and only a person with the depth of the Coleman actor perception can reach. It was like watching Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except that this double role was much deeper and poignant. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and beautiful at the same time and added her talent to the movie. It is thought that Ronald Coleman loved his role in this film over all the others he played and then won the Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I would see this movie several times and I would never feel bored .
