Everyone who has gone through the ages of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will enjoy this movie. It's one of those movies that offers everything you want in a "Spring Break movie", PLUS it makes fun of the kind of college movie. It's funny, there's a cast to die for (Amy Pohler, Rachel Dratch !, Sophie Monk !, Parker Posey, Jane Lynch, Amber Tamblyn, Missi Pyle!) And her guarantee to make you laugh out loud. Screenwriter and actress Rachel Dratch is a comic book genius and Sophie Monk is such a nasty villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (I'm repeating myself now ...) He will live with girls who love Miranda July but who want to eat ice cream and pretend to be silly.
