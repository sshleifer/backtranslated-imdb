In this satire of the marketing and lightness of the war, John Cusack interprets Brand Hauser, an assassin sent to Turaqistan to eliminate Omar Sharif, an oil company likely to cause trouble in the former vice-president of the government. Own American company. In addition, Hauser must reconcile his false position as a producer of trade shows, marriage for pop princess Yonica (Hillary Duff) and a curious liberal reporter Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> technical aspects: <br /> <br /> - The acting game (at least the main characters) was good, as expected. Part of John Cusack's dialogue was obviously not written for him, as he often seemed uncomfortable to say it. . . perhaps unrealistic is more accurate. Joan presented an excellent performance, often hilarious. Marisa Tomei, although I have never been a big fan of hers, was quite fit for the role and worked well. Hillary Duff, however, was rather terrible. They needed an attractive pop-star from the Middle East (or Russian, or whatever that accent was). Unfortunately, they left 0 for 3 with her. <br /> <br /> - As I said above, the writing seemed a little stiff and inadequate in some respects, including the dialogue of John Cusack. Not much, but a few. The story was also a bit silly at some points, which is good for a satire up to a point, but it took a whole new level here. Fortunately, the Cusacks and Tomei maintain a relatively calm and calm behavior, which makes a nice mixture between the madness of the film and the lucidity of the actors. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who previously had a drought of real credits to his name, is doing a great job with a fairly broad spectrum film. He handled the small budget very well ($ 10 million) and stretched it to make it look a lot more. Seftel also managed to mix the humor of the story well. . . with the painful and hard-to-see parts of the real war (including the killing of civilians, etc.). <br /> <br /> - As for the general satire, his exaggerated view of the commercialization of the war is very well done, especially the "Golden Palace Poker" ads on American tanks. At times, it gets a little too much, but in the end, it always stays true to what is happening for a young 'Mel Brooks' style. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is very well done for the meager budget and it's really worthy of a look. It will not be one of the great satires of cinema, but it is certainly not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
