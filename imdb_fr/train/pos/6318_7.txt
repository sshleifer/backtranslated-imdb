I had tried to praise this a few times, but I was still with the girlfriend who, as a rule, usually rejects the heist movies and the comedies together with the comment "Uh ... that has the look good, but I'm in no mood for this movie. "So begins the" Almighty Movie Night Solo "! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found Welcome to Collinwood a rather nice movie. Although finally forgettable enough, there are moments of pleasure and some laughter. I did not know the fact that it was a remake and, as a rule, I watched movies that tried to ignore it and looked at it anyway. George Clooney presents us with a humorous little appearance as a roller cracker that basically makes me think of two things ... 1. Would not every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney made a strange 5 minute appearance? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded and how easy do they wash? The actors, all good actors in their own right, did a great job and you feel like they've had a good time working together, which is quite important in a film like this one. Needless to say, not everything happens as planned in this film, both in terms of plot and humor, but it made me check the special features and consider looking at the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this one for a good time, maybe have some friends and a pizza. you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> By the way, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear the very underrated used by Paolo Conte, and he left me bits of the score resonate long after the credits.
