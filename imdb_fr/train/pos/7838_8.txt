If you are a fan of T-Rex / Marc Bolan, I recommend you check this out. It shows a whimsical side of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, having apparently had a good time shooting some scenes that are not part of the concert, but are fun to watch, leaving you with the feeling of just knowing them, and when the concert shows a talented musician, both playful and professional, who impresses and seems to impress screaming girls. Looking at it in concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but just having a good time playing good songs with good friends, like Elton John and Ringo Starr, who participated in some of their concerts. Certainly, I miss some songs that I would have liked to see there, but like any album, he can not have everything. I just bought this product in 2006, but if I had known it was released in 1972, I would certainly have bought it years ago. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love of cars will never learn to drive and will die in a car accident!
