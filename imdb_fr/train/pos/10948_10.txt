Following a sitcom plot is so easy that letting your character run simultaneously in and out of context, the rest of the cast is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use. The secondary characters base the series on a sitcom reality that provides a contextual counterpoint to Sarah's erratic personality that, beyond the general insensitivity, has no recurring traits upon which to base behavioral expectations, thus making her less a character than a painting to repaint. each episode if not scene. Sarah's ability to see everything from an outside point of view allows her to parody aspects of social behavior that are subtle enough to go unnoticed. Every time she speaks, it's like an independent 5-second skit. She takes a lot of control, demonstrating the innumerable things that a smile or vocal change can mean, but never stay with an idea long enough for you to be comfortable and form expectations that are met. It may be the most creative, original and experimental television program of all time.
