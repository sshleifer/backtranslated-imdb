Monstervision was a show I grew up with. From the late evening with Penn and Teller to one, the only one, Joe Bob Briggs. The show kept me awake on Friday night during my high school years and provided some of the best drive-in memories ever to be lived outside the drive-in. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the best of the night television ever. If you did not stay awake, you would have missed your chance. <br /> <br /> I know that John Bloom and Joe Bob still live, but I want them to come back in their place ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... Did anyone else attend the 4 hours of "The Swarm"? q :) <br /> <br /> Long live Monstervision!
