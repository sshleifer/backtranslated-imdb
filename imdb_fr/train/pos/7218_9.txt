Deathtrap works like a play in a movie about who does what to whom, because it takes place mainly on a set. The principle is that an accomplished playwright, whose star is falling, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student. He therefore plans to leave his protégé and to appropriate his piece under the protests (strong) of his wife. Or if you think, for the first half of the movie. Passed the cap, Deathtrap begins to create twists and surprises that upset its principle, then all around, then crazy, while maintaining its title. It is an excellent mystery film impregnated with spirit. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, as the main playwright, plays himself in this film - a bit of a zany and very dramatic Brit. No surprises here - he does his usual good job. He gets the best line of Deathtrap, which he executes perfectly: "What is your definition of success, being gangbang in a state penitentiary?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Christopher Reeve juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance in which plays the ambitious young playwright (and psychopath). He also has the opportunity to show his very toned body, that he had to retain Superman movies. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve collaborated on another film that is one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. The same goes for a play, although this time, Caine is the director and Reeve, an actor. Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers) join them. Together, they demonstrate the calamities that strike the actors and the team of a play. At first glance, the film seems to be more of a burlesque genre, but when you look at it, you see that it's a lot of subtle jokes that require more than one view. I would like this underrated movie to be available on DVD.
