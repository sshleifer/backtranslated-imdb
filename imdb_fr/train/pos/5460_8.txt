Lily Powers works in a speakeasy until the death of her father.She then goes to New York to work in an office building.She notices that if she wants to go higher, she must give men what they want . And what the men want is Alfred E.Green's Baby Face (1933) is a film with a strong sexual content. For a movie of that time, anyway. It was one of the last Pre-Code movies to be shot. Barbara Stanwyck gives a very sexy performance in the role of Lily. The other actors in this film are George Brent (Courtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Ned Stevens ), Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henry Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsay (Ann Carter) and Theresa Harris (Chico). The young John Wayne is interpreted as Jimmy McCoy Jr.This film deals with a brave subject and he does it well. Baby Face is a historically important movie and therefore good to watch.
