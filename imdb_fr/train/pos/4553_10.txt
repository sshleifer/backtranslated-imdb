As far as I know, the real guy that plays the main actor saw his performance and said it was an outstanding performance, I agree with him. It's a fantastic movie about a very talented boy / man with a body part that helps him. Oscar and BAFTA winning the award, and Golden Day nominating, Daniel Day-Lewis portrays the role of Christy Browna, a man with a cerebral disability who spends most of his life on the ground, in a wheelchair and carried by his family. He has a special left foot, he can write with, paint and hold things. He learns to speak later in the film, it's fine for a guy like him. In addition, featuring the Oscars of Home Alone 2 and Golden Globe, Brenda Fricker was named Ms. Brown and Ray McAnally of BAFTA is named Mr. Brown. He was nominated for Academy Award for best director for Jim Sheridan, Best Screenplay and Screenplay, based on material from another medium and the best film. He has also been nominated at the BAFTA for Best Picture, Best Makeup Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 on British Finest Actors and he was number 15 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 28 on the 50 biggest British movies. Exceptional!
