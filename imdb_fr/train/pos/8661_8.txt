I have enjoyed Criminal Intent's Law of Order series for a long time. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, the detective woman is rather tough and seems a bit bitter in the series on criminal intentions. See his other side in this film. <br /> <br /> This film shows the wonderful soft side of this talented actress and if you're a fan of Criminal Intent, this movie is a real party in her game and you get a damn good family hardship in the south. <br /> <br /> I did not like the role of Albert Finney in this movie, because he had done such a convincing job as his southern compatriot, older, hard-headed and intolerant and who refused any change. It reminds me so many men of my youth and the portrait is divine, but you will probably find it difficult to appreciate in this film. <br /> <br /> It's easy to love Katryn Erbe in this film and why I recommend it 10 stars for fans of Criminal Intent, Law and Order.
