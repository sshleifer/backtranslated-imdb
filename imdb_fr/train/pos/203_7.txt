Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys with Walter Matthau and George Burns is a funny comedy about the strange connection with life and its brevity, but always bitter laughter. Seeing Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns), two great actors in theatrical comedy now reduced to the imbecility of old age hard and incessant, you can only feel anger and blue. Willy never goes and continues to look for work, while Al is tired of the players and is retired in the country at his daughter's house. The couple of his time was really funny and harmonious, but off the stage was a continuous quarrel and quarreling, and for eleven years after their breakup, they did not talk to each other. Now, if they want to work, they have to come back together again to make one of his best old sketches for a comedy TV show. The meeting is explosive and liberating for old questions ?? Neil Simon's script gives the story a certain corrosive spirit and overwhelming melancholy and blue, gags and laughter managed to generate a good mix, also thanks to the superb couple Walter Matthu (Nomination Academy Award of the best actor) and George Burns the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor). Both actors are very credible and real and their harmony seems almost like they really work together during all this time and this reality that they do not support between them. The film is also very touching for its consumer reality because the story is narrated and how the report Love-Heat that binds the two actors is a very real part of the strange things but at the same time usually understandable of life. My rate is 7.
