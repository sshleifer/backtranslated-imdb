It may not be one of the best films ever made, but overall it's a very nice and light piece of foam in which everyone involved seems to have fun. Highly recommended for his feeling of well-being. OK, the acting role of Frank Sinatra leaves a lot to be desired, but his singing is a great redemptive feature and the songs fit perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra then shot in many other films where his undisputed acting talent shone, but in this adventure, his first Hollywood adventure, his voice, and not his role as an actor, is his main contribution to this film. I just watched it on TV again and it still makes me feel as much as when I first saw it many years ago.
