The life of bugs is a good movie. But for me, it does not really compare to movies like Toy Story and others. Do not get me wrong, I liked this movie, but it was not as good as Toy's story. The film has the visuals, the laughs and others of Toy's story. But the movie did not seem so ... I do not know, but I thought it was still a very good movie. <br /> <br /> A life of bugs ... I do not mean that, it's a movie I can not remember. I saw it years ago. Of course, I have not seen Toy's story for years, but I still remember it. I should not have seen this movie again, but I am. I agree with him, although this is not exactly the best job Pixar has done. <br /> <br /> The life of a bug: *** / ****
