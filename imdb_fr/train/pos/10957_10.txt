This show will probably not please everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she does not ask permission and she does not apologize. It's a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars and a team of cheerleaders who steal wallets. The star of the series is not a heroine, it is a perverted goofy and fanatic. If you can not appreciate the offbeat humor it offers, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It brings together the comedic style of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (Comedy Actors), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (The "Stay" by Bobcat Goldthwait) and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also showcases the best talents in the fast-growing community, channel101.com. (If you like this show, keep an eye on "The Department of Acceptable Media" on vh1 in March, it will build on the same pool of talent.) <br /> <br /> Watch Sarah Silverman's show . This kind of thing is the future of entertainment.
