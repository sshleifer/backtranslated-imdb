People call it a comedy, but when I look at it, I only laugh once. I guess the problem is that I saw him for the first time at the age of 14, <br /> <br /> and that I was not old enough to understand that this was not supposed to be taken seriously <br /> <br />. Some scenes were meant to be fun, but I cared too much about the characters so I could laugh at them <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you fall in love, <br /> <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you'll find that despite some stupid flaws, this is one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen.
