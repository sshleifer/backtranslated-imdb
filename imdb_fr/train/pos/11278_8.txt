The first Tarzan film with Johnny Weissmuller. The plot has already been summarized, so I will not go back to it. Just know that the actors who play Jane and Tarzan are born for the role. If you have not seen this movie and you only have Tarzan's modern movies as a reference, you are missing a real treat. No matter how far we have come in making movies, makeup sets ... no one will ever play Tarzan as well as Johnny Weissmuller. He was and is Tarzan.
