Different filmmakers from different countries have contributed a lot to support through their thoughts. As a result, we experimented with different genres regarding the medium. Jafar Panahi, unlike J.L. Godard or F. Truffault, believes in simple narrative; The schematic narratives are one of the main features of his work as a director. He trusts the automatic intelligence as well as the critical intelligence of the viewer; he does not feel the need to go for alienation or such things to reach the viewers. It is equally effective despite being conventional. Offside (2006) is another schematic creation of him, where the gender subordination of Middle East Asia is gradually becoming clear to everyone as the simple but catchy narrative of the film progresses. Nowadays, while we all protest on the issue of women's rights, this film creeps very quietly into our minds and ends up becoming a bump for our critical intelligence by spreading the message that equal rights of man is nothing but an illusory good, a utopia. Paternity will never let women emancipate themselves. An important football match in which the country participates. A teenager who understands the game, loves her country, has no right to enter the stadium to encourage her country. She is only allowed to listen to the comment live. Her pseudonym could not work for her. As a result, she had to undergo several humiliating situations. From the beginning, his worried father ran here and there for his daughter. At the end of the day, the nation won the match that the girl could not see because she was stopped outside the stadium during the game. But the celebration can not remove the issue of women's rights that remains in every corner of the world in a different format. Jafar Panahi spoke very well about the problem of sexual abuse in the context of conventional filmmaking and patriarchy. A world tragedy has been handled with ease and sometimes with humor, which torments our being constantly.
