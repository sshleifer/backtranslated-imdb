I can not say that this film is a disappointment because I read some of the reviews before looking and it was not as good as I thought. The bar was not very high, so the fact that my expectations were met does not say much. <br /> <br /> The Good: The city of New York. If you live in the city like me, you will recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than a decor, but one of the main characters. There are really tender moments, humorous conversations and left-to-right intrigues that keep all things interesting. <br /> <br /> The bad thing: the first thing I thought about after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not in the positive "let's want more" fashion. Admittedly, good sketches / scenes outweigh bad ones, but there are a lot of skits that belong to the "in-between" category, too many in fact, which is ultimately what lowers the film. In addition, the diversity of New York City, though insinuated in the many distant basins of the city and mentioned in conversations throughout the film, is never actually realized or analyzed to the point of doing justice to the city. For example, many skits involve well-off middle-aged whites. I mean I know that the city is home to many members of this population, but, thanks to the intrigue and diversity of the characters of Paris Je'taime, New York looks like Lancaster, Pennsylvania, or a place really White. It is simply disappointing to see the city reduced to such a heritage. <br /> <br /> Still, even after saying that, I would recommend giving New York, I Love You. Who knows, maybe you will disagree with my opinion and maybe not. You will never know until you see it for yourself. This notice is not intended to deter anyone from watching this movie, as everyone's opinion of the art is different. I'm just giving you a very vague overview of what to expect.
