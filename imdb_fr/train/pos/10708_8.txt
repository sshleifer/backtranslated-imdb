John (Ben Chaplin) is a lone bank employee living in a small town not far from London. Although the Internet, he contacts a Russian agency of wives. He chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman, the guy might be lonely and shy, but certainly tastes good, does not he?) And when they meet, he realizes she does not speak English. The communication between them is basically limited by sex (again, imagine, what a terrible situation for the guy, just have a naughty fuck with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, two Russian friends of her visited him. Then a lot of surprises will happen. I liked this movie: First, it's almost impossible to be tagged. Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller? I think all the choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is beautiful, as usual, and I'm very curious about her Russian: does she speak Russian with a correct accent, or pretend? Anyway, I found the movie nice. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "To Isca Perfeita" ("The perfect bait")
