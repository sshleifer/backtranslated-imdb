Independent functionality can now be seen as both a cinematographic work of art and a video resume. Enter Broken, and aggressively promoted, short of twenty minutes with style and enthusiasm to spare. But is it good as a movie or does it only work as a demo? Ah, there is in the lie the rubbing. <br /> <br /> Broken tells the story of Bonnie Clayton, kidnapped after being woken up a nightmare night by "a sadistic stranger and colorful entourage" (quote from the video box). As she is kept captive, it becomes clear that her captors know things about her that even did not know it. As they question him, a black-skinned soldier makes his way to their hiding place to try to save her. Mayhem ensues. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, the director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he's doing, or at least he knows how to pretend it. Broken does not suffer from any lack of visual flair, which is particularly commendable given its budget and the inexperience of everyone involved. What he is suffering from is a weak and derivative writing. Think Good Kiss Goodnight meets The Matrix, written ten minutes after reading Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer / writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the elements of the story are easily ignored by countless puffs of treats. Does the plot really matter as much in a twenty-minute short film intended to show the technical skills of its creators? Not really. <br /> <br /> Even if it would be unfair of me to neglect the negative aspects regarding the budget and the duration of the film. Broken is not a classic of the genre. The biggest problem was that it would have worked better as a feature film. The final "twist" does not take enough time to be shocking. If Ferrari had the time to slowly burn the feature film, the elements of the plot would seem less random and the film more complete. Discover how he has the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Audio Broken's Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation is unparalleled in the world of indie music. I have never heard such an aggressive entourage of such a small element. The Matrix-inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep, the shots have punch, and even the dialogue goes into the surround effects. Of all that is presented on this disc, it is the audio that praises the production of modern independent DVDs. An equally impressive Dolby 2.0 surround track is also included, which is the default value of the menu. <br /> <br /> Extras There are literally hours of feature creation on this drive. In fact, there are so many extras that I find unrealistic to list and describe them here, while still waiting for my readers to continue reading. Whatever the short film shortcomings, the DVD is unprecedented in its information resources. People who enjoyed the film can learn everything about its production, from conceptual art to the promotional campaign. Those who are thinking of creating their own independent film can learn just about everything they need to know through these features. <br /> <br /> The extras are divided into categorical menus. These include: pre-production, production, post-production, after the short film, as well as the biographies of the actors and the team. From a critical point of view, I found that some of the sections were quite short. If they had been modified in a menu option, they would have been less frustrating, because the cursor is positioned by default on the first selection each return to the menu of the main section. This is of course something to do, but perhaps for future DVD releases, filmmakers will take my advice to heart. <br /> <br /> It contains six audio commentaries, hours of interviews and talented people, and despite sales quality, their true colors are visible. <br /> <br /> The will to share their secrets of realization with those who take this DVD is quite generous. Thanks to the supplements, I learned which editing and effects software is the most reliable and efficient, which brand of camera creates the most professional appearance for the lowest price, even where to procure cheap airguns. In addition to that, I have been given several alternative options, in case I find myself unable to locate the products used for this particular production. Filmmakers wishing to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this DVD. <br /> <br /> Overall, I wrote the short at 6 out of 10, but I would like there to be an option for the length of the feature film. potential and effort, because I would have scored 8 or 9 in these areas. I recommend the DVD for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with only eight thousand US dollars. Those who buy the DVD can consider themselves ghost producers for a larger project. The more attention they attract, the more the feature film version would get funding.
