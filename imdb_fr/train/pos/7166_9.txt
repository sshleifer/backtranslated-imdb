Holes, the novel, was imposed on me in an education class. I did not think I would like a children's novel; Plus, the other two books I had to read for the class were really bad. But, to my surprise, I absolutely loved Holes. It's really one of the most perfectly written novels I've ever read. I think it has rare quality that makes it attractive to pre-teens, teens and adults. I think everyone who reads it will leave a better person. Although I can not really say that for the film, I am happy to say that they have generally understood it well. I do not think the movie's audience will be enriched, but they will certainly be entertained, without having the side effect of being more stupid when they sit down. It's an intelligent story and very well told. I think it moves a little too fast. The novel takes longer to develop the characters. And flashbacks come in and out so fast that they do not have much time to register. The interracial novel in the past seems more clich√©d and banal than in the novel. And the end, which connects all loose threads, seems very ridiculous. It's exactly the same in the novel, but there is a sense of absurdity that does not quite exist in the film. It works much better. I do not like the multitude of pop songs either. I hope Disney did not consider it necessary to sell soundtracks. The distribution is excellent at all levels, from the youngest to the oldest. Jon Voight is particularly great. We do not really know why we need Catwoman and Fonze. 9/10.
