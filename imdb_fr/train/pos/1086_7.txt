This film is a little unusual in that it has a very thin plot and the film itself is made at a very slow and slow pace. Although this makes it quite different from the average Grant movie, it remains very watchable and entertaining. It's a bit like someone saying, "Let's follow Cary and watch him upset by all the little problems that come up when you have a renovated house." Considering which entertaining actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the movie works very well. Although the film has fairly modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. This is a great movie for Cary Grant fans or the whole family.
