On July 19, I attended a small screening of this film, only knowing the names of some of the actors and explaining that this was a fantastic quest / adventure. <br /> <br /> The plot line This is really not what I saw, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with all that is happening now in the theaters or soon will be. Despite what first impressions can give, it's not ridiculous, old-fashioned, old-fashioned or ridiculous, and is actually a lot of fun and fun. The flow is pretty well done, nothing seems hasty or dragged. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds a lot to the film, instead of just filling the silence, as often happens in the movies or on television. And although I could have known what was going to happen, I still could not stand to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the cinema during the entire film. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as I can not understand why.
