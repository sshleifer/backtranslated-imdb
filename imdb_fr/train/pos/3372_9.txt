It's time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his recent death, but this film is not that one. BEN HUR, THE TEN COMMANDERS, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES are his best films. <br /> <br /> This film shot in 1973 tries to prophesize a future land, in 2022, it is so overpopulated that the authorities manipulated the human race to consume a food product called "Soylent Green", made all over the world and made with human flesh. This bizarre and improbable film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes that the Indian population that would be about 2 billion at this stage would then be meat eaters without knowing it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston's character that goes beyond the international secret conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by resorting to cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the producers of this film, the green message they send is not the party of the Greens of the current philosophy. Thank God. Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous peoples of New Zealand, Fiji, and Borneo until this film was shot for only 40 years, but it was long abandoned by human civilization. <br /> <br /> Another silly prediction of the film is that women become sex slaves by reversing the wave of radical feminism that was on the rise in 1972 when this film was shot. <br /> <br /> The movie was stupid at the time and is as stupid now, but contains a very last unchanging movie. fire performance and great Edward G. Robinson, but still not a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a flop of a movie and I would not even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other critics of this film that I read are all like a dystopian society in the future whose central theme only seems to involve the United States in which an ecological disaster has occurred. <br /> <br /> The film's only merit is that the Earth is confronted with overpopulation.
