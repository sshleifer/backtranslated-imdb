A masterpiece of the most commendable, not only for the underlying themes of the story, but also for the incomparably brilliant and ingenious film Angelopoulos, not to mention the game of giants, Mastroianni and Moreau, and the remarkable character of 'Ilias Logothethis. Gregory Karr's performance may seem overshadowed by his "difficult" partners at first, but in fact he perfectly embodies his character, which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl (Khrysikou) and the man (Mastroianni ), although it is already announced. (Where the spoiler.) <br /> <br /> Meet your expectations! It's a "film of art" in the sense that this sentence has to offer and requires attention. Not to spend free time, but to watch a work with the necessary concentration like to read a book or attend a concert. Due to the general style of the photos, it is recommended to watch a large screen. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are used sparingly. But the film includes, in addition to the standard Greek and English spoken languages, spoken Albanian, Kurdish and Turkish fragments, which will please those who are charmed by the beauty of listening to different languages.
