I first heard about this film about 20 years ago, when I was a child in primary school (!), I happened to leaf through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and under For movies (or cinema, I do not remember), there were several stills for different films ranging from mainstream to experimental, and one of them shown on the page was a still for OffOn. It really intrigued me, because that's what stands out most on the page (it's an excerpt from the film of the scene where the eye is superimposed with other superimposed elements). <br /> <br /> About 18 years later, the public library here where I live had at its disposal all 4 DVDs of "Treasures of American Film Archives" published by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I was reading the notes on the DVD boxes for the tray, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years, I could finally see the movie! After watching it, it was slightly less than I expected it to be (the film tended to be more organic, not that it was a bad thing, but I was expecting that it has a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive film, in my humble opinion, considering the techniques used by Scott Bartlett, including the manual dyeing of the film itself and the use of video equipment for some scenes from the film (filmed from a video monitor), which in distressed, bas-relief look. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the techniques used in this movie were pretty innovative for 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite short / experimental films, and a creative inspiration for me too ...
