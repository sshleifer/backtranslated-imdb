To say that Anton Newcombe of Brian Jonestown's Massacre could also use a therapy is a euphemism. In Dig! who won the Jury Grand Prix at Sundance, we watch him and his band self-sabotage for seven years, while former friends and contemporaries The Dandy Warhols reach heights (an advertisement for their cellphone, still). <br /> <br /> What raises Dig! Above his contemporaries lies the immense comic tragedy, almost biblical, that is played out: an extremely honest treatise on art versus trade and compromise. Despite all his postulates, Newcombe is in fact a particularly talented musician, although very troubled, much more talented than his rival, Courtney Taylor, of the Dandy, who tells the scene. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Taylor's Peter Fonda. <br /> <br /> Even sadder, Taylor seems to realize it, as evidenced by his tired and disgusting voice off: he knows his band won the battle - but what's Cost? In truth, they sold their records, created Indie-Lite records, kept their teeth clean and probably brushed their hair twice before going to bed - winning record deals and a big tour bus. And jettisoning any credibility in the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in filth, is continually bursting, strikes the other members of the band on stage, hits the rowdy in the head - and is the last glimpse of Dig! to be taken away by the police after losing the right to see their child. <br /> <br /> Two of the best movies about the rock subculture have been made by women: The Decline Of Western Civilization by Penelope Spheeris and this one ?? a classic moment at the moment of its release.
