I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really liked it. Stone has once again delivered a very good character. She was as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. She always has these smart but delicate answers. Although Sharon may be 48 ... she looks amazing! I do not care if she's as wrong as a Barbie. She looks good and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the beginning. Sex, violence and a great ending that will let you think and talk for hours! Half of the people commenting on this film did not even see it. So do not listen to them.
