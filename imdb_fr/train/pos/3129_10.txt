It's one of the best special gatherings of all time, with Adam West and Burt Ward parodying and having fun. It's amazing how much effort is spent in detail, especially to get back to the 1960s vibe, the Batcave, Wayne Manor set, the costumes and the actors chosen to interpret the younger versions of West, Ward , Burgess Meredith and Cesar Romero. and Frank Gorshin! These 90 minutes are well worth your time and delight all the fans of the television series "Batman" of the 1960s. I notice that the clips of "Batman" come from the film and not from the series, probably because of legal restrictions. Let's hope that the three seasons of the show are coming on DVD.
