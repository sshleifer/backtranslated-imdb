This film has everything. The emotion, the power, the affection, the adorable dance on the bare beach of Stéphane Rideau ... This highlights the need for a true communion and an external communication in all relationships. It's not because Cédric and Mathieu are gay that it's not really useful for anyone. I would probably classify it as a gay movie, but it can be enjoyed and loved by straight, gay and bisexual people. Mathieu's inability to manage his emotions reveals the way in which our society does not encourage us to act differently, and this is what causes the discord between him and Cédric. It's really a must !!!
