"I moved here to get away from this kind of thing!" The sheriff of the little town laments. <br /> <br /> "Does this happen often in Chicago?" His assistant asks. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians are confusing the replay of Orson Welles' war of worlds with Halloween as a tale of a real Martian invasion and deduce that they need to embark on the action! The following are a series of mishaps involving the Martian's random attempts to conquer the city of "Big Bean, IL". Everyone concludes that they are children dressed in very good costumes, with the exception of the sheriff's daughter and her friend, a child dressed in a duck suit. <br /> <br /> The Martians themselves are comical and you have the impression that they pose no threat to anyone except themselves early enough. It's a fun family movie.
