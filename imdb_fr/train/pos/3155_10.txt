I wish "this show of the 70's" to come back on television. It was the biggest show of all time !!! They should make episodes between the other episodes, but of course, that would be confusing. But I wish he could come back and make more episodes. Please come back ... The show was absolutely hilarious. You could not laugh without seeing an episode. There's a really funny part in every episode and besides, the show was so much better when Hyde and Jackie went out together. These are the best episodes. "This show of the 70's is the best" ... It will be and always be the best show of all time. It was really sad when the show ended. They should make new episodes.
