"Kalifornia" is a good Hollywood odyssey of suspense and terror that tells the story of two couples traveling to California to share the cost of gasoline: a pair of losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two Wannabee artists, one photographer and a writer (Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt "nails" his character who is at the center of this rather predictable thriller. A good watch for those who love the psycho-killer flix.
