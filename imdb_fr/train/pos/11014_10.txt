I loved watching Cliffhanger. At first, when this woman (Sarah) was full of terror when she slipped, I thought it was a terrifying scene because I would think that when you see this, your nerves in your body catch you because it makes you scared. and your heart beats faster. I loved watching Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is an excellent actor and I think he will be known to play Rambo and Rocky.
