I will be brief and brief, the people who wrote the scripts for this show are great, the actors are perfect for the roles they play (the character of CJ is legendary) and they have so much chemistry on the screen that in this is a very successful comedy. <br /> <br /> When I saw the new episodes for the first time probably going back a little over 6/7 months, I wondered what had happened to Paul. I was shocked to learn he had died when I visited Google. He was so funny and played his character to perfection, a father too protective, who likes to keep his girls out of the limelight and boys. <br /> <br /> The comedy, I think, went from strength to strength, even without Paul. <br /> <br /> Also, I think most people would like to watch this.
