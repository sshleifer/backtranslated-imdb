The funniest and funest Brooks movie I've ever seen. I can watch and watch the tape again 100 times. I laugh a little and I cry a few moments. It's a really good and fun movie, and if you like Brooks - it's a must! In short, Brooks (Billion Dollars) is on the homeless street for 30 days in order to win all of his competitor's poor neighborhood. The reality bites, but in the end, it is about warm relations between humans ... I highly recommend it!
