I just saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies last night and I was blown away by the performance of Victor McLaglen: In every sense of the word, a "tour de force". The atmosphere of 1922 in Dublin, evoked through cinematography and the conception of production, foreshadowed techniques used in the best black films of the 1940s and early 1950s. Very nice attention to detail, too; Gaelic. Max Steiner's score is unforgettable. As in later films such as GWTW of 1939, he appropriated folkloric ballads to give a local color and a sense of place and time. John Ford: already a movie giant in 1935!
