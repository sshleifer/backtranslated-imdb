This film is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage in financial difficulty. When the director goes on vacation, his father agrees to intervene temporarily to direct activities. <br /> <br /> This is the best job Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea of ​​renting children in the film is immediately innovative and his sales techniques will certainly make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I'll never forget it. Just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Such family fun is so rare nowadays. If you opt for slightly cheesy pictures with a happy ending, go for this one! I could watch this again and again, and I do it often! My only complaint about this film is that it is so difficult to find a copy.
