In my opinion, WHEN TURNS KILLS is a very touching and heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic. Whenever Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) vomited, I wanted to vomit. It's a bit difficult to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative on some things. However, I enjoyed seeing them doing things together and classes given by their parents. Before closing, I'd like to say, "If you ask me, WHEN DOES KILLS FRIENDLY show you how an anorexic or bulimic can affect a person's body?" In conclusion, I recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. You want to cry and have a good time, so next time you watch TV, relax with a friend and watch him.
