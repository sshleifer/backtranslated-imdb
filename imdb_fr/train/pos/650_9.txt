A good movie, rather stimulating than really entertaining. Unfortunately, no memorable quotes here, but this one is my favorite: Alexander: If you leave someone you liked, you must say what I'm saying to you now: "Farewell, I'm going." But to disappear, to hide like a criminal, is ignoble. (did not watch it with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this expresses everything. There are so many tactics in the relations between Alexander and the others and yet everyone longs for a little more truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as Alexander knows. The current interpretation is that the film criticizes the mere possibility of a "liberated love" by describing the undesirable implications for the people involved. This is convincing, but I would be grateful if the reasons were treated a little more deeply: it is not that the liberated love is in itself doomed to failure, but the people (especially men, I think) should work on themselves and try to overcome morality in place before and not by the practice of liberated love. <br /> <br /> That said, the film is realistic and really worth watching.
