"Fido" is to be commended for taking a tired genre, the zombies, and making it a cinematic experience of the most original. The atmosphere of the early 50's is breathtaking, the acting is great and the entire production shows careful planning. Suddenly, the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars, Eisenhower era dresses, art deco furniture and zombie servants. It would be very easy to reject "Fido" as a comic duvet, similar to "Tank Girl", but the two films are very different. "Fido has a structure, storytelling that tells a story and a great acting game, make no mistake, it's a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed." Highly recommended - MERK
