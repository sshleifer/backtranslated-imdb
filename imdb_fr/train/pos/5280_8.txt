Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan origin. Despite his Muslim heritage, his attitudes and values ​​are very French. All of a sudden, his father announces that Reda will lead him to the Hajj (pilgrimage) in Mecca - which Reda has no interest in doing but accepts only by obligation. As a result, from the beginning, Reda is angry, but being a traditional Muslim man, it is difficult to talk to his father about his fears. The father and son seem very rigid and inflexible - and it is very ironic that the father tells his son that he should not be so stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, it says how much the characters grew up and got to know each other. However, I really do not think they did it and that's the fascinating and sad aspect of the film. Of course, there were moments of understanding, but there was so often an undercurrent of hostility and repression. In fact, I liked it and appreciated the fact that there was no complete resolution - it would have seemed phony. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is well played and fascinating - offering Westerners an unusual insight into Islam and Hajj. It also offers a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional Islam and the young secular generation. Although the slow and unclear relationship over the course of the film may bother some, I think it gave the film an intense realism and made it look like a film about people - not a formula . A nice and unusual movie.
