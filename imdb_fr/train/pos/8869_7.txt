In this little film, we have some great characters but a very superficial plot. It's really nice to watch because Singleton does a great job in presenting esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This makes the director forget the non-existent realism to which this film is supposed to be intended. In fact, here we have all the possible clich√©s and stereotypes about celluloid at a rate higher than that of a soap. It's certainly not a deep film (although it wants to be), but better than an average university film.
