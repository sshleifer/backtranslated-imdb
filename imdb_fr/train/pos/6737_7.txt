The director and two stars of LAURA (1944) have been reinstated for this strong policeman: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop who cuts all ties with the past but can not control his inherited violent methods while questioning suspects and, one night, he goes too far; Gene Tierney is the separated wife of his victim, a decorated war hero who was involved in the city's biggest racketeer and Andrews first enemy, Gary Merrill (who had himself been Andrews protégé) Snr.)! As usual with Preminger, this is a well-crafted film with a remarkable sequence of generics and a good cast including also Karl Malden (as Andrews' outgoing superior), Tom Tully (as father of Tierney's motorized taxi driver) and Neville Brand (as Merrill's chief thug), with the notable support of Craig Stevens (as a meager, victim of spousal abuse), Bert Freed (as a partner Andrews sympathizer) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews outgoing superior). Having already been warned by the latter to recover, Andrews panics and imitates Stevens a few hours after his assassination to put the police on the wrong track of Merrill; However, once Tully became the prime suspect (at that time, Andrews and Tierney are involved in a romantic relationship), the policeman goes alone to Merrill's lair to be crushed and "condemned "the racketeer for his own murder! Clearly, the protagonist is a complex character and Andrews takes up the challenge with a characterization of the first order, usually complemented by the internal style of Black Fox.
