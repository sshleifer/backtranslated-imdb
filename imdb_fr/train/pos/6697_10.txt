I remember first looking at Sabrina when it was British TV ITV1 when I was 13/14 years old. I am now 24 years old and I still love it as much today as when I first watched it. I get a little stick from some of my friends to watch another children's show, but I do not care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal favorite character and later, Morgan has also become another of my favorite characters. I remember spending so much time watching various special events in honor of Sabrina on Nickeleoden UK. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was excellent in "Clarrissa explains everything" but so much better in this area. I was emptied when they decided to finish it! I hope it will be released soon on DVD here in the UK - I'll be the first online! lol x
