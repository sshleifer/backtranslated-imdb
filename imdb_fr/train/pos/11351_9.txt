Excellent movie. The whole picture was shot in Budapest, so I'm proud. My problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV) and it is obvious that they were used in big trains, not in the local railways - according to the Chikatilo's story has gathered its victims local train stations. Apart from that, the film is superb.
