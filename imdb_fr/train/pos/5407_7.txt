I always liked Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, they're all very tacky, mediocre in some areas, and of course, even if they're for little kids, they're too grown up in some areas to be able to protect them with the following statement: "Hey, lighten up , it's a children's movie, "but all that aside, are not good pieces of entertainment yet? In my opinion, they are and I appreciate them greatly. This one is just as nice as the previous three and certainly more cute. There are some very sweet and touching moments since the introduction of the cool Pokemon Celebi magnet. This is not the best Pokemon movie, but I appreciate it more than the third part, although the third is not bad and the whole series is just entertaining, harmless and fun for the pop family. -corn and should be considered neither more nor less. This film has good marks of intensity and interest, especially around the apogee / end, as are all the episodes, and the characters, though they are a little duller than the previous three, are always friendly and humorous. This film is the least rated and the most criticized of the four feature film adaptations, and it does not deserve it.
