If you have not seen Eva Longoria from the TV show "Desperate House Wives", you'll miss it. Eva will be one of the biggest Latin stars and you will see her soon in theaters. It was Eva's first film and she does a fantastic job. She was 24 when she shot, and looked hot then. Regarding this low-budget film, it's pretty good for the director for the first time, which has another upcoming film, "Juarez, Mexico", currently featured in many film festivals across the states. -United. In fact, it seems that some news broadcast only partially in theaters. What would be nice to see is a "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
