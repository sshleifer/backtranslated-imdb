The original DeMille film was made in 1938 with Frederic March. A very good movie indeed. The Hollywood love of remakes brings us an interesting movie with Yul Brynner. Of course, he was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all his films. Charlton Heston like Andrew Jackson was a stroke of genius. However, the film has tended to be a bit long in places. It does not move to the rhythm of the 1938 version. Still, it's a fun movie that should be seen at least once.
