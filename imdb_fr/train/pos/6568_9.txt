I had the pleasure of watching this movie when it was released and it is still the case today. A simple story featuring the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer who comes straight from the pocket story. He has actors who were more recognizable at the time. This should not prevent the viewer from giving it a whirlwind. Wayne Crawford plays the main character Jake Speed. Of course, he could bite some elements of Romancing the Stone, and Indiana Jones. But this film is well enough done to keep it outside the cellar. I am surprised that not many people know it. It must have been overshadowed by other movies in movie theaters in 1986. I watched it at the time on cable TV. It can be hard to find because it is sold out on VHS and DVD. I managed to get an ebay DVD for less than 8 dollars! Cool movie.
