It's a very beautiful film. Color photography is beautiful because it shows the sumptuousness of the Metropolitan Opera House in brilliant colors. Other interior scenes in various mansions, etc. are equally brilliant. As for the music, what more could it say than Lanza's voice was at its peak when he sang a lot of the most famous and appreciated tunes in the world. The wonderful Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy because her soprano voice mixes with that of Lanza in a delightful harmony. Of course, Hollywood has taken back its usual liberties with the story of Caruso's life. In the story, there are few precious things about real events. For example, the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and have nothing to do with the truth. There are very good websites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several images of him. These websites can be located using any good search engine. There are also several books available concerning his life story. But, the fictional story does nothing to ruin this beautiful movie. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten and the members of the choir are the real stars of this film. Enjoy it, I know I did it.
