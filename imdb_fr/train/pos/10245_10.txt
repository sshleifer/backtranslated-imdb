it was one of my favorites when I was young, it had the best of 90s kids movies ... adorable dinosaurs, lovely kids, crazy villain and some awesome songs (and not the typical little mermaid songs of the type of the beast, but the ones that are generally entertaining)! I met this movie again recently and I still love it so much! I recommend everyone to see this movie, and I really think it should be presented to younger generations! sorry not the most informative, I'm a little in a hurry ... just please, trust me. all those who go against this film kill their inner child!
