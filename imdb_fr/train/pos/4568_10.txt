Seriously, can you imagine such a dispersal of talent in a film without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards: but it would have been quite legitimate to see O'Conor (Young Christie) and McAnally rewarded: the clich√© is true here: they do not interpret the roles, they live in them. The performance of Day-Lewis is a tour de force - a transformation so impressive, but it was really a hallmark of the Academy's intelligence that also paid tribute to Brenda Fricker for her magnificent, motionless, heartbreaking work as that mother of Christie. By the way, if you have not seen this beautiful actress in "Swann", this is another film that deserves a visit for her contribution (and the sublime Miranda Richardson).
