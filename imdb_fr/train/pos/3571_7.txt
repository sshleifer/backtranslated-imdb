I have seen this film twice with my teens who love it. This one should be a fave cult! The best line, "Your dress is deeply cool!" said the prince to Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like stepmother. I also love cars and motorcycles from the 1950s. The melancholic prince is a great departure from the typical swashbuckler. He tries to stay calm, but does not hide his love for the future princess. His slipper is not glass (more faithful to the origin), but Cinderella loses, but it recovers from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it can not be seen anymore and seems almost impossible to obtain. Hopefully Blockbuster or Amazon will soon start storing this one.
