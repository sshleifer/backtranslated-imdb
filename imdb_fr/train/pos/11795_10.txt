I will never forget this movie or the events that led to Jonestown in Guyana. It sounds so tragic, but it has to be said. The Boothe powers give a remarkable performance as a leader, Reverend Jim Jones, from darkness to total madness. He would have easily earned an Academy Award if he went out to theaters. This is the kind of mini-series you will not forget. You will not forget the images of the brutality, control and obsession of the sect of its leader. His rise and fall and the threat of the outside world to destroy what he considered paradise. Mass suicide is horrible, almost unreal to the imagination of the reason why so many (over 900) went of their own free will or resisted Joe's orders. They are no longer mini-series like this where we are left speechless and eager to know what happened to others.
