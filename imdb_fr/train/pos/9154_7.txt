All right except the end which was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> The scenario was very good, as was the acting game. The visuals were often very grainy, but somehow it added to the film because the snowy characteristics were well placed, which helped to create a favorable atmosphere for the film. This affect has been ruined by the extremely incredible end. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this film an 8 out of 10, but its end was a point to 7 because it seemed to deviate drastically from the first 75 minutes of the film and seemed rather forced to the end to make the filmmakers look smart. <br /> <br /> This film, however, was much better than the movies with much bigger budgets and seemed to be shot like a movie at home with extra material. Not a lot of special effects, but for the suspense, it was very good.
