Sensational. I saw that last night and I'm still in shock. Each character felt so real (though most of them are small, selfish and selfish) and the weird story - a middle-aged widow starts to fuck her daughter's clumsy boyfriend - turned out to be all quite convincing. The best performances in all respects but hat to Anne Reid and Daniel Craig of Our Friends of the North (the latter appearing as the next David Thewlis). <br /> <br /> And the director Roger Michell? This is as far from Notting Hill as possible. Thanks my God. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
