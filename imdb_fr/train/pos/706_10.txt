I must say that I wanted to see this movie for a long time and I was not disappointed. Dominic Monaghan's game is just fantastic. Insomniac myself, I can understand how the story develops. I have never seen anything like this, but some awakening times overlap with sleep and it can be scary. It was an excellent movie, worth every penny. I hope someday I can work with Tess myself, it would be an honor and beyond. I can recommend it to everyone. Maybe not little kids because they might be scared. But if you are an insomniac like me, you will understand the world, the mysteries and the fear. You'll love it. <br /> <br /> F.
