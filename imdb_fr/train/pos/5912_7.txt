of Danish Youssef <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" is a film by Ralph Bakshi, which would be a satirical indictment of films on blaxploitation and negative stereotypes about black, as well as a dark look at life in modern America (modern for the day, I mean - 1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just ignited. <br /> <br /> But this is a Bakshi film, controversial, exciting and must-see, almost by definition. Not just another random "shock-jock" of a movie that tries to shock for shock. It's by Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a film, he has something to say ... <br /> <br /> Although his roots are based on a cheap blaxploitation, "Coonskin" is not a another camper who hits - out of the big white film or any kind of disposable film. "Coonskin" wants to be more. It aims higher and fries much bigger fish. <br /> <br /> The movie does not just make fun of the genre. Neither does it denounce blacks, but it actually seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells the story of some convicts waiting for incarceration. The fact that it is even possible to get out of a prison in the world "Coonskin" alone makes it old fashioned. <br /> <br /> One of the inmates tells the story of a trio of black brothers in Harlem, named Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Preacher Fox who want respect and a share of the action and who are ready to obtain it by all necessary means. The Itallian crowd directs all the real actions. <br /> <br /> Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black playwright to win the Pulitzer, are one of the best black musicians. Obviously, something big is happening here. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds as a descent into this world, on this side of the racial divide. A black man angry, hip, deep, soul, with a hate in his heart and a weapon in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word "sublety". He seems to have never heard of this word. But perhaps a subject like this needs extremism. True satire of sledgehammer. Some topics can not be approached gently. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is a merciless damned. Here, no member or minority of the Harlem scene seems unscathed. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" or "real", it depends on the atmosphere and the situation. Animated characters and human beings all share the same reality and are supposed to be taken literally. <br /> <br /> Bakshi never only shows ugly caricatures for shock. He always has something to say. The black face is not free. Here, unlike Spike Lee's "Bamboozled", he seems to be using it to try to really say something. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all Bakshi movies, this one incorporates animation and real action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki is not just gimmicky here. All this technique is intertwined, entangled while saying something. <br /> <br /> In one way or another, it seems inevitably dated. Many of these types of films (Bakshi included) are very current, very urgent. They reflect the certain trend of the day, but a few years later, there is an undeniable feeling of nostalgia (and timeless truth). <br /> <br /> Even though music, clothes, slang and the city clearly looks like photos belonging to a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same regardless their ear. Anyone who has really seen the movies, the state of things and has been in the company of people knows what I am talking about. <br /> <br /> Even some of the black characters are a rabbit (junglebunny), a big bear and a fox. One of the most bitter and disreputable racist characters is a dirty Harlem cop who is on the trail of these "dirty n ----- s" after the death of a cop. But for him, it's not just business. Nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield. It's a pure sadistic racist pleasure to hurt the blacks. <br /> <br /> The sequence featuring the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces of the film, which has many. This is played like an opera or a ballet. <br /> <br /> The promotion line: WARNING: "This film offends everyone!" It's not just hype. Proceed with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You have been warned ... <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
