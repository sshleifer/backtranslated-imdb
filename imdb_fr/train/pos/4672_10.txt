I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Festival and I loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are excellent as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen's parole in Alaska to his family in Brooklyn. He introduces himself because his brother is dead and he begins to slowly repair his relationship with the wife and child of his brother and father, who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. The story immerses us in the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to understand more deeply the complexity of their lives. In addition, the imagery of the woodworking industry and Brooklyn's backdrop set the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
