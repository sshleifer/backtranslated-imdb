Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (in a small role) are all brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly adept at this type of role, where he must portray a character whose morality is, at first, uncertain for the public. As is often the case with Sutherland's characters, we must ask ourselves "Is he a villain [minor, in this case] or a hero?" <br /> <br /> It's a troubling story, intelligently told, about the incompetence and scary bureaucracy of the former Soviet Union, which has hindered the efforts of extremely competent people. As the character of Sutherland sneakily notes, "the measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions". The "committee meeting" (between the characters of Rea and Sutherland) after the application of perestroika, with its revelations, has a huge emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who have worked in this system. <br /> <br /> The handful of dramatic scenes describing the victim's family members adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story. It's rarely a film that deals with this disgusting subject, but it actually reminds us that the victims had a life and were loved. <br /> <br /> This is a sad but very important film that deserved its showcase. on Canadian history television.
