From the first scene, I was really excited. "I can say it's going to be great!" I thought. The acting was so good that I felt like I was spying on the lives of these people. The music was also deliciously disturbing. The plot began with a sudden event and then drifted (one could feel) towards an irrevocable destiny. The construction was slow, but I personally like that kind of thing, as long as the calm tension stays on track and does not get derailed before being paid. <br /> <br /> Everything will be fine, and then the fireworks begin and, before you know it, the credits are rolling. "WHAT?!!!" That was all I could say with my movie mate. If you understand the director's intentions, the frank end makes sense (for those of you who have already seen the film, check out the fascinating and hilarious interview of Larry Fessenden on filmcritic.com), but I can not to stop saying it. This was probably not solved with just ten minutes more material before the climax. In any case, it's a shame. These ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world. (But for those of you who do not write and do not make movies, know that developing a narrative arc with the right timing is a huge pain in the back, and I certainly do not make that criticism of a any pedestal!) <br /> <br /> Wendigo seems to me to be an abandoned masterpiece before the end. But hey, I would take a dull masterpiece every day for a piece of over-the-counter poo-dog over-compensated by too much digital effects (like most horror movies nowadays). <br /> <br /> Another comment. Some scenes of monsters left me confused as to whether I should be afraid or laugh. I do not know how to explain it, but there was a peculiar impression of Monty Python about this monster in its more "flagrant" forms of "monster". Although it may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie - I do not know, it still worked for me in a twisted way. I will never look at stag antlers again in the same way! :)
