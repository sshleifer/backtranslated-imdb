As someone else commented, it's a movie that feels good. There are beautiful landscapes and the wonderful voice of Luciano! I have seen this film many times and I have seen it again this afternoon. I had forgotten how much I missed the singing of Nessun Dorma by Pavarotti and I needed to get the CD out! It's a great movie to spend the afternoon absorbed by daydream and fun. Eddie Albert is a big agent and a bit exaggerated, but all the agents are just that. The Italian countryside is beautiful but nothing beats the balloon flight for a perfect view. If you need to play Olivier's proportion, this movie is not for you. If you just want a flight and some wonderful music, watch this movie. Just enjoy!
