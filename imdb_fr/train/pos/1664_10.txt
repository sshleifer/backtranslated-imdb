I thought this film was beautiful, with quite exceptional performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Cervi portrays Artemisia beautifully, with hesitant but confidential ways. in law. Artemisia's passion for her art is simply spectacular to watch. <br /> <br /> Even though each character was not overtly gorgeous, it made the film more realistic because the facial hair and clothes were perfect for that moment. . <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie fantastic.
