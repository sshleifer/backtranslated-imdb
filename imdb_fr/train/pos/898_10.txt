One would have to be very jaded for not falling into that movie gem (and I've already seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies). The actors, the beautiful scenery, the places and the environments, the deep emotions depicted, the sweet songs (especially the singing voice of Udit Narayan, my favorite) - everything was just adorable. The human element (imperfect) has also been incorporated to create a drama and drive the plot, while allowing a sincere resolution. Alok Nath is such a great actor. So open to the emotions of the characters he represents, he almost steals the limelight from young stars. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves real romance - from superficial beauty to true love - as one of the best movies, Hindi or not!
