For those of us, baby boomers arrived too late to enjoy James Dean and. al., Martin Sheen showed us The Way in this great feature. <br /> <br /> The principle is pretty simple: the cool hood meets the sheriff of the little town and All-Hell ensues, but the inner workings of this film captivate car nut in all of us. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Casablanca, nor the great literature, but it's a serious film about the cars, the rebellion and the genius of Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and enjoy it for what it is and for what Martin will become. I loved this movie that grew up in the 70's, and you too.
