This is certainly an appropriate update for the original, except that "the party on the left is now the party on the right". Like the original, this film is dead against a federal government that oversteps its limits on individual freedom. It is a warning about the fragility of our political freedoms in the era of a zealous and overpowering federal government. Kowalski is a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge, where the US government, with the cooperation of mainstream media, has broadcast words like "white supremacist" and "right-wing extremists," as well as drug charges of its citizen rights, with the voluntary acquiescence of the general population.This message is so non-PC, I am stunned that this film can be shot - at least not without putting the federal government via the IRS against the makers as they do to Juanita Broderick , to Katherine Prudhomme, to the Western Journalism Center, and to countless others who have dared to speak (to some) message from this film. <br /> <br />
