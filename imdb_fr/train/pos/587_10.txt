One of the things about the film that warmed my heart was that dry fly fishing was an important part of the scene. I have occasionally spent time fishing dry fly, having tied my own flies and accompanied by my brother and my father, we spend a day on a river or another trying to try brown trout, still elusive, to get up and fly. it was offered to them. <br /> <br /> When we had opportunities like this, any difference between us and all the pressures of the world disappeared to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed by the activity and the surroundings of the place where we were. <br /> <br /> This is one of the amazing things that was presented to me in the film when the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly, were performing the ritual. Because there is something ritual in fly fishing, just as there is something ritual in so many hobbies. You can not just start throwing your fishing line and hope for the best. You must adapt to where you are, you must scan the surface of the water considering its flow and the best point to place your fly. Depending on your skill level, you could even get your fly to land long enough for a fish to take note of it and hit it. The art of fly fishing has been so well directed and represented that they can themselves be called artists. <br /> <br /> The title of the film can not be better chosen, because the river is well defended through the life of father and two sons. However, this film spreads more widely than the Montana family and community on the Blackfoot River, where the film takes place. He has the ability to attract you, captivate you, capture you as the story of the family, the community and the time unfolds. The story told is not just a family story, but a story of life. What can be classified as a "river of life"
