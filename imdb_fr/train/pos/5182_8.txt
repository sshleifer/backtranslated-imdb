A calm, sweet and wonderfully nostalgic film about the confrontation with old friends and the surroundings of your youth with all those memories and the problems and sorrows of the present with you. A film that feels good. All the ingredients are together: old jealousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Distrust, night raids in the refrigerator and all the other fun stuff we all remember about our summer camps. For one week, all the characters have the opportunity to experience this experience as the former head of the camp retires and wishes to meet the children of the golden years of the camp. All are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers.
