I thought the youngest kevin dillon was hot.hahahaha ... but I also thought the girl was stupid. the cop and that was wrong what he had told her before her death "I was inside you" .I think that's what she gets for doing what she did with he and how is he going to tell her that she is too young when he never cared how old were the other girls? Now, I do not think I can trust a policeman like that. But to tell the truth, it was obvious that it was him, even if he wanted to become a policeman, I would always be suspicious. and it was funny when she sprinkled him in the eyes in the shop.hahahahahaha. She was always stupid to go back alone to the warehouse, and the policeman died HELLO !! it's called a backup. Sometimes these movies drive me crazy when people act stupidly and do stupid things. But that's what I think is a thought for the film.
