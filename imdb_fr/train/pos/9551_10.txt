I must say that I was surprised by the quality of the film. It was better than I expected. The scenario and the game are pretty good. The director has also done a good job. Although some scenes seem a little awkward, it's a decent movie overall. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth was not revealed until the end. The atmosphere of the psychiatric hospital was pretty good. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people may find this a bit boring because the storyline is very precise and takes a lot of time for character development and storytelling. Moral of the story, it's a decent movie for its kind and it's surprisingly good.
