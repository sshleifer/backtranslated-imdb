I have to start saying that I have not seen it for a long time, but I have seen it 5 times or more; a wonderful little party that is clearly inspired by the musical / actress associations of new or endangered stars with leading musical groups. The mysteries of Kay Kyser would be a good example. <br /> <br /> The best part of the series is to let Spike Jones go wild, because he and his band play many tunes and are part of the action. support. Hugh O'Brien plays face, Buddy Hackett, the rumor that it would have been offered to Lou Costello and therefore to Abbott and Costello who would replace the main roles. I do not know if it was true. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a nice film, but it's important that Spike Jones and his band be filmed for the story. I wish it to be published because I have not seen or heard about it for two decades. I hope it's not lost
