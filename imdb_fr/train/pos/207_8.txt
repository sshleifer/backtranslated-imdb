At first, it sounded like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got into this movie, it turned out to be a really funny movie. Willy Clark (winner of the Golden Globes, and Walter Matthau, Oscar and BAFTA nominee) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner and George Burns, named Golden Gloves) were an excellent duo of comedies and a group brought together to revive their portrait of the hospital. for a television show. Willy's nephew, Ben Clark (Richard Benjamin, winner of the Golden Globe) is confident that they can meet again without resentment for each other, how wrong he is. They can not get along all the time, they are forgetful, especially during the conversation, but they do it eventually. Also starring Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, Al Daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy Nurse and F. Murray Abraham as that Mechanic of Muppets from Space. I think the best replica of the movie is Burns, mentioning that Matthau called him "a son of a bitch". He was named BAFTA for Best Screenplay and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Film - Musical / Comedy and was nominated for BAFTA Best Screenplay. Best scenario. Very well!
