Nice despite the performance of Leslie Howard. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat and uninteresting character. We are supposed to have pity on this man; However, I find myself applauding Mildred from Bette Davis. Ms. Davis gives one of her best performances (she received an Oscar nomination). Thanks to her performance, she gives life to this rather dull film. ** Make sure you do not miss the moment when Mildred tells Philip exactly what she feels for him.
