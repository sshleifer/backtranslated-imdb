I have to start by apologizing because I thought the first 75-80% of this movie was hilarious. This is mainly because of the performance of Brad Pitt. Spot on. <br /> <br /> The acting game was pretty good but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in every respect. I'm not a fan of Pitt, but it must be one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> Brutal, Honest, Gritty. All the right words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I was reading a previous review and the person stated that the reasoning behind Early's violence was not explained. That's explained, but fortunately, they do not need to go into graphic details to get their message across. <br /> <br /> Overall, I assigned this value to 9 because each scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie. Unknown.
