This film was excellent. A sad truth about how culture tends to run up against the sexes. This is just a big type of hot and blurry film. You have the master who is steeped in tradition and generous in his way, Doggie although it is a girl to gain his affections and you complete it with a cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This equates to a big happy movie in the end. This film shows how much we can be steeped in tradition, so impregnated that they are ready to die without sharing their secrets. You see facets of an unprecedented culture that help to improve the drama unfolding towards the end of the image. The cinema photography is excellent, especially the opening sequence of the parade with all the sparkers. Linked to be in the running for the best foreign film.
