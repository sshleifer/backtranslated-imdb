I agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza, it was the most beautiful voice that God could offer if only he had found the courage to leave for Hollywood and to go to the opera, he could have been the American Caruso. Everyone says that it could have been, but in any case it is a fantastic introduction to the art form without the bump on it and if that's how it's going to be like that. see the movie, you'll see why Mr. Lanza is still in discussion, even at home. Someone says Pavarotti, I say MARIO LANZA. As for the movie itself, when it will be on DVD, you have to restore it and the VHS is not good enough, but it should also be the only movie in Lanza put on DVD, the others are totally bad and boring .
