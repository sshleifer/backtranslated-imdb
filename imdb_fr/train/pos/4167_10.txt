The Devil's Dog: Hound of Hell is really a good movie. He has a good acting cast, including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong. The music is spooky and gives that diabolical thrill! I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns, which flew like a part of its neck and acted really viscous! I've never seen The Devil Dog before and I can find and buy that rare movie, and then do it because it's a good movie and I do not think you'll be disappointed!
