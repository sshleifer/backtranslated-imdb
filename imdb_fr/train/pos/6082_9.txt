I've always liked Kenneth Branagh's versions of Shakespeare classics, because he's always doing a really good job, but in this film, the one who's raising the entire film is none other than "always big actor" Laurence Fishburne. Certainly, he made bad choices in the movies, even if he is a great actor, but in this one, we really have the real Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as she grows up to sides of Fishburne's well-described paranoia and, moreover, we finally have a black Othello! <br /> <br /> I do not think they could have picked a better Othello. Who else could have given him that mixture of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate and, not to forget, those ardent eyes ...? Branagh is good as always, but not at its peak, Irena Jacob's Desdemona is pretty good but a bit dark, while Laurence Fishburne really raises it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable film. Look at him.
