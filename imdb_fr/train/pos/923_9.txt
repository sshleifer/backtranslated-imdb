I never saw it on TV, but I rented the DVD from Netflix as soon as I found it available. I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. It's funny and the animation is excellent. This level of quality I only expected for feature films, so I'm surprised some negative comments about it. Maybe the DVD version had improved the animation? A bonus to the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the driver. I am an adult and I really appreciate that it is for adults. It's not just kids who love cute animated characters. As some have claimed, it is far from being "hot", but I see where some parents would not want their young children to see it. I am very disappointed that this has been canceled. I wish they produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
