This movie hit the house for me. At 29, I remember the 80s and my father working in a factory. I thought that if I worked hard too, if I had the pride and never gave up, I could also have the American dream, the house, some children, a car, mine. However, I noted that without a diploma in something (unlike my father who resigned in the ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would like to know. if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. it's done for television and I just saw it an hour ago. I can not find him anywhere! I would like to show this to my friends, my pseudo-friends, my family and other loved ones, see what they think and remind them that once upon a time, Americans SHOULD work to feel honored and we were proud of who they were. accomplished !! I think the feeling is still there, but in a downward spiral with so much stuff made abroad ...
