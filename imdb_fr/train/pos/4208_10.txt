From time to time, this movie is out of the box that no one has ever heard of and that was filmed very quickly with very little money and resources, but everyone goes crazy and is surprisingly great. It also happened in the '50s with a lot of little movies that few people have heard of. There are really surprising little jewels unknown to the 50s that deserve to be discovered. "Panic in the Streets" is another film like this one that comes to mind. Both are movies that do not really look like the usual genre films of their day and are also made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised how much I ended up loving this movie. It really was a movie that was improving as progress made. Like all "old" movies, the movie tends to start a little slowly, but once you get into the story, you get a real pleasure with the characters. This film has a really great story. <br /> <br /> this involves spying, although the movie does not start like that. It starts as a typical thriller with a touch of black film. But "Pickup on South Street" is not really a movie in numbers, so he's starting to take his own directions very soon. This ensures that the film remains a surprising film but especially very refreshing to watch. <br /> <br /> I also really liked the characters in this movie. None of them are really good and they all have their flaws and weaknesses. Really human. Thelma Ritter, who was even nominated for the Oscars, deserves her place. It really has to be one of the biggest female roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Even in spite of its relatively modest budget, it is simply a superb little original and special film that deserves to be seen more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
