Noni Hazlehurst's performance (which earned him an AFI award) is at least as good as his efforts in FR three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and for those who are interested, Alice Garner appears as the child of Noni, and Michael Caton (best known for THE CASTLE) is a bearded painter. (It is also interesting to note that Hazlehurst is currently hosting the BETTER HOMES AND JARDENS lifestyle program, and Caton is hosting proprietary programs including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc.). This film reaffirms the popular belief that Noni was probably the first Australian actress from the beginning to the mid-1980s. Rating: 79/100.
