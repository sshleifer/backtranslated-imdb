I love cartoons. They can show things that movies with real actors and sets can not, although computer effects are changing more and more. They can push the limits of satire ("The Simpsons"), good taste ("South Park"), the show ("Aladdin") or reality ("Toy Story"). There are good examples of this in "Ice Age", such as when we see a motley herd of extinct mammals migrating across the countryside, chatting like old friends. These scenes are a pleasure to watch, because we have the feeling of both the familiar and the strange, usually in a way that makes us laugh. Although Ice Age is not as good as the best animated movies of all time, it's a really fun movie. Sit down and enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, beautiful scenery and bursts of laughter. <br /> <br /> The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth, Sid, a silly fool, and Diego, a human baby tiger to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, of course, they have a lot of problems. Scrat, the most unlucky rodent in history, desperately tries to bury an acorn for the winter: in the glaciers, at the top of the dead trees, in the ice caves. His opening scene is a classic. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, with a very predictable end and a middle, which is just a series of amusing incidents with a few moments of character building, but some scenes, like the diaper change or the dodos, are hilarious, the animals are friendly and that looks good. There is also a touching moment when cave paintings of mammoths come to life under Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> This is not a must, but it's good for an hour of entertainment. <br /> 7/10
