"Dangerous Offender" is the story of a seemingly antisocial girl and how she got it. It is based on a true story, and although I was annoyed by the description of a note, that is to say, by the scowl, by the main character and by the difficult dedication of his lawyer I am forced to accept that life imitates art, and that there are people like that. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds for me because, although the attitude of the main character has softened a little to the end, we are gradually moved sympathy for it. as the film shows how it came to its present state - which is self-destructive, not anti-social. <br /> <br /> Really a moving film that will put your throat in your throat when you think about it - which will often be the case. <br /> <br /> Despite its many flaws (including the fact that it is difficult to monitor, sometimes, because of bodily functions and suicide attempts), this is another production that I am proud of. call Canadian.
