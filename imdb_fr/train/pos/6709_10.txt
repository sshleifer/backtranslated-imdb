What I like about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and that it is a pleasure to experience their love, their humor and their everyday adventure. The literature of magic is so diverse, describing the ideas of classical, medieval and modern witchcraft, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina, the teenage witch, this show is so fun and unique, as it allows us to experience this modern magic, which is worth seven seasons! This show has so many great qualities and it is a joy to see Sabrina live her daily life in the realm of mortals and "others". I would recommend it to all families as the TV series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classic!
