I saw the film twice in a week, both times at the cinema in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was crowded both times and people had to be pushed back. From the beginning of the film with Henry Winkler injured on the football pitch, everyone was boiling. A laugh that lasted until the credits. <br /> <br /> For those who love the American fight, this film is a must, but be prepared to see Henry Winkler like you've never seen before. Also look for a well known actor whose movement in wrestling is a head, but! <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, watch this movie and its family comedy entertainment at its best!
