A masterpiece. <br /> <br /> That's the way it may not be for everyone. <br /> <br /> The camera works, plays, directs and all the rest is unique, original, superb at all levels - very different from the garbage we are so used to. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, credible and intriguing Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this movie, his acting is unique - it's completely his - neither "British" nor "American", nor anything else I've ever seen. There is something interesting about it. <br /> <br /> The long unbroken and natural shots are wonderful, reminding us that we have become too used to a few restricted shooting and editing methods.
