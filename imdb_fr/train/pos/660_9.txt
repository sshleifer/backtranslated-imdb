9 / 10-30 minutes of pure holiday terror. Okay, so it's not so scary. But it's really fun. <br /> <br /> The Guardian of the Crypt (John Kassir) tells a dreadful holiday story, giving us all the Christmas goose ... GosseBUMPS That's it. Bwahahahahha. You should really pay attention to what you AX Santa. Spend a scary Christmas and a new happy fear. Okay, I'll stop. <br /> <br /> Alright, an avid woman (Mary Ellen Trainor, the world's best shooter) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, the trainer who wipes a towel to the death) in ANOES 2) for money. BUT, his plan is ruined when a crazy killer wearing a Santa Claus costume (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) comes to meet him. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on YouTube, you can watch it for free. , but most of you have already seen this (my third viewing). But if you have not seen it, I suggest you do it.
