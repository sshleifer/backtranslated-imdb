When I was young, I had seen very few movies. My parents in all their wisdom have praised this one. I was very suspicious about the movie, in fact I was not even allowed to watch it. Of course, my brother and sister had to do it and it pissed me off. So what did I do? Late at night, I broke the VCR! He kicked the TV screen and called the police and reported vandals. I was arrested of course, I could not get out of the TV before the police arrived. I was only given a severe conversation and sent home. Of course, my parents put me to the ground and made me work to pay off the debt for TV and VCR. It tore me apart, the slave job is really bad, believe me, but I had to do it. The chores all around the house. What happened in the end? We had a big screen TV, a DVD player and a surround sound system for my work. How did I get the money? I made my own movies and sold them to Disney! Do you remember finding Neno? Well, I wrote this film and filmed my goldfish in their aquariums! Of course, they rewrote the plot and did it in CGI because they could not afford to make it a real action scene like I did! In the end, I have never seen The Head movie that is not dead and the rating I gave it is the one of my life! I'm very good!
