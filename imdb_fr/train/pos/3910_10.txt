So I'm at home, I turn the chains one night and I fall on this man wearing heels and who wears makeup in front of a colorful background on HBO. Naturally, I made a double take and decided to watch for a moment. I did not change channels until it was over, it was incredibly hilarious. The next time I turned it on, I made sure to record it so I could watch it again and again, and that's still one of my favorite things to watch. During the first few minutes, you can say that the public does not really know what to think, but he quickly convinces them with his incredible humor and wit. While many comedians mingle with my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing and it's nice to hear jokes about topics like history and puberty when most comedians stick to the news. His show stayed with me after. I went to Italy this summer, and all I could think was that "the Italians are still on scooters with the mention" CIAO ... "" 10 out of 10. You will not regret it.
