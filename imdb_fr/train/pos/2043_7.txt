I just saw this film last night at the Toronto Festival where it was playing in the Midnight Madness section. To tell you the truth, the only reason I went to this movie was because it gave its name to the Radiohead song, and also because my friend bought the tickets and so I really did not no choice: -DI is expected. it would be something like The Silence of the Lambs, but it turned out to be a semi-gore movie. Someone has already mentioned that none of the characters are friendly, and that's fine. I do not care if Potente's character gets his guts torn by the Creep. I was looking for homeless people to make him alive with the character of Potente who served him just desserts. Christopher Smith certainly did a great job with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is rather weak, but again, the purpose of the movie was to scare you and it was very effective. The score of a Bristol group called The Insects was first rate. It's more than anything else that really scared me. <br /> <br /> The director was a really decent guy and was very entertaining during the Q & A session. I really hope he can make better films in the future. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for genre fans, but I would recommend non-fans to try it anyway. It was a fun ride.
