I must admit that I thought this movie was not going to be good, but I soon changed my mind. The film let you guess in which direction he was going. Pierce Broson is amazing in his role as a successful actor, who suddenly becomes exhausted and asks for help from a man met in a Mexican bar. Greg Kinnear is a brilliant heterosexual man, whose role as a sweet man from Denver begins an innocent conversation with Pierce in a Mexican bar. The movie will make you laugh while Pierce delivers a hilarious movie (mostly about sex). <br /> <br /> The fantasy in this film is very well done, especially at the bullfight stage and when Pierce sees himself trying to finish. his last jobs.
