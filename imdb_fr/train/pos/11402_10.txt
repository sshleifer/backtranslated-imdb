I saw "An American in Paris" during his first outing while I was still in school and I immediately fell in love. I went back to see him the next day and I lost count of the number of times I've seen him since, in movies and on television. He fantastically uses some of the best music and songs of the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and presents the greatest male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. The actors of Oscar Levant (still offbeat), Georges Guetary (why did not he make more movies?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in a role unfriendly) are they in top form. The closing ballet, superbly choreographed on the music of the title, exploits wonderfully the images and the sounds of Paris and the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All of Gershwin's songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are "It's very clear" (Caron and Kelly on the Seine) and "I Got Rhythm" (Paris children join Gene Kelly in "Une American song "). . If you like Paris, see this movie. If you have never been to Paris in your life, go see him. But see it!
