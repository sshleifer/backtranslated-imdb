It's a military drama that I like a lot! Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Navy is nonsense, in your face, and no question asked kind of person doing the work. Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT D.C. member, works for the government and only receives orders from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! When the two are paired, the sparks should fly. And how. However, Beckett explains to the young bureaucrat how it works. When the other sniper hits, it's spirit against spirit, cat against mouse, shooter against armed man. And when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to Miller to put politics aside and save him. Who needs the policy when you are a professional like Beckett, he has received orders only from himself, respects the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is put forward despite politics. The film was a direct hit. Look at this. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
