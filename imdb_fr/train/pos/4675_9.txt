I saw "Brother's Shadow" at the Tribeca Festival and found myself thinking about it again two days later. The story of a prodigal son (Scott Cohen) returning to his family's bespoke furniture store after a stay in prison offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama: memorable characters; lively and attentive dialogue; Sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who reflects visually. <br /> <br /> But more than that, it presents something too rare to multiplex nowadays: the uncompromising vision of a mature sensitivity. The talent of director-writer Todd S. Yellin seems to flourish, but we feel that he (like his protagonist) paid his share. He knows how much real people are struggling in this world and he knows how much we aspire to success - or at least experience by proxy. Yet, Yellin respects his audience too much to blow smoke in our backs. In the end, we see that Jake's triumph does not lie in the commissions, or even in the esteem of his family, but in "the work" that he could not give up if he tried. <br /> <br /> This is an essential theme in a world (and especially in the film industry) that can not go beyond "goals". This film deserves a large audience.
