Finally, an independent film that makes beautiful scares! I see most of the horror movies coming out ... Theatrical, Straight-To-DVD, cable, etc ... and most are void ... there are some that are visible ... let alone who are really good ... Dark Remains is one of the good ones. I had the screening of this movie at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I loved it! Having no actor name, I guess the budget of this movie was rather low, but you would not know it ... the movie looks fantastic ... the acting game works totally for the movie. .. the story is good ... and the scares are great! While most filmmakers focus solely on fears, they often forget the story and development of characters, two things that help produce fears more effectively. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that the character and the story are important. It develops at the same time as to interest the characters, to know them and to be more afraid when they are in danger. <br /> <br /> Watch horror movies costing between $ 80 and $ 5000 I find that "Dark Remains" is one of the jewels on the planet. Watch this movie!
