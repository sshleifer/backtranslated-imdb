I saw the film in Dallas, Texas, when it came out in 1986. I remember they had distributed prizes for coming to see the film. After seeing the movie, I can see why. The movie was neither bad nor great. The problem with this movie was that he was trying to tell a parallel story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to integrate it into the Masters saga. My biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of Robotech Masters attacking the Earth. They even used the same scenes of Master Saga but with different dialogues. Child, I loved the movie. But unfortunately, I did not see him as an adult and I can not give a better review. Looking back, I was disappointed, but now I would like to see the film and re-evaluate my position on it. That being said, will anyone want to publish this film for the whole world to judge? I love Robotech and I can not wait for The Shadows Chronicles.
