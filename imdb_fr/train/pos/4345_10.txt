It's no wonder that this film won 4 awards, it's a soul-boggling film, it's no wonder that it took Paul Reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to Peter Falk about his idea. I can understand everything. It's a film that will make you cry a tear, or even thousands of people. <br /> <br /> Story: 10/10 When Sam Kleinman receives a letter from his wife inviting him to leave. to find something else, he and his son make a car trip in search, and while they do, they find something lost, friendship, family, and affection for each other. other. At first you know what will happen, but never is the story easy to understand from beginning to end, it's a walk between a father and his son, and a husband and wife. It is no wonder that it took Paul Reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romance / comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors: 10/10 You can not say anything more than what I'd like to say, it's with Peter Falk it's a legend, all he does in the movies is magic, when you use Peter Falk in a romantic comedy, what do you think you get? A perfect result, it is not surprising that this film is so perfect and has won so many awards. As his son Paul Reiser does a great job, although he is not a great actor, that does not mean it did not work. In fact, Peter Falk and Paul Reiser play the perfect father and son, the rest of the cast is good. Enough, but you do not see them as much, so just say they're doing what they need to make it shine even more. <br /> <br /> Music: 10/10 It does not always work with music, sometimes it does not work, but it's not that in this film, the music is perfect, it makes the film even more convincing. This part of the film will shine as much as the others, an excellent soundtrack for a novel / comedy, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> Overall: 10/10 There are so many romantic movies / comedians on tap tapes, DVDs, Blu-rays and everything in between, but this movie is one of the most special. it does not happen every day that we can create a story like this, it takes years of thinking and the fact is that what was needed to do it is a great piece that should be bought and preserved in the human soul, see it When you're old and you'll see it with your father, I think this film will shine like no other.
