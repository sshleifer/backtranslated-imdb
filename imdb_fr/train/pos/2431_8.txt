Famous was "famous" for his tension and cartoon style where the main character is in terrible danger, before being rescued by the hero at the last second. This Casper in particular is the only one I can remember where death really holds the road But even in death, there is always a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The constant in the cartoons of Famous Studios is that "virtue always triumphs". Popeye always arrives on time in his spinach, Baby Huey is always up to the fox, Little Audery "still learns his lesson". And some FS cartoons ARE really dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> You have to give them credit. as much as I like Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry", I do not think anyone has produced a better comic product at this time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (the great Winston Sharples), editing, voice. They were consistent and were an eloquent example of the best forms of art.
