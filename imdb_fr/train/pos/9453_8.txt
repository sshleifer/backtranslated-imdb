Deliverance is the fascinating, captivating and sometimes disturbing story of James Dickey, transformed into a brilliant film by John Boorman. These are four businessmen motivated by manhood and macho behavior who spend a weekend of canoeing in the mountains. Up there, they are confronted with all the darkest aspects of man and all the worst forms of human misery: poverty, sodomy and even physical harassment! These four men intended to descend the river for adventure and excitement, but their journey will soon turn into an odyssey through a mountainous, violent and hidden mountain, completely separated from any form of civilization. All these elements are actually Deliverance one of the most nightmare movies of my life. Just about everything that happens to these men, you pray that you will never find yourself in a similar situation. Cinema purely speaking, Deliverance is also a very important film. The best of John Boorman (followed closely by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film. It contains several memorable scenes that were already in many other films. Just think of the wonderful musical score "Dueling Banjos" and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual homosexual scene "Scream like a pig". All actors offer (haha) perfect gaming performance. Especially Jon Voight. A must-see movie !!
