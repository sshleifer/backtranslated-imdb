In my opinion, this is one of the greatest movies ever made in America and it deserves all the awards it has won and is on the list of the 100 best AFI (although it is terribly too low in the list of the 250 best IMDB, only 183 of this writing). If you like to play the highest caliber (Voight and Hoffman are a great match), well-designed characterizations and inventive direction, editing and cinematography, you'll love that as much as I do. Schlesinger paints a living and always credible picture of the New York scene in the late 1960s. Many victims struggle to overcome their personal demons and survive in the amorality, poverty and despair of 42nd Street, New York . <br /> <br /> The filming techniques used here brilliantly capture the sensation of the clandestine film movement of New York (and the city) and are simply dazzling. I've seen many ideas (including quick editing, processing voice-over flashbacks, drug / trip sequences, and caricatural face slipped during a murder scene to express anguish and terror ) stolen by other filmmakers. The relationship between Joe and Ratso is managed so as to be perceived as an exceptionally strong friendship OR having his homosexual fundamentals. I think the director did this in a subtle way, not to reduce censorship at the time, but to focus his energy on the importance of a strong human connection in life, whether sexual or not. <br /> MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave and moving film of magnitude, influence and importance that has not lost its impact over the years. If you have not seen it, you will really miss a true American classic. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Note: 10 out of 10.
