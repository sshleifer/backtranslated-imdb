Ok, needless to say, this movie will not please any audience; namely runners and like-minded people. <br /> <br /> That said, if you are one of the aforementioned people, this movie is a MUST. In fact, I think it should be mandatory for major stores to sell a copy of it to anyone buying their first bang. The Holy Grail of Monty Python is for geeks and nerds. This film is too. I first saw this movie about 10 years ago and I always fall in love every time I watch it. The jokes perfectly reflect the lifestyle of the chicken, much better than today's as an attempt by Half-Baked. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy, so to speak; the film is rather a collection of various sketches; while the protagonists of the movie wander in Los Angeles in their legendary haze. Despite this, the film has an excellent sense of rhythm and does not lag at all. Many people cite Up In Smoke as the best job of C & C, but I would say that Next Movie is superior. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood to laugh for an hour and a half, enlighten yourself, connect and let your mind go away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
