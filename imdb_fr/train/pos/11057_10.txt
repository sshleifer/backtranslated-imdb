I was 10 years old when this show was on television. By far it was my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was just beautiful .... I just ordered the DVD (15 episodes). They did not have super powers. They just had superior human skills (strength, hearing, sight). The 3 actors were very good in their roles, very credible. There was a good story in every episode. At the time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, the script was supposed to be good and the characters played were great. There was no fancy stuff, like in other shows. They did not try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I highly recommend this TV show to anyone who likes good things.
