Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code movie featuring some of the best of the time. It is located in the maternity ward of a hospital, especially in the room reserved for women who may have problems. There is an older woman, a tenacious single mother (Glenda Farrell), a frail young woman, an Italian, and the main character (Loretta Young) who spends 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital every second, knowing that everything will be fine. Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is excellent in her work. <br /> <br /> This film is very interesting and entertaining. This is not at all shocking, but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the screen. The acting game is brilliant all around. Loretta Young is beautiful here at its peak. Eric Linden comes from nowhere and is as sincere as possible. His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is great, as always, a pre-code base and for good reason.
