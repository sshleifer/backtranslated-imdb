The film shows how high society has become unemotional and selfish. He has many characters and each character represents a different category of person. No character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all typical Indian movies and no character is 100% bad, but all are simply different. The film is a very perfect mix of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the very first time, I loved a movie that raised social issues. I would recommend everyone to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers the shaking parts of Bollywood for the newspaper, but here's how she became a judicial reporter for the newspaper. But that's not all, it shows how she could not survive there and when she helped save innocent children, how brutally suppressed her voice is. Even she is fired from work. Then she could not find a job as a judicial reporter and must start again. Not only she, but a very large number of characters are intertwined in the film and all give a different feeling by watching the movie. I would really like to congratulate the director for making such a good film. Please do not allow yourself to miss it.
