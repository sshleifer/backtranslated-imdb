The movie "Men in White" is certainly one of the funniest, if not the funniest, movies I've ever seen! (and I watched a lot!) They are two bag men, who become "Men in White", then end an invasion from space. It's also a parody of many classic movies, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says that this film is bad has something wrong with his head. There are tons of funny jokes and jokes here, and you could hurt your mouth laughing too hard (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you certainly will not regret it!
