The very urban Ronald Coleman is featured here as in some of his films. He is literally in all the scenes and this comic film stays cool because of him, not in spite of himself. He is handsome, witty and very clever while he is always one step ahead of his charming wandering wife - perfectly interpreted by Anna Lee. The film is based on a French play and brings all the best qualities of this farce. Most actors are known, at least by their face, if not by their name ... and are absolutely perfect for this very funny movie. The fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable, because he keeps one step ahead of the other characters. His multiple talents can be further appreciated in the classic "Lost Horizon" that every film buff must see.
