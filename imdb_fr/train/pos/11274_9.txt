One of Tarzan's best films is also one of his most action packed films (and graphics). <br /> <br /> Reporting about a year after Tarzan the monkey man, Niel Hamilton's Holt asked a rich friend to fund back to the elephant cemetery to pick up the ivory. His friend also arrives with dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to retrieve Jane from Tarzan. Before he can leave, Holt finds his card stolen and it becomes very difficult to try to capture a competing expedition. When they end up taking the robbers, they find the whole group dead and surrounded themselves. They have no choice but to make their way and quickly realize that they are no longer in the frying pan and in the fire. Finally, Tarzan and Jane introduce themselves and everyone is left for more adventures. <br /> <br /> An infamous movie has been heavily censored to reduce graphic violence (its graphic, even by today's standards, it would probably get a PG 13) and to remove any suspicion of nudity (there is a scene swimming naked for several minutes involving Jane, who is completely frontal in her nudity, she has only been restored recently). It's clear when looking at the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes of its time for television. In its restored version, it is a very adult movie, romantic, touching, action packed and all that a movie should be. It's an amazing movie of almost every standard. The best of all is the kind of movie that plays well both as a stand-alone adventure, you should not have seen the first movie to enjoy it, but it's also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in this original movie. It's an incredible thing. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. <br /> <br /> If the film has flaws, it may be that the film has not aged well. The rear window is often very obvious, there are gorilla costumes for many monkeys and some of the other effects are more picturesque than convincing. However, on almost every other level, this film is first rate. <br /> <br /> You really owe it to yourself to see it. Prepare a large bowl of popcorn and relax on the sofa and let yourself drift to the past. This is one of the great adventures.
