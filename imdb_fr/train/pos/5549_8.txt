The silent film The Pride of the Clan with Mary Pickford was supposed to take place on a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the exterior shots were shot at Marblehead Massachusett, at Marblehead Neck, near several rocky seaside areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the location of the film Marblehead in my hometown and 2) the fact that my grandmother, Lizzette M. Woodfin, had been hired as a replacement for Mary Pickford during the shooting of several scenes, including the "cliff scene". The two women were small (5 feet) and my father and grandmother recounted the fact that she was a replacement on the back of the camera for the cliff scene as part of the Chiefton shoot. I just wanted to tell this story to future film historians and amateurs. The film itself (the copy of my DVD is a bit mediocre) is very well done with lots of action and expressive play, including several scenes in which Miss Pickford has a strong female character. I enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy although I do not know if there is one, as I have seen in various movie sites. The remaining copies are dark due to deterioration. A very beautiful movie of the silent genre with a lot of action!
