For what it is, "Raising Victor Vargas" is as close to perfection as a movie. Real genius of a novice author or just one of those lucky mixes where everything has been clicked (probably of each), this simple little ethnic film of the first ethnic coup of the urban life encloses his young characters with such depth that you can almost read their thoughts. The film begins with a strong "street" flavor, but mingles with a Latin American family affair, then focuses on a story that speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the deeply natural desire for it. to love another. In my experience, never has so much been done with so little (distribution of tyros, director of novices, etc.). Praised by the critics, but not for everyone, "Raising Victor Vargas" is recommended for independent film fans and directors for simple and rich stories in humanity. (A)
