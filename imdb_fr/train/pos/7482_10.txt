"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderfully thought-out film. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I watched this movie late at night, excited about what was coming. I was not deceived. At the end of the movie, I was shattered. I could not manage. The whole idea of ​​that completely upset me. The end was more a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The plot was also something that kept me interesting from start to finish. The casting, superb. It was a wonderful movie all around. The kind of movie you can watch over and over again and always find something new. I have seen it four or five times and I always find something new. It's a movie to stay interested forever.
