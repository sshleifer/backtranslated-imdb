It breaks my heart that this film is not appreciated as it should be. it's very underrated. people have forgotten what the movies really are, nowadays they only think about bum bum movies, which can be very fun to watch with popcorn and their friends, like transformers, movies oriented, with an extremely high budget like 300 mln or even more, with special effects only and which are silent movies without scenario. This is the kind of film that I still have. Of course, it's fun to watch extremely elaborate CGIs, but we do not get any benefit from this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think the performances have been excellent. Especially Busy Philipps, alongside Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) made this film an Oscar. The emotional performance of Busy Philipps was amazing, it's a shame not to see Oscar in his hands, what she deserves.
