The film has a great story of written genre. It contains all the usual ingredients of Columbo. The way Lieutenant Columbo approaches and links his suspect, the way the mystery unfolds for him, the Columbo dog, the cat and the mouse play, which is great in this one and, thankfully, a good sense of humor. relaxation, mainly involving the character of Columbo. Everything is written despite the fact that he does not even have a really original concept. Columbo in search of a crime writer / assassin had been filmed more than once in a Columbo film. <br /> <br /> It's also an extremely well-made film by James Frawley, who then made 5 other Columbo films, in the 70's and 80's. He provided the film with really great style and sequences. memorable. <br /> <br /> This is one of the slowest films in Columbo, even if it does not have a long running time. This style and approach does not always work well for a Columbo movie, but in this film, which is the case, which may not be at all thanks to the film's performance. <br /> <br /> Most of the films Columbo either played a big famous star or a star of the beginning of the making of a film, like the movie his murderer. This film stars Ruth Gordon, an unknown woman still 81 years old. She has not played in many movies throughout her career, but she is still well known to some, especially for her role in "Rosemary's Baby", which has also earned her an Oscar. She had a realistic and somewhat unusual actor style, which some people might not like well. That earned her another four Oscar nominations throughout her career, before her victory for "Rosemary's Baby" in 1969. She also had excellent interactions with Peter Falk in their sequences together. <br /> <br /> stars a youngster still GD Spradlin. I say young because I only know him by his latest productions out of his career, when he was 57 years old at the time of this production Columbo. He is still alive, but retired from the movies since 1999. <br /> <br /> An even better movie entry than usual in Columbo. <br /> <br /> 8/10
