When Braveheart was released for the first time, I was fascinated and I was one of the most rabid fans of the movie. When Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued and, although I enjoyed the movie, I did not think it was a good movie. However, over time, my appreciation of Rob Roy has grown and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has diminished. Braveheart is certainly great entertainment, but there are also some flaws. The most significant, in my opinion, is the unflattering portrait of Robert the Bruce, who was undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which tarnishes it in proportion to the many historical distortions. I also think that the fact that in this film, seen retrospectively (at least by me) and retrospectively, bothers me, is that the beginnings of Mel Gibson's egomania are clearly visible for the first time. On the other hand, Rob Roy has grown with me over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the faults that bother me the most in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like a good wine, more and more mature and complex with each viewing.
