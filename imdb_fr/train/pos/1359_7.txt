I work in a library and hope to love this movie when it comes out 5 years ago. Well, I really liked Parker Posey (he's a wonderful actress) and Omar Townsend was really cute like his boyfriend (he could not play but when we look like him, who cares?), But the movie was bad. It was not funny or cute or a lot of nothing. Posey kept the film afloat with his energy. But she learned the Dewey Decimal system OVERNIGHT and then tidied up tons of books to the beat of the music? !!!! ??? Come on! I also had a problem with her appearance when she became full librarian at the end - hair in a bun, glasses, no sense of humor - can we let this stereotype go away please? It's worth it to see Posey and Townsend but that's about it. The television series was much better.
