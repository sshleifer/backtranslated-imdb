Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid success rate for their work on television. However, their film work was much more nuanced (The Bank Job of 2008, everything was fine, Across The Universe from the previous year was decidedly weak). <br /> <br /> Still Crazy, thankfully, is a solid success. He has a great story, great performances, lots of humor, fabulous music and, above all, a real heart. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the "moments", and this film has one - at the moment when everything goes pear-shaped at the show of the festival meeting ... <br /> <br /> Very amusing.
