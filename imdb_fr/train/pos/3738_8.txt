TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years, the public has seen and understood war movies With every possible point of view, and in one way or another, producers and writers are always proposing new and innovative ways to represent various soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM", "A Time to Kill"), one of the riskiest filmmakers currently, has found a resemblance to "The Thin Red Line" in the way his new drama "Tigerland" comes to the soldier's place. This film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony than "The Thin Red Line" or even "Saving Private Ryan". Although the dramatic impact of the film is somewhat mitigated due to the perversity of the material present, it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young men preparing for war. <br /> <br /> I would like to know Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are men really so impetuous and brutal? I'm sure some are, but the film describes his uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man by the name of Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who rebels against the ideas of war. His personality is instantly opposed to that of several characters, one becoming his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis), and the other, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose fiery temper often exasperates Bozz's tension with him. idea of ​​going to war. The war described in this production is not on a battlefield, but on the training grounds of a Louisiana-based training camp between the conceptions and fears of the soldiers in formation. This film deals specifically with preparation for war, nothing more, nothing less. This ends when the soldiers finally go to war, which is a little disappointing, since seeing the characters in action would have been a real reward. <br /> <br /> Shot on site after 28 days with a 16 mm support and a tiny budget, Joel Schumacher accurately displays a sandy, perverse, cruel and ruthless atmosphere with the help of manual cinematography, unique lighting techniques and direct sound. Schumacher's grainy, blooming images give the film the impression of being a feature documentary. This unusual style of film making only contributes to the realism of the hard core of the film, graphic enough in its use of a crude language, perhaps a little too disturbing. Waves of four-letter words pound the audience, some shocked by what they hear. Even the extreme extreme of vulgarism does not prevent dialogue from reigning, it is heartbreaking, sincere and emotional. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, "Tigerland" gives us a small appreciation of all that our soldiers suffer for our country at the beginning of the fight. Such bravery must be necessary to engage in the military in times of war, knowing the difficulties and risks involved. These stimulating ideas are made possible by the heartbreaking performances of young aspiring actors who describe the various trainees. This film is not intended for all audiences, but must be viewed by young men before enlisting in the military ... and the adult audience must watch to appreciate the courage needed to do so. <br /> <br />
