Carlos Mencia was excellent it's a special time. He worked hard to show everyone that he was the real deal. I know people have said that he stole material on this special show, but that's not true. Carlos presents the comedy the way he wants, and not like anyone else, that's why he's so good. People say he's not funny because he says too much about Dee Dee Dee, and they still did not realize it was part of his act, and they do not want it that way, but he brings it anyway like that, and manages to make people laugh. For all enemies, here is a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no interest in trying to make him fall.
