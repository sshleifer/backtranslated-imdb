The poor quality of the videos on DVD is the only reason I gave this film a 9 instead of a 10. It could have been so much better, this film deserves it. <br /> <br /> It's really a movie that covers several themes simultaneously. If you do not like movies about serial killers, but are fascinated by the surprising bureaucratic culture of the old Union Sovjet, this film is a must see. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to "Silence" of the lambs "for several reasons.The way the serial killer is described was much better done in Citizen X. You see many details of his life private, because you "travel" with the killer, which gives you an idea of ​​the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I've seen is as realistic as this one was "Henry - Portrait of a Serial Killer." If you're fascinated by this movie, you should definitely have a look at Citizen X.
