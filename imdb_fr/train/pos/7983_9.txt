It is difficult to finish this film in many ways. Everything works very well here; casting, acting, screenplay and cinematography are all first rate. For the viewer, it is a moving and violent story of love and human redemption. For the film critic, there is a lot of sharp technique and technical merit. There are some tactical mistakes and, as discussed in the forums, the end lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the training angle of the CIA agents. However, I came to the end as more moving because rather than pursuing the pragmatic approach of the CIA agent, Creasy basically recommends his soul to the Ultimate without considering the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Creasy becomes superhuman by his sacrifice, whether it really has a pragmatic meaning or not. In any case, I appreciated the fact that Creasy gets rid of conventional bourgeois morality and only puts the bad guys one after the other in his methodical search for justice, which actually ends in redemption for him. and for the innocent. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is definitely worth watching if you're attracted to the genre. An excellent soundtrack, excellent writing, impeccable casting and solid performances make it a top 100 movie.
