This film is an excellent example of a refined narrative. The acting is superb. The story is inspiring without being too manipulative or false. There were a few moments when they probably made people a bit better or meaner than they really were, but since it's a Hollywood movie, they've been incredibly restrained. No explosions were shown in the film, even if they had the opportunity. The film, while having suspenseful roles, has not been transformed into an action movie. The story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times. Good game!
