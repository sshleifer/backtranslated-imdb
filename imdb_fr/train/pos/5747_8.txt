If you have heart and compassion for people, it's a difficult film to watch, at least in the second half of it. <br /> <br /> It is in this segment that we see a nice little boy being beaten up and a man with a backlog (having an intellectual disability) sinks deeply after witnessing this brutal act against the child. It is not a pleasant material. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good movie and the acting is good too. The story will spend a moment with you. <br /> <br /> "Dominick" is the mentally disabled guy and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this could be Hulce's best role. He is treated by a medical student, "Eugene", played by Ray Liotta, who became a star the following year with Kevin Costner's "Field Of Dreams". <br /> <br /> Dominick is a heart scavenger who reads. "Hulk" and love the fight. He is the type of "slow" guy that you can not help but love and look for a happy life. When he panics, it's for many good reasons and ... well, see the movie for the whole story. It's worth it, but get ready for a real emotional roller coaster ride and maybe be very upset with some of the things you see.
