If you went to see this movie to attend a huge Academy Award ... well ... but if you wanted to see a fun and delicious adaptation of an old classic, you'll love it .. Jim Carey was amazing as usual. The scenario was great, some additions like the Grinch story made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat..But although there were some ADULES comments and a cleavage added, it is supposed to be a show for kids or family. Try not to lose sight of that ... if you really do not like the movie ... and about the comments about Ron Howard, try making a big movie and see how you're doing it ... this is not so simple as it seems ...
