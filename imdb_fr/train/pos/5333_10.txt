How that did not become a cult movie, I do not know. I think it's a really ingenious comedy that has unfortunately been ignored! <br /> <br /> "Runaway Car" tries to pretend to be a fast thriller, but taking the quality of an acting game (good God it's bad), the scenario, the practicalities of the demonic possession of the car and the scene of the evacuation of babies are not a problem, you can not do anything but laugh. And laugh you go. Movies are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they do it can be an indication of the value of a movie. This film is the ultimate in entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. At one point, I was out of breath and almost choked. It's really funny at times. When the baby was transported out of the sunroof in a scabbard by a helicopter piloted by a pilot robot that managed to maintain a constant speed identical to that of the car and a flat plane of flight, which means that the grapple did not tear the roof of the car. I laugh hysterically. But when the baby started to swing in the air, nearly hit a bridge and tangled in a tree, tears ran down my face. <br /> <br /> He also thought that the black policeman was the guy who played Jesus in Madonna's "Like A Prayer" video. He seems to go everywhere.
