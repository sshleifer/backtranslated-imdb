In recent years that I reviewed this classic, I decided to go back, but first some insider's notes from a movie critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of the ones I grew up with, it made my childhood happy, it made me great, miss some of these things today that we clearly do not see as much as we had at the time, and well under consideration ... <br /> <br /> Talespin, or Luftens Helte in Denmark, is a great animated series. It's a bit like chip and dale, ducktales and a lot of old ones, so it's weird, I can not remember this series as much as I'd like to remember. <br /> <br /> But, in my opinion, it was great, it was accompanied by a kind of message, not so wild that it, but it is one of the old ones so that we can forgive them . <br /> <br /> Now, I do not want to look old or anything, but I feel like time is running out of my hands with these drawings, we're seeing something like Ed E dd and Eddy or anything weird like that, we have all these new or almost new shows like Hannah Montana or something like that, yet I feel we do not have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days. <br /> <br /> Now, I may be wrong, but I feel that the weather has changed too much. In conclusion, I would be delighted to see these series like Talespin being aired again on the TV screen instead of all the news ones, give me my childhood drawings, give them to the kids I have a day, give them again ...
