I was just a little young for this one, but I had to see him. There is excellent music, which many people have mentioned, but no one seems to notice a very rare apparition of "Angel", a musical formation that is now practically ignored but once very popular. Dressed in their white outfits, they mingle with the "20th Century Foxes" and, apparently, they all try to sneak into the field of view of the camera. The keyboardist Gregg Giuffria remains the highlight of the group and apparently never had a really amazing haircut! Cherie Currie (former Runaways singer) starts a brief career as an actress here. She is memorable alongside Jodie Foster and others. (His three-dimensional topless scenes in "Parasite" and his UFO sighting in "Wavelength" have all watched us for a while). <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, but it retains part of its time, to watch and marvel.
