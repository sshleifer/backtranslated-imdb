Another silent love triangle film by Hitchcock, not a mystery, but very English, very rhythmic and photographed. Bob Corby (Ian Hunter), a talented boxer, recruits "One Round" circus boxer Jack Sander (Carl Brisson), partly to keep the pretty but unstable Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby. There are many actors of character and grotesque at the wedding of Jack and Mabel. The spectator, standing in the aisle of the church, is shocked at the sight of very tall and short men, the fat lady, the Siamese twins who, of course, discuss which side of the aisle you sit on , and the wedding feast is fun. In the rest of the movie, Jack loses Mabel and goes back to his heart, or something like that. It was another time, with the audience in evening dress and the boxers who also dressed when they were out of the ring. The angles of the camera, the rhythm, the use of symbols, the cut - all very elegant and masterful. The camera work and the editing of the last boxing match are very interesting. The beauty of Brisson is well used in this one; his smile is not as oblivious to what's going on around him as in Hitchcock's The Manxman, and so is not boring. But can boxers have such dimples?
