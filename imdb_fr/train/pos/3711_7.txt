"The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955, Charles Laughton directed "The Night of the Hunter", a frightening slice of Southern Gothic in which Robert Mitchum plays a scary serial killer. One of the film's most famous sequences is composed of two children who escaped from Mitchum on a rowboat, the children paddling frantically while Mitchum chases them like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum played an equally spooky killer in "Cape Fear", another film taking place in the southern United States. This film featured a local lawyer who was trying to protect his family and ended up with Mitchum terrorizing people on a boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese, trying to diversify and tackle something more traditional, redone "Cape Fear", boat scene and everything. <br /> <br /> We now have Robert Altman's "The Gingerbread Man", another slice of a small southern Gothic town. Altman says he consulted "The Hunter's Night" to find inspiration and to have tackled such a mainstream film simply because he wanted to "spread his wings and try a photo of popcorn", but what he secretly tries to to do here is to deconstruct the canonical films of the Southern Gothic genre. <br /> <br /> So, instead of a confrontation on a small boat, we have a clash on a giant ship. Instead of two children being kidnapped, we send two of them safely to the police. Instead of hiding money, we easily have money donated by will. Instead of the fair advocate of the 1961 film and the deplorable advocate of the 1991 remake, we have a rather three-dimensional lawyer in Kenneth Branagh. Instead of the monster pursuing the family, the hero pursues the wicked. Instead of the monster bursting into the family houseboat, the hero chases the monster aboard the monster's "houseboat". Similarly, instead of a deadly serial killer, we get an innocent weirdo played by Robert Duvall. . .etc., etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Altman continues over and over, slightly reversing things, pulling the edges and doing what he has to do. It was during the first half-hour of the film that his contact was most obvious, the film being situated in a disturbing space between the narrative-based narrative and Altman's taste for the dialogue that takes place. overlap, occasional stories, prowling camera movements and the presented because they are just part of what is happening. <br /> <br /> Yet, despite Altman's best intentions, the film never goes beyond mediocrity. Altman is too tied to the "thriller format" conventions to cause a lot of damage, his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is just not radical enough to counterbalance the other canonical films of the genre. "Gingerbread Man" is too common to function as a more pure Altman movie and too much to be a mainstream thriller. <br /> <br /> The film is not a total loss, however. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and the intolerable Daryl Hannah all perform in concert. The film also has a pleasant atmosphere, set against a hurricane approaching, and the final act contains some interesting twists. Although Scorsese's film "Cape Fear" is not a complete disaster, the film still has nothing special about it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 90s, Altman shot three successive films in the southern United States: "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie's Fortune". Unlike "Gingerbread Man", "Kansas City" and "Cookie's Fortune" approach the genre on larger, looser canvases with which Altman was most comfortable. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is the most important of these two films, its class, political and crime hierarchies, and its desire to radically break with the typical gangster genre, would have a decisive influence on the 21st century. crime writers of the century (see, for example, "The Wire"). That said, "Cookie's Fortune", although it's a much less clear story, is perhaps the best picture. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims that this is his first thriller, but he has directed "Images", an art house thriller. , in 1972. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit.
