I had few problems with this movie and I heard a lot of critics say that it is too long and overrated. Admittedly, it lasts more than three hours, but I was surprised that it went so fast. I do not think it's overrated, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly correct. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and great effects, and James Cameron's direction seldom escapes home. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack and Kate Winslet is beautiful as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals all the scenes in which he is. The story is very rich in detail and is very interested in the development of the characters, which is evident in the love story which is very moving when it is necessary, even if film is a bit slow. The last hour is extremely captivating and I will admit that I was on the edge of my seat when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes have been very moving. The music of James Horner was charming, although I have never been a big fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 mini-series was good, but it suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic a score of 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
