Before Lost, everything that was shown on television was predictable. You can predict who will die or who will find something, but in Lost, you can not predict anything. Every thing was surprisingly amazing and it was really a mystery, not because there were so many secrets, but because there was nothing like it before everything was really great. I literally became addicted. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something to hope for every week. It's genius. The environment is great, it's quiet and hot at the beach and so scary in the jungle. The characters are a work of genius, especially those who are already on the island. The castaways are so dramatic that we can never predict their death, because they have so much to do and so much to say and they have secrets about the other shipwrecked who die with them.
