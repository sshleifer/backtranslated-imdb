I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed this movie. Witty writing (some "inside" jokes I had, others I did not get - maybe because of actors talking to each other), great acting ( including John Cassini), excellent cameos, an interesting and unique staging. I rented it to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed that he stayed so little time, blink and he will miss you!), But the film was remarkably entertaining. In fact, I'll watch it again before sending Netflix back. I think actors and eager actors will really appreciate this movie. The end is a little awaited but would have liked to have done something different (and more positive). Too bad the film was not better received, except on the market of "festivals". I suggest it to anyone who loves acting.
