I really enjoyed the movie, however, I did not realize Little Richard had so much to do in his life. First of all, I was not aware of Lucille. There is very little mention (hardly) that women are intimately involved with Little Richard. Even in her life today, there is no question of romantic involvement of women. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall, the movie was great. I did not like Leon playing the role of Little Richard either, he's a good actor but I think the role of should have been attributed to another actor. Visually, he did not remind me Little Richard. I was also totally unaware of the promiscuity that Little Richard was involved in. From the movie, he has been portrayed as a sexual addict. At present, he would be referred to a counselor for his sexual addition. He was a voyeur. I do not want to ruin the film for someone who has not seen the film, but there were several things in the film that, in my opinion, should not have been part of the final cup.
