"One of Hung's best efforts at first. The humor is flawed, Hung tries to mimic Lee's movements and facial expressions, and also a bit where Hung makes fun of Jackie Chan's Drunken Master. The action is also very good, especially when Hung faces in the end a trio of martial arts experts, this is not the best movie, but rather good for the kung fu of the 70s, especially if you're a fan Hung and / or Lee. The versions of the film are rather of poor quality. There is also a character in blackface that some people might find offensive. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a rural pig farmer who moves to Hong Kong to fight villains. Sammo launches his imitation of Bruce Lee when he fights! <br /> <br /> This film is often portrayed as a parody of Bruce Lee's "Enter The Dragon", but it's not exactly that ... Sammo is obsessed with Bruce Lee - pig breeder in the middle who moves to Hong Kong to help his family manage a small outdoor restaurant. In the new job, he is forced to defend the restaurant of local gangsters who seek protective money. When Sammo goes into battle mode, he activates his imitation of Bruce Lee, which must be seen to believe it! This film is rather sloppy, and in many scenes of combat, Sammo fights against actors much more than martial artists, and there is a character who is supposed to be black and which is played by an Asian man with thick makeup ( and absurd). But what this film lacks budget and accuracy, it largely offsets the atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for good mood. "
