I had heard good things about this movie and I was, you guessed it, a little disappointed. As promised, Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, from an early age; really all the (little) actors are pretty solid, in their simple 1950s American setting. The reason I did not give this movie a higher rating is that towards the end, the sister's grief Elder did not seem so real and it took me out of the movie. Maybe we should fill in the plot or maybe the movie would need a little more time. Maureen's character is quite underdeveloped, I think. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., the youngest) is traumatized and angry, but why is her sister upset? Because she has a few more years? Has not the end sapped the rest of the movie? The pace of the film suggests that Maureen and Court have just met, when it is treated force (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect, it looks like she may have tried to shock a little. market!) . It depends on what you want - if you want the girl to content the beautiful love story you are going to have, she will surprise you. The man in the moon is both picturesque and dreamy and a film of transition to severe age ?? a rather clumsy combination? I liked the character of Court however, I can see what girls who watch this could watch. And I loved the fact that they had the courage to let him hurt the younger sister (most men, most movies would not do it) and get killed. For some reason, I found Jason London funny on a tractor.
