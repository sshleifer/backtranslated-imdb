For a movie that is ostensibly about sex and leather, he has no right to be as strangely sweet as he is. The story of Bettie Page, a good Southern Christian whose mother did not want to date her before her marriage, moved to New York and became the most successful pin-up of her age, is motivated by an exceptional performance by Gretchen Moll. Her page can not quite reconcile the images she takes (no one can touch, it's fun and respectful) with the pornographic essays and the supposed perverse effects that her images have on the world around her. <br /> <br /> Page has been an inspiration to all burlesque artists ever since, not only because it had a figure to die for, but also because it invested every image in an innocent sense of pleasure that was both sexy and simple. Rather like this movie, actually. Filmed in black and white and glorious technicolor, it's a nice way to spend a few hours.
