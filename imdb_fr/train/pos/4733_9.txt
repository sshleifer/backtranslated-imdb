Once again, Jet Li brings his charismatic presence to the screen of the movie Black Mask. In this movie, Li plays Tsui, an escape from a super soldier program that seeks to recover the humanity that the program has taken away from him. To do this, Tsui decides to become a librarian to lead a normal and peaceful life, but fate asks him to solve the problems of his past before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the super-soldiers program had escaped along with Tsui, but they want revenge for the world rather than finding inner peace. Thus, Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former teammates from disclosing information that could cost the lives of many innocent people. This film screams on the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go. Martial arts are fantastic, but since they use threads, they may not be appreciated as much as they deserve by the American public. If you like action movies that have an interesting story and require good acting because they deal with both psychological and physical conflicts, Black Mask is for you. I'm happy to see some of Jet Li's films finally starting to be released in the US, and I can not wait to see how the changes this release will require (such as dubbing and sound) will affect the movie. This is one of Li's best movies, see him on May 14 when he will be released in America.
