This film moves without being sentimental - meaningful without pretension. It tells the simple story of a family about to collapse as technology and society evolve and the family business becomes more and more untenable. <br /> <br /> The action is fantastic - although none of us in the western world have probably heard of these actors, we should have them for a long time - they play their characters with honesty and reverence - they are imperfect characters, each with major weaknesses, but with humanity and kindness as great as it is impossible not to engage in history. <br /> <br /> We need more movies like this - we need more Western filmmakers to create movies like this.
