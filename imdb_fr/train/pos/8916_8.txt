Absolutely the very first film that scared me to death. I happened to catch it when my older brother (r.p.) watched him. It was on a black and white TV and not really a good image but it interested me. Shortly after, my parents bought a color scheme and, coincidentally, The Million Dollar Movie showed it on a Sunday. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten most of the plot, but it did not take long to catch up ... and I'm so scared that I had trouble sleeping that night! I mean, of course, it was just a movie, but it involved a creature that came not only from space, but that you could not hear or see it ... and once he took you, it was too late. Even now, after all this time, it's still cold in the back. A real classic, and even better a classic that I saw scare a new generation of pants! <br /> <br /> Long live the Blob!
