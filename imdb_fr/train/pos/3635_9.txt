It's the story of an aging baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who was once on the road to big leagues as a pitcher, but suffered an injury that ended his career at the end of his career . Morris (Quaid) tries with a team of major leagues and even lists them. It's a great family film. It's a source of inspiration, but it does not pour out too much. It's fun and entertaining. Adults will enjoy this movie. as well as kids.it is based on a true story, although I'm sure that the filmmakers took a few liberties to tell this story.Quaid is sensational as a main character, very convincing.If you are looking for a movie for the whole family can enjoy, look no further.9 / 10
