The one and only was a great movie. I had just finished watching it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler and thought it was a good portrait of the life of a professional wrestler. Now this film was shot 4 years before I was born, but I do not think the rigors of the professional wrestling trip have changed so much. Sad, funny and all around awesome !!! **** 10+
