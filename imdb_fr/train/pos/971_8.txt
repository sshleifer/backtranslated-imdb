This film is a bit reminiscent of the German film, THE NEVERENDING STORY, because a child is magically transported to a foreign country to become a hero. However, because of the much higher modern technology, puppets and computer graphics are used to create an incredibly realistic world - a world that will amaze you because of its realism and reach. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, but at first it was a chore! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this film is a film you can give up very quickly or reject because everything in the film seems so strange. However, give it a chance. Do not think and try to understand everything you see, just let the story unfold and you will probably enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this is exactly the kind of advice given to adults who watch Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY because it is very similar and contains tons of Yokai (mythical Japanese spirits). The big difference between the two is that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR is a lively action and SPIRITED AWAY is much more child friendly. Although I think THE GREAT YOKAI WAR was primarily for a children's movie in the US, most parents would not want to show it to younger kids because it's so violent, scary, and has some adults. So who is the audience in the west? Well, older kids and adults who love foreign movies with non-western themes and compositions. It's a rather narrow audience, indeed! <br /> <br /> While you look, look for all the little weird touches. In fact, you can watch the movie dozens of times and notice different little things each time. Some of the fun references that I liked were the commentary on Gamera, the scene accompanying the comment "KIDS: Do not try this at home", as well as the use of Kirin beer to allow a person to see the Yokai (hmm, ... maybe this scene should also have contained this warning)! <br /> <br /> By the way, the director Takashi Miike is difficult to identify stylistically, if it is not just to say that none of his stories I saw appeared "normal". Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and I hated them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER) while some are magical and are among the best films I've ever seen (THE KATAKURIS HAPPINESS). One thing is certain, it is difficult to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other.
