It's one of my favorite family movies. I loved it when I was little and it still holds me now that I'm older. I still laugh old jokes and I could even shed a tear once. I have never cared much about animals that speak, or at least those animated by the UN, but this one, I will defend it. It's a very old film, but it will always hold a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There is no other animal movie I can think of right now with which I could even compare, let alone love as much as this one. I may be praising this film too much, but I do not think about TV. I really hold this wonderful message that "home is where the heart is." Or at least that's the message I got from that. Highly recommended for a good old family movie night.
