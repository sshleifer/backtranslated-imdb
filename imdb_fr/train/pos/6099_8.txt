I still have cheap VHS dudes late, late, without cable, waaaaaayyyyy back, late night commercials and all the time, when I stayed up until the weird hour when they hit this show - like that I could record it. <br /> <br /> The series was not really ABOUT Freddy Kreuger - only the first two episodes actually involved him as a Rod Serling announcer. Instead, each episode was a distinct nightmare, using traditional horror themes of horrible childhood, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating, and ... dating. .. of the dating. <br /> <br /> episode where a teenager accidentally says "I will love you forever" to the wrong girl and gets stuck with her (literally, at least for a moment, they grow up together ...), to that where a young stewardess goes home with a strange man, only to find himself in his cabin, where he has a trophy room filled with other flight attendants, and I can only remember very vaguely from the date that compared blind dates to hockey (and the injuries and penalties that accompany it) - dating was definitely the scariest thing in the series. <br /> <br /> An episode had Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) as a motivated pizza merchant with a new tasty secret ingredient. Not original, but still scary and fun .... <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, some episodes were great. My favorite was "It's a miserable life" where a young man is trapped working in the joint of his parents burger, while he wants to go to university. Stuck talking alone and doing small puppet shows with old cheeseburgers - until a late night when a strange guy crosses the car and his life is not the same. No, not Freddy, just a thug with a gun - turns out that the breathtaking episode is just that - the last thoughts that cross the child's head ... with a bullet. <br /> <br /> The second half of the same episode (several episodes of Freddie's Nightmares being essentially two vaguely related news) follows his girlfriend, who was also injured, but was not killed by the way, and who is taken to "the devil's hospital". - They pile up in all the most frightening clichÃ©s of the hospital, then in some cases, from the fact that you accidentally sewed your mouth - or awakening during an operation - to the fact that your deceased boyfriend tries to attract to the morgue for a little hug. /> <br /> Again, that's what I liked best. <br /> <br /> Some episodes were much more stupid, like almost all the ones they made available on video. They put the shabbily as representatives of the series, then nobody likes them, thinks that the series is stinking, and then they do not put more on video. It's a miserable life is only available on DVD PAL in England - but I will still buy it.
