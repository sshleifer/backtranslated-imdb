Before you watch, make sure you have seen Night of the Living Dead ... This is perhaps the best parody of 7 minutes I've ever seen! "Special effects" absurd, crappy (the rope, the rope !!!), and slices of maneating bread ... what do you need ??? <br /> <br /> (Do not watch this movie while eating bread ... you might be scared!)
