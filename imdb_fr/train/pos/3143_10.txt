If a show in the last ten years deserves a 10, this is a rare gem. This allows us to return to a time when things were simpler and more fun. Filled with heart and laughter, this show makes you laugh through the three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the colored clothes and even the drugs were tolerable. The hair was covered with hair, the music was accompanied by roller skates and, to use the words of Merle Haggard, "a joint was a bad place to be". Take a trip to the greatest moment in American history. Fall for the characters and the sense of well-being of the small town where people were kinder to each other. This classic is on TV as much as "Full House". Do not miss it, and always remember to "Shake your rhythm !!!"
