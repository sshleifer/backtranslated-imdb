This film is directed by Renny Harlin, the Finnish miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to direct an action movie. Stallone needed this role to get back on track. Snowy Mountain is a great place for action movies, and it's better to direct a movie with the snow, ice, cold and bad weather than the Finns. The action is good! The music in the movie is spectacular. The villain is John Litghow, other stars, Micheal Rooker (The portrait of the serialkiller), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine). The is placed in a beautiful place and it is a very exciting movie. All in all, it's a good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Do not forget about Extreme ääliöt: special edition for collectors, with good extras. Comig soon in Finland directly to the video.
