ok, but just stupid. Not bad for a horror / comedy movie. I read how people changed with Michael's version and that's a good thing in my opinion because some adults hate horrors and when they see it, it will interest them in horror movies like this or maybe ( never seen) the horror (maybe comedy) Uncle Sam, I'm going to have to rent or buy this movie, but the second is much better than this one, but I bought this one on Amazon's VHS and I got it on November 21st, the day before Thanksgiving. worth the four dollars, l.o.l. to this film. <br /> <br /> 9/10
