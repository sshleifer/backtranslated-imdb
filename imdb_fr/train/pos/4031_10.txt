I have been a Hindi movie buff since the age of 4, but I have never seen such a moving and impactful film, especially as a Hindi film. In recent years, I had stopped watching contemporary Hindi films and returned to watching the classics (Teesri Kasam, Mother Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.). But this movie changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found it not only moving, but also very informative for a first-generation Indian woman who grew up in America. It helped me understand the story of my own family, which was always something very abstract for me. But "seeing", feeling and understanding helped me to sympathize with the generations that preceded me and the struggle that the Indian people endured. The film put a lot of things in perspective for me, especially given the current world events. I never thought that a film could change the way I think about it before ... that's what happened. The plot is fantastic, the actors play superb and the direction flawless. Two thumbs up!
