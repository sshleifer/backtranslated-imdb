This film is an absolute classic for the camp. That's why it was an Elvira classic and the MST3000. Everyone knows the story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he travels around the city and tries to find a body for him by checking the local chicks. Finally, he finds a real hourglass body surmounted by a chick face with a scar face. The severed head befriends the experience missed in the closet and the tapered head comes out of the closet and pulls out the last "good" arm of the assistant (his other does not match the failure of a scientist before ), and the whole place burns. <br /> <br /> The film scared us so much as children that my friend would not go to his basement for a year after seeing him. As children, we ranked the scariest films of all time and this one was number four. Only one of these scary movies was really good (the original "The Haunting".) <br /> <br /> I had to award this movie a score of seven for the incredible amount of entertainment it offers. Its strange effect due to the production of shit and the strange sexual angle when the scientist searches for the bodies (with soundtrack porn) scares the innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it an ideal material to watch talk and laugh. I could watch this movie tonight and enjoy it while I would rather go to the dentist than watch "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> Seven is the maximum I can give, because its entertainment value is only luck. The film, as a cinema, is a disaster.
