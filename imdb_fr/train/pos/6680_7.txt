It was different, that's for sure. Just watch the casting! Talk about head balls. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, although many actors share almost the spotlight, in this joke about superheroes. The most outrageous was played by Paul Reubens of the celebrity "Pee Wee Herman". <br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor, garish colors and no lull. It's a pretty light and entertaining comedy with wacky characters, all of whom want to be Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and other heroes. They have talents in strange fields, however, that true heroes do not have (and do not want!). It's silly, but you know it's happening. <br /> <br /> It's also a film that you can watch in installments without running out of continuity. It's a long film for such a hectic, so take a break here and there, it's okay. The language was tamed so that children could enjoy it too. In fact, I do not remember having sworn here, except for the theater guy next to me who kept saying, "What a stupid and fictitious movie! I thought it was fun two hours but I prefer to watch it on DVD and have a few breaks.
