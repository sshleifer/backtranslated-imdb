I try not to take the ratings of IMDb to heart, but I was flabbergasted when I saw the rating of 5.4 of one of my childhood favorites. At 17, it does not impress me so much, but as a family film, it's a sweet and well-meaning film. Children will certainly love it and will not worry about defects, and adults will be able to guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messages of the film. No film has been preached in any way, in fact, it contains a great message that adds to its sweetness. I will admit, however, that the story is rather thin and that some scenes such as the death of Screweyes (which scares me still) may seem a little scary. But the animation is well above average with pretty colors and good character animation. The music of James Horner is very beautiful and the song is memorable, catchy and fun. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most in depth of all, but the dinosaurs were at least attractive. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the party when he told Screweyes "I stopped!" I had in the stitches. My favorite is however Screweyes, an effective villain, cunning and intelligent, I suppose. If something happens, I wish the film stays in the game when it explains how he lost an eye and why he is afraid of crows, because it could have been more developed in terms of depth. The scenario, while not worthy of an Oscar, has its fun and comforting aspects and should entertain children and adults alike. The voice for me was what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave strong performances, but a special mention goes to Kenneth Mars, as he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. Overall, it's a good movie. I do not have the rating, honestly I do not have it. Of course, this movie is not perfect, and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie like Land Before Time, but it's a lot of fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
