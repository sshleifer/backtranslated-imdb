This dramatic document is what you expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": beautifully photographed, convincingly molded, well written and literate, Hollywood abandoned in the 1930s, and scrupulously exact. He stands out as a genre film, excelling in his portrayal of Native American culture (or, more specifically, in his Canadian context, "First Nations") and holding "Black Robe" as a wonderfully photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture. (here, around 1934). This idyllic portrait derives from the drama of his subject: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a Scotsman raised in Hastings (England) by young aunts become so obsessed with the "Indian Red" tales of his childhood that he went to Canada, disappeared in the east became a trapper and an adopted son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man who used to marry and give up Indian wives, none of whom seemed to think less about it, because he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque. One of his wives (one smarter than he, according to most accounts) has propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate of the protection of the northern wilderness, which is central to the story. Attenborough. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as a woman, Gray Owl's Pony) is engaging and, if not fiery, is nevertheless very touching. A good movie when you need time from the crowd.
