A tour de force! OK, the kid who plays Oliver is a little too nice! Starting with great cinematography, colors, costumes and the most impressive performances, it's a must-see movie. I have seen several adaptations of this great novel, but this one stands above all and it's a musical more! He is a masterful Fagan, never leaving his character to make a song. You never really know if you like it or not, the same feeling I had in the book. In other versions, you hate it from beginning to end. Bill Sykes .... when you read the book, he's mean, and so he's in this movie. Oliver Reed was masterful. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went to see his latest movie, Gladiator, based on his many performances, without seeing the headliners. The music adapts to both the mood and the mood. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You should!
