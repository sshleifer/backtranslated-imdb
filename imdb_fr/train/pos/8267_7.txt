Brown of Harvard is a difficult film to pin down. We are expecting a lot more from our movies these days, so it's worth remembering that the 1920s audience was a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming as a thug who must stumble in pain and humiliation to find success and even fame. All the relationships in the film feel really elevated EXCEPT for the homoerotic bond between Billy and Jack Pickford, the nerd of the city. The film has it all, romance, tears, love, death and even sport ... It's an excellent education about how society changed in the 20th century.
