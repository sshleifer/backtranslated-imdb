One can only hope that there are many times when a person as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to help someone who needs it. <br /> <br /> It all boils down to loving people. As Will Rogers said, "I have never met a man I did not like." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, why not love? His smile can melt diamonds. She is so fantastic that I can watch anything. The same goes for Freeman. he's just magic on the screen. <br /> <br /> They gave us a fun movie from start to finish. From the Mexican supermarket at Lorraine & Bobby to Packy. It was tender, charming and just funny. <br /> <br /> You have to check that.
