One of the best Three Stooges short films of all time. A spooky house filled with perverts and "The Goon" challenges the best men of the Detective Agency Alert. Shemp is in great shape in the famous in-the-dark scene. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in his role as Mr. Goodrich, as a target of an assassination plot. Before it's over, Shemp's "little faithful shovel" is used wisely. This 16-minute gem moves about as fast as any short film by Stooge and hits it twice. Highly recommended.
