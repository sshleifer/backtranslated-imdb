I really enjoyed this drama by Sidney Lumet. The best word I could find to describe it is crazy. It throws the viewer for about an hour and a half and does not let you breathe until the credits begin to roll at the very end. Trust me, this movie will let you guess all the way. <br /> <br /> The story is very well designed and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complicated Tarantino story. The acting is amazing for all actors and even small parts, excellent casting. I also liked cinematography a lot, it made me feel like an independent film. It was great. <br /> <br /> This film is exciting, exhausting and heartbreaking. It's almost hard to watch but you'll be glad you did.
