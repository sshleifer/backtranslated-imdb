Green Eyes is an excellent movie. In the current context of supporting our troops, it is interesting to note that this film showed the lack of respect of the soldiers in the performance of their duty, during this period. From a historical point of view, the end of the war in Vietnam left us all with something to remember and learn. Gene was very proud of this film and he deserved the credit he had earned by writing "Green Eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often, if at all. This film is the kind of film that should be broadcast on television every year, much like the Wizard of Oz. The dedication of a man to his lost son is quite moving. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocky
