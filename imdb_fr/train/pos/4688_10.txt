I showed it to my Grade 6 class about 17 years ago and the students loved it. I liked it too. The history of termites and their interaction with their environment is incredible. The cast of creatures is deep and they all play their roles well. The battle between the two titans of self-control is a truly classic film. <br /> <br /> Alan Root did incredible camera work, which should have earned him the Oscar for Best Documentary. Orson Welles does not tell it (Derek Jacobi) and I do not call it the "mysterious castles of clay", but simply the "castles of clay". That makes me think that it had to be done with Welles added for the power of the stars and an Oscar boost. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to find this VHS just recently and it is now the favorite movie of my children. They brought it to the last family reunion instead of a Disney movie. If you can find this movie, you're really lucky.
