I enjoyed Longstreet, who followed in the footsteps of Raymond Burr's hit Ironside TV series and was destined to compete with her. But this show was canceled after one season because it was decided - I mistakenly believe - that Longstreet was not able to compete with Mr. Burr's Ironside. <br /> <br /> I would add that the pilot of this show was particularly well done and very memorable. I hope a Longstreet box will appear. <br /> <br /> The authors should note that this idea of ​​history has only been briefly explored here and that much could and should be done to show on television the game and the game of handicaps.
