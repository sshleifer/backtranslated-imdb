I do not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why do they think it's so bad, etc. It's not worse than anything else. Personally, I think that "Soldier" is an excellent film, much better than most other films of the same genre. <br /> <br /> Reasons I liked "Soldier": Kurt Russell, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the screenplay (David Webb Peoples), great visual effects and staging (Paul Anderson ). <br /> <br /> I even think it's the best job I've seen from director Paul Anderson, who has directed the film Mortal Kombat and the entertaining Horizon of the Event.
