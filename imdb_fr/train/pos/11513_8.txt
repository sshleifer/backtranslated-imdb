One of my favorite shows in the 70s. If I remember correctly, it was broadcast on Friday (or possibly Saturday) on the Nine Network (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland have been great together. <br /> <br /> Each episode has usually reached a climax, Kolchack being forced to fight in hand-to-hand combat with some sort of supernatural adversary. To their credit, the writers made a concerted effort to get away as much as possible from the usual wave of vampires and ghosts. <br /> <br /> I remember an episode in which the opponent was the spirit of a former Indian chief. who / who is "income" in the form of a massive electric current that started killing people in a city hospital. During the last confrontation, Kolchack tried to bypass the "powerful beast" in the middle of an explosion of sparks and stifled flames. Oh well .... you must have been there at the time but it was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin has always put a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best. <br /> Really deserve a place in the television "Hall of Fame". To quote Tony Vincenzo ... "Kolchack, you're ON" ... Or, in the case of the Hall of Fame, "IN it"!
