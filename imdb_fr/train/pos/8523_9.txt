I was a fan of the book since the third year, so of course I watched the movie, read more, then watched the TV show. It was a good show in itself, and now, as an adult, I still love the show. My only real problem with that is that it did not follow the book. The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But it comes from a girl who has a first addition of the book. But over time, I decided to try again and ignored the book (a bit like what you have to do with Harry Potter movies). I found the series beautiful! It was a clean cut and something everyone could enjoy, just enough comedy for everyone to go. It's truly pleasent! Clean and wonderful!
