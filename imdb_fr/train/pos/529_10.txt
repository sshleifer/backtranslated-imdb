It's one of the most neglected jewels in Hollywood. - A young British fighter ace of the Second World War, whose plane is about to crash, is in radio contact with a young American woman who comforts the brave pilot, knowing that he will be dead in a few minutes . For some reason, the man who should surely be dead gets away from the wreck and finally learns that he was supposed to go to heaven. When a messenger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refuses and asks to have his "day in court" to plead his case. The man claims that his situation changed during the last moments of his earthly life, that he fell in love and that he had become a different person, a person who deserved to live. <br /> <br /> The "Heavenly Court" is a cinematographic delight! "The announcement of the peer jury" is a highlight. The story, as fantastic as it may sound, is engaging and will keep you going for almost two hours of play. The final scene is simply beautiful and will require "Kleenex treatment" for most viewers. This movie is in my top 10 personal favorite of all time, it has my highest recommendation!
