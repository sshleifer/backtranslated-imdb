A powerfully wonderful movie. You are held in mortal grip once you have become involved in the story. Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a renowned dentist, is torn by a crisis in his life that has earned him a balanced career with his family. He notices his former classmate at the university, Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), and wants to make contact. He discovers that Charlie, who lost his wife and family during the 9/11 attack on the United States, is no longer in touch with reality ... choosing to engage his mind with his favorite music from the United States. past and his video games. Former roommates renew their friendship and reinforce their old bond. Johnson asks his friend Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, to try to get Charlie out of his grief ... but it was Alan who managed to get his friend out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Screenwriter and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's Attorney / Guardian. Also in the cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. An exceptional soundtrack featuring Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I have never been a fan of Sandler; but I found it exceptional in this role. In some scenes, I thought aloud ... why was he never approached to interpret singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in a biographical film.
