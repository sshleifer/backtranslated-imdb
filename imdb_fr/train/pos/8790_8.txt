Hilarious movie. In 2002, I saw this film at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, Mardi Gras, and had a good laugh from start to finish. The acting was subtle but very entertaining. I'm not quite sure of the influence of the "Real World", we do not get it here, but the film holds up without the understanding of this show. Heather B flies every scene in which she appears, especially when she plays with her red co-star, little talkative. Highly recommended. I would love to see it released on video / DVD in the future.
