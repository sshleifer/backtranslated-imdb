Before I start, I'm afraid of dentists. This film gives me goosebumps and even makes me cringe. That's what I like in this movie. The film is rather boring. For this, I remove 3 stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone who has just discovered that his wife was cheating on him. Soon, he begins to hallucinate and begins to torture his patients and kill colleagues. He even tortured his wife to death and killed the man with whom he had an affair. <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is very bloody and bloody. I would recommend it if you like gore. <br /> <br /> I give this film 7 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your ordinary dentist!
