You do not need to read this review. <br /> <br /> A previous review, done by pninson from Seattle, has already identified all the shortcomings of this production. I can only amplify his basic arguments. <br /> <br /> Bleak House was a relatively new Dickens novel and is much darker than its previous work. This is taken too literally by the director, Ross Devenish, who benefits too much from the darkness and the fog. When Ada, Rick and Esther appear, half an hour after the beginning of the episode, it's a relief not to be in the light of day for the first time. In some darker scenes, it was hard to see what was actually on my TV screen. I watched it all in one day, starting in the middle of the afternoon. As daylight disappeared, the problem was less serious, but I have a very good television and I had never encountered this problem before, at any time of the day. <br /> <br /> The stimulation is very deliberate (that is to say slow). I'm sure it was intensional, but it's exaggerated. There are many snapshots of people walking in the mud and sadness of Victorian London and kept longer than necessary to create the atmosphere and atmosphere that reign. A good editor can probably take several minutes of each fifty-minute episode, without losing a line of dialogue, by slightly adjusting each of these scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not want to exaggerate these two problems. . You will quickly adapt to the look and the rhythm of this production. The most important problem is that he does not always tell the story very effectively. Dickens' previous novels are as long as Bleak House, but they are not complicated in such a complex way. For example, I recently re-read Nicholas Nickleby because I was intrigued to see how Douglas McGrath had put together an 800-page book in his two-hour film. The answer is simple: the book is filled with padding. McGrath has gone through much of the novel while retaining all the essential elements of the story. This would not be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production needs seven hours. He probably still needs more time, because many elements of his intricate plot are not clear enough, nor as well treated as they should be. Some random examples will illustrate the problems. <br /> <br /> The maid, Rosa, appears out of nowhere, without a background. As a result, Lady Dedlock's attachment to her cause is largely unmotivated. <br /> <br /> Sgt. George's acceptance in Tulkinhorn's request for a sample of Horton's writing is a bit blurry. <br /> <br /> It is not clear enough that Esther is really in love with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Jarndyce. Nor is it clear that they agreed not to announce their engagement or why. <br /> <br /> The secret wedding of Ada and Rick is omitted. In one episode, they are only lovers, in the other, people suddenly refer to them as husband and wife. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Rouncewell is only a belated introduction to the story and the remoteness of Sargeant George with his family remains unexplained - as is the means by which it is discovered. <br /> <br /> Tulkinhorn's dedication to maintaining the Dedlock family's honor and respectability is underrated, so its motive for persecuting Lady Dedlock is more obscure than necessary be. <br /> <br /> The involvement of the brick makers with Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is somewhat opaque. <br /> <br /> It is not obvious that Guppy renews her offer to Esther because it The scars of smallpox have practically disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is just a selection: there are others. These are not major problems and most of the story is clear enough. Nevertheless, these are minor irritations that undermine his power: you should not have to lose yourself in small pieces of land. However, there are larger structural problems that weaken history at its later stages. <br /> <br /> The whole affair of the Tulkinhorn murder is somehow abandoned. Bucket immediately identifies Hortense as a suspect, which undermines the suspense of Sergeant George's plight and the importance of finding Ms. Rouncewell. It also diminishes the impact of the sub-plot in which suspicion is cast on Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is unmasked before Sir Lester. <br /> <br /> A more serious problem is murder, her investigation and Lady Dedlock's subsequent research dominate the story for over an hour, during which we completely lose sight of the other main thread of the plot: the legal case and its effects on Rick. His failing finances, his gouges by Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's despair, his declining state of health, etc., are all put on hold for an entire episode. This may be how Dickens wrote the book (I have not read it for years), but a good script should allow the different elements of the plot to move forward together. <br /> <br /> Finally, the role of Smallweed in history is so diminished. that it is almost superfluous. His discovery of the new will, which triggers the final phase of history, is also rejected. This is happening off the screen. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the production remains excellent. Many performances are exceptional. The individual scenes are beautifully done. His accumulated sense of tragedy is very powerful. I would still recommend it as a great adaptation of an excellent book, without the production of 2005. In fact, I probably would not be fully aware of its flaws if I had not seen how Andrew Davies had done it better. I've criticized Davies 'adaptations of Jane Austen, but I must admit that he really knows how to tame Dickens' bulky books. <br /> <br /> This is an impressive and captivating drama, worth seven hours of play. Nevertheless, its likely destiny should be considered primarily as a cross-reference to the near-final version of 2005.
