Murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of the best books of Poirot, because it is very scary and has an ingenious end. There is no doubt that the television adaptation is striking, with beautiful photographs and a haunting musical score. As always, David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot, the comic highlight of the episode being the battle of Poirot against a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is as good as the naive captain Hastings. The rest of the cast turns into decent performances, but be careful not to overshadow the two protagonists, a danger in some adaptations of Christie. Part of the episode was pretty scary, a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs, an episode that I enjoyed much more than this one. What made the thing particularly worrying, put that music aside, is when Louise Leidner saw the ghostly face through the window. About the adaptation, it was pretty true to the book, but I will say that there are three things I do not like. The main problem was the rhythm, it is rather slow and there are scenes where very little happens. I did not like the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer. In the book, I see him as a rather nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of ​​making him a murderer and underdeveloper, has made him less attractive, although I am glad they have not missed his addiction to drugs. . (I also noticed that writers have left out the fact that Mrs. Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she thinks she is the next victim of the murderer.) The other thing that was not so impressive, It felt like it could have been more effective if the adaptation had been done by Amy Leatheran, as in the book, Amy seemed somehow less sensitive in the adaptation. All in all, despite some errors of judgment on the part of the authors, I loved the murder in Mesopotamia. Bethany Cox.
