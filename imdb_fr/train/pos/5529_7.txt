I saw this film for the first time in a theater in France about a year ago. It came and went with little fanfare, but I appreciated it for the beauty of landscape photography and the fascinating images of wildlife. (The story, though nice, is really fortuitous - if you think about it, there is no chance that most events will happen in real life.) I just saw her tonight here in the US , on DVD. Again, I guess its distribution is very limited. Blockbusters had only one copy, and I do not remember at all that he played in the Cleveland art houses. <br /> <br /> Seen on my television, the photography is not as breathtaking, even if it is still beautiful. . The images of wildlife are always fascinating. The story of the relationship between the 10-year-old and the fox is even less convincing the second time, when we know where she is heading. <br /> <br /> Yet, as I said, the story is fortuitous. It's a beautiful movie to watch, and if you like wildlife pictures, you should find it fascinating.
