Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) is a film about traditional Japanese "yokai" or "monsters" of folklore. It is also known as Big Monster War or Ghosts on Parade. <br /> <br /> Yokai of the first installment include the freak of the teapot, the kappa elf, a 'living brella - a woman whose faces can become extremely gigantic. , a woman with a second face on the back of her head, a dwarf priest with a huge gourd-shaped wrist, etc.> <br /> <br /> These kinds of whimsical monsters do not just stem from tradition fairies, but a type of summer entertainment from the Tokugawa era, comparable to today's haunted Halloween houses, or the old-fashioned "monster shows", but only to dummy monsters. Goldfish ghosts and monsters and dancing one-headed umbrellas were invented to create "chills" during hot summers. The fatcheek woman, etc., was recreated by tricks or illusions, from monsters represented in medieval scrolls; & if their design for the film is a bit simple and hoky, it makes them all the more representative of what has been recreated historically for the thrills of summer. <br /> <br /> These rather endearing monsters face and destroy a former Babylonian vampire demon who came to Japan and disguised himself as a samurai lord. Although some Japanese appearances are a little crazy and that too many costumes look like masks without even moving their lips when they talk, all this is very poker and is very charming. It has a beautiful cinematography, pretty much that provided in a CGI movie of the same decade. Seen in good humor or with good friends, it is exciting, moving and touching. <br /> <br /> Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous movie Lone Wolf & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) & was the special FX director of the excellent trilogy Daimajin. The series of Yokai monsters is not the same as the best Majin, but the Yokai are nevertheless very funny. The first miike movie that is the most family-friendly of his family films, with GOZU & IZOO consecutively more serious but not too harsh for young viewers.
