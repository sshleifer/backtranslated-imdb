It's one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently, I was happy to see it on DVD, which relieves me from watching the old granular VHS versions. <br /> <br /> I had not seen him for years and I was watching him today, amazed at how resistant the film is to time. This is one of those rare and perfect comedy storms where great writing (really funny line after really funny line) is associated with excellent direction and outstanding performance. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore was nominated for the Oscar for "Arthur" but lost (though John Gielgud won the Best Supporting Actor award). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" does not win the Oscar for Best Actor, it is proof that no comic actor could ever win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein"). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon makes the film by faithfully respecting each character and the warm tone of the story. Quite simply, in my humble opinion, the film is a rare jewel. It is unfortunate that Steve Gordon died just one year after the release of "Arthur". <br /> <br /> Regarding the DVD available from 1/2007, it's true. Although video quality is a leap forward from older VHS copies, there is still no widescreen version. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some interesting extras, but they are not enough. One example is the director's comment that he was very keen to have some deleted scenes and scenes included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make difficult choices for a final release. The DVD, being the ideal format to include this type of material, should certainly have offered it as well. <br /> <br /> The original, "Arthur", is a classic comedy for books.
