IT IS FAR FROM MY MOST PREFERRED FILM IN THE WORLD !!!!! I enjoyed it when I was 4 years old and I still enjoy it at 16! It's an absolute masterpiece! No video collection is complete without it !!! I enjoy every second and not only the movie has great special effects, but it sends a great message to the young audience, which may seem chaotic, but in reality, the film is very COOLY in reality! Although Michael Jackson has starred in a few movies, people still do not see him as an actor. In fact, he is the most talented actor I know! He is so talented! He is incredible !!! MOONWALKER is a must see !!!!!!
