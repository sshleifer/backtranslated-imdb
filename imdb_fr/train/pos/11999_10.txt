I saw this wonderful production and I wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife. I am not sure of the name of his character. I went to BYU with her and I lost contact with her maiden name, Kim Luke, and I wonder if anyone has any information about her. It does not appear in the credits. This production was exceptional, a twisting in all respects, a superb game from everyone. I guess I do not even want to put it in the general category of the "acting game", but rather to "portray it with the feeling of the extraordinary events that led to the opening of heaven for this final dispensation" ... whatever something like: this. If someone has worked with Kim or has a website or something, please let me know !!! By the way, she was fantastic in her role ... Thanks, Melissa Thorne
