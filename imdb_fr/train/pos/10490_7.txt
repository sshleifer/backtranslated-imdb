Yet another example of what British cinema can achieve: a simple story, told and well interpreted. Brenda Blethyn gives a layered and comforting performance as Grace, recently widowed and struggling financially, helped brilliantly by a strong cast. The "weird little town" map is used extensively, as have many TV series and films from the British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come to mind). Like the above, this film uses rural landscapes of striking beauty, in this case the wet and wild Cornish coast. ending just a little too cute and sure. But it's a nice spliff, of course.
