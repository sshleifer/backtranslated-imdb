It's an extremely well done film. The acting, the scenario and the work of the camera are all first rate. The music is good too, although it is especially at the beginning of the film, when things are still relatively gay. There are not really any superstars in distribution, even though many faces will be familiar. The whole cast does a great job with the script. <br /> <br /> But it's hard to watch because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to reproach the British for opposing Hindus and Muslims, then cruelly separating them into two countries. This point of view has merit, but it is also true that no one has forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat themselves as they did at the time of the partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between religions and were smart enough to exploit them for their own purposes. <br /> <br /> As a result, there is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity in the situation. very uncomfortable to remember and see on the screen. But he is never painted like a black and white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, as well as the hope of change of the younger generation. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of redemption, in the end, when Puro has to make a difficult choice between a man who has ruined his life, but who really loves him too, and his family who has denied, then who comes looking for her. But at that moment, she has no option that is very painful. <br /> <br /> This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have serious mistakes and that they can both be dignified and caring men. . The reality of the partition makes this realization all the more heartbreaking, because there can never be true reconciliation on the Indo-Pakistan border. In this sense, it looks like "Mr. and Mrs. Iyer". <br /> <br /> We are finally delighted to have seen the film, even if the resolution was heartbreaking. If the United Kingdom and the United States could deal with their own stories of racism with this kind of franchise, they would certainly be better off.
