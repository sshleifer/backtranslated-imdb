It's always a good surprise when a film made for television proves to be entertaining, such as Little Richard. It's a very interesting film about the history of Rock and Roller, Little Richard, played by an actor called Leon whom I had never seen before but who does a very good job. Like most TV movies, it's a bit more tame than if it was made for the movies, which is a shame, because I'm sure there are a lot of controversial things that we could have seen on Little Richard. Instead, we see a lot of religious trash that is the only thing that ruins the film and ends up ruining a very promising career. Overall, this film is good and the acting is above average for a TV movie. 7 out of 10
