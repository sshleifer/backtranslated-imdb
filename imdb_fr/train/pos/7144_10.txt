I saw the movie Holes and said it must be the best movie of the year. This brings out the child in everyone. I mean, who would suggest that troublesome boys dig holes as punishment? Louis Sachar is who. Although the film is different from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be the biggest. Weight and height, but ZigZag / Ricky was bigger and Armpit / Theodore was bigger. Plus, X-Ray / Rex was supposed to be one of the smaller boys but was not. The only thing I did not like in the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long. I would have preferred to see more present than past, but that's just my opinion. I particularly like the boys work though. Like Squid / Alan played by Jake M.Smith was supposed to be a sullen and sturdy kid. Jake M.Smith played exactly that and did a great job like almost everyone in Holes. So, I would say that if you have not seen Holes yet, then you should definitely see it when it reappears, otherwise you will lack pleasure.
