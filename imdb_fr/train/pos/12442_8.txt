Shot on an impossible schedule and without a budget, the film proved much better than expected, certainly more faithful to Peter O'Donnell's books and comics than the two previous films. You can read the tape currently in Titan Books reprints or in Comics Revue every month. It's one of the greatest adventure comic books of all time. The film is not great, but unlike most low budget movies, it makes the most of what it has, and it holds your interest. On the extras of the DVD, the interview of Quentin Tarentino, who is obviously stoned, is a gas. Some people have criticized Tarentino for associating his name with the film, but without him, it would never have been done. He is a fan of Modesty Blaise and has chosen a good writer and director. All things considered, worth 8 stars.
