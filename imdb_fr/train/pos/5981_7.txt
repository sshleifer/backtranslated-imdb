TRICK OR TREAT is a good example of Hollywood on the train of "messages back in metal music" that Tipper Gore and his Washington Wives launched in the mid-80s (among the less successful entries of this mini-genre ROSES NOIRES and stupid THE DOOR). I was in the second year of high school when TRICK OR TREAT came out and I could not wait to see him. It seemed to disappear from video stores in the late 80's, but I finally took a cheap DVD copy not long ago and that brought back many nice metal memories of the time. Any teenage metal nerd could be linked to Eddie "Ragman" Weinbauer's (Marc Price's "Family Ties") lawsuits in this film as he is persecuted by his school's "handsome" people for his heavy metal style and his musical taste. . Eddie's favorite rock star is Sammi Curr (who looks a lot like Tommy Lee of Motley Crue), who was killed in a hotel fire at the beginning of the movie. Eddie is inconsolable until he receives a press essay from Sammi's latest unreleased album of a radio DJ (Gene Simmons of Kiss in a brief monochrome). Eddie soon discovers that this disc, when played backwards, allows him to communicate with the undead spirit of Sammi Curr himself! Soon Sammi gives Eddie some advice on how to get revenge on his preppie executioners, but when the messages become more scary ("Waste'em ALL ... no false metal!"), Eddie tries to destroy the album, this which brings Sammi back. to life through Eddie's stereo speakers. Sammi rushes to the big dance at Eddie High School and gets on stage to thrill the crowd and disrupt some unlucky "faux metallers" before Eddie arrives to save the day and the girl of her dreams. No, it's not terribly scary in 2006, it was not even scary in 1986, but TRICK OR TREAT is a movie that will make any 1980's metalhead smile and has a stylish cult band Fastway. It's worth looking if you've already hit your head or have a taste for B-level horror movies (or both, like me).
