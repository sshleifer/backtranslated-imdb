Or, I like the suspension of any stereotypical plot in this movie. I saw him several times and it still holds. A little too stylized for some but I imagine that any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a Canadian compatriot, takes a lot of risk with his films and his casting and it almost always pays off in quirky and somehow delicious movies, like this one. I have often wondered because of Cher's short acting roles, whether she chose to downplay this part of her life or if she did not have enough good chewing roles. I found her as a superb actress who can fall back into a role, as in this one, or be strong, daring and fierce as in "Mask". I sometimes found the comic features quite broad (a hair salon called "Cinderella"), but that was the intention of the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays the tenor of the opera, an extravagant agitation, demanding a knife to slit his throat. The scenes of Brooklyn are magical, it is a Brooklyn in the moonlight, romantic and dramatic, just like the opera. Overall, the movie was very satisfying and did not please everyone. I loved the end, everyone was gathered together like a Greek chorus, each part being subtly nuanced and blending into that of the others, the camera moving down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10
