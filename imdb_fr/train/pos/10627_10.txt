So, what constitutes a true independent film? At a time when the latest trend in the Hollywood mainstream must be harsh and forward-thinking, I'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as an independent film is usually nothing more than a marketing ploy. clever. <BR /> <br /> That's why we should be delighted by the presence of movies like "Hate of the minute". In a general way, this film highlights the fact of contradicting its own model (independent horror film). Love it or hate it, "Hatred" is not afraid to be what it is and, watching this movie, we really feel that Kallio (the director) did not just do this movie to spread fake blood place, it is there to tell stories. Good. You might find this film in the horror section of your video store, but make no mistake, this story also speaks of love, good people pushed to the extreme, and this light so far away at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you're waiting for a charcoal or an Evil Dead scam, stay away from this movie. But if you dig the details of horror / suspense genres, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. This film was produced by Bruce Campbell, and I'm sure he's proud to tell anyone that it's not "Evil Dead". Bruce never tried to bet on his "ashy" image, and it is obvious that he did not get involved in "Hatred" so he could not do it either. <br /> <br /> My advice, however, to all Dead-ites furiously devouring all that is published by Mr. Campbell, is still watching this film and see what Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you. <br /> <br /> The action is well done, although Nothing of this film is of caliber oscar (perhaps intentionally), it is good to see performances impressed of compassion in a horror film . Often, movie actors such as these do not even seem to try, with "Hate", it seemed that all actors took their characters very seriously, without ever resorting to the typicality of horror movies. <br /> <br /> Technically, "Hatred" is about as competent as the independent film. The editing is fast, the cinematography is good considering the budget, and "Hatred" keeps a fast pace, without any point of fall nor any bad anti-climax. <br /> <br /> In all, hatred can not look at all these multimillion dollar false indies, but I personally do not have a problem with that. It's a movie of people interested in the medium. People who searched their broken pockets, took out their coins, were cautious and made a good movie. <br /> <br /> Discover this one.
