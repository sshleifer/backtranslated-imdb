The beautiful story of Stardust is written by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and it's really a good story. I think it would please all fans of Labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom and yet it is totally unique and stands alone. And I think that the adaptation of this story to the film is much better than that presented in Neil Gaiman's original novel. I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a fairy slave raised by a witch in the realm of fairyland. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a shooting star, Tristan promises to get her back for a girl who is enthusiastic. He does not know that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and there are others after her. Three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again and princes who bicker. <br /> <br /> It's a very good story. He has humor and magic and beautiful scenes and surreal visuals. It's lovely and I think it can be watched by kids and adults of all ages. It's just magic. It's a classic fairy tale, movies I have not seen in the movies since the 1980s.
