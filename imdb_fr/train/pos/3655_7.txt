De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors, but this one was a coincidence. A foolish and smiling young man becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milan. It is a detailed and glittering story of innocent poor masses, completed by evil capitalists and easy-triggering police forces, but it slowly turns into a fantastic fantasy tale, while the young man wonders if Toto is developing unlimited powers of superheroes. After 10 minutes, Toto, still smiling, was up and when the magic took over, I stayed in the dust. There were so many beautifully orchestrated shots, so many good characters among the settlers, that I always thought it was a mess that the movie was not more serious with its material. The neo-realism and fantasy coupling appears more like an experience of "look-what-can-also-do-yourself" rather than a fully developed work / art.
