The romance of the film, which is also its main theme, is good and well presented. However, the love story is too lyrical, graphic and unrealistic. Even worse, the psychology of the main character is strange and incomprehensible, just like at the end of the film. Do not hesitate to watch this film, if it arouses your interest, but do not expect too much.
