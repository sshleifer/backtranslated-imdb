After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie never went to the movie theaters, so I ordered the BluRay. I had a good time watching it and I must say that this movie is better than some great animated movies. Of course, it has its flaws but I can really recommend it. The animation is well done, very fun and unique and the story kept me watching until the end. Some sets are simply beautiful and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought Forest Whitaker's performance looked a bit lifeless, but that's how the character of Lian-Chu is portrayed in this film. So overall, I liked it a lot and I hope it's pretty successful so that all the studios involved continue making great movies like this one. I would recommend giving a chance and being surprised at the quality of a movie with such a small budget. Hektor alone deserves to watch the film because some of his moments are hilarious.
