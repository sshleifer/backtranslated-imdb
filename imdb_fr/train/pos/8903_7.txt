Of course, this is a 50s driving special, but make no mistake. In my little book, there are a number of smart keys with unexpected clouds of humor. Catch the dreaded Mrs. Porter who is supposed to keep an eye on the place of the doc. She steals not only the scene, but also almost the entire movie. And where did these independent producers find the means to film in color, a wise decision, because the blob would not be very visible in black and white. Yes, the result is in tatters, as illustrated by the number of gaffes. But with the exception of several teenagers, non-Hollywood actors are doing well. In addition, the game among hot-rodders and cops is as lively as it is entertaining. It's damn good for some directors more comfortable in the pulpit than on a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to present teenagers in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents". Again, 27-year-old McQueen does not qualify well in the age group department, but still manages to be virulent. The film was a success at the time, helped undoubtedly by the catchy title melody that played a lot on the radio. And aside from the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, drive-in or not drive-in. In the meantime, I'm waiting for the drop to come back now that the polar cap is turning into, say, refrigerator water.
