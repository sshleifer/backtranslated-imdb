Red Eye is a good little thriller to watch on a Saturday night. Intense play, big bad and unexpected action. <br /> <br /> Some people may not want to see this movie because it lasts 85 minutes and 88% of the film is on a plane and speaks. Do not worry, they conclude very well with this intelligent and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> A film in PG-13 format seems to be a new base for director Wes Craven. But surely he has made as much violence as possible in this thriller. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is its distribution. This film needed good actors to deliver dialogue and thrills. If they did not have these actors, the movie would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy from Batman starts and 28 days later. Brian Cox of X-men 2 completes this casting. <br /> <br /> The look of this movie was great. Just when you think it's going to get boring, they're casting a spell on you. Fortunately, it's not a long film and it does not tempt me either. Much better than the flight plan of the other flight movie. <br /> <br /> Here is my comment on the flight plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not too bad. <br /> <br /> 8/10
