This film should not be compared to "The Sting" or other caper, queues, and idiots movies. What makes it such a great cinematic experience is what he has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. It is also a fairly critical criticism of psychiatry, since the female protagonist is a psychologist who is so easily deceived and then behaves so primitively in the finale. Did Mr. Mamet have an unfortunate experience in therapy? Strongly recommended!
