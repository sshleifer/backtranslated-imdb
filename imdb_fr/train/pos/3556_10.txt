Oh, it's such a glorious musical. There is a bit of misunderstanding - Frank Sinatra is cruelly misinterpreted as the Jew Nathan Detroit, although this only becomes evident in "Sue Me", a distinctly Jewish song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut one of the best songs in the series, "Marry the Man Today", and replaced it with a lower representation of Sinatra. With these two faults in mind, the film is also beautiful. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing beans, but still succeeds. Stubby Kaye has a wonderful role on Broadway (it was written for him). The language, rhythm and humor of Damon Runyon are very good. It's on my list of things to see, every chance.
