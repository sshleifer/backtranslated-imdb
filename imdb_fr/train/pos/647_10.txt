Of course not, women are on average excessively sensitive and needy, which is interestingly described as a mother prostitute, although it is not pseudo-artistic, extravagant or insinuating. Unlike many of you, I only saw Mom and Whore twice. Like many good movies, I noticed that my opinion improved after a second viewing. All I know is what I saw and I still have to dig into new exploits until I myself acquired the DVD. I still do not understand why I like this film so much, but what really matters to me? Although I am sure of power and wonderful explanations. Okay, so you may not agree, maybe it's a little boring sometimes, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of a beautiful Grushenka.
