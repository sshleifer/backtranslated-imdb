Although I live in Minnesota, I studied in France lately and came across this weird jewel of a movie. <br /> <br /> This film was amazing to say the least. A creative and unique film, the different directors have each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first thing to do is try to integrate each of these little stories in a general scenario, as can be done with Love Actually 2003. This attempt, however, makes the magic of each individual segment obsolete. Taken literally, each of the short segments constituting his own film, love stories tell a beautiful message together. <br /> <br /> The film is sometimes surprisingly bizarre - often to the point of confusion - and each individual segment can be difficult to follow. Nevertheless, for an observer who pays particular attention to each segment, the lines of the plot become clear after a while. The confusion is almost intriguing; he keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will follow. This leaves the viewer wondering, "Has this really happened?" but also leaves them convinced that it actually happened. This is the kind of film where the viewer, when he leaves the theater, can not really decide whether he liked it or not. The initial reaction is to go watch it again and again, just to see those individual lives blend into a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The interesting decision to make the film multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can identify. This adds to the reality of the film - here, American tourists speak English, French Parisians, etc. The number of people included in the film makes it possible to understand the international language of love. <br /> <br /> From illness to the supernatural, from the love of parents to the love of husbands, this film covers all the foundations of romantic tales. In a beautiful and original way, each unique event is set up to tell a story: that of all types, sizes, nationalities and forms of love.
