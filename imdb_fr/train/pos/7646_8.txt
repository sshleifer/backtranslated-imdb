This film is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices I made and the way my life would change if my choices were different. This is part of the theory of "multiple universes". <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not sound right is that Larry Burrows (James Belushi) has so much trouble understanding what's going on, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
