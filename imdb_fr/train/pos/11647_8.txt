I can give you four reasons to see this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best filmmakers in contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories, linked in a big scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. A surprisingly good cast. <br /> <br /> 4. A bitter reflection on the biggest problem in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this film with a good humorous story about the extortionist authority against ordinary people and always hoping to be appreciated by His efforts. <br /> <br /> Then, Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second piece with a heirloom story of Italian neorealism with an anecdote "Peter and the Wolf". <br /> <br /> In the third story, which seems the most independent of this series even in the context, Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man in the wrong place at the wrong time. But after the recent lynching of Tlahuac and the tradition in this appalling case of the State of Mexico, this story could not be updated. <br /> <br /> And in the end, Fernando Sariñana returns to black humor the "grand finale" in which he brings together most of the characters from the sequences spent in one of the best comedies ever filmed. Taking up the central stage of one of his previous films "Todo el poder", Sariñana gives the last lesson of the theme. And by the way, give us the scene stealing the movie with Anna Ciochetti doing a short strip-tease. <br /> <br /> Once the movie is over, you have a bittersweet feeling of having watched a good movie (and perhaps appreciated) with a very painful subject. They say that in Mexico people make fun of their own shame and this is the best example. This film shows how Mexicans have learned to live in the midst of a criminal (and possibly accepted) state between two fires: criminals and so-called corrupt authorities. Even this film is wishful thinking because almost all good people have been victims of crime and are not spared. If you have been assaulted without a scratch, you are in luck. In the meantime, do not miss the chance to see this movie, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> And it's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
