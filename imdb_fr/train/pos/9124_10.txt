Apart from some of the dubious actors (his musicians at the end of the day), this, in the words of Quentin Tarrinno, is "The best rock movie ever made ... period" <br /> <br /> Think 8 Mile, but without the rap - a young musician, trying to prove himself to the local community, while struggling to cope with a broken house and a rival group. If you take into account the sexual interest and truly exceptional performance, it's the real mile. <br /> <br /> Prince provides a strong performance, as do Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent scenario, good direction, beautiful plot and spectacular performances. Not to mention the best rock / pop / funk music you'll ever hear.
