Although this program has not been broadcast since 1973, after watching a set of DVDs that I borrowed from our library, I felt obliged to say a few words. <br /> <br /> I remember when it was the only color show. on television in the 1960s, and sometimes, there was a little "Sunday night party" with friends to watch this on NBC on one of the few color TVs. <br /> <br /> I really like history, not so much for the names and dates, but how does it affect us today and how much can be so deep, based on the least important actions of the moment. Example: Virginia City, Nevada, which has become one of the richest cities in the world thanks to money, takes its name from a character called "Old Virginny", which, in its early days, came out of a saloon, fell and broke his bottle of whiskey. <br /> <br /> The old Virginny did not want to spoil the opportunity, as the precious liquid seeped into the earth, he decided to christen the city "Virginia Town". The area is known as the "Comstock Seam" because another character, Henry Comstock, was known to try to override everyone's claim and the area became known as the "Comstock Seam". <br /> <br /> with these 2 topics. Other episodes dealt with Mark Twain's literary rise as a journalist for the territorial company ... <br /> <br /> It was a healthy (and often educational) family entertainment. As someone else pointed out, every episode would really be considered a movie in its own right - scripts and rich characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that has twisted the truth is the proximity of Virginia City and Ponderosa. In fact, to get up from Ponderosa (all the way north of Lake Tahoe), you would have to ride your horse about 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) from the top of Spooner to the high desert (3,000 to 4,000 feet) of the Carson Valley, then another. 30-40 miles from Virginia City. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the Cartwrights would have painful back ends that would do it regularly. But every writer should have some leeway with the truth. <br /> <br /> Since I miss this show, even today.
