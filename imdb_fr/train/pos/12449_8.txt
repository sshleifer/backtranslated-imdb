Finally, a good movie about Modesty Blaise has been published. It tells not only a story, but actually tells the "real" story. I admit it's a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop on your way and remove all your expectations. You will then notice that this is a story very close to that of Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover just to tell how Modesty has become the gorgeous person she is. This is not a film to attract new fans, but a film to tell the real story. Some things could have been better, but when you can not forget the horrible movie of '66, then it's a beautiful movie. So, are you a fan, sit down, relax and enjoy the fact that the real story is there with a cover story just for Modesty to tell
