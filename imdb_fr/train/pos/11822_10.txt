Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies of all time. I must confess to those who have not seen it. You will really like it or hate it. He came out a year after the success of Batman. So, everyone's expectations were so great that many were disappointed simply because the plot is so simple. But it's based on a comic book ... what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is amazing! The sets, the make-up, the music, the costumes and the impressive acting make this film fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and no foul language - it's something rare nowadays. Directed, produced and performed by Warren Beatty in the role of the crime fighter against Al Pacino's big bad boy Big Caprice and his gang of thugs. Madonna steals the show under the seductive name Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. She has the best liners I've heard! Madonna fans would love that! One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic. This film is really a work of art that is unfortunately neglected by the public. To summarize, this film brings out the child in each of us. It's a movie that will leave you smiling at the end.
