I would like to see the resurrection of an updated series of Seahunt with the technology they have today, that would bring back the enthusiasm of the kids in me. my vote for a return of a new hunt at sea. We need a change of rhythm on television and it would work for a world of underwater adventures. By the way, thank you for this point of sale which allows you to see many views on TV and the Many movies. So, I think I have what I mean. It would be nice to read a few more points about sea hunting. If my rhymes were 10 lines, would you let me, or leave me in case of doubt and get arrested, if that's the case, I have to go, so let's act.
