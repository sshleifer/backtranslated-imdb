"Men of Honor" - a true story about a proud, proud and persistent black diver (fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr.), is certainly a great film that touches and entertains and is part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema. The acting is the main reason for making this film something really special and a pleasant and enjoyable experience. The charismatic Robert De Niro is wonderful as the rough, fierce and ruthless leader Billy Sunday - his role is practically written for him. This film alongside fantastic "15 minutes" (2001) are two of the latest proofs that he is still one of the best actors of our time. For its part, "Men of Honor" includes a fine performance by Cuba Gooding Jr., one of the most promising young black actors since "Boyz n the Hood". "Men of Honor" goes directly with "Jerry Maguire", "As good as it can be" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. is a fantastic and talented actor, and I'm ready to do a lot more. "Men of Honor" also has an excellent storyline and probably the most exciting dive sequences in the film's history. It's a fantastic and fascinating film that I can only recommend.
