Stephen King's best film alongside computer science, even though it's more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> This one has it all: <br /> <br /> - a superb cast with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a funny cameo from King himself; <br /> <br /> - A well-balanced horror in a fun scenario; <br /> <br /> - great use of music, especially "Sleepwalk" from Santo & Johnny; <br /> <br /> - adorable characters in a typical village setting nowhere; <br /> <br /> - a lot of humor. You can not really have good scares here because it's too much fun and excessive; <br /> <br /> - but pretty awesome makeup effects, like they do not do it anymore! <br /> <br /> A grade of 4.5: I do not really understand. When was the last time a horror movie was as much fun as this one?
