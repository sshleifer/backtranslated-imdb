It's an incredible movie. I do not remember the last time I saw a Swedish movie of this layer. It's funny, it's tragic, it's convincing and, above all, it's a slice of life in a small Swedish town. He crushes clichés and lives more deeply. We feel connected, not only with the main characters, but with all the characters. <br /> <br /> A great city dweller who goes back to the roots, her little hometown, to celebrate her father's 70th birthday, crossing with people she has not met for years. Although the story itself is not unique, it proposes a new approach. The center of the story is the relationship between three sisters (on different stages of life), who are not very close. Or at least, do not realize how close they are to each other. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why it's so easy to connect with the people in this movie is flawless distribution. First of all, I am more than happy that there is absolutely no Swedish actor called "list" in this film. Usually, a handful of actors are able to find themselves in almost all major Swedish productions. This time, the production company has managed to stay true to reality by staging actors who seem to really like their job. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva Röse to prove that you do not need words to express an emotion. <br /> <br /> The writing is also very attractive. The dialogue is more than credible and compared to other Swedish films of the last two years, it advances several kilometers. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you did not know it, you will never guess that this is her first writing AND the making of a feature film. I can not wait for the next one. <br /> <br /> Once you start looking at this, you really want to see it through.
