My daughter, her friends and I watched this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and girlfriends escaped with it. Subsequently, I rented it so often. It never gets old !!! Blockbuster does not even have it in their lists and I have tried to buy, to find it, to rent it for more than 5 years. Without a doubt, this was and remains my favorite film of my daughter's childhood ... he has everything! We laughed, we cried, we discussed the real life and hardness of some children around the world. There was nothing pretended about this movie. We logged in every second and every line Bill! Thank you a thousand times for restoring our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, huh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> August 2007 Update: <br /> <br /> Who should we judge if a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a man who has love chooses to raise a child who is not his. It may not be my life or your life It's not just credible, it happens every day. Thank God! Keep my faith in the living human nature !!! celebrate!!!!
