I saw it when I was 17 and I have not seen it since. The "CBS Late Movie" showed him regularly at one point. I remember how sad and overwhelming it was. It really made me sick. The effects were not what they are today, but nevertheless, it gave the feeling of being alone in the Amazon, after losing both parents and looking for a way out, very well. I remember the most realistic insects and maggots, eating their flesh. It was a dark film that was controversial at the time, although it was probably heavily edited for television. I want to remember more details, and if I ever have the chance to see him again, I can comment further. I have been looking for years. I think it may have been broadcast on CBS under another title. I do not know if it has already been broadcast on video.
