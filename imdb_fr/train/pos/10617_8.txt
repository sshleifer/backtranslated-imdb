Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter who travels with her team (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California, to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their homes have fallen into the water and all hotels in the city are full. They travel out of town to a remote location and enjoy the seemingly sympathetic hospitality of Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). Do not you know, Ernest and his Virginia partner, Virginia (Lelia Goldoni), hide a big secret in their cellar: a pitiful, deformed "Junior" dressed in a diaper (Stephen Furst, in a performance remarkable) that terrorizes girls. <br /> <br /> A deliciously unbalanced Lassick plays the real monster in this worrisome horror movie. It builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation / climax, delivering the horror in small doses until the last half hour. The hotel and the menacing cellar - great echoes of "Psycho" here - offer an ideal setting. Above all, the perverse intrigue involves incest and patricide, allowing the film to take on a truly dark quality. And yet, it becomes as poignant as we realize that Junior is not a frightening ghost but a victim as well as girls. The final plan is particularly sad. <br /> <br /> "The Unseen" is a solid little horror movie that deserves to be discovered. <br /> <br /> 8/10
