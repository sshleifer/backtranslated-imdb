It was a movie I had heard about all my life growing up, but I had never seen it until a few years ago. It is the reputation really done. I knew Michael Myers, I had seen the mask, seen advertisements for all the shabby suites that followed. But I was growing up in the decade when Jason and Freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game and never really thought about the Halloween franchise. Boy, I got fooled by cheap imitations. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a truly terrifying movie. Today, by today's standards, it is not as graphic and visceral, but this film lives up to all the other levels that most horror movies fail today. The atmosphere created by John Carpenter is so terrifying and the fact that it takes place in a picturesque city in the center-west testifies to its capabilities. The effects of light are frightening, "The Shape" seeming to appear and disappear at will. The simple but brutally effective score only adds to the suspense. <br /> <br /> The performances of all the players are well executed, with specific marks of head to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is very friendly and vulnerable. It's all the more frightening because she is harassed by Michael Myers, because the director and the viewer have invested so much in her that she wants to survive and escape. a man on a mission, and it works well. It adds a sense of urgency to the difficult situation in which the city is located because it knows that the evil lurks in their streets. <br /> <br /> Overall, Halloween is not just a big horror movie, but a good movie too. It works on many levels and attracts the public and never drops anything. This should be the standard visualization for anyone who wants to live a really scary movie. And for an even more scary time, try to watch it alone with the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think to see "The Shape" hiding in the shadows!
