It's hard to say which of these two successes will be James Cagney's charm and energy, or the revealing excesses of Busby Berkeley's three big hits at the close. I give a tie, with Footlight Parade, one of the funniest and fastest musicals of the early thirties. Although the film clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds a lot to the beautiful story. <br /> <br /> And what is the story? It's Chester Kent (Cagney), who produces musicals. He begins to make Prologues, live musical entertainment offered on stage before the beginning of a movie. He had the idea to make bigger and bigger, moving them across the country. He is a ball of fire and ideas, and he needs all the ideas he can have to continue producing these things relentlessly. But a rival spies on him and robs him of his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), his wise secretary, loves him but he is too busy to notice. an office girl with black and round glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants a chance to dance; his wife comes back saying that she has not divorced after all; a blonde gold researcher puts her hooks in him; his partners are cheating on him ... God, what's next? All of this may seem hard to digest, but everything goes fast, Cagney leaping, strutting, walking, taking fingerprints, barking orders and occasionally - until the last digit where he starts singing and dancing - doing a step or two just to show how it's done. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Let's do a show, gang," we have "We have to create three shows in three days, so lock the doors and start to repeat." These three Super Prologues will present 40 choirs, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract, with forty Kent units in luxury cinemas ... all the circuit of the Apollo movie house! Exhaustion threatens, feet hurt, but all those unbanked chorins disguised in tight suits (including Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour, you can quickly spot Sothern but Lamour is more generic) stay the course, dancing their hearts, laughing and chatty and seemingly remarkably carefree. . <br /> <br /> And then the curtains rise, each prologue being presented in separate movie theaters, one after the other, the same evening, the owner of the Apollo circuit will determine if this evening will be saved The skin from Chester or not. <br /> <br /> The first step is "Honeymoon Hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9-minute production issue that features a lot of healthy lasciviousness, with brides and grooms (some may even be married), rooms and beds and doors with "Do not disturb" signs. <br /> <br /> Then, let's go to the next theater and the 11 minutes of "By a Waterfall" which probably worried the Warner Brothers accountants to go bankrupt. This number is so excessive - dozens of girls swimming, trees, fountains, a huge cave with slides, a giant pond - you would never think there was a depression. Berkeley realizes all his tricks - synchronization, human diagrams, legs and arms performing all kinds of precision tasks - and he does it in the water, with a lot of underwater photographs lifted. The girls are safe. They go up smiling with water in their eyes and still strike their marks. All this must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has some quick shots in the water, is the only one to look a little cautious. <br /> <br /> And finally, the glittering finale ... 11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler for "Shanghai Lil", with all kinds of bar girls and their clients, which is unusual in that the races are mixed. Cagney and Keeler dance on the bar, on a table, Cagney fights. There is what looks like fifty or sixty marines in motion, going back and forth, guns thrown and caught. So ... that's right ... a human image of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle. It may be the only Hollywood music production ever to feature Roosevelt, a large federal agency and a group of sexy Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It's an entertainment, my friends. It's good! <br /> <br /> Of course, the Chester Prologues get the big deal and Nan gets Chester. The film is full of juicy clich√©s that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so endearing that she throws her shots with her arms up and you want to help her. Joan Blondell makes us forget a lot of Hollywood women who could have been more beautiful but had a lot less wit and personality. The film, however, belongs to Cagney, who catches and shakes him, and to Berkeley, a man for whom too much was never too much.
