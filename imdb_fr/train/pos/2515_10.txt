Moon Child, with Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt, was a better movie than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in Mallepa and follows a group of street orphans, Sho, Sho's brother Shinji, and Toshi who steal and murder for a living. On a flight, Sho meets Hyde's Kei vampire who is burning in the sun. The true nature of Kei is shown, but no one avoids it. <br /> <br /> Time passes and implies that the immortal, immutable, Kei raised Sho, and both have an extreme close connection. Sho and Kei then meet Son in an extravagant shootout and quickly become friends. Kei and Hyde fall in love with Son's sister, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time passes again and shows an adult Sho, this time empty of Kei. This also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through tragedies, tragedies, this film plunges into the reality of life and all its difficulties, with a focus on friendship and love. It's a really moving film, sad and beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think Gackt did a wonderful job. Hyde did an incredible job for the first time. <br /> <br /> The shots were beautiful, but the film had rare and horrible shots. <br /> <br /> All in all, I must say This movie is amazing, moving, and I highly recommend it.
