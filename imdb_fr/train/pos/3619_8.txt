In spite of all the efforts of Disney, it is about a rather pleasant film on the realization of your dreams. I was surprised that this did not seem to me too sentimental; this movie just played. Dennis Quaid was very, very good in the role, saying something for a sports film. I do not remember how many sports movies have had small quirks that bother me; here, everyone is watching the game. This film is surprisingly good, and I predict it will make surprising business because it is a G-rated film that does not force the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert on the contrary, this film is a success.
