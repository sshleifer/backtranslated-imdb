In her first non-aquatic role, Esther Williams plays a school teacher who has been sexually assaulted. She gives a great performance, proving that she could be very effective outside the pool. As a detective in charge of solving the case, George Nader may be giving his best performance. And it is so beautiful that it hurts! John Saxon is the suspected student, and although he gets an impressive bill in the credits, it is Edward Andrews who is his overprotective father who stands out. <br /> <br /> Bathed in a glorious Technicolor, The Unguarded Moment is irresistible hokum and sometimes compelling drama.
