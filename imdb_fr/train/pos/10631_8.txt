This film was seen by my wife and me when it was released in 1978. It was a revelation for us. We thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple to have married and had children. Obviously we were wrong. Love can come from where you do not expect it and maybe you do not want it. But we both chose this love anyway. <br /> <br /> And no, it never changed our sexual orientation. This kind of thing is for Christian wackos. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we both had business, but never with the opposite sex. As we get older, we have stopped having extramarital relationships. <br /> <br /> This story is not exaggerated. However, the idea that they have become heterosexual seems to me rather unrealistic. My wife and I have been sleeping together for 40 years. We are still gay. End of the story.
