It's an extremely powerful movie based on a true story that can be maddening to watch. I say that because the bitter press can be brutal to people, in this case an innocent Australian couple accused of killing their baby. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for his performance when this movie was released but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's just say they were both excellent, but the role was a little harder for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent. (She learned so well that I had trouble understanding her in parts.) Without revealing anything, all I can say is that this movie is going to exhaust you emotionally.
