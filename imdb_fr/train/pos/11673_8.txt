Having seen Charley Boorman in Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested to see how Charley would be on his own show. I thought Charley was an adorable man, very down-to-earth. It's good to see that celebrities are struggling to keep their weight and their physical condition, it shows that it is also their human! I do not know much about motorcycles, but this show captures me from the beginning. The preparation and organization of this event seem immense. The event itself seems very dangerous and I am fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else do it and how good it is. I love the rhythm of the show and the fast and catchy music. I can not believe he broke his collarbone, I really hope it's not the end, I can not wait to see the next episode ...
