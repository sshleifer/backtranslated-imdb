I started watching a replay of this TV movie on a Sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another silent film in case of an air disaster. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's Clock" is an intelligent political thriller that far exceeds the quality of most TV movies. He could have made his debut on the big screen as well. <br /> <br /> The distribution is excellent, especially with veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga achieves one of his best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA. Jane Leeves de Frasier is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is convincing. In fact, the last hour is so full of twists and suspense that you can not leave your seat for a second. If you have the chance to see this movie, invest time - almost four hours. You will be richly rewarded!
