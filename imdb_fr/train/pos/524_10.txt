I saw this movie years ago on TV late at night. At the time, it bore the title of "Stairway to Heaven". Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply touched by the story and stunned by the visual effects of the trial (those who saw him know what I'm talking about). Such an imagination! A perfect mix of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this film is among the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. Voters in the IMDB rated this film extremely high, and rightly so - over 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or more out of 10. I was surprised that it was not listed in the top 250 movies until I realized that so few have seen / noticed this movie, compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this movie will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so that 1), I can buy it, and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
