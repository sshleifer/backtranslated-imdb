I found this film inspiring reflexion and refreshing ambiguity in a world of fast films where we are manipulated to love the "good guy" and hate the "bad guy". Scott Cohen, a very fine television actor, brilliantly portrays the black sheep / lost child who aspires to win the love and respect of his father, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law, with whom he apparently lives. 'history. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual image of a man as a father who triangulated his sons and found himself now with the one he had always rejected. <br /> <br /> When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was delighted by the beautiful way that sawdust was used to represent a family tradition, as explained by the director. <br /> <br /> It is a suitable successor of the classic "Ordinary People". I just realized that Judd Hirsch was also part of that!
