Greetings again from the darkness. How rare is a film to examine the lost souls of suffering men. Adam Sandler plays the role of Charlie, a man who lost his family in the tragedy of September 11 and has since lost his career, his reason for living and, no doubt, his sanity. Don Cheadle is the former roommate of Sandler Dental School, who seems to have the perfect life (which Sandler apparently had before 9/11). <br /> <br /> Of course, the parallels in the lives of these men are obvious, but it's really refreshing to see the feelings of men in a movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge, c 'is. Watching how they help each other by simply being there is painful and sincere. Screenwriter / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger" and Sandler's accountant in this film) really brings a different look and feel to the film. Some scenes do not work as well as others, but overall it's well written and well directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's character is a little reminiscent of his great performance in "Drunk Love Punch", but it brings a lot more depth here. Cheadle always goes very well and sums up the burden he bears ... just watch him work on a puzzle. <br /> <br /> The support work is excellent from Jada Pinkett Smith (Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in a strangely appealing role), Donald Sutherland in as an irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's in-laws. <br /> <br /> The film really talks about how the tragic events of this day have affected a man so deeply that he is fundamentally ruined. In addition to the interesting story and some great images of NYC, you should love any film featuring voices from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder imitating Daltrey. It's not really an optimistic film, but it's a quality film with an unusual story.
