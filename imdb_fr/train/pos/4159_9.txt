Anyone who thinks that anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. It's a good movie that tells Tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death, but also grows in the process. The journey by train represents, in a way, Tetsuro's journey from childhood to manhood. The music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated (you can say it's a 70's movie) and the animation is only slightly higher than your average "Star Blazers" episode. But the story and the characters are so strong that it does not matter. A must for any fan of animation!
