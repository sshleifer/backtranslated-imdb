We loved the movie. I am a mother of two little men. I love having a movie that I can watch with them, where men have integrity and character. Moveis where money is not the most important thing. And the family is forever and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> I wish we could see more of the Davis family. But all in all, I loved that gave me the same feeling as others: "Please, do not be above you". We both want the actors do not change. The new actors were good substitutes. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son also loved this movie. asked me to go buy them all. He is a film critic, so for him, it tells me something. The family should all see this move buy it for friends. Help to bring back a time of values. We will read the books now that we are hooked. I really hope to see more. Be happy happy in motion
