This great movie failed to score above 5! Why not! It is a great portrait of the life of Christ without the pitiless sensationalism of The Passion of Christ. Johnny Cash did great things for God that are surprisingly neglected and neglected the film itself took less than a month to shoot because Johnny felt the strong presence of God that guided him. Great credit to all the people involved in this extremely sincere film that will always be cherished At least Billy Graham's crusade has deemed it high enough to use it as the main source of education for new Christians. Thanks Fox for having it Walk the Line proved that it was whimsical that this man had survived an underrated masterpiece. The films are not canonized by the popular vote as proves this production! In summary, I think this film is one of the best documentaries in the world, because it is frank, honestly described and a great witness of the Christian faith!
