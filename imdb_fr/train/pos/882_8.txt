I took this one on a whim of the library and was very pleasantly surprised. A lot of tight and expressionistic photographic work, an equally tight scenario and two superb actors blend to give a very beautiful film. Not for the reptilian multiplex brain, but rather the true movie aficionado. If Hollywood manages to get dirty one day, I'm sure it will ruin it. A choice of choices all around. Other posters here have more than fully praised her, so I do not need to worry about duplicating their pages; follow their advice, and mine, and do not miss this gem. Call it what you want; I call it two hours of well-spent entertainment. Read my lips: do not miss it.
