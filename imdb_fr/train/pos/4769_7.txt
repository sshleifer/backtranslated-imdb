I'm sure it's a show that no one knows so well and who might not think it's good; after all, it's almost close to Baywatch Hawaii. With the casting, the place, the style of the staging and its advertising ?? shows women walking on the beach and all that. It is no wonder that people have a wrong idea and decide not to look at it. <br /> <br /> It was wrong of them to do it. Because after I decide to watch the show, there are more things, real juicy stories and conflicts, that are really exciting to watch and pretty much? addictive. <br /> <br /> The story of the hotel's employees, the manager, the owner and their complicated love life. Also enter the hotel's annoying visitor and the mighty man trying to steal the hotel. It's actually more exciting than it seems here. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that the acting is nil, but it's not so bad that you look elsewhere. The story is not so consistent but sufficient. The soundtrack fits the script quite well and the action is going on all the time. I took a couple of episodes before anything happens, so be patient. <br /> <br /> Recommendation: I really like watching this. Zillion Times: better than expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Grade: B) <br /> <br /> Rate my comment after reading it, thanks.
