* SPOILERS * Four men, Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty), decide to go rafting on the Cahulawassee River before it is flooded. > <br /> They wanted to have fun, have a good weekend in the nature. <br /> <br /> But when two mountaineers cross and rape one of them (Bobby), everything starts to go to Hell in a basket, and this "nice weekend" will cost even the life of one of the four ... <br /> <br /> "Deliverance", which is stupidly called "A Tranquillo Weekend Di Paura" ("A Calm Weekend Of Fear"), is the grandfather of films like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Hills Have Eyes', 'Wrong Turn', 'Last House On The Left' and all the other films of 'Evil Nature / Revenge'. , and one of the scariest, right next to "The Hills Have Eyes". <br /> <br /> According to a book by James Dickey (who appears in the film under the title of Sheriff Bullard), this is a scary story about how to go into a situation by thinking that he knows everything when he does not do it. <br /> <br /> And the image of the dead man's hand lifting water, or the hands holding the rifle to a leaf are haunting images that will never leave you. <br /> <br /> Deliverance: 9/10.
