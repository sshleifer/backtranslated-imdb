For years, I thought this comedy worthy of the name was a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen. He certainly has the same rough humor as Ford Lace with his films. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I learned that it was George Stevens who realized it. I still refuse to believe that this film was not offered to John Ford, but he probably went to Monument Valley to perform Stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen, along with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, play three Indian Army sergeants who have a nice friend / boyfriend / boyfriend camaraderie. But the old gang separates because Fairbanks is engaged to Joan Fontaine. Not if his two buddies can help him, aided and abetted by the regimental beast Gunga Din played by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> Rudyard Kipling's poem inspired this RKO film about life in the barracks of the British Raj. The cartoon of the actors is so good that it eclipses the incredibly racist message of the film. It's not that the officials are racist, but that's what the British at the time assumed, including our leaders and Gunga Din shows it in the most effective way. <br /> <br /> there with local rulers under a weak Mughal emperor who was eliminated in the middle of the 19th century. They ruled India very little, it would have been impossible. Their reign depended on the native troops you see here. Note that soldiers can not go beyond the rank of corporal and that Gunga Din's status is considerably lower. <br /> <br /> Note here that the rebels are in fact Hindu and non-Muslim. There are as many strains of this religion as there are Christian sects and this strangled cult was very real. Of course, for those who are strangled, they might not have the same vision of them as the liberators. But until India organized its independence movement, until the creation of the Congress Party, these people were the voice of a free India. <br /> <br /> But no matter how you decide, strangling people is not a good thing to do. and the British had their point here too. When I look at Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and the reason why the main directive was created. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant had the chance to play his real cockney role here instead of the urbane Cary we're used to seeing. Fairbanks and McLaglen are doing very well with roles that fit their personality perfectly. <br /> <br /> The best role in the film, however, is Eduard Ciannelli, the guru, the leader of the strangler cult. Note fire and passion in his performance, he blocks everyone when he is on. <br /> <br /> The favorite scene of Gunga Din is Ciannelli exhorting his troops in their mountain temple. Note that Stevens gradually darkens the background around Ciannelli until you see only eyes and teeth like a macabre Halloween mask. Hasty, scary and very effective. <br /> <br /> It is right after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more British have begun to question the underlying assumptions justifying the Raj. But this is the subject of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is always a great movie, entertaining and entertaining. This should be shown with A passage in India and Gandhi and you can trace how the Indian independence movement evolved.
