After seeing Dick Tracy in $ 6.99 at Future Shop, I decided to try the experiment without any prior knowledge and to be a big fan of Mafia and crime movies. I was very surprised to see a very entertaining and intelligent entertaining film with solid performances throughout. The film is going well, of course it has another strong performance from Warren Beatty, but the real stars of the movie are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to hear that Pacino was nominated for his performance as a high-profile gangster who was trying to destroy the city. Madonna was great as a damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you'd rather watch a fun, smart movie with great acting and a solid storyline then try Dick Tracy. I do not think you will be disappointed. And watch the cameos of Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman, among others.
