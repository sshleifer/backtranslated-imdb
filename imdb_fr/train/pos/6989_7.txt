This film was featured in one of the very first episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I watch it, I do not think about this wonderful TV series. I think it was a surprisingly good horror movie in the early '40s, with a very good sound and a very good image for a 67-year-old horror film belonging to the public. In fact, I loved watching Bela Lugosi and his weird staff, including his wife who needs liquid glands of young wives, an old witch, and her two weird sons, a giant idiot, the other a comic dwarf (Angelo Rossitto from 1932 Freaks). I also enjoyed the courageous young journalist, who is a kind of stereotype, but still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent film is its intrigue, even ridiculous and incredible for a movie. I do not want to ruin this movie, so rent it or, better yet, buy it for a few dollars.
