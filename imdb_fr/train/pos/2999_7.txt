There were times when this movie seemed to get a lot more complicated than it needed to be, but I guess that's part of its charm. The detective powers of Detective Philo Vance seem superior to all Eastern detectives of the time when it comes to the final assessment of how the murders were committed. The fall of the dagger in the Chinese vase was a blow to me; I mean, could not someone just let him down? <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, Vance (William Powell) spoke of Archer Coe's "psychological impossibility" of committing suicide - I had to think about it for a moment. I wondered if there was a scientific basis for this concept to be true without having studied psychology myself. This sounds logical, but there is always a case that does not fit the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, the restless coroner (Etienne Girardot) gave me a good kick, which reminded me of the Star Trek doctor. McCoy both times he said "I'm a doctor, not a magician" and "I'm a doctor, not a detective". I can imagine DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and saying, "I'll have to use this once in a while." <br /> <br /> Once the identity of the killer revealed, it does not seem to be such a big surprise, but until then, everyone guesses. Aside from Archer and Brisbane Coe, the film does not answer the central question posed by the title and the murder that interests me a great deal: who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald's dog, Ghillie?
