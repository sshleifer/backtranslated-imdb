As someone who has seen and followed Hartley's public work for many years, I think that much of what was once a fiction told through true stories has been erected into obscure games of philosophical thought. <br /> <br /> While entertaining, Fay Grim is another Enter the line of thinking of Henry Fool, where the film reflects the quality of an object in the film itself. In Henry Fool, the object is constituted by memories ... In Fay Grim, the object is encrypted memories - themselves stolen, forged and trans-mutated into something as obscure as it was not really make sense - the scripting process of writing and filmmaking in the modern era - where most blockbusters are just a mix of the past. In philosophical terms, this is what Fay Grim consists of. The object, perhaps, is the tragedy that the shock has become clich√©d and boring (as shown in the early scenes of the publisher's office). <br /> <br /> That said, many of the film's best points are lost if you do not understand Henry's character and the meaning of the memories sought. Henry is a barely veiled devil, first visiting Simon as a modern Faust, and so on. Without understanding how tragic Henry's character is, much of the quality of Fay Grim's plot and story is lost. <br /> <br /> And there are not enough "details" expressed by verbal flashbacks - knowing the plot of Henry Fool can not be compared to "feeling" the quality of the characters as in Henry Fool, and so I think for someone who walks in this cold film, it takes about 10 minutes However, Henry Fool was also my last favorite Hartley movie until I realized it was bad - putrid and infested - precisely because Henry Fool's confessions were bad ... not just brutal or dirty, but inevitably broken. Henry can not even be a real villain - and it may be the tragic flaw that makes him the most endearing ... like Gollum in Tolkien's works, Henry is pitiful. <br /> <br /> This can not be seen at Fay Grim, although Henry's dialogue is excellent. What is obvious is that the entire movie is built as an encryption - a kind of molding of another plot around what ends up being yet another bad story to add to Henry's confession. It's an interesting twist, but it can not really be digested without watching the first movie. Perhaps it would have been better to show Henry more earlier than asking the publisher to describe the basic storyline of the first movie - although this plot is not really what the first movie was about - unless the one of them may be an occasional observer. <br /> <br /> Part of the encryption? Hard to say ... a little disappointed by the sexual gadgets. Nerdy.
