Opening the film with a Bach Toccata is a hint of what will happen in this intense drama. All the composition devices perfected by Bach to keep his listener (and his interpreter) intrigued and entertained apply to this film. There is no mutual tenderness between the two main characters and the main woman in the final scene, but I think it is justified to say that she was raped, even if her attacker believes she was warned he was a boy. Mamet convincingly explores the emotional pitfall and the differences between the sexes, but I feel that he has no idea how they complement each other given a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet has already developed a healthy humorous approach to gender interaction, I wonder how this work could have ended? As it exists, it is very dark and petty.
