Albeniz's music permeates this film. Once in a while, it is played with an original instrumentation (for example, the piano, but never with a full orchestra), but often it is reworked with various contemporary ensembles and treatments (for example, the guitar) (by example, the jazz piano). The film focuses exclusively on music: the vast majority of the time, the music is programmed in various dances, often flamenco, but not always. I guess there are 12 out of 14 scenes that are not united by a plot. Not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual spectator. In my case, about half reached the top, although all the others were very good in their own way. Those who worked for me pushed me to an aesthetic pleasure in goosebumps; indeed, the final scene left me crying with joy. And in a very magical way, it plunges you deep into Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. The film is virtually silent, although each scene bears the title of a piece of Albeniz. Seeing this beautiful film highlights my complaint that virtually none of Saura's films are available on DVD in the United States. I am thinking in particular here of his flamenco version of "Carmen", a spectacular work of art available in Europe but not here (European DVDs can not be played on American DVD players). It is a scandal.
