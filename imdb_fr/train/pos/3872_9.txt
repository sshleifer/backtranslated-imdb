After seeing this funny and comic little movie, you will certainly feel better. Congratulations to Yves B. Pelletier for giving birth to this wonderful little film moment that, in my opinion, will be recognized as a milestone film of the year 2004 for Quebec. Actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and St√©phane Gagnon all deliver a touching performance. I would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to those whom Amelie Poulain's Fabulous Destiny has given me. So, if you like Jean-Pierre Jeunet's beautiful film, I would say that you should also like Yves B. Pelletier's first film, Les Aimants
