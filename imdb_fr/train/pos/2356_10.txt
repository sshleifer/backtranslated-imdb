Pushing Daisies was a wonderful sight. Just like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you see, was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand that people who do not have a great passion for theater, film, musicals, etc., are annoyed. This is not a typical TV program and the fantastic is too much for some. These people seem to need a bit more linear and sweet tone to stay happy. This program bursts with color, winks at old movie scenes, hums incredible music and offers talented performances. There is nothing random about the choices that take place from costume to leitmotiv. The story takes a lot of twists but is very accessible because the conversations are about love, honesty, courage, loss and so many other problems we face every day. The only unfortunate aspect was the end of the show and it was rushed because Pushing Daisies was canceled. Do not approach this as a typical TV show. Think of it as an evening at the theater, then sit back and enjoy!
