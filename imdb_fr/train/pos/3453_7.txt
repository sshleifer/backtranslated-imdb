Although this film has a list of excellent actors, excellent special effects and a story full of surprises, it was not picked up for studio distribution and went straight to DVD. Perhaps there is too much information about "police forces", or maybe it's too many action films that have been broadcast during a glut, but whatever the reason for which big screens missed the opportunity, fortunately the new concept of direct diffusion on DVD allows us to profit from it. <br /> <br /> The theme is old: a novice journalist discovers a small circle of corrupt police officers - in this case, the FRAT (First Response Assault and Tactical), a group of well-trained police, created to clean the mythical Edison town of crime, drugs, prostitution, etc. Working under cover to try to confiscate confiscated property and money turns out Fifteen years after its creation, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, the terror of innocents, etc. The leading dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, a terrifying gangster!) And his partner Rafe Deed (LL Cool J, even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor). Journalist Pollack (Justin Timberlake) gets wind of a "bad mistake" and presents his theory of fraud and corruption to the boss of his newspaper, Ashford (Morgan Freeman, still very reliable). Gradually, Polack convinces Ashford, then Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also a character actor always excellent) and helps Pollack in his investigative reporting. The closer Pollack gets to the truth, the more surprises and incidents, and the story turns to the mall for a series of unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Timberlake lacks the charisma to lead the dance, especially in the company of such experienced actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey and McDermott keep the machine well oiled with a film until the end. No, it's not a good movie, but it's a film that stands out with its message. Grady Harp
