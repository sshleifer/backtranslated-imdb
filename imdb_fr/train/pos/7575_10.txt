Resident Evil: Code Veronica is an excellent video game well designed, with superb graphics, very comfortable controls, a remarkable script and a high entertainment factor. The scenario of this film, Claire Redfield, is taken to an island to pass without authorization The graphics of Veronica are very good, the effects of fire and rain are superb. The controls are comfortable, but the button pattern does not match the control of Dreamcast, which makes it difficult to get used to it is always fun to walk in a strange and disturbing place, to draw guts on zombies. Code: Veronica also has a bit of "romance" between the two main characters. The sound in this game is better than ever, for example, although I hate the new feature, when giant spiders crawl, their feet produce a disturbing disturbing sound, and the guns sound much more realistic. history, comfortable controls and reali The sound stic makes Resident Evil Code: Veronica a loved one. I give him a 10 out of 10.
