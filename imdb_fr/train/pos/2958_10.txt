A comedy with epic and funny proportions from the guys who brought you to South Park and most of the guys from Orgazmo. This vulgar observation film has a totally disgusting, egotistical and satirical content. It depicts an incredibly cruel treatment of human beings and animals. I LIKE THAT!!!!! It's funny stuff. Very funny. Two losing friends create a game in their driveway, which is a sensation. Corruption, greed and blackmail are upsetting the sport. And on the way, you will laugh. A lot. That's all there is. Enjoy!!!!
