The first two seasons of this humorous series were very strange. They were not very funny and had a dramatic element where Bill (the mother) struggled with all the usual problems of life, but this element was a little depressing and did not mix. well with the comedy elements that is probably why he was abandoned. After that, it quickly became one of the funniest comedy series of the BBC! The chemistry between Bill's character and Ben's was very funny and there were always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series. The Christmas promotions were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The series ended with the death of lead actor Gary Olsen, who was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in movies like Up 'n' Under and a very funny man . RIP This underrated program has unfortunately disappeared from our TV screens and should not be repeated as often - though it occasionally appears on UKTV Gold, but it should be repeated on the BBC to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
