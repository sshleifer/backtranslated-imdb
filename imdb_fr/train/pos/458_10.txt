My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the show and we can not wait to be next (I hope there will be a sequel!). I'd like to know what's called the catchy song and who wrote it, maybe because I'm "old and gray" and life always interests me :-). If you have the full lyrics, send them to us. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons my wife and I loved this series so much is that we are 75 years old and retired, but we are very active intellectually. It is good to see a show that highlights the contribution to society of older people with special skills and experience. The human interest that highlights the interactions of the characters and the young people around them is an important part of the series. <br /> <br /> This series is very entertaining and very sophisticated, on par with our other favorites. , "Spooks" and "Hustle".
