I think the context of the story has been covered by other posters, so I would just like to talk about the impact of this film on me. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time in the year of its release, around 1987. My school organized a trip to the cinema to see it, for an ER project, I think. We all went of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema! We did not know what we were going to live. To this day, I still remember the feelings he invoked in me and I remembered many crying like most of my friends. I think that at the age we were, we found it shocking and silent, rightly scandalized in our own youthful way. He impressed me so much that I joined the anti-apartheid movement the same year. <br /> <br /> I think it served its purpose in my case.
