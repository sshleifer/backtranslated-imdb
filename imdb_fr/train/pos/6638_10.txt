The attraction of old movies like this is that you see a moving picture of life more than 100 years ago. There are many people coming out of a factory, all dead to date and none of them even remotely realizing the extent of the invention they went to before. I was shocked to read a review describing this movie as boring as the personal videos today, and at least one other mistakenly identified it as the first film ever produced (it was the first film shot at 16 frames per second rather than the then normal 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Of course, all you see is a lot of people coming out of a building and passing the movie theater as they come home from work, but it's a piece for many reasons, not least. This is the first film made by the Lumiere brothers, which probably had a greater impact on the development of cinema than any other individual or group of individuals in history.
