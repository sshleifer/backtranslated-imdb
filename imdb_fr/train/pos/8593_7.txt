The Sentinel presents a sort of running and suspense / mystery clich√©, but is highlighted by a good staging and a good pace. Most of these stories have already gone through as many permutations as we can handle. So how good is the game of actors, how smart are the installations and the bad guys, how well designed is the main plot, and so on? ..... so the Sentinel does a solid job given its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland both have a good screen and a good attitude. Eva Longoria (the first time I see her on the screen) is providing good support. The whole history of the story is totally implausible, but it deserves to be released. Worth a look if you like the genre.
