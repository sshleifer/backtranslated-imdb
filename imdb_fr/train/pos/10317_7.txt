Do you know how Star Trek fans have flocked to every Star Trek movie, even the worst? Why? To see their heroes in action once more. That's what I feel for Doc Savage. I am a big fanatic of the character and the prospect of seeing Doc and his team in an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the film only reinforced this feeling of anticipation. Then, they decided to inscribe elements of a number of Doc adventures and to throw them in this film, thus giving a film somewhat disjointed. There are many promises here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (music, "camp" elements, etc.). But Doc's spirit is there and that's what those of us who know Doc and his team react to. So, what I'm trying to say is that it's not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. And all fans of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters should watch this movie just to get acquainted with the hero who inspired them all.
