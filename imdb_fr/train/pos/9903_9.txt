Wow, praise IMDb and Google, because I'm trying to remember the name of this awesome movie for 15 years now. Slaughter High, man! Hells yeah! <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with a summary of the plot, actors and yadda yadda yadda, because you all know what's going on. That's why you're here anyway. What I'm going to do, however, is explain the memory I have of this adorable slasher attached by D-Movie of the 80s. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was about 7 years old, my father rented all those horror movies. Would he care if his children look at them with him? So, at this young age, I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in this film was close to my heart. I have not seen it since, but I still remember most of the ridiculous assassinations of the movie. For example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) Is electrocuted. Or, the guy is drowning in a pool. Come on! My favorite, however ... the belly that explodes contaminated beer. Unbelievable! How can you honestly hate a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, 10 or 15 years later, and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it? Then his stomach explodes? What!? And this beautiful phrase: Let's take my car ... it always starts. From classic shit to the end. <br /> <br /> I mean, I'm looking back now, almost 20 years later, and I'm laughing. But when I was 7, I was scared! This jester hat (or was it a mask?) That the killer rocks made me panic! F / ck out! <br /> <br /> All in all, yes, a crappy movie. But for reasons of nostalgia and for the humor factor, this film gets a 9 out of 10 from me. Stay awake very late every night and hope to see it in the same movie Late Late Late Late Movie, or look for a VHS copy and dust off your VCR.
