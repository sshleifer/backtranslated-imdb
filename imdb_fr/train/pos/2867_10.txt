I lost my father very young. So young that I can not remember anymore. Over the years, I learned a lot about him. One of those things was that he loved westerns and watching Bonanza every Sunday night was an absolute ritual for him. I remember the end of the show, which was 8 years old when the show stopped production in 1973 Watching this show over the years brings me closer to my long-lost father. He has all the necessary elements to make a show a success: laughter, tears, suspense from your seat, and that has even made you angry. from the original series of the series, shortly after the death of our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker. One episode in particular and the end of the closing credits, an image of Blocker and a blackish color, and I remember that as if it were yesterday. In the name of my late father, who is not here to say it himself, we love Bonanza. Long live the Cartwrights.
