The first hour of the film was, to say the least, boring. However, this has improved after the start of Valentine's Day. Aside from the twist on the murderer's identity at the end, the hot murder scene is one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this film. The garden scene with Kate was well filmed, as was the very last scene (the "twist"). In these scenes, there was a real thrill and thrills and the murder scene in the hot bath had a nasty edge (as the slashers should be). The previous murders are frustrated, bloodless.
