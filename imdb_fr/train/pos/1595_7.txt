Although I would say that I enjoy the show, I was expecting something completely different from the first time I saw "What I Like About You," I expected to find something like " All that "(I'm not sure that to happen) but I must say that I like the series, and even if I do not class as a breakthrough, it is very charming and I love the chemistry well between characters (including secondary distribution) <br /> <br /> I would certainly say that I am delighted to see Wesley Jonathan return to the screen because I really loved her in City Guy. I also saw the woman who plays Valerie's friend in Popular and I think it was a good show, but I do not really like her character in this show because she's just not cup of tea, but she completes it quite well.
