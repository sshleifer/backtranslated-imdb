THE LADY OF SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could make a "mainstream" film if he wanted to. Compared to his other works, more artistic, this film has only a moderate skill and almost no esoteric element. <br /> <br /> The exception being of course the final scene in the Hall of Mirrors, widely accepted to be one of the biggest scenes in the film's history. This alone is worth the cost of a rental. <br /> <br /> The sweet surprise was the beautiful performance of the beautiful Rita Hayworth. Her play at the beginning and in the middle of the film is so excellent that she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters. Even the big Mr. Welles.
