The erotic cinema of the 1970s was docile compared to today's triple X, which is good. Because there is a good story about rituals and naked sex scenes. Of course, I wish they had some vampire effects they had at the time and sex has a little embarrassed history. In addition, some accents were difficult to understand at certain times, but it is worth looking at the unmodified version, then the modified version, entitled THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING. But if you do not care about the many naked women who dance and make love, this movie is not for you. However, I enjoyed it and gave it to ... 7 STARS.
