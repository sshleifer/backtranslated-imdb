Extremely tense thriller unfolding in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in Brazilian urbanism. To make it easier for those who are curious about this intriguing and really well done movie, the film has the courage of the Mexican film "Amores Perros" with a character not too far from Max Cady, both Cape Fears, although it is no, far from it, a movie about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay Anisio (Miklos), strike agent, to dismiss their third partner (and majority shareholder) of this construction company. The murder is imputed to the city, but the situation begins to get very dark when the spiritual and charismatic nightmare that hides behind his approach, Anisio decides to want to rub shoulders with his partners always so nervous, not only intruding, but by deconstructing the codes strict social conditions. that make up the Brazilian society. Anisio makes poverty an attitude and wants to enter it. The look is almost entirely portable, grainy, exceptional performance, especially as the first actor (and member of the Brazilian pop group classic "Titãs"), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his funny social terror. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie at the Brasília Film Festival in November 2001. It has since been very successful at Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho
