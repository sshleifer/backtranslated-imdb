I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was a great character actor, now I know she is also a great screenwriter / director. I've been a fan since I saw her for the first time in the movies "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories". <br /> <br /> It's so rare to see Lee Grant nowadays in anything. She has been missing from the screen for too long. It's also wonderful to see Cloris Leachman in something other than a sit-com. This is his best work since "The Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an Italian-American family, you will love this movie. I did not expect much when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised to fall in love with this movie. If you have the opportunity, look at it.
