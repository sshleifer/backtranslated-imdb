What a fun movie! If you are a Giallo fan, Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. For starters, it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the innocent Bouchet, the wide-eyed innocent, as a guilty woman fearing for his life. The kill scenes in Red Queen Kills 7 Times are particularly nice and contain enough blood to please most fans. One of the first murders occurs quite unexpectedly and kicks off the film. The killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most delirious and interesting killers I've seen in an Italian film. The sets and fashions of the 70s are wonderful. In fact, all the visual elements are interesting, the laughing Red Queen crossing the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the movie. The intricate plot has always caught my attention. Finally, the score of Bruno Nicolai is perhaps the best I got from the composer. The main theme is so memorable that I have not managed to get it out of my head for two days. <br /> <br /> The only two numbers I have with Red Queen Kills 7 Times are in the film finale. First, the person responsible for the killings is far too easy to spot. If you have seen more than one Gialli couple, you will have no trouble figuring out who is behind the killings. Second, the end is a little too hurried and, therefore, is a bit confusing. I am certainly not someone who needs every point of the plot to be clarified, but I will admit that I am unable to explain everything. A second viewing could clarify this.
