It's one of Jackies' best films, it's him without his operatic companions Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. This is one of the best openings of all action movies. the middle gets a bit slow, but he stays for 25 minutes frenzied in the movie and the end credits show what a mad crazy Jackie Chan is just to make us happy moviegoers
