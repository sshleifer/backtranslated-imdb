"GI Samurai" sees Sonny Chiba and some other men being transported into a feudal Japan struck by civil war, without any particular reason, and a lot of bloodshed ensues. It is a rather epic test of the sword against the machine gun that finally gives interesting results. <br /> <br /> The plot takes place essentially on the rails that you could expect from the title; Initial frolicking of fish out of the water ("What is this flying metal box?" Etc.), "Are not we better here", discussions and finally a huge battle. The latter is proof that the film is not taken at all seriously, the carnage occupying most of the second half of the battle while the army of samurai faces the Chiba squad; One would have expected the title to be face to face, but he still manages to overwhelm his inventiveness and extravagance. It is certainly one of the most unique combat sequences of its time and it does not lag behind despite its length. <br /> <br /> Chiba gives a grumpy performance like Iba, a good leader at the start, but someone who ends up asking questions. his own morality as the situation slowly affects him. It is certainly one of his best vehicles among his great CV. In the final act, the two worlds had such an effect on each other, you must ask yourself if it was a little nihilism on the part of the writers, because they seem to be asking: "Have not we not better lived at the time? " But it may be reading a bit too much in what can usually be described as two very entertaining (almost) hours of action.
