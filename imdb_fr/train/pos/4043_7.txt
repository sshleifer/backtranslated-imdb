Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very entertaining Japanese movie about SCI-FI. I noticed a lot of disappointed movie geeks who liked Versus, this director's first film or his third film, Azumi. I heard that they are blood-soaked movies with swords, zombies and all kinds of treats. Frankly, I went to the video store to get Versus, but I'm fine with Alive. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for end-to-end action, Alive is not your choice. There is a lot of action, but it pays for a full hour of character accumulation. Personally, I think it's done well and it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the plot is ridiculous, as with many SCI-Fi action movies and I think subtitles using the term foreign object could have been replaced by a parasite for more effect. This film is brutal when it needs to be so anxious that there is no need to apply. <br /> <br /> They have reduced the budget, limiting essentially all the action to a single underground building (inspired by the cube) but the film does not suffer. Another highlight of this film is the intense Gothic imagination made with a lot of artistic talent during the many sequences of flashbacks and dreams. <br /> <br /> Rent this!
