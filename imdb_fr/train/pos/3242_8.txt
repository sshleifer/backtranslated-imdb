I saw this movie with my dad. I had to be quite young, about 15 years old. It was an afternoon in Star Movies. The movie started a little vaguely, but you could say that these thieves were preparing for a score. It really took off after the first half hour. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I guess it's all together, they play so well together. I can watch this movie anytime. I think it's the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters who are trying to deal with a very strange score. The jokes are not lame but they are subtle and extreme at the same time, which makes them so hilarious. <br /> <br /> A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
