Being a person who does not generally like boxing movies, feeling that they focus only on boxing and not on characters, this movie really moved me. I loved being able to see the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) go through so much in such a short time, it was amazing for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did a great job playing Diana, especially since it was her first experience as an actress. She showed a real emotion and described Diana to perfection. All the actors had chemistry on the screen and made this movie even more amazing. I highly recommend this movie even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies. 10/10
