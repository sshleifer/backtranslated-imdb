The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was so closely inspired by Alan Quartermain (or at least is a character type of Alan Quartermain), that the director of 85 made the mistake of plundering IJ's films for dialogue and history more deeply. What you got as a finished product is a clutter named Alan Quartermain, mixed with an uncontrolled mix of a little imitated IJ saga (with a touch of Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> Many critics have called it a "big parody" or "unintentional comedy". Unintentional is the word. This movie was never meant to be funny. witty, yes, but not funny. Unfortunately, it's more devious than witty. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV mini-series, you get a lot more story, character development of your main character, solid performances and a good, even, fun mix. This story is a bit long. much longer than its predecessors, but rightly so that this version carries a real story and not just the action and Eye Candy. Although it includes both action and Eye Candy, it also corrects the error made in the 1985 version by forgetting IJ as a whole and returning to the sources of QA. subplots. <br /> <br /> Now, this attempt is not the action-extravagance of Indiana Jones. Nor is it a bad attempt to be. This vehicle, based on plot and characters, is a beautiful interpretation of the AQ / KSM saga. Filmed locally in South Africa, the public is entitled to beautiful views (so desolate), to the aboriginal cultures of South Africa and some beautiful images of wildlife blending in perfectly with the performances and scenario here. with this one, as I have never been one to subscribe to his vision. In fact, I hated most of his work as a director until this attempt. I hope it's more a new vein of talent and less the chance that seems to be. <br /> <br /> This version notes 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
