but you have to watch over Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. The entertainment filmed by Greene during the war required either a transplant on US shores, such as in This Gun for Hire, or the use of American actors in roles they did not fit. Bacall fits this part here. I was still waiting for her to whistle and bring Bogie back to life; her tone of voice is simply wrong for a British upper class. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not speak that way except in books, but Greene sent a message about an England that had to be aware of the dangers of the world. Another positive note is that Greene's range of characters has been kept whole. While Mr. Mukerjee was more like a Brahamin, at least his nationality has been preserved and his last conversation with Paxinou is priceless.
