This is one of the greatest movies of the 80s !!! It comes out as a "shit in a punch" !! I can not believe Mad Magazine has denounced it or anything. And yet, they proudly put their name on a series with "Stuart", "I do not speak a Chinese woman" and "UPS guy on speed". What's up with that? And I love Ron Leibman - he's cunning! I wonder why he had his name removed from the credits? It was his funniest role I knew. Of course, he's not as cunning as in Norma Rae. But, in my opinion, this film is up to National Lampoon's Vacation. If you like movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin or any other 80s-themed movie, you'll love this one! Praise him and you will see what I mean!
