SPOILERS Sex huh? It is one of the most fundamental parts of human life. Yet, do we ever take it too seriously? People always want more, even those who receive it every day, and if you are not lucky, you risk having harmful consequences. Ironically, people claim that we all start having sex at a younger age (although Victorians got married and have children in their early teens). It must be more and more difficult for those who become virgins. In Steve Carell's lead role on the big screen, he plays a man who has reached the age of 40 without managing it. By treating us to innumerable incidents related to ludicrous and extreme sex, not to mention more rude than an episode of "Eurotrash", the film's general plot and its principle does not sound funny. This is a pleasant surprise so, despite all the inappropriate jokes that have failed, there is an incredibly large number that has hit and left the audience in hysteria. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a nice guy with a good job and a nice temperament. At the same time, he takes life blatantly and after being invited to play poker as a necessary fifth member, Andy's friends discover his secret. Andy is still a virgin at the age of 40. Now, for many reasons, but especially for pity, the three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) all offer advice to Andy with only one goal in mind. To get him out of his misery and get him caught in the air. <br /> <br /> One of the few positive things about "Anchorman" was a matter of time before Steve Carell found himself in the lead. own. Impressive, in "The Virgin of 40", he does not disappoint. Showing the desperate and timid virgin to perfection, Carell is a revelation as he begins to become more and more confident as the board begins to help. <br /> <br /> Carell is not alone in her performance. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener as a love interest are all superb. Rudd is a personal favorite as David Lovers who falls apart several times and shares the most beautiful scene with Rogen while the two are arguing about homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise about this movie is not the many jokes struck, but in fact, the clever way of tipping the message on its head. Visibly designed for conservative America, the film's tone evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest to a story of safe sex and abstinence. The virgin does not need sex to complete her life, he just needs confidence and true love. A message worthy of preaching and a considerable improvement over the one you hope to see at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It's strange to see a rude comedy that's always funny and well played, but low and here, "40-year-old virgin" is just that. Also send a well-meaning message and you are on the way to a leading comedy. A surprising joy.
