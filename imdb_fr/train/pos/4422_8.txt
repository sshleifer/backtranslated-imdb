Well, if you're part of Katana's crazies (just like me), you'll certainly enjoy this metaphysical film swinging Katana spitting blood and running the movie. <br /> <br /> Featuring Tadanobu, Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) & Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This samurai war between the Heiki clan and the Genji clan hit the zenith during the final confrontation at the Gojo Bridge. The count in the body is infinite. <br /> <br /> Demons, magic swords, Shinto priests against Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions offered by Maestro Sogo Ishii will do the rest. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese Flick for a rainy summer night.
