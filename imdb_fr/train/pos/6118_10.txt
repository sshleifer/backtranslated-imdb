Jack Frost is really a cool movie. I mean .... it's funny. It's violent. and very nice. Most people say it's B rated, but it could not be further from the truth. It has great special effects and a good interpretation. The only strange thing is of course, The Killer Snowman. I think this movie was actually one of the best movies of the late nineties. Most of the movies these days do not have the criteria of a Clive Barker masterpiece. That is to say, be original and give the viewer what he does not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 out of 10. Grade: A +. Ed also recommends the movie Uncle Sam to Jack Frost fans.
