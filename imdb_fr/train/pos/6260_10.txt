It was inspiring! I am an Iranian and living in the 21st century, I did not know that such great tribes lived in such conditions at the time of my grandfather! <br /> <br /> You see that today, or even in 1925, on one side of the world, a lady or a baby could all be pure and on demand, but 80 years ago, people were risking their lives to go somewhere with more grass. It is really interesting that these Persians bear these difficulties to find a pasture for their sheep, but they lose a lot on their way. <br /> <br /> I congratulate the Americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as hard as the Bakhtiari people. .
