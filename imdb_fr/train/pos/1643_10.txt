It's a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see a good acting game. Mr. Torn and Ms. Farrel are doing a great job. I think they should have it on television again for a new audience to enjoy. Wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> This gives you a real idea of ​​what the pioneers had to live physically and emotionally. An incredible movie. <br /> <br /> This was done when Ms. Farrel was very young. I had always thought of her as an actress, but it's definitely not a comedy and she's just wonderful. There is very little dialogue, but it gives the impression that it is more real. As always, Mr. Torn is very present and his breathing is pleasant. I have to see a movie.
