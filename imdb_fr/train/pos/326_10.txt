"Jag är nyfiken" Yellow is a lot of fun. Like at least one other comment, many times, I burst out laughing. Yellow is energetic, player, self-conscious, explorer. Do not expect Bergman here. This film focuses on Swedish youth from the early to the mid-1960s and the problems, such as contradictions, that the nation and the world faced. Sometimes, Yellow seems to be a serious social and political documentary, with Lena, the main character, and others interviewing both ordinary people and politicians (eg, Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Jaune seems to parody this kind of documentary. All the while, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring Lena's life - her home life, her loves, her political views, her vision of herself. She is a complete person ?? complex, imperfect, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And above all that is the wonderful extra dimension of director Sjöman and his documenting team documenting Lena. That's what really gives me yellow wings for me. Not only do they suddenly appear at very entertaining and amusing moments, reminding the viewer that it is a fiction and an artifice, but their presence is in itself another layer of the film; they film themselves filming themselves. I think of a video clip of Bjork with the same quality ?? a video clip on making a music video, ad infinitum, each iteration becoming more and more weird and more cartoon. I think Sjöman may have had something similar in mind. Although "Jag är nyfiken" Yellow is not everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly intelligent, witty, refreshing, full of energy and genuine.
