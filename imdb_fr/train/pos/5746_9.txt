The words are seriously insufficient to express the emotional power of this film. it is one of the most heartbreaking you can see, yet the end is one of the most affectionate, tender and rewarding you can hope for. Every actor in every role is great, especially a wise and sober Jamie Lee Curtis, a deeply hurt and anxious Ray Liotta, and a touching Tom Hulce trick that should have placed him at every book price. (He is the # 1 choice for "Best Actor" in Danny Peary's "Alternate Oscars" in 1988). The last half hour is away from the melodrama, but the film will be worth all her tears. many of them.
