I felt obliged to watch Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke's 1983 adaptation of "Jane Eyre" because I had just written an article about the 2006 BBC "BBC Jane Eyre" for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> approached by looking at it in the same way that I dreaded doing my homework. <br /> <br /> I was irritated at first. The lighting in this version is bad. Everyone / everything is faded by a bright white light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters. <br /> <br /> And the sound is poorly recorded. I felt like I was listening to a play in high school. <br /> <br /> And the makeup for pancakes is way too heavy. <br /> <br /> And the sets do not perfectly reflect the Gothic atmosphere of the novel. They are too difficult, so Martha Stewart. I simply do not see that Rochester de Bronte respects such domestic settings of Martha Stewart. Orson Welles "Rochester lived in troglodyte darkness, very appropriate for the Gothic atmosphere of the novel. <br /> <br /> And yet ... with all these objections ... not only is it the best" Jane Eyre "I've seen, this is perhaps the best adaptation of any novel I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This" Jane Eyre ", despite its technical flaws, I has brought back the feeling of reading "Jane Eyre" for the first time. <br /> <br /> Critics of this production say that it is too close to the book.For me, someone who values ​​the book and does not need to be less "verbose" or less "Christian" or more sexual, the fidelity of this version to the novel that Bronte wrote is in fact his best asset. <Br /> <br /> Bronte writes a darn good book, there's a reason it's been going on for 150 years and more, while other smoother, sexier and easier texts have disappeared. <br /> <br /> As a fan of " Jane Eyre, "I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is famous, not beautiful; Jane and Rochester are the famous ugly couple in literature. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if not incredibly beautiful. <br /> <br /> But Dalton gives a fascinating performance as Rochester. He just took my breath away. I have never seen anything comparable to his utter dedication to Jane's role, text, dialogue, and love for Jane. Dalton brings Rochester's page to life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester is a bit scary. Dalton is scary. Welles also had the most frightening panic when he shouted "Enough!" after Fontaine plays a short piece of piano. But Dalton is scared more than once, here. You really can not tell if he's going to hurt Jane or himself in his desperation. <br /> <br /> Rochester's urgency, his humor, his rage, his vulnerability: Dalton communicates everything, sometimes a few seconds apart. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> And here is the essential: the actor who plays Rochester must say that he has spent more than a decade of his life in absolute despair, lonely, living with a horrible and devastating secret. . <br /> <br /> No other actor I've seen try this part translates this black hole of despair as Timothy Dalton does. Current fan favorite Toby Stephens is not even trying. Dalton hits him out of the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton playing Rochester in a bar for singles, I would say, "This guy is a problem, do not even look at him." He is radioactive and suffers from agony. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is not only the best Jane overall, it's one of the few Janes that the producers wanted to put in Jane's book. . No, people who only know "Jane Eyre" since the 2006 version, Bronte did not * describe * a robust and sculptural Jane with finely arched eyebrows and sulky lips. The Jane of Charlotte Bronte is rather poor, sober, obscure, and not pretty. <br /> <br /> Zelah has a small mouth, closed eyes and a little nose. She is really "small". She is not a model. And she is the best Jane, the most faithful to the book. <br /> <br /> Some have described it as cold or boring. No, she's faithful to the book. Jane de Bronte is not a hot mom, she is a protected and private teenager whose inner passions only come at key moments, as Zelah does here. Jane of the book is a person you must watch slowly, cautiously, patiently, with observance, if you want to really dive into her depths. You have to watch Zelah here to find out who she really is. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more shots at Zelah in a key scene, but it's a five-hour scene that she is, otherwise, very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its proximity to the text, this version, like all the versions I have already seen, avoids fully explaining the overtly Christian themes of "Jane Eyre." Christianity is not an accidental subtext in "Jane Eyre", it is central. <br /> <br /> Helen Burns teaches Jane about Christianity, giving her a subversive and counter-cultural way to read and live with her, seemingly doomed, life. It is Christianity, and a Christian god, that convinces the poor, clear and obscure, of its equal value, of its need to live up to its ideals and its rejection of a key marriage proposal. This is not entirely clear here. <br /> <br /> In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex and rich novel, and this adaptation of all that I saw, mines and honors the novel the best of any adaptation that I have never seen, and that speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> Other versions, which do not fully honor the book, end up being a chore to watch in many places. If you do not care what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse, or the hypocrisy of a culture based on look and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be a fast forward for the spectators. Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that all that Bronte wrote - about Jane's experiences with Lowood and about her relationship with St. John - is part of what makes Jane's relationship with Rochester as explosive and memorable as it is.
