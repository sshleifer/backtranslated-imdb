I saw this movie and the play, and I must add that it was the most touching story I have ever seen. Until I saw this film, I did not know how horrible life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults who lived and lived at that time. I had tears in my eyes and a lot of sadness in my heart to think that every human being should have to struggle like that to stay alive, and to get the kids out of this place and teach them to act, to preforming and releasing their own story is simply amazing. This just exceed a five-star, I give it ten. Thank you Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such an amazing story. It has been 12 years since this story was told, but it remains heavy to bear in my heart. If there is a VHS or DVD in the room, please let me know as soon as possible. Thank you. PS There was nothing wrong with the children wanting to make other countries aware of their problems and their living conditions, in the hope that someone would have heart and offer help.
