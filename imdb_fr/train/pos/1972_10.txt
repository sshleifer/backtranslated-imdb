I do not understand your objections to this film. It is a tense and exciting extension of the character created in "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story that is a bit unrealistic is the fact that Sharon Stone's character is still alive and not in prison at this late date. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As the movie progresses, has come up with three theories about what's going on: 1) Sharon Stone's character kills all these people because she's crazy (Risk addicted); 2) David Thewlis's twisted policeman is killing these people to frame Sharon Stone's character; 3) David Morrissey's analyst kills these people for revenge. What bothers most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories is ever explained as being the "real" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric facility for killing the officer, this is the only murder that occurs on the screen.) <br /> <br /> I think it's a great plot in the spirit of "2001, the Space Odyssey." Who cares about what is real? The blonde is really crazy, the cop is really twisted and the analyst really wants revenge. What is important is the interactions between these characters and other characters in the story. As in real life, everyone is more complicated than we think and reality is more complicated than a movie. To move on!
