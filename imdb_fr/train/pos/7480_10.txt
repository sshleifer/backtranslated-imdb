This film is one of Tom Cruise's best films. He captures the public's imagination with his role as David Aames. His character can understand us all in a certain way. The scenario is very intelligent and keeps the audience energized throughout the film. I had never really watched cruising movies before, but after seeing this, it shows me his true talent. My favorite part in the movie is the end where everything ends and where he discovers the truth. If you have not seen it yet, you should definitely try it. It's one of those movies that once you've started to watch it, you have to see it until the end, otherwise you'll continue to think and you'll regret it. My opinion is that you should just go buy it and take a chance that's what I did and it became one of my favorite movies of all time. It's A * 10/10 I promise that once you've watched it, it will stay with you and you'll love it forever.
