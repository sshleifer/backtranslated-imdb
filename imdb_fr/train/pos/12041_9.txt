It's an old story of phantasmagorical ghosts. I showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club and they were kept in suspense until the end! No blood or blood-just the good old suspense. It starts from the beginning, and builds and builds. The end is a real twist that caught me off guard. <br /> <br /> Well directed and well played. It is also a "period piece" - located in the 1920s - that has added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed that Susan Hill offered me Amazon's book. The film follows the book quite closely. <br /> <br /> Too bad that it is not available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This with "haunted" are probably two of the best ghost stories I have ever staged. Which proves that a little creativity goes beyond "in your face" gore every day!
