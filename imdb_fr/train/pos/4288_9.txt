Rain or shine, you enter a movie theater. It makes you happy. (If not, exit immediately.) The lights go out. You settle down with an ice bar. Moving images start to flicker on the screen. You feel happy. In the dark, you are back at the beginning of time. Sitting around the campfire ... watch the modern flickering flames 24 times a second and share the pleasure of discovering the unknown turns of the scenario with the rest of your clan / spectators. <br /> <br /> Those who are not happy with themselves should not write comments. (Long live romantic comedies ...)
