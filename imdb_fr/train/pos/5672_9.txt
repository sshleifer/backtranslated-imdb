In this episode of the series, Edmund Blackadder is a prisoner of the period of regency in Britain (during the last part of the reign of George III). The chances of Blackadder are much lower this time, because instead of royal royalties, he is at the service of the very very thick George IV (the price ruler). Contrary to George IV's historical narratives, it is about as bright as a tomato and, therefore, Blackadder is able to take advantage of him and play on his own. The only major difference in style between this one and the previous ones is that the series ends on a very, very, very different note - you just have to see it to believe it. Other than that, all the usual elements of the story are present and the show is hilarious. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this show is not appropriate for children because of its rude language and adult status.
