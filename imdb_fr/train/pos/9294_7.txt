Before I start, I must point out that I know the publisher of the film. We never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (things that preceded the bulletin boards), and we talked on the phone, so I have a bias. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Somehow, it's ironic that if the "Rat Pack" culture of the late 50's and early to mid-60's made its big come back in the middle of the 90's, this film, taken from one of the original Rat Pack, and which was made in the same way, was a flop. Not only that, it was a critical flop; I think Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not save that (he gave a mixed review, if I remember correctly). And although I do not think it's the biggest movie in the world and I'm not a fan of the Rat Pack or the "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it looks elegant and moves forward. On the other hand, the basic performance is all good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly remembered here as the leader of the gangster returning from a sanatorium and has a funny side. Jeff Goldblum returns to the calm and ironic performances he gave in the era of pre-blockbusters, such as THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin is only in the movie, she does it in a fun way. Admittedly, it's not a good movie. the dialogue is mainly composed of word games, and many of them do not work (like all the "Zen of Ben" speech). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are awful here. Still, I had fun, and if you like gangster movies, you could be too.
