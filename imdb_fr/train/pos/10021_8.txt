This tale based on two plays by Edgar Allen Poe ("The Fall of Usher's House", "Dance of Death" (poem)) is actually quite scary from beginning to end. It looks like some old black and white movies about people meeting in a decrepit old house (for example, "The Cat and the Canaries", "The Old Dark House", "The Night of Terror", etc.). ). Boris Karloff plays the role of a demented inventor of life-sized dolls that terrorize guests. He dies early in the film (or does he?) And the residents of the house are subjected to many terrifying experiences. I will not go into details, but it is a must for the followers of the old mysteries of the black house. <br /> <br /> Look at it with lots of popcorn and soda in a dark room. <Br / <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
