Unlike those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club provides both real and inspiring answers. It also provides reliable information, logical commentary and a different view of what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS consider to be the best. Unlike other programs, which provide social and faith-based commentary, those behind Club 700 provide help to those in need, such as feeding the hungry with Operation Blessing, providing medical assistance to people living in communities affected by violence. poverty and give hope. to those who need hope. It's not at all hateful. If the 700 Club offends you, I suggest reaching the remote and turning the channel on your TV. I do the same thing when I find CNN Headline News or programs that I find biased or offensive. What I find offensive is the way ABC Family inserts the disclaimer that the views of the 700 Club do not reflect those of ABC Family.
