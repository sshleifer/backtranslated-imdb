I did not expect Val Kilmer to convince John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting that it was not the legend of porn itself. In fact, all the actors have achieved incredible performances in this largely underestimated film. <br /> <br /> As some have mentioned earlier, look for the two-disc set and watch the "Wadd" documentary first; this will give you a lot of background on the story that will help you enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people seem unhappy with the inclusion of the video of the LAPD crime scene on the DVD. This may have been included for various reasons, including the fact that John Holmes' murder trial was the first ever in the United States where such records were used by the prosecution. If you do not want to see it, it's easy to avoid it. it is clearly identified as "LAPD crime sequence" on the menu!
