At the time of the major studio system, the most daring casting decisions had been made. The good old James Stewart, all Americans, appears as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner. If I had shot the film, Kralik's role would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart also had the same problem in Mortal Storm with Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was her main lead actress on the screen. He shot four movies with her. But is it only one where none of them dies? Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart when he was a struggling player in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband was at the time Stewart's good friend, Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> I think only Clark Gable managed to be an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American too, so nothing stood out. <br /> <br /> But if you accept Stewart, you'll see a very good film by Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is quite simple, a man and a woman working in a department store in Budapest do not get along well. But it seems they maintain a correspondence with anonymous admirers who turn out to be mutually. In addition, the employer Frank Morgan wrongly suspects Stewart to have discussed with his wife. <br /> <br /> Although the tracks are good and Frank Morgan stands out, the two players that stand out are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie when he takes off after Morgan has started asking his opinion of people. It is very rare. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as an unofficial little worm who constantly kisses Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I know too much, like Schildkraut in real life, who are at the political desk 24 hours a day. Sad that it pays off a lot of the time.
