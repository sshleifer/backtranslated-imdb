"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in Hong Kong. It's an awesome mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The film features gorgeous scene graphics between Wu Ma and the language of the demon tree. A truly original and refreshing film and another quality recommendation for Embalmer.
