This film is great for raising the spirits. <br /> <br /> Whenever I look at him, I see and hear funny little things that I missed before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is amazing. Mick Jones (Foreigner) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) wrote the songs, making Strange Fruit the best thing ever to hit the music scene. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is a strictly fictitious film that failed between the '60s and' 70s that was never good at first, because of drug use and internal struggles. One wonders what he could have been listening to his fanatical soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The Fruit is inspired by the Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> <br /> Each Fruit members are quite memorable. Stephen Rea is starring Tony Costello, a festival organizer who asks him to reunite his band for a reunion tour, hoping to reap financial rewards. Costello is perhaps approaching the former roadie Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help revive the flame of a past dream. <br /> <br /> Juliet picks up the bitter Jimmy Nail (The Wickes) by scandalizing Timothy Spall (David 'Beano' Baggot), and Ray Simms (Bill Nighy), an extravagant glamor. Hugh, another ex-roadie, Hughie (Billy Connolly), who never lets the flame go out. <br /> <br /> As Juliet searches for the last member of her ragtag group, the elusive guitarist-songwriter Brian Lovell (played by Bruce Robinson), the assembled members quarrel, as at the time, fighting over the rusty talent of each. <br /> <br /> The group is then offered the possibility of a small Dutch tour to prepare the festival. With the young Luke Shand (Hans Matheson) in place of Hendrix, who replaces Lovell, the crew takes the road. The sparks fly as their memories catch fire, threatening to burn their unfinished goals ... <br /> <br /> Prepare to laugh, sing, applaud and cry, as these memorable characters burn into your heart ..
