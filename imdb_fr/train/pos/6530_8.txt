The last time I read a book by Nancy Drew about 20 years ago, much of my fictional character memory is probably wrong. From what I understand, the books were introduced to me at a time when teenage detectives were popular with children who grew up at the time (for me, the 80s and early 90s) , with Hardy Boys, Famous Five and of course Nancy Drew's "Carolyn Keene" among the most famous. I still remember these hard-cover books with very dated cover illustrations, usually quite heavy (for a child) to lug around, and the book's thickness may be attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large print. <br /> <br /> Well, the character was updated along the way, as I remember the following books by Nancy Drew, my sister, less and less thick, soft binding, with a update and a more chic Nancy illustrated on the cover. I do not remember if these stories were the same as the old ones, but I guess those books, as ghosts, have their share of update for the time. <br /> <br /> In this version of Warner Brothers by Nancy Drew, the character undoubtedly has his own update to fit his time, but the writers Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen have retained his fifties sensitivity in small towns, thus retaining a charm and flavor that men like me would appreciate. Her fashion sense, her primacy and cleanliness, and even some odd little demeanor traits that make her worthy of the name, Nancy Drew. <br /> <br /> The family origin of his father, Carson Drew, remains pretty much the same. (Tate Donovan), who moves his daughter and himself to the big city for a better job opportunity and wean his daughter from the hunt in the city of River Heights. Mom is only a distant memory, and the maid makes an appearance. But what did Nancy Drew do was the cast of Emma Roberts in the lead role. Niece of her famous aunt Julia, she also has this cheerful behavior, the indisputable red hair and that megawatt smile. Her Nancy Drew, even if at first seems to rub you against you, she will invade you. And in almost what I thought was a discarded scene from Pretty Woman, the characters entered a fancy store with almost opposite reactions. <br /> <br /> While Dad Carson Drew is trying to get Nancy out of her role. the environment and to assimilate to the normal life of adolescence, trust Nancy to live in a house whose owner, a Hollywood type, was found murdered in suspicious circumstances. The mystery resolution is her comforting food when she is rejected by the local fraternity and soon after, we leave with her in her adventure on the big screen. <br /> <br /> There is nothing too black Dahlia about the crime and the mystery, and instead, it's a pretty simple question to solve for Nancy, between her relationship of friendship with Corky (Josh Flitter), a chubby friend of the school, and her jealous boyfriend, Ned (Max Thieriot), while concealing the truth about her extracurricular activities her father. The story is filled with fun and old sentimentality that seduces and together it becomes a little scooby-doo. With minimal violence and no brawls or explosions, it's really a genre that is clearly called "chick alert". <br /> <br /> I guess the movie will generate a new generation of fans, rekindle old memories, and probably, probably, could trigger a new trend of fashionable penny loafers.
