It would have been my number one film of the year 1991, unless he was defeated by the brilliant JFK. It's such a wonderful movie! I liked it. I love stories where the lives of different characters merge with others and how to manage their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin surpass him. I never really liked Martin or his style, but here he is great. I loved the whole speech he made to Kline towards the end, about the Grand Canyon. The writing was excellent. Larry Kasdan is an excellent dialogue writer, like Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, he has trained many three-dimensional characters and well thought-out scenarios, as well as messages that give a positive impression to our lives. A really excellent movie. 4 out of 4 stars
