Ok, so it borrows a bit from "It's a wonderful life", but it was 44 years before this movie, so why not try again. Belushi is celebrating its 35th anniversary. He did not have his Wheaties, his coffee and lost his job. The capper is when his so-called "big piece of blue sea **" breaks down at the end of the day. He goes to an empty bar to ask for a tow. Meanwhile, he is recognized by the bartender (Caine) as the kid who lost the baseball game of the city 20 years earlier. This makes him think of the life he would have had if he had won the game. He discovers when, without his knowledge, Caine serves a potion in a glass that gives him a home, the queen of the ball (Russo) as a wife, and names him president of the sporting goods company of which he is the guardian. Caine turns out later to be responsible for this change, but Belushi is not quite on board. He never adapts completely, and in a plot development that does not kill the movie but is still strange, he tries to woo his wife (Hamilton) in his real life, who is now married to someone else. The good thing to do is they do not spend too much time on it, because they basically tear "Ghost", Belushi constantly telling things to Hamilton that only she could know. He also brings a hokey dramatic element, like two of his kevetch lovers in the shadows, new bride Russo, and his lopsided lover, Cox. But the keys of the film are the beginning a little long and the happy end. Also, good work from important and recognizable actors, as Belushi is very friendly, VERY attractive women are chosen, and Caine is perfectly easy going as the title guy. Strange that it was Belushi's second film in 1990 about the acquisition of a rich alternative lifestyle, which was found in "Taking Care of Business". Although similar, both films are at the same level of laughter provided. So check this out for a fun exploration of "what if?"
