Unlike other reviews, I found this film fascinating, even with all its flaws and the zombie game of some actors. <br /> <br /> As a technologist, I found interesting experiences and realistic material. Although the reading of minds via a computer sounds fantastic, experiments are being conducted for this purpose. I will note that these experiments are at a very early stage and that their results are not yet favorable. <br /> <br /> The characters of the film are well chosen. The girl, although too active, seems silly. The truck driver is a ringtone for real truck drivers. The minister transmits the doubts at first (the principal investigator tells the minister that he himself, the minister) does not know whether he believes that God created man or that man created God. But the minute the fleas have fallen, he falls back on his faith. Only the doctor plays the zombie. The secrets he conceals are well suited to his characters. In the face of death, they react like real human beings. <br /> <br /> The film warns against the dangers of unlimited surveillance by the government. As a strict thriller, the movie does not have enough thrills. As a scientific exercise based on philosophical principles, it is fascinating.
