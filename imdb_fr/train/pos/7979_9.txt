Tony Scott can do good and bad movies. Personally, I think it can be a bit flashy and trashy. His work obviously suffers from comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but it is probably his best film. /> What makes this movie so awesome is that Scott gives Denzel (on a hot form, better than Training Day) and the revelation that Dakota Fanning has time to develop a warm relationship and tenderness. The set-up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - this involves and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a great role for Radha Mitchell as a mother. All this helps to make the action more effective, because we are so invested in the characters, despite all their obvious weaknesses. This film puts you on the edge of the razor and does not finish at the end either. <br /> <br /> The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to have so many duff roles, while he's clearly as good as almost every influential man (I can only think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more power to screen nowadays). This film should have been huge considering its status and the strength of its performances and the quality of the film. It just proves that if a studio does not support a movie, it goes straight to the video. I would like to have the chance to see this on the big screen.
