I liked this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful. Play the role of the modern magician thoroughly. (And that's absolutely adorable.) 2) The film inspired a role-playing game that I really enjoy, Mage: The Awakening. I showed it at several LARP after-parties, and it's still a big hit. <br /> <br /> The love of D & D and Jeff-squeeing aside, it's not really a masterpiece, but it's well done and really enjoyable. The plot is fast and engaging in its simplicity, the special effects are pretty good for such a small budget, and the storyline, though nothing fancy, was not too badly done, and nerdy in the right places. A good way to spend an evening.
