I think Monarch Cove has been one of the best drama and drama series to come on all networks for a long time. This show had great potential and I was eager to see it every week. This could be developed in a big Primetime soap. People are eagerly waiting for this kind of action when we are an overrated "reality TV". I long for the type of writing and acting such as Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dynasty, Melrose Place, etc. Monarch Cove updated this concept very well and I expected it to improve. There are so many things to develop with these characters and they were all very interesting and captivating. It would be a waste not to explore that and develop these characters after having attracted and hooked on their world. I absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual without excess or excess. Love
