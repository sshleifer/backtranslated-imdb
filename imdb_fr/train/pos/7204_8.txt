It's a play, adapted to the screen. 95% of the film takes place in the beautiful home of playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of a fabulously successful play on Broadway, but his last four efforts have failed - horribly. <br /> <br /> Aspirational playwright Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who participated in a drama writing workshop hosted by Sydney, sent him a copy of the play he wrote. Sydney tells his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon), that the play is fabulous - a foolproof success. But is it good enough to die? Time will tell us. <br /> <br /> A clever dialogue and many twists in the plot make this movie entertaining from start to finish. The whole cast seems to have a good time. This is reminiscent of another fun mystery from Michael Caine: Sleuth. To have. <br /> <br />
