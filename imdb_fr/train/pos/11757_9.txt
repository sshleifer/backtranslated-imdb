Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play in their thirties who put their lives in danger by deciding (Russell with some reluctance) to replay their heartbreaking link with rival Bakersfield years after the fact. Williams agrees, but Russell is excellent as the legendary Taft quarterback, Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a nice and attractive turn as a Williams woman, who could live without this rematch. It's worth watching the movie to see the famous Remo in action. Highly recommended.
