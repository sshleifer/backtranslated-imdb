This movie was part of my collection for a while, but it was not until one of my friends reminded me ?? until I decide that I should watch it. I did not know much about Leo? just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of the age film and that it deals with a very serious subject ?? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although the person who has help ?? is Leo ?? the story revolves around how Marcel (Leo's youngest brother) cut with his relative's illness. At first, everyone tries to hide the truth from Marcel ?? do you think he is too young to understand his brother's illness? the fact that Leo is also homosexual contributes to the reluctance of parents to discuss the issue with young Marcel. I know from experience that most seniors often do not want to accept the fact that sometimes, even when you are young, it does not automatically mean that you will not be able to accept reality and act more adequate way than even. Except for the fact that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, they left me with an impression? the way they supported their son ?? even after discovering the truth about her sexuality and illness. The fact that they allowed young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his ex-boyfriend was a gesture from them. most families I know will hesitate to do so. There is a lot of heat in the scenes where the brothers spend time together ?? you can see them as true friends and care about each other. <br /> <br /> The proximity of Leo is an excellent drama, which I highly recommend.
