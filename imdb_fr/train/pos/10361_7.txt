Once you became aware of your position, you realized that they had managed to put things in place so quickly that it was published the same year the case ended, you will find that it is not bad at all. The plot is attractive and interesting, and the pace is fast, it covers many situations and so jumps quickly to the next after a line or two have been spoken. What really stands out is acting. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. It's also cool to hear so many Australian voices in a Hollywood movie, and even those who do not come naturally at least try an accent. Cinematography and editing are pretty cool, but they do not really go beyond the standards. The story of this film is compelling and the fact that it is authentic simply makes it more scary. Although I have not read the novel or heard what has happened outside of this picture, I understand that it is pretty close to the truth. There is moderate to loud language and disturbing content. It is sometimes a real drama of hearing. I recommend it to all fans of this guy. 7/10
