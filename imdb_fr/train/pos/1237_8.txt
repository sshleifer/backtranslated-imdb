It was a very original film, decent and courageous for all participants. I do not care if it's not the best prepared film of all time, the fact that Eddie Murphy does something non-formal and I do not know what's going to happen next. One of my favorites. . I would like more films to be as imaginative as this one, rather than the same old entertainment formula.
