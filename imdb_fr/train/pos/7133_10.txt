Absolute masterpiece of a movie! Good night Mr.Tom has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. Nobody should miss to see this movie, it's too beautiful! John Thaw perfectly describes Mr.Tom as the hard old man who becomes a sweet father figure when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent to him for evacuation, almost like "The mouse of the city and the mouse of the country". A really heartbreaking movie. The director knew exactly how to turn a book into a movie and he did very well. The film was shot so that the emotions of the characters and what was happening prompted the audience to feel a range of emotions ranging from love to fear, emotions can turn to six pence. This film, which takes place in the turmoil of the Second World War, also shows the difference between cities and the countryside. They look almost like different countries. A must see, those who do not discard pass by a truly amazing and brilliant film.
