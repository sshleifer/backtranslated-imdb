Richard Dix decided to retire and Michael Duane took his place, playing Ted Nichols, who met a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). This couple had only known each other for two days and they decided to marry before a justice of the peace (judge). It rains heavily when they come to the judge and find out he's not home and will not be back until the next day. As the couple is inside the house, you see someone lifting the hood of his car and taking a car engine part. Once this event is happening, you realize that this couple is about to get a big surprise and the story will reveal a very mysterious event surrounding Alice Barkley and poor Ted Nichols starts with a lot of problems and no wedding. Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
