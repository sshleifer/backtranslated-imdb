I was a kid ... crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance .. He was and is the best of all time. A few days ago, a friend gave me a gift .. A DVD "Moonwalker" ... I could not believe it! So, I took my time and saw the movie again. After many years, it made me go back. I almost cried. Not because of Michael Jackson, but the good old days I remembered when I went to his concerts, listening to music and dancing. The film gave me another perspective than that of the time, when I was a child. You can really see the parody that Michael went through his life. Thank you Michael Jackson for bringing me back to these good times, to your good music and your dance. It's a pity that people have forgotten you .. I did not do it because you gave me good moments with your music .. I wish you the best, wherever you are.
