This film is highly recommended by Matt Groening. In fact, I looked at the Simpsons and Futurama and that's one mention at a time, so I thought "what the hell". The film brings home some "and if" that make you realize how lucky we are at the time when we take for granted simple things like water and soap. It is interesting to note that in 2022, men still shave with a single-blade safety razor! Although the makers have not overloaded the film with unnecessary special effects, ray guns, etc. Some nice furniture once you understand what it means. Remember, "Tuesday is Soylent green day"
