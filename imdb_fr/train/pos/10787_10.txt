So when I was little, I got this movie as a gift and my sister and I loved it. we would watch it all the time. when our friends came we had pajama parties and we were looking at the mountain of stone candy and grandfather's magic toys. I'm 21 now and I still love this movie. Some old friends and I recently got together to watch it. We knew all the songs. We danced and discussed our hatred for Profster when we were little. A friend bought this movie and his grandfather's magic toys for his 2-year-old daughter because she wants to convey our love for this movie. It's really a film that you can let your kids watch and feel safe, no violence, no vulgar language, just a lot of beautiful songs and important lessons.
