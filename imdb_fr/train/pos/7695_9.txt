Good Times was a revolutionary comedy about the first black nuclear family living in Chicago projects. Whether you live in inner-city neighborhoods, ghettos, suburbs or the countryside, this show is always a treasure to watch and watch a family that's just a family rather than a show about a poor black family. But they do not dwell on it. They find humor and have strong family and moral values. Despite the behind-the-scenes story, this show was worth staying on the air, except that I did not like them killing the father, which made me agree with Esther Rolle, who fought to keep the family together. But despite all the fighting behind the scenes, Good Times was a family show. We all loved JJ's dynamite and his antics. We watched Janet Jackson's Penny grow a little. This show was revolutionary to show desperation in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without being preaching, The Evans always tried to do the right thing rather than do something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
