Why was it not published? I kind of thought it must be a bit nil, since it was not. Like a girl can be wrong! This film is, in a word, captivating. <br /> <br /> You will be captivated. He holds your attention from the beginning and his pace never slows down. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film, "the episode" so to speak (do not reveal anything, you saw it in the trailer) is also not to be missed. You will choose a favorite, you will be shocked, you will not be able to go for a cup of coffee because you must know what is happening. The adrenaline rises and you can not watch. Cudos to the actors, it is very credible. And that does not stop there, they have a last shock for you. <br /> <br /> This also requires you to query the reality show and watch if you like. And how far are we really? Endemol (who is a big brother) made a TV show in the Netherlands last year, offering the kidney of a dying person to patients needing a transplant. The show turned out to be a hoax, intended to raise public awareness of organ donation, but are we too close to be reassured?
