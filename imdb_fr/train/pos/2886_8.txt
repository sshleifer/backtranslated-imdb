Cinderella is a beautiful film, with beautiful songs of course. In fact, it's one of the best movies of the 50s. <br /> <br /> I think all the characters are described in amazing ways. You can see the cruelty of the half-sisters and her mother-in-law of Cinderella, the sweetness of Cinderella. The mice are funny and nice too. <br /> <br /> I think they've changed the story a bit, but I think it's for the best. It's such a beautiful movie, and I do not think anyone can resist it in the end. <br /> <br /> I give him an 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But it's a real classic.
