The set and actors make this TV movie the best interpretation of Dickens' classic narrative. George C. Scott is very believable, as is the rest of the cast. His Scrooge overflows with malice until the very end of the film. Then his character changes for the one who is truly repentant. The 19th century English city chosen for the setting creates a mood that suits Dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film. It's a movie I watch every Christmas with the real Grinch and it's a wonderful life.
