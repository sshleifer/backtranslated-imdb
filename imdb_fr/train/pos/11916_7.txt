With all the hints of "Adults" in today's family movies, it's nice to see one where you do not have to worry about it and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your children. Yes, this film may contain some big words (there is a time when Knox swears, but they do not let you hear all the words), but most of the time, this film is really as clean as they are (and this includes movies back in the day). On top of that, it's very nice, one of my favorites and a pure and fun movie to watch as a family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have against this film is that it's too short and I wish there were more memorable parts therein, I'm not going to mention because I do not want spoilers here. <br /> <br /> In short, everything is well done and an excellent movie to watch; So go out and go get the kids, make cookies and watch this movie!
