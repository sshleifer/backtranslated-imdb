The novel by Robert Standish speaks of a triangular romantic situation in a tea plantation in Ceylon ... Thus, events in the background of Ceylon and its pictorial beauty are rewarding points for William Dieterle's film. .. <br /> The story tells powerful wealthy planter (Peter Finch), who brings a charming and tender beauty (Elizabeth Taylor), in the jungle as a wife ... The plantation, of course, is threatened by some kind of wild life ... For this reason, Taylor ?? as elegant as ever in dazzling costumes ?? finds himself in a strange atmosphere ... The determination of the echo of a ghost, the bad mood of a husband obsessed with the memory of his autocratic father, an extremely dangerous disease and the fury of wild animals ... In her confusion, her boredom and her annoyance, Elizabeth Taylor looks at a friendly face, pretentious foreman (Dana Andrews), who admires her beauty but tries to defeat her love ... <br /> <br> /> With echoes of "Jane Eyre", the mysterious Yorkshire mansion with a threatening master, and "Rebecca", the young and innocent second woman sought after by the image of the first glamorous woman, "Elephant Walk" is a melodrama threatening with a wide view of a huge bungalow, exotic dances with excessively colorful rage, big bull elephants, amazing burnt mansion, all in the company of an exquisite creature of undisputed beauty and talent ... <br /> > <br /> The film gave Liz u no change of scenery and allowed him to be more creative and self-respecting than most of his other full beginner-rebels ?? The woman here has a sharp tongue and a strong will, and so Taylor plays her movie star heroine with more wit than she's been granted credit for ??
