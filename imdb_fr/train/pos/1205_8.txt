This film is exactly what its title describes - an attempt to embody what writers have to offer. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's fun to see the 1996 Toronto, the way I remember it. stupid haircuts, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. It really has not changed. just a nice little safe, cheap and provincial urban backwater, which makes it an ideal meeting place for international movie types! It's also fun to see Kenny and Spenny go to Los Angeles and find out that you're in Toronto, only with a strange assortment of beach fans, musicians, fortune tellers and other types of movies. haughty. <br /> <br /> I do not see Pitch as a movie to enjoy. it is not entertainment unless the viewer likes to look at the aspirations of someone trampled. I take pitch as a warning that power and money are actually held by studio directors and production houses. Authors, musicians and aspiring (and "successful") actors are still just passing travelers, even when they reach Big Time. <br /> <br /> Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message is still there.
