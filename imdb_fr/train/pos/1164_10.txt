I saw this movie when it came out. It was an official selection of the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for the best image. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is as sexy as Amanda, psychotic but complex. This is not your ordinary psycho movie. Many interesting and original inclinations on the genre. A kind of fatal attraction for the youngest with good blues music, the object of Amanda's affection being married to a promising blues singer who has less time for her husband while his career takes off. <br /> <br />
