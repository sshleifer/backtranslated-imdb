Reflections: A pure delight from the beginning to the end. No laughing, but a more subtle and sophisticated humor. What a gold mine of great scenes and character actors including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant stands in front of his building new house, which at this stage, be framed. A young carpenter, interpreted by the future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "allies to be tapped", or something like a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to sound ignorant, answers in the affirmative. In this regard, Barker shouted to his comrades: "OK guys, he wants to have them with a soap opera, so ... YANK 'EM OUT!" A second later, you hear the heart-rending, heart-rending sounds of about 20 large nails torn from various planks. All Grant can do is moan. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is dated. You would never see so many carpenters working in a single-family home at all, and such a place in Connecticut would probably cost a few million dollars. <br /> <br /> A classic movie that is really a treasure.
