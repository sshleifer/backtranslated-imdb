The world is a terrible place. But this movie is a joke and it's fun. And if you do not like it ... you do not get it ... and if you do not get it ... it does not matter. It's up to you to decide if you want to play. All the actors of this one had fun. It's just a joke. And that's enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is priceless. Byrne and Paul Anka doing MY WAY are, as "Vic" says, "... the best version of all time". Ok ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I was warned to see him, but I'm glad I did ...
