Personally, I find that the film is a good watch. It describes the current situation of the triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how the triads are organized. <br /> <br /> It also shows how the Hong Kong police control the situation of triads and why the police do not just eliminate all triads. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is rather violent because of the methods of murder and torture perpetrated by the gangs. Nevertheless, the film remains true to the real world and the violence on the screen only reflects what is really happening. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to all fans of the movie Triad / Mafia. Another good watch would be Dragon Squad. This movie has more guns than that, because in this film there are more knives than guns (in fact I do not remember seeing a single gun).
