All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie I have always loved. When I was a child, I watched it every day. It is underestimated if you look at its IMDb rating and comments from many people in general. This is not a bad movie as many say, it's a very good movie. That's good and your kids will probably like it. Even though it is rated G, some parents may find it a bit violent. It's actually a pretty dark story, where dogs are like gangsters involved in gambling, extortion and even cold-blooded murder. The film follows a dog named Charlie who escaped from the pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but ends up returning to earth. Many young children watching this film may feel like watching a great movie. <br /> <br /> Some scenes may scare little children, but I'm sure they'll be fine. Every time I watch this film, it reminds me of my childhood. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of their youth, it's the movie that makes me feel that way. The performances of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are excellent, and this is the last film in which a little girl by the name of Judith Barsi was filmed. Unfortunately, she was killed very young, which is a shame because she had so much potential and she did not deserve what happened. Now that I know his story, I can not watch this film in the same way because his voice is so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation of this film is excellent, the work of the voice is excellent and the story is good, but a little different from many other children's movies. It was popular at the time of its release, but was dominated by the popular Disney mega, The Little Mermaid. It's a film that is not designed as well by adults, but if you're a child, or if you grew up with this movie as a kid, then I'm sure you'll like to watch it.
