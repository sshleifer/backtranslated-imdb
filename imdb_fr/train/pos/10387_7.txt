After reading some of the reviews, I was expecting something really horrible but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series was not very good. I think some people remember it with more affection than she deserved, but aside from Daisy Duke's car chases and legs, the scenarios were weak and misinterpreted. The Duke Boys were too smart and fancy for the boobies, the Boss Hog was too fool to be mean and Rosco was just super at every moment of the screen. It's amazing that the series lasted as long as it lasted, as there were no more stories in the first series. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you watch this movie as such, not as a direct comparison to how you remember the TV series, then it's not bad at all. The real star is of course General Lee. The car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what D.O.H. is all about. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric and, with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo, the couple makes this movie really funny in a hilarious Dumb-and-Dumber style that the TV series never made. The charming Jessica Simpson is a native character of Miss Daisy. Burt Reynolds makes a much improved Boss Hog and CM. Gainey makes an incredibly nasty Rosco P. Coltrane, as he always should have been. <br /> <br /> If you do not like awkward humor and crazy stunts, then you would not want to watch this movie should know what to expect. If not, if you want an entertaining action-car movie with some good laughs that do not bother your brain, then go see this fun adventure with an open mind.
