What an incredibly funny and original show. The cast that begins with the hysterical Julie Brown (Queen Homecoming Got A Gun) is just perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American, Kim grandmother) who plays a lesbian who is always fighting with her partner and business partner (Asian restaurant-WOK-DON "T RUN.) I laughed more during this show than any Other than I've ever seen If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane, you'll love this series! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams playing herself. When she bluffs Tammy on dry Tammy find a picture of Cindy Williams in her coat, in which Cindy Williams is committing an unimaginable act with an upside-down bowling, an opera with a lot of surprise twists and turns for the short while. DVD will come out one day with many special features as a bonus.The funniest series I have ever seen !!!!
