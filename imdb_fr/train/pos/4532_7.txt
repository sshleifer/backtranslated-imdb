This is Keaton's first feature film. It is actually three short films spread over different periods (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Age) on the eternal triangle of the novel. The stories are parallel, as in Griffith's INTOLERANCE, that it was meant to be satirical. The strong points of jokes and gags are almost all based on anachronisms, which brings modern affairs back into old settings. <br /> <br /> **** WARNING - THE SPOILIERS FOLLOW TO DEVELOP THE GOOD POINTS ******> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> The use of a turtle as a plank (Stone Age); A wristwatch containing a sundial (Roman period); A chariot with a spare wheel (Roman era); Use a helmet as a tire lock (Roman era); Beginning of golf with clubs and rocks (Stone Age); Dictate a testament engraved in a rock (the stone age); The evolving meteorologist The chariot race in the snow - Buster using skis and huskies with a rescue dog in the trunk of the tank (Roman Age). <br /> <br /> The above are all disposable gags that make us laugh. There are, however, some unforgettable moments: <br /> <br /> Buster takes out shaving equipment to match a girl wearing makeup; The fantastic double catch when Buster, drunk, looks at his plate and discovers a crab that looks at him (in a second, he jumped to sit on his chair from a sitting position and jumped into his arms again of the waiter - one of the funniest moments I have ever seen. And this lion - the manicure - is simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is also a bit of disordered racism when four African-American litter bearers abandon their mistress for a game of Roman shit. <br /> <br /> The Kino print is a bit fuzzy and contains many nitrate deterioration and film deterioration sequences, most likely at the ends of the coils. The Metro function is composed on piano and flute and borrows heavily from Grieg. <br /> <br /> Lots of fun and laughs.
