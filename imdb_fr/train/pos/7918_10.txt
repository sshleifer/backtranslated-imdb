I loved this film. In fact, I loved being an actress in this movie. I was a pregnant teenager in the second part of the film. You may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf exposes himself to a movie. I was the woman in the front row with my hands on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector. In fact, they have doubled me many times, so it's hard to miss this mistake. Congratulations to Full Moon High. I hope it will come soon. Cheryl Lockett Alexander Leesville, Louisiana Loved this movie. In fact, I loved being an actress in this movie.
