Maybe some people may consider this a slow movie. However, it is precisely this "slow burning" that allows him to profoundly affect the viewer. Like this marvelous first scene: first, we can hear voices; then we are allowed to see the characters; finally, the camera slowly moves back and forth on the side and we see another character, a young man sitting next door, apparently not even listening to the conversation or, at least, not really caring . The fact that this young man is the main role reflects the strategy of the film: to allow the character to develop and be determined by the environment around him, but without noticing the points more than necessary. People come and go, come in and out of his life. Although most of the film follows him (and most of the secondary characters are only seen so close to him, defined by the relationship he has with him), we are inclined to believe that we are objective, both the contact with the director is subtle.
