Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason he was so great was because of the Ramones! You could not have done the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols, or The Clash instead of The Ramones, it just would not have been the same. dey young, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel, and the lobby editors, have just added to the film. The whole movie is about Ramones ... especially about Joey! So everyone has been to see Rock 'n' Roll High School if you are a big fan of real PUNK. Not the new shit sissy ... but the strong and fast kind. The kind that only Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest in peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
