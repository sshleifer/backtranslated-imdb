Daniell Steel's Daddy, what a refreshing story. This film has glorified the importance of family and parents in the lives of their children. How is this rare? In these times of "Heather has two moms" (or whatever, you fill in the blanks), it's easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. The roles of the father being important, I hoped that it would be another saga of Daniell Steel. What a disappointment to have it finished. Each character was important and did a fabulous job. I would have liked to see each character develop over the years. I loved this movie, it's a movie that I will watch with challenge every time it's released. Good story, good acting, and I hope it's not a spoiler, but no unwelcome sex or vulgar language. Yes, it touched my heart. Be careful, prepare the Kleenex. What I find sad is that this aspect of family life is rarely described today in our entertainment, be it television or. Movies. Daniell, if you listen, You Go Girl, give us more.
