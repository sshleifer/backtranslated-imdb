EARTH (2009) *** 1/2 The big-screen adaptation of the BBC / Discovery Channel series "Planet Earth" offers a rather majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty, with truly breathtaking moments of "how the hell did they had this sequence ?! "While admiring the awesome landscapes of animals in their natural habitats and the environmental message of the circle of life, you can be cruel (watch a great white shark swallow a walrus seal as a quick meal!) and adorable (the different babies). The deep tones of the narrator James Earl Jones reinforce his "look of God" and his depth. Literally censored by hundreds of hours of shooting, the only complaint comes from the fact that it should have been in IMAX format and could have been even longer! Oh, well, there's always next time (since Disney Studios has produced this account on a series of others to come). Dirs: Alastair Fothergill & Mark Linfield.
