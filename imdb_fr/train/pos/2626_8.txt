"Lion King 1 1/2" is Disney's most entertaining non-theatrical release. I recently reviewed this movie after not having seen it for several years. I remember the first time I saw it. I had no hope and was pleasantly surprised by this very watchable and entertaining film. <br /> <br /> Is it better than "Simba's Pride"? In many ways, yes. Although "Simba's Pride" is not really bad, he had some problems: lack of good script and bad characterizations, which had an impact on what would otherwise be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's nice to see. The personalities of Timon and Pumbaa are flourishing again as we have loved them (or certainly me) about them in this film; in "Simba's Pride", they were completely annoying and I did not like the series "Timon and Pumbaa" either. <br /> <br /> This film could easily have been stupid, but fortunately, the filmmakers did not take the wrong turn and rather focused to make this film sometimes extremely hilarious. There are some jokes that adults can enjoy alone. The score is good enough. There are two new songs, which are catchy and two new characters, Timon's mother (played by Julie Kavner of Marge Simpsons, recognizable) and Uncle Max, who are nice. The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa is touchingly evoked. The emotional scenes are well integrated into the comic story and are not moved, which could have been easily done (especially in comedies). <br /> <br /> But is there anything that prevents this image from getting 10 votes from me? Yes there is. Fortunately, they do not have much impact, but I'll mention them: 1. Most scenes from the first movie are used in this one. Personally, it was weird to see the old scenes fit into the news. <br /> <br /> 2. During the climax, some jokes become lame. <br /> <br /> 3. This is the story of Timon. Even if the filmmakers try to integrate his story with that of Simba, the scenario is sometimes a bit hasty. <br /> <br /> But these details have no impact on this film so fun. . This is the only truly acceptable Disney suite, which should feature in every movie collection.
