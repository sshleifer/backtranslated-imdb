It's a very unusual film in the sense that the star at the top poster does not appear literally halfway. Nevertheless, I was caught by the hook of the Phantom Lady. Curtis, although competent as the falsely accused Scott Henderson, looks a bit hard to be sympathetic (he may have had to shave his mustache) and his behavior on his return should have convinced the cops at least in some measure of his innocence. . While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone in the role of Jack Marlowe, I found that his description of the character was incredibly complex. He is not mean. The superb actress Elisha Cook Jr. is again in great shape as a "little man with great ambitions". His percussion in musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism. This film is however worn by the very competent and welcoming Ella Raines, because the devotee would be a Henderson lover, Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent and her on-screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of her work I've seen and I really want to see her play other roles. The rest of the cast is also more than competent. In short, a very satisfying film noir that today fully reflects the dark and complex urban world for which it is intended. Recommended, 8/10.
