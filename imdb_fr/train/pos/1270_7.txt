This film is really a mixed bag. On the one hand, the story and concept of the film are really good, tense and have some interesting twists. But again, everything is said very slowly, without style and without implication. I still consider that "Just Cause" is a thriller above average simply because of the quality of its casting. <br /> <br /> Maybe Sean Connery has been misinterpreted. I mean, he's not really credible as the main "hero" and father of a girl (played by a still very young Scarlett Johansson for that matter) and husband of Kate Capshaw. I think he was just too old for the role to be really credible. However, Sean Connerey is of course a great actor and that's the only reason he's still able to make the film as well as he is. But he is of course helped by a very strong support cast of actors like Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris. All the actors are really good, but some of them are heavily underused at the same time, which is a shame, as well as a missed opportunity. In particular, Ed Harris is simply brilliant in his role as a psychopathic serial killer. He is really scary and acts superbly. Normally, he does not play this kind of ruthless and scary role in movies, so he's really surprised by his role in this one. His performance alone is already enough reason to watch this movie. However, since the story is told without much style and too many formulas, none of the characters in the movie really work because it seems too far away. <br /> <br /> This is really the way of telling stories. it kills the whole film of its great potential. Arne Glimcher directs the film with little style and sometimes keeps the pace too low. That's why we, viewers, never really get involved in the story or any of its characters. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because "Just Cause" had more than enough potential. A beautiful cast and a beautiful story with some unexpected twists in which nothing is what it seems. Distribution and story are the only reason this film is still an above-average thriller, which will probably still please fans of the genre. It is however an eternal shame that the film lacks narration and style, otherwise this film could have been a true classic of the genre. <br /> <br /> 7/10
