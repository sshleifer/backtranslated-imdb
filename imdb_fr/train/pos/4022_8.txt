Another detailed work on the subject done by Dr. Dwivedi takes us back to the past in Punjab. Dr. Dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his film debut. He worked on all the minute details to bring the story to life. The treatment of the subject is very delicate. <br /> <br /> Even though we have not been to the area since then, the sets and costumes are true. Unlike most score-based films, this one does not focus on the gory details of violence to attract the audience, but on its consequences. The characters come to life. Priyanshu Chatterjee gave an impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai showed his heart by showing the fate of a man torn by guilt. The rest of the cast also did a good job.
