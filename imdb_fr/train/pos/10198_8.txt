I am grateful to Cesar Montano and his team for reactivating the Visayan understory, which was once moribund. "Panaghoy" is, we hope, the precursor of a resurgence of this vernacular language (which claims more speakers than Tagalog). The dialect and lifestyle details accurately recall this region of the Philippines. Disadvantage: the nerdy and scalded game of the American antagonist. The other thing I did not like was the lack of authenticity of the "old-time" costume of the same character and, above all, his bright red kit-kit that I assumed was meant to be a 1930s roadster. Without these small, yet glaring details, "Panaghoy" would have been at least 9 out of 10 in my note - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Addendum: This film beats Peque Gallaga's "Oro, Plata, Mata", which offered a different vision of the Visayas during the Second World War. In addition, the cinematography sometimes recalls "The Color Purple" by Spielberg and the screenplay begins to sound like "Noli Me Tangere".
