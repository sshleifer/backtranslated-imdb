Normally, I do not watch action movies because they are usually very similar. This film featured many stereotypical scenes of action movies, but the characters and originality of the film's premise made reading much easier. David Duchovny changed his usual actor approach, which was great to see. Angelina Jolie, of course, was beautiful and played very well. Super casting all together. A must see for people who are bored with the same old action movie.
