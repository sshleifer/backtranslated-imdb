The comical joke between William Powell and John Arthur is the culmination of this mystery of murder, which has one of the most bizarre and improbable intrigues of all time. Powell is probably the sweetest detective of the 30s and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells. They are extremely fun to watch, so take the plate of the plot with a grain of salt and enjoy it to see it unfold. Eric Blore also has comedic roles as Powell's Butler. <br /> <br /> Powell's contract with MGM included a clause allowing him to refuse the loan-borrower to another studio, but he wanted to rework with Arthur and he liked the script, so he enthusiastically accepted the assignment . They had worked together in two 1929 Paramount films, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, both of the Philo Vance series.
