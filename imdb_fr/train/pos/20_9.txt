'Stanley and Iris' show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it's the struggle to become literate and realize his potential. For Iris, it is to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film lies in the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda make together, starting and stopping, before everyone has the skills and courage to trust and move forward. In this sense, it gives us a very good idea of ​​how life is often lived, so credible. Unlike other reviews, I found that the characters were consistent across the board. Supporting actors are also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that gives the main characters extra meaning through support performance. Overall, it's an excellent movie. The best thing I get is Hope.
