It's a movie that gets better every time I see it. There are so many nuanced performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing a lively comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut, as Vadas, is the only "villain" of the film, and his oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan is charming as the owner of the securities shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar style is well used here. I particularly liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Very credible in all facets of his role. <br /> <br /> The two main roles are also accomplished. Margaret Sullivan does a remarkable job in portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic woman, but charming and seductive. However, this film belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The film is presented from his point of view, with the action revolving around him. Mr. Stewart is more than capable of making the film, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just look at Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment caused by such a traumatic event. In my opinion, James Stewart is undoubtedly the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. No one has ever been captured in a film that conveys so completely what they feel for an audience. By the time he made this film, he still had most of his career in front of him, but he is quite master of his art. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts' best movies, but also one of the sweetest and most enjoyable romantic comedies you'll find. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
