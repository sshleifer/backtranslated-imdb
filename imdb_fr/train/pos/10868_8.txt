I always thought it would be a long and boring Talking-Heads movie full of static inlets, dude, I was wrong. "Election" is an extremely fascinating and captivating drama thriller that takes a deep and realistic view of the origins of Triads-Rituals. The characters are constantly moving, and although as a spectator, you always remain an outsider, you can still feel the suspense emanating from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. In addition, Johnnie To creates truly opulent images with meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric shadow contrasts. Although there is virtually no action, the end is still shocking in its ruthless description of brutality. Cool movie that deserves more attention, and I came to like the minimalist acoustic guitar score a bit.
