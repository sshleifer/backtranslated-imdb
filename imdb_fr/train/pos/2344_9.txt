I am one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a private show. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the broadcast commercials that gave an overview of the series. I was skeptical at first, especially after the Six Feet Under final was still in my head. It's off, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought that it was necessary to approach the subject of death and present it in an acceptable way without being morbid. The characters were endearing and I like the idea that Ned, the main character, can literally not touch the love of his life, Chuck, without the consequences of his death. <br /> <br /> Most characters aspire to death. things they can not have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian are waiting for their niece, Chuck, and Emerson still longs for the financial rewards of the mysterious deaths they have solved. I think the characters are perfect and credible. I like the way Emerson, who is black, plays with the rest of the characters since as a South American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. <br /> <br /> In the end, this visual fairy tale is one of the most valuable entertainment I've seen of the 2007 season. I think the series has enough romance for romantics and enough who did it for the mystery enthusiast. I just want the writers to get back to work, so the show can continue to evolve.
