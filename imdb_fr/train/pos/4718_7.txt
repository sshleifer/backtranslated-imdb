This film was made in Hungary, I think. Anyway, the campaign is beautiful, the people who play farming were totally fascinating. their riding is great. I became more interested in aboriginal people, farm life and the heroic way in which they tried to hide Brady from the nasty Nazis who were looking for these paratroopers. They even sacrificed their lives many times. the orphan boy with whom Brady was a nice boy. I think you will be amazed by the riding and by trying to avoid the Nazis. it's fun and comical in some places and very tragic to others. The ladies have handkerchiefs on hand, you will be devastated at the end. I own it and have watched it many times. in other words, not just a one-off film. he is a guardian ....
