I do not know what the previous review looked at but I guess that's what the reviews are, personal taste. What was missing in this film was the depth, a very deep film, many layers of emotion, that touched. Undercurrent of love held back because of submission to social beliefs, taboos of times and classes, racial relations not being in a very good state of equality, guilt, longing, hatred, confusion, very dark emotionally , I thought, under the skin, submit to the air of it, a fluid film, not slow as indicated previously, relax in the flow of the film, the emotions will manifest, the characters will reveal their faults, their nasty entrails , excellent and in fact very cruel!
