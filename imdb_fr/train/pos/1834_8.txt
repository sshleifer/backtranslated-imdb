This film is very touching. I do not care what people say about this movie, it's a very good movie. Amitabh Bachchan's performance in the role of the dying father is excellent because he wants to teach his son how to manage life in case something happens to him and that Akshay Kumer was great in his role as Aditya Thakur, spoiled. The secondary role of Shefali Shetty, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good in her small role she had in the movie. Ragpal Yadav as a cerebral servant, and Boman Irani as a fierce stepfather have very good relationships and the comedy scene is hilarious. The direction is very good.
