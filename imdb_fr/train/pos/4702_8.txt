In the 80s, the ZAZ Boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the pinnacle of the world of genre parodies. But there were several pretenders to the throne. This time, Amy ("Fast Times at High Ridership") Heckerling is trying her luck, with an incredible amount of TV writers behind the screenplay (go check it out). <br /> <br /> This awesome slap on the cops and gag movies of the 1930s throws just about every cliché for a loop and even adds some clichés that did not exist yet. And not only is the Keaton, still reliable, the Johnny of the title, but the same is true of funny guys and dolls like Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and just about everyone. the other actors in Hollywood who have been walking in the immediate vicinity. You would be surprised by the number of faces you will recognize. I know I was. <br /> <br /> And the jokes? Well, when they start, they come to you quickly and furiously, like a machine gun. There are too many to count at the beginning, with a mad theme song by Weird Al Yankovic in mind. But you have to watch the moment when they recharge. And they have to recharge a little too often. <br /> <br /> Everybody tries, they seem to have fun and I have a good laugh. In the end, though, there was plenty of time to think about how some of the scenes might have been more fun - it's usually not the best thing to think about after a comedy. <br /> <br /> But for a slow night where nothing good on TV, enter "Johnny" and get ready for a serious laugh "dangerously". <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Discover "Johnny Dangerously" ... do not be a "bastidge".
