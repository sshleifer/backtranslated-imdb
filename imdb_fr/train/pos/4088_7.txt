this one is there. Not much to say on this subject except that it is a subject rarely discussed in bestiality films. I can understand why this film was banned for so long, the topics in the film are still a little taboo because most people in the world will say that the eroticism in the film is well deserved and that it corresponds to the atmosphere of the film. It's a good movie that is well played and has a purpose ... to shock the viewer and cross boundaries that we do not see often in the movies. I came across this movie on the net that I thought I could watch. I enjoyed the film because it is both provocative and quite erotic. Something you do not often see in movies today.
