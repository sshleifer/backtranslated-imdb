How can we not like this film? I think it's a hilarious parody of all the old gangster movies; If you've never seen them, look at this. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role just like anything. A guy spoils the English language every time he speaks and Griffin Dunn plays an insignificant D.A., but my favorite role must always be Joe Piscopo. He has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale and Ray Walston are part of this movie stars that gangsters proclaim much funnier than what "Mafia" did for the underground criminal.
