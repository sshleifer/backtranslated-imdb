I'm looking for this movie for years. Apparently it's not available in the US so I bought a copy on Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and three of their friends are venturing into the woods in search of a bear that apparently killed several campers. What they discover is a veteran Vietnam veteran gone crazy (he kills some of his victims with a long-nailed metal glove Freddy Krueger). As soon as night falls, one of the girls walks after a brief argument with her boyfriend, she gets killed. Once one of the group members found his body, they all hid in their tents while waiting for the day. Once the sun rose, they all tried to escape, but they were killed one after the other. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not a lot of coolness, but some good murders, especially those of the daughters of the dead. The guys are killed somewhat dripping (exploded in a car, shot, knife in the head). <br /> <br /> Overall, INFERNAL TRAP is a beautiful slasher film from the late 80s. Nothing new, just played, fast and some pretty ladies. 10 of 10.
