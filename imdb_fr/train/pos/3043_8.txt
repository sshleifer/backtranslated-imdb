This film will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is an industry to a man. This film will also explain why Indian moviegoers are savvy shoppers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the top of his Bollywood domination when his former godfather Prakash Mehra decided to reuse his image. Prakash has a habit of choosing themes and creating stories, adding generous doses of Bollywood sensibilities and clich√©s. Zanzeer saw the training of the young man angry. Lawaris wanted to be a bastard and Namak Halal, a loyalty to the master servant. <br /> <br /> But then, the theme was limited to get the script through the three hours of singing, dancing and drama. This film is a caricature of a Haryanavi who goes to Mumbai and turns into a regulatory hero. Amitabh's vocal skills and diction have enabled this film to earn a lot of money with its flawless Haryanvi accent. For me, this alone is the biggest attraction in the movie. The rest, everything is written on a typical Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Amitabh now had to have typical comedy scenes in each of his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This film had a good dose. The festive shoe, the monologue on the considerations of Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare, The challenge of mosquitoes in the meeting room and the usual drunkard scene that has now become a standard Amitabh fare. A little longer than the film with its sullen and capricious character (remember that he asked Ranjeet of "Shaaadaaaap" after the incident of the poisoned cake ".) The mind ... and that's how Shashi had to work with the rest of the movie, he was a character who could have been more developed to make a serious movie, but it's a caper, do you remember? people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new hat and came home happy.The end is still predictable, and the good guys get the girl and the bad guys go to the prison, the theme of loyalty is a Once again emphasized and all is well that ends well. <br /> <br /> So w What makes this movie almost a classic Amitabh Bacchan like Haryanvi Prakash Mehra has created another icon at name of a story Chuck the story, the characters and the plot My marks are for Amitabh alone.
