It's a really funny (and sexy) movie - not just silly, but a great actor. This is the kind of movie where the characters are so much fun that we feel connected to everyone in the theater. I saw him at the Boston Film Festival, and I often found myself laughing with everyone and being upset by some of the more serious aspects of the film. It's a unique film about two doctors, and I do not want to reveal anything, but there are scenes as powerful as funny - the dialogue is great. The character of Wood Harris has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana. Brian White and Mya also play a funny and sexy role. If you have the opportunity to see it, go ahead, you will not be disappointed. It's worth the detour. Wood Harris deserves a prize.
