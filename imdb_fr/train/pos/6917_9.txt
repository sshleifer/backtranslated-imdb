This is a story of the 1873 model of the Winchester rifle "The gun that won the West" For a race man, an outlaw, a peace officer or a soldier, the Winchester 73 was a precious possession. An Indian would sell his soul to own one ... <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo who would then create a series of westerns that superior added a new psychological depth to the genre. The story sees Stewart playing Lin McAdam in pursuit of the man who killed his father. While traveling to Dodge City with his faithful friend Johnny Williams {Millard Mitchell}, Lin meets the Dutchman Henry Brown {Stephen McNally}, the man he wants. But with Wyatt Earp {Will Geer} having taken all the weapons of those who enter the city, the two men are unable to have the shooting for which they are ready. Instead, the men compete in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition Lin eventually wins. But before he can leave the city with the magnificent prize, Dutch ambush him, steal the rifle and jump quickly from the city. As Lin embarks on a hateful pursuit between the man and the rifle, the rifle will change hands several times, adding each time another dimension as day of consideration of all approaches. <br /> <br /> Reference criterion for what has become the so-called "Western Psychological", Winchester 73 essentially tells the story of a decent man pushed to the limit of madness by an event of his past. Although shot in black and white (the only duet in the West), the landscapes are still breathtaking feast for the eyes. The tone is given with the opening scene while Lin and Johnny are on horseback and, in silhouette, walked on a hill as they head for Dodge City. This is the ideal starting point for Mann to use his views as a way to compete with the emotional states of his characters. <br /> <br /> Stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as a McAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of America's most talented and versatile actors . The support is not bad either. Shelley Winters is excellent as the only female chauvinist, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and the always formidable Dan Duryea add even more class to the procedure. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson even have a few roles to play, even if the latter plays a brave Indian is too complicated. <br /> <br /> Originally, the film was a project of Fritz Lang, who had even prepared the script. run. But Lang moved away, which was a blessing for Western fans. For one as good a director as Lang, with Mann as a director (and with a new scenario of Borden Chase & Robert Richards in his hands), he set in motion the process to change the course of the genre. Not only with the extra effort that Mann & Stewart has produced, but also with those they have influenced. Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller all took notes, and with great joy for Western purists, they followed suit and carried the psychological flame even further. <br /> <br /> A resounding success at the box office When it was released, Winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still resists the modern era. 9.5 / 10
