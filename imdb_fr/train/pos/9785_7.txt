Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I had the film for Hugo Weaving and I watched it until the end. It's one of those movies about the "drama of life", as my mother used to call it. He describes a narrative of real life without extraordinary events and which is essentially descriptive. <br /> <br /> I loved the light and the girls. The rest was without much fault, but without much merit either. I dreamed of something like The Interview, or at least an element of evil matrix here and there, but nothing extraordinary. History teaches one to face its own destiny and free itself from the environment that others build for you, but this happens when the invigorating fishing plant in the area is about to close. It is not necessary to make a lot of effort to change things. <br /> <br /> American Beauty's "smart" song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack, but it was still annoying after 100 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> In the end, I guess his job was to introduce some of Australian life, but for me it did not seem to be specifically Australian (it could have been anywhere) and it did not seem attractive. history. <br /> <br /> I guess you have to be in a certain mood to love the movie.
