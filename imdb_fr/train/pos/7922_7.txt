In this flight of horror movies, paranoia of the Cold War of the 1950s, Reagan era America and high school films, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the star quarterback of Full Moon High in the 1950s His father and he (Ed McMahon) go to communist Romania and, while he is lost in the streets one night, he is bitten by a werewolf. When he returns to the United States, he can not control his animal impulses and leaves for a slaughter. Frustrated, he flees the city. Decades later, the immortal Tony returns to town and enrolls in high school. He still can not control his transformations, and the townspeople and his friends realize that he is not quite human. All of this culminates during the school's big football game. <br /> <br /> I was expecting it to be one of those "so bad it's good" movies from the early 80's. But I was surprised that the movie was really legitimate funny. The actors, including Kenneth Mars as a perverse coach, Roz Kelly as Tony's former vigorous flame, Demond Wilson as bus driver and Alan Arkin as a supernatural doctor, gave it all, with results. hilarious. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I was struck by the similarity of writing and humor with "Family Guy". "Full Moon High" has the same attitude and never takes himself seriously.
