As a guy who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG surprises me constantly. I mean, after seeing him go from laughter to paranoia instantly over the seasons and after every little gesture on his part, you thought he was a gangster, you thought of yourself: OK, he's a good actor and he can get into the shoes of a gangster. . But after seeing him open his eyes and fight for his life, I could almost feel the pain he "made us" believe we were crossing. His performance touched me so much that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generation and even more. But nowadays, they are either old or dead (Brando) and it is normal that they produce fewer films and their performances are "lighter" than they were before. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other films where he plays a totally different role. Can you recommend some of his older films where he gives a memorable performance?
