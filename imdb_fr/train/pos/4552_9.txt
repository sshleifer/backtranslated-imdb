Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot offers us one of the best performances ever performed by an actor. He is brilliant like Christy Brown, a man with cerebral palsy, who later learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker who plays his beloved mother. Hugh O'Conner is great as a young Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are excellent as a father. It should look for outstanding performance.
