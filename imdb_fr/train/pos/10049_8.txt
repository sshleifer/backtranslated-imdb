I am not a parent, I am not a man either. But I was able to identify the sorrows and pains of each character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that teenagers should watch. Maybe so, they will begin to appreciate the value of the family again. I am sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a role different from that of Bobby Ewing. And it's good to see Ben Affleck, 19, doing his best in a moving and heartfelt performance. He showed early on that he was capable of a sincere drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland ... his first serious role in years and he came out winner of the best actor at the Venice Film Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This film can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Children under the age of 10 may not be watching because they may be afraid that the same thing will happen, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched with friends a few times. Because it describes the values ​​that are important in life.
