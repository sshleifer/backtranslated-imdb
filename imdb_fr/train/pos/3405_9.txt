"The Garden of Allah" is one of the first 3-band Technicolor feature films. To correct a previous poster, Technicolor's first feature (after five years of exclusivity with Disney) was "Becky Sharp" from 1935, a play that used color for its gaudy costumes. <br /> <br /> "The Garden of Allah" seems to have been turned years later, because cinematography uses not only color but also the use of shadows. It must have been incredible for an audience of the time to see a color feature after watching only black and white movies for their entire lives. Unfortunately, the film does not stand up to cinematography. That being said, the film is worth seeing as a visual treat.
