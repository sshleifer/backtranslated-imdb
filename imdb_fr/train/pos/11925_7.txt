I have seen this film on cable one afternoon. I must admit that I have never been a big fan of baseball, but I can sometimes get into a good movie about sports. What I found more interesting is the description of the host family system. As a therapist who saw both the advantages and disadvantages of mental health and system for host families in the community, I found very refreshing to see a film that showed the ups and downs of this system: people moving from family to family, parents do not always actively participate and transitions can be heartbreaking and heartbreaking. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchors of this film and offer very credible performances. It may have been just my emotional state, but I found myself shedding a tear at the end of the film.
