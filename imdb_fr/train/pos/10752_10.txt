It was the most amazing, moving, incredible and incredible story I have ever seen. Frankly, even these adjectives just can not describe it. I can not just pick a scene that stands out for me. I suppose if I had to list a few of them, it would be the firefighter's reaction to the crash of victims jumping; the reaction of people trapped in the elevator, who were not aware of what was happening, when they finally emerged on the horrible scene; the shock and disbelief of the spectators; and finally silence. <br /> <br /> That day, and even now, I remember Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says, "I felt a great disruption in the Force, as if millions of voices had suddenly screamed in terror and had suddenly been silenced." It is amazing to see his description so precise. There was really a disturbance in the Force. <br /> <br /> This documentary strongly reveals this disturbance. The feelings are incredibly visual. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, exhaustion and realization of its very magnitude. Everything is there. There is nothing missing. <br /> <br /> It's a powerful documentary, very moving and worthy of the Emmy. Not only because it documents September 11, but because that's all it should be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch, be sure to grab a box of tissues. You will need them. I know I did.
