Dr. Mordrid is one of those rare films completely under the radar, but it's worth it. It really reminds me of the old soap operas of the '30s and' 40s. That's why I would have liked to see movies in a row ... but judging by the rest of Full Moon's production, there was nothing just not enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene, there are two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without them, it could have been a Harry Potter magic party that the kids would have devoured. Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are both great. I did not know if Ms. Nipar had not gone astray in a photo on the film list on this film. She was very credible. No seriously! Anyway - it's too bad they did not have the money to give Dr. Strange a license, because I think it could have been a total phenomenon for the kids.
