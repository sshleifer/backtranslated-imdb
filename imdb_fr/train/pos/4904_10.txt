Charming in all respects, this film is perfect if you want to feel good. If you like jazz, it's a must see. If you like to see adorable characters that make you smile, you can tear your eyes and swing as if there is no tomorrow, this film is for you. If you are looking for an intense, deep and heavy work of art to dissect and analyze, it may be best to stick to something from Darren Aronofsky!) My only complaint is that the film was really too short . I suppose I will have to watch it several more times to satisfy myself.
