I thought this movie was fantastic. It was hilarious. Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap. It's a must for any rock fan of the '70s. (I hope my friends and I will not be like that in twenty years!) <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy gives a great performance as a first singer trying to find this old spirit, <br /> <br /> Stephen Rea fits perfectly in the film as a glue trying to keep the group, but not doing well. <br /> <br /> If you like music and have already been part of a band, this movie is definitely for you. You will not regret seeing this movie. I know not. Even my family found it funny, and that says a lot.
