The famous pre-code movie, actually the only movie that pushed people to insist that the Hayes Code be strictly enforced. Barbara Stanwyck stars a girl whose father, an alcohol salesman, has no problem selling it to customers. When he dies in an accident, she came out into the world knowing that her nubile body can get her what she wants. She travels to New York and begins to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Although sex is obviously not presented, the film is rather sordid. Unfortunately, once the initial value of the shock has faded (about the time Stanwyck screws a car inspector so that she can travel for free), the film becomes a little repetitive and dull. Stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the movie worthy of being seen. As always, she is fantastic.
