Australian Fred Schepisi (A Cry in the Dark) directs this comedy / romance that is both fun, relaxing and springtime. You will laugh watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is an auto mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ, who increases with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic friends, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them by their preppy shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, you have a mail) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece, a competent but not as confident mathematician. It may be because she is surrounded by all that genius. She thinks that if she marries a person with a high IQ her children will have a high I.Q. too, but she does not know what she wants. Between Tim Robbins cute smile and the kindness of Meg it's a refreshing film. I like sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is engaged to jerk James Moreland, who works in the behavior of animals, but is very stuffy. It is a love at first glance, between the mechanic and the mathematician. Thin lines and subliminal lines! Cinematography is beautiful. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With the help of all these brilliant men, Catherine falls for Ed without knowing that he is a car mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite Scenes: Ed passes a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein on a motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris free all search animals! <br /> <br /> Favorite Quotes: Albert Einstein: "Do not let your brain disturb your heart". Ed Walters: "When was the last time he said" Wahoo "? Catherine Boyd: "Well, I'm sure I do not know." It's a refreshing film, I recommend it. I have the cassette and I will watch it from time to time.
