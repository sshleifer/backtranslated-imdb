I'm a big fan of M Lillard, so I ended up watching this movie. Honestly, I doubt if he was not in the movie, I would have enjoyed it so much or even watched, but once I looked at it, I realized that the story was pretty decent. A bad end I must say but I saw it coming. It's a low budget movie and some actors are not really good, but overall, I rated this movie 7/10. <br /> <br /> The suspense of asking what Lillard was really doing was what really kept me interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
