I do not normally have to write a review for a movie, but the only comment for this film so far is rather unfair, so I think it's necessary to share my point of view. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" (or as he was titled at the theater, I saw it, "Fallen") follows Matiss, a solitary Latvian archivist, as he tries to discover a woman that he did not try to stop jumping off a bridge, as well as his reasons for doing so. It's sort of the plot, but this film is not interested in the story but in the description of the guilt of a man who did not act. As an investigator who investigates the incident tells us, we usually do not care about the anonymous faces we face every day until they die. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Michaelango Antonioni and his "Blowup" will most likely abound in all the reviews you read about "Krisana". The influence of Antonioni's philosophical and austere style and the story of "Blowup" is clear and, in fact, the screenwriter / director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to this film in scenes in which Matiss tries to know the woman who jumped from the movie. bridge, or at least what he thinks, did it. <br /> <br /> The only other person to make known his point of view on the film undermines the look and sound of the film "college film class". He neglects to take into account the budget constraints that an existentialist Latvian film is likely to face, but black-and-white atmospheric cinematography and ambient sound reach an artistic level to portray Matiss's loneliness. The background noise of wind and street noise confers a disturbing aura and recalls a film by Fellini, whether or not Kelemen intended it. The filmmakers certainly had little money, but this constraint is used to the advantage of the film. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" succeeds as a study of the character with enough humor to prevent him from becoming too serious. It could easily have fallen into the trap of a mystery story, but it avoids it and becomes a clever film about loneliness and guilt. If you are more concerned about the plot, this movie and its end can frustrate you. If not, take the time to commit to it. It is worth looking for.
