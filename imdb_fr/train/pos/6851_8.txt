De Palma's technique had reached its peak at the time of this film, which is a great showcase of its classic techniques. Unfortunately, like many movies written by De Palma himself, the story serves more the meta than the interests of telling a captivating story. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a CRAZY scene in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in a shower as she watches her husband. She is then seized and raped while her husband stands unconsciously close - and everything turns out to be Angie's fantasy while her husband pumps her unconsciously to bed. She has a short scene with her son, a dead performer for Harry Potter, who ends with a joke that "she will tell Grandma that he is playing with his peter". She then goes to her therapy session where she complains of her dead marriage before attempting to seduce her therapist, Michael Caine. He refuses, and she is hurt and feels unattractive and unsatisfied. <br /> <br /> So begins a bravura sequence of 22 minutes almost without words that is perhaps the highlight of the film. Among the many things De Palma has learned from Hitchcock, is there an understanding of the film as a purely visual way of telling stories? and in the typical De Palma way, he transforms it into a way of showing his formidable talent. The problem for me is that in this case, we start to feel that the scenes are unnecessarily prolonged simply to show more the skills of the director. <br /> <br /> The sequence begins with Angie in an art museum. She observes strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, then begins to get caught by a man sitting next to her. De Palma very skillfully recounts an extremely complicated story without a single word about the attraction, embarrassment, retreat, and finally the search for a stranger in the back of a taxi, all pushed to a wonderfully lush score of Pino Donaggio, also scored Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the sequence, Angie slept with the boy and gets up to join her husband. Once again, De Palma teems with tons of stories without a word of dialogue, because Angie realizes that she has no panties, that her husband is already at home and that she wonders doubt where she is, that she has probably contracted a venereal disease. , and that she lost her engagement ring somewhere in the brewing. All of this is very admirable, but we start to feel a bit stuck when we have to do things like take a long elevator from the seventh floor, then again, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... Spoilers from now! When Angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a tall woman with blond hair. The woman leaves her until she reaches the ground floor, when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees it. There's a wonderful slow motion as Nancy reaches the elevator, Angie reaches out to her and the killer's blade is about to cut Nancy's hands. Then follow electrifying shots as Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the convex mirror of the elevators. Everything is fine, and by the time we have a dialogue again, you think; "Woah, it was just 22 consecutive minutes of purely visual storytelling!" <br /> <br /> A young Dennis Franz plays an important role as a sleazy and tough detective in New York who would prefer everyone to do his job for him. He questions Michael Caine, implicitly asserting (albeit trivial) that Angie WANTED is murdered. Angie's son is also present, and he has links with Nancy. They are preparing to spy on Caine's therapist and find out who the killer is. <br /> <br /> Once again, a Hitchcock film is closely related, in this case Psycho (just as Obsession is a reworking of Vertigo). You have a woman who, we suppose, is secretly a slut, who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space, in this case an elevator rather than a shower. Then, the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation which reveals that the murderer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill. De Palma even throws in the end a doctor who explains the psychology of the whole. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting, but at the same time, a spectator can start to feel a little jerky. This is my main concern about this movie. It is essential to watch and present some of the greatest masterpieces of De Palma, but the feeling that history is in a third place behind the need for De Palma to show his somewhat inappropriate sexual fantasies makes it hard to come back on this one with sincere Affection. <br /> <br /> --- Check out the other reviews on my site regarding bad and nerdy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
