I just returned from a screening a few hours ago and I was very happy with the movie when I left it. It's very intense and it's what I'm most afraid of for a while in a movie. This is a credit to Adam Sandler, who has achieved a magnificent performance on several levels and probably deserves an Oscar for this title, if he does not come out so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his superb usual performance by playing the heterosexual man to Adam's disturbed. <br /> <br /> There's a bit of humor, but most of it is really funny compared to the watery moments, while Adam manages his loss and Don has trouble helping him. Adam plays very well on two levels ... when he is mentally stable, he is funny and friendly, but when he is, well, less stable, he is powerful and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who loves intense mental drama about difficult friendship and loss.
