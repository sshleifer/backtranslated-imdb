I just watched this episode tonight, during a presentation recently added by one of our local independent channels, which now features two episodes every day of the week. <br /> <br /> Like the opinion of man in the other, previous comment here, I agree that this was perhaps not one of the best programs in the series, but I find it nonetheless fun. <br /> <br /> My dad was a friend of one of the directors (in my hometown, Cincinnati), Rod Serling had worked there in the media - and I remember Dad had told how he was known for his talent and creativity. Overall, "Twilight Zone" is certainly one of the great classics of television and, given its production at the height of the Cold War, offers not only a vision of that era in the country, but also (today ) a nostalgic image of the production techniques, creative views and actors of that era decades ago. <br /> <br /> * Minor "spoiler". * <br /> <br /> This particular story describes, as well as other presentations from this series and elsewhere, a story where the place is meant to provide a "surprise" ending. Sometimes the characters are on earth, coming from elsewhere, while the story implies that at least one of them is a "Terran". These usually contained the message (as here) of a situation caused by the buttons of the end of the world after finally being pressed by the superpowers during this period of the cold war. <br /> <br /> Seen today, stories like this give a nostalgic look to this worldly point of view, 4-5 years ago, and still provides some food for thought. - just like this episode. <br /> <br /> Although the dialogue may not have tested the considerable talents of the main actors, it nevertheless presents a simple and important message, as well as twenty valid minutes of entertainment and interest.
