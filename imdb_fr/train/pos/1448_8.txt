Across the country and especially in the political landscape, people with any political ambitions should take the time to see this film. The film is called "City Hall" and with little imagination, its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It turns out that this is happening in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician, Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino), who is knowledgeable enough to manage a large metropolitan city with very little effort. His right hand man is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an equally brilliant man whose ambitions are linked to his mentor and who both seemed destined to occupy high office. Everything goes in this direction, until a police shootout triggers an investigation led by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), who believes that the guilt is the responsibility of the mayor and the mayor. A six-year-old criminal and the death of a police officer are charged to a career criminal whose dubious liberty leads to apparent concealment by political gains and corruption in the city involving union leaders such as Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt judicial officials like Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia leaders like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Party officials, like Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff), who works for the New York probation office, are also involved. But it is the link between the mayor and his deputy who is put to the test by the accidental shot. An excellent vehicle for Cusack and a betting candidate sure to become a classic. ****
