The planning episodes were a little boring, but when they reached the desert, it was a lot of fun to watch. The reason I call the most realistic reality show is because, to my surprise, Charley pulled out of the race relatively early. When his hands were painful, I was expecting the usual stress, then a miracle, but instead, he left the race. The most distressing moment of the series had to be when Max was stuck in the desert without water or food! The end was excellent and I was very happy to see at least one member of the team succeed. Overall, it's not as good as the Long Way Round, but it's an interesting watch, as you take a look at the toughest race in the world.
