2 sisters and I watched Tenko's 3 series and we agree that this is by far one of the best series of the BBC. The whole cast was very convincing in the parts they described and although the 3 were the same without it. Do not doubt that we will watch it again because it is a series that I would never get tired of watching. Excellent viewing and lots of points at the BBC for such a brilliant series and casting.First speed in all departments and would recommend this series to everyone, although some age limits are to be considered because of the content reserved to adults. We thank the BBC for publishing this series on DVD and video.
