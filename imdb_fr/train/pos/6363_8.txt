As a child, I was a big fan of the series and then remembered one of those memorable caricatures that made the difference in the early '80s compared to previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Once Upon a Time). the Man ... which I like most). I find that other similar Japanese cartoons of this type, published later, can not match Mazinger Z because they started boringly repeating the same pattern. <br /> <br /> This very thing, the novelty, can be one of the best features of Mazinger Z. Another plus point is its inventiveness, with so many extravagant monsters, strange devices and weird characters. In fact, we were eager to see each new episode to find out what kind of new monster or diabolical machine was waiting for us!
