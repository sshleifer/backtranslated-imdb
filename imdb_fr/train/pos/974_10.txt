One of the best director Miike Takashi. It's so good that it's hard to put into words. At almost fifteen years older than the target audience, I was thrilled from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It recalls similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that (unlike today) these films were not afraid to scare - Initially, I found many unpleasant details, but I I soon realized that it was not different from what I grew up on. The film is a compilation of children's film conventions from the 80's. You call it, it's here: a young hero moves from his unhappy / dysfunctional world to another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force; he has a crush on a beautiful heroine; a sadistic maid (Go-Go Yubari of Kill Bill Vol.1); a master villain who derives his evil power from something that everyone in the world can understand. But all these genre conventions give a new twist and extra depth. <br /> <br /> One of IMDb's critics begins with "Where was this movie when I was little?" and it is a feeling with which I totally agree. Even looking at him, I deplored the fact that I did not grow up on it; that it was not part of my childhood like Labyrinth, Masters Of The Universe and, to a much lesser extent, The Neverending Story. These films, and others like The Goonies, are remembered but never copied - Miike constantly offers us a new vision of things. <br /> <br /> The poor CGI is one of the basic products of many of his films, sometimes due to budget constraints, but quite simply. so often an artistic choice - a desire to present things in a strange way. Here, the CGI is largely average, only due to budget constraints, but it does however a fantastic job of show. Synthetic effects combine with traditional puppets, animatronics and a truly extraordinary makeup to create a world filled with rich characters (and characterizations) that often border on the visionary. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest kids movies ever made. Not for younger or more sensitive children though. <br /> <br /> Simply breathtaking. See for yourself and if you think your children can handle / appreciate it, show it to them. Let them grow in Yokai's Great War, as a small compensation for the fact that you could not.
