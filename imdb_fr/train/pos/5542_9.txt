Probably the best image Producers Releasing Corp has ever made, this little horror piece gets the attention of the first to the last. The director Frank Wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and, more importantly, he knows how to realize all his shock potential on the screen. The plot and the characters are fascinating, but the scenery is absolutely out of this world! Almost all actions take place at night or in the middle of a thick and invasive fog. This frightening atmosphere is reinforced by Wisbar's creative direction and the convincing performances he has made of all his players. The beautiful Rosemary La Planche makes her an ideal, beautiful, spirited but vulnerable heroine. Robert Barrat presents his usual portrait of the local bigwig, no frills, although it is hard to believe that the handsome and charming guy who plays his son is none other than the writer / director of Dullsville, Blake Edwards.
