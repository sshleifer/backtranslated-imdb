I love ghost stories in general, but I particularly like the ghost stories of the British period, cold, atmospheric and elegantly scary. He is qualified on all levels. A young na√Øve lawyer ("lawyer" in English) is sent to a small village near the seaside to settle the estate of an elderly woman and deceased. We are in the 1920s, at a time when many middle-class Britons go on vacation at the seaside for "their health". Well, guess what, nothing is "healthy" in the village of Crythin Gifford, the terrifying site of the Victorian estate of the old woman, which is located on the edge of a salt marsh bathed in fog. When the lawyer saves the life of a little girl (none of the inhabitants of the region will help people in danger - you will understand why later in the film), he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit, the woman in black. She is not a thin film, a wet specter, but a solid black silhouette of mischief and mischief. The viewer only sees it a few times, but you feel its malevolent presence in each frame. As the camera goes up on the lawyer while reading legal documents, you expect to see the woman in black at all times. When the lawyer goes to the garage of the generator to put electricity in the old scary house, the camera looks at him and you think that it will also appear there. To wait until the woman in black comes to show herself is upsetting. We have already seen many elements of this story before (the locked room in which no one enters, the fog, a naive outsider who ignores the warnings of the locals), but the director manages to combine them into a completely new narrative ghost. Watch him with a friend so that you can have someone warm to grab while waiting for the woman in black. . .
