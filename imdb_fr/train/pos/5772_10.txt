I used to watch this show when I was a kid and I loved it! I watched it when it arrived on Toonami YEARS, a few years ago ... Sheesh, I look so old! I must have been 13 or 14 when it started ... But finally, there was a beautiful plot, and I'm one of those girls-girls who watched (and LOVED) Sailormoon, and I really liked . The animation was not the best ... actually, quite fun in some ways, and the dubbing was VERY lame at first, but it was a good watch and I found myself sucked up day after day. <Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic, and one of my favorites. Come on Ryo !!!!
