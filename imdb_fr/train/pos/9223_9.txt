Ashanti is a kind of film from the 70s (1979, to be precise). It made me think of Wild Geese (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on mission in Africa). It's also a very good movie, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a doctor working in Africa. He is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman, Anansa (Beverley Johnson), who has undergone training. in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While they are healing, one day she is abducted by slave traders working for an Arab slave trader called Suleiman (portrayed to perfection by Peter Ustinov). The rest of the movie is David trying to get it back. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a very determined character and ready to do anything to recover his wife, but rather hopeless with a gun and action tricks. He was first assisted by an English anti-slave activist (Rex Harrison!), Then briefly by a helicopter pilot (William Holden), then by an Arab called Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a goal to settle with Suleiman (he is very intense, it's a very engaging character), and so with David to find him and bring back Anansa. This is a wonderful scene in which David fails miserably to ride on his camel. . <br /> <br /> Then there is a lot of adventure. There are also a lot of moral issues. The progression of the story is a bit predictable from this point, and there are some freedoms to take to plot to get things done faster, but that's quite forgivable. The question is whether David will go to Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells it to Omar Sharif (yes, of course, Omar Sharif is there!)?
