It's the best and most original show seen in years. The more I look at it, the more I fall in love. The cast is excellent, the writing is great. Personally, I like all the characters. However, there is a favorite character for everyone because there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds, as in real life. I think that ABC has done a disservice to the writers, the actors and the potential audience of this show, to cancel so quickly and not to advertise it enough, or to give it a real chance to win an audience. There are so few programs that I watch more, because most TVs are awful. In my opinion, this show lived up to my favorites Grays Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for brothers and sisters would like this show if they already knew it. Why is it always the loser show that gets so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential are always immediately dropped. I'm so sick of reality shows that I do not care. It was so refreshing to have a new show idea and then to hire great actors, this show was so promising. The recent episode was the best so far, as everyone started to really get into their roles and make the show so real. Please watch this show on the ABC video and let ABC know you want to retrieve this show. PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION AT ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
