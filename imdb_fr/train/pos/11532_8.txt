Well, it was one of those movies I took by chance, and it was good enough for me to record when he came back next time ... If, like me, you like a lot of movies horror of the 80s that have spread a little bit of the norm (ie not just another glut of generic suites), so I think you'll enjoy it. When the villain finally arrived in person, he was certainly not what I expected! All in all, I would not bother you for this one, but if you like the genre, watch for it if it appears and you have an hour and a half to kill, I suppose. I would give 6.5 out of 10.
