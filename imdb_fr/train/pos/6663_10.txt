This movie is about a dysfunctional family but not any dysfunctional family. This is the family of the father of our nation (India), although the film focuses mainly on the relationship that goes out between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son, Harilal Gandhi. This shows how the Mahatma had to kill Mr. K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life to obtain our freedom. Whenever Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son tried to get closer, the Mahatma interposed between them. It's a beautifully made film. Akshaye Khanna has proved to be a major player. He expressed his emotions very naturally. Darshan Jariwala, lead actor of Plays-Gurukant Desai in Guru, has beautifully described Gandhi. to show how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son. This film is touching and its soundtrack "Raghupati Raghava" is sung in a very unique way. I saw this film barely 3 hours ago (it was released in Dubai a day earlier on the 2nd) and when the film was finished, there was "Pin Drop Silence". we Indians do not push?) NOT ONE! There was a sacred silence ...
