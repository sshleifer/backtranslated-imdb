It's a beautiful film visually. The images of the Mexican desert, the old manor, the characters in their picturesque costumes ... all this is a true work of art. <br /> <br /> The story seems a little loose, but that's because it does not mean being realistic. It is taken from a book entitled "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and is supposed to evoke the isolated and supernatural atmosphere of Latin America "so far from God and so close to the United States". Erendira's enormous debt to his grandmother is emblematic of Latin America's international debt burden, even though there are several levels of significance. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a slow motion movie with lots of textures, this one is for you.
