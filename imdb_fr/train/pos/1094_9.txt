It's one of the few comedies that I can watch over and over again and burst out laughing. In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism in sneaky, politically correct words. There is no here either, unless you define sexism as a woman as a housewife and racism as a family employing a colorful maid. <br /> <br /> The lines are hilarious and all tracks have never been better. Melvin Douglas is particularly brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you have ever considered or attempted to build a new home, you will be relieved to know that no matter the process, the process is annoying, no matter how many wolves you may feel, you will are not alone!
