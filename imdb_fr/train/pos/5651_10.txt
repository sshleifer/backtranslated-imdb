It was a bit odd and perverse and I enjoyed it a lot, the characters in the series were also excellent and complimented each other well. I was sorry to see him cut .. I would have liked to see where he could have gone. You ended up leaning towards Sheriff Lucas Buck who had more secrets than anyone. Lucas was scary and seductive. And I would have liked to see more of him and how his character became. I will buy the show just to enjoy it, it was great to see something different on TV. And Paige Turrco who was Caleb's cousin, she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant for Lucas. It's a shame that he is not still in place ... or has never been finished, I would have loved to see what would have happened.
