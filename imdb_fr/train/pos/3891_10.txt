One of the best comedians of all time. I have seen this show about 10 times and I will probably watch at least 100 others. My friends and family so often cite this DVD that you would think we did nothing but watch it. The first part on Alcatraz is a little slow, but you can go through it or go to the part where Eddie is on stage. Watch out for "Cake or Death" and "Hitler / Pol Pot" (hard to explain, just watch it). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expressions. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner and eye shadow probably help, huh?) Just warning: Eddie tends to throw a lot of four-letter words.
