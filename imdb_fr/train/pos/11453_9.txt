The filmmaker has inspired Andy Goldsworthy's artwork, his quest for proximity to the land and water, and his sense of proportion - and does it so sweetly, so beautifully, that the film was inspired by the rest Population. "Rivers and Tides" loves Goldsworthy's work and joins him as a visual concert of time and human presence in a fluid world, a world that hides its power in plain view. See this movie!
