It's the biggest film I saw in 2002, when I'm used to mainstream movies. He is rich and makes a very beautiful artistic act of these 11 short films. According to the technical information (the directors chosen), I feared that it had an anti-American base, but ... it's a kind of personal tribute (11 times). <br /> <br /> The weakest point comes from Y Chahine: he can not "swallow his pride" and considers this event a well-deserved punishment ... It's really the weakest part of the film, but it shows real freedom of expression for the entire play. The strangest thing comes from the mexican Mexican conceptual art film ... I'm still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. The other 9 are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me smile, cry or even be stunned. I still do not know if the fable of S. Imamura is really related or not to the disaster of September 11, but it is so pretty that its final place makes it "deeply".
