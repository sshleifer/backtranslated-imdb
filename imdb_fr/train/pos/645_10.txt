I hate French films too talkative, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and most talkative French film of all. I saw him twice in the mid-70s, and then he disappeared. But I finally saw him again in 1999 and fell in love again. What is most remarkable is that it feels just as fresh today as it was 25 years ago. If you have not seen it, do not miss your chance!
