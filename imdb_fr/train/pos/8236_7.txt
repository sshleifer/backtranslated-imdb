Due to the invention of the "domestication collar", flesh-eating zombies are mastered and become productive members of society; However, they perform subordinate tasks. The servile dead assist those living in 1950s-style American small towns, while untamed zombies roam the "Wild Zone". In "Willard", pre-adolescent K'Sun Ray (as Timmy Robinson) lives with his parents, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Dylan Baker (as Helen and Bill Robinson). Alas, Robinson is the only family on their street who does not own a zombie; their new neighbors, the Bottoms, have six. So, to continue, the Robinsons get the zombie Billy Connolly (under the name of Fido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "Collier de Domestication" is damaged by an old lady, and he eats it; then, new hungry zombies infest the city. Meanwhile, young Ray has become attached to Connolly (the boy and his zombie look like "Timmy and Lassie" on television) and the Robinson family is struggling to cooperate with the "Zomcom" control authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" does not go far enough in his own intriguing "Wild Zone"; but, it is a colorful, elegant and amusing addition to the zombie film tradition. Ray and the cast work well, individually; with sonja Bennett (under the name of Tammy) and her owner Tim Blake Nelson (under the name of Theopolis), the most memorable couple. Director Andrew Currie and his team, including Rob Gray (drawing), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (drawing), have been rightly awarded. <br /> <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker.
