I think it's probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. Robert Harling's script is almost perfect, check out the "quotes" section; on reflection, just rent the DVD, because it is the delivery that really makes the replicas sing. <br /> <br /> Sally Field gives a comical and disproportionate performance like you've never seen elsewhere and Kevin Kline is effortlessly hilarious. Robert Downey, Jr. is usually brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a riot as a beleaguered client. I've never been a big fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she's great here as a real * person * surrounded by a multitude of cartoon characters on the set of "The Sun Also Sets" - which resonates Beneath you is Hemingway rolling in his grave. Either that, or he laughs very hard. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
