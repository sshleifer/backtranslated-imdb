For Columbo fans, like me, this is the episode episode that explained why Columbo was so popular and how good it was. Ruth Gordon spends a day on the ground (as always) with the novelist Abigail Mitchell, a crime novelist who demonstrates spiritual intelligence. It seems that Abigail calls his nephew to sign papers transforming him into his heir. She never overcame her niece's death and is convinced that the husband of her dead niece (Charles Frank) has committed the dirty act. To say more would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley has a devious role as a personal assistant to Abigail. This episode of Columbo is in a class of its own. It's a really good TV movie. I highly recommend it.
