Kazan's first black film won an Oscar. Some of the criticisms presented here deal in great detail with the film and its symbolism and give it a very high score. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer to take a more moderate approach to a long-forgotten film, which seems to have been shot with virtually no budget and almost documentary. Pneumonic plague rages in the streets of New Orleans. It is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to apprehend the main carrier (Palance). The film is dark, shot in black and white and makes a very good use of the place. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the symbolism (the crime is equal to the disease, and the disease is equal to the crime) and just enjoy the hunt. It is not always easy to watch a film like this now that we are well into this new century because it is a particular style that has been short-lived (from the early Second World War) 1950s) and will be of little interest to casuals. movie observer. For those who will be watching this for the first time, sit down for the big chase at the end. It's something else and, frankly, I do not know how they filmed it. I can say that the final probably took as long as the first 90% of the film.
