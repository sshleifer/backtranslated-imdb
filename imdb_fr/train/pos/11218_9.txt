This anime is a must for Evangelion fans. Anno Hideaki is an earlier work, but his dramatic and unrestrained style is quite in place. In addition, those who did not like Evangelion could find this version a bit more acceptable. Gunbuster is rather unique for sci-fi cartoons as it is based on real science. In fact, the series contains several small "Science Lesson" interludes explaining the physics behind certain film events. One of the dramatic points of the film is the relative passage of time at a speed close to that of light. The series does a remarkable job in dealing with the traumatic experience imaginable of leaving Earth for a six-month mission leading to a speed close to that of light and returning to a land where ten years have passed. The main character remains aged 17 or 18 throughout the series, while almost all other characters age considerably. Be warned, this show is sometimes heavy on the sap. He also has a couple of the most totally undeserved chest shots I have ever seen. I found it fairly easy to ignore skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, as the series is also very good, but viewers with low tolerance to sap might want to stay away from it. On an interesting note, Gainax, as always, managed to run out of money in the last two episodes. However, they managed to use black and white movies and action sketches to get a good resolution. The end is a little silly, but it gave me such a good feeling that I could not help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful pieces of Anime.
