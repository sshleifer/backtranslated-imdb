First of all, I would like to say that, even though I know my share of Star Wars, I am not a fanatic. I do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp rat has or the extended family of TK427. What I know is this: Star Wars, all the movies (less with episode 2 though), have captured something magical. It's hard to say what, what button Lucas found and supported boldly, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. it is an idea. <br /> <br /> How, can you ask? I am going to explain. Star Wars touches the most universal of stereotypes, the good against the bad. it does so so obviously, so deeply, that anyone in the literal sense of the world can understand. Episode VI succeeds very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his father used and manipulated, but also, with the addition of prequels, reveals even more history. Suddenly, it's Darth Vader at the front, and viewers realize that this is the story of Anakin, not just Luke. but even before 1-3, there was an incredible depth to all this. it seemed real, as if the capsule fell from the sky on Lucas' lap, describing in detail a historical account of a very distant galaxy. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is definitely something well above the norm, and I must admit, Whenever I see them, especially this one, I feel very small. I feel immersed in a world where good and bad are clearly defined. I feel tingling when I see them, the feeling that something has touched me more than anything physics could hope for.
