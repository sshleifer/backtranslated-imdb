This film was a classic. I must say that this film captured the best of a man who learns from his mistakes. if we could all hear and learn in the same way as everyone else in this film. It was important to show that family is an important part of life and that pride can make you lose something important in life if we can not find the "GREAT THROAT" and we are proud to swallow you .
