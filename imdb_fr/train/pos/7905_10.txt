I am really sorry for the people who go to the movies with a notebook and a pencil to note their faults and keep a note on the gravity of a film. I feel the same contempt for people who go to the movies and CAN NOT suspend the reality and / or be 90 minutes away from their boring or busy life! Get a GRIP people. ECGTB is a very entertaining film. If you take the movies seriously, it's not for you. If you expect the movie to look like the book in any way, it's not for you. But if you liked the absolute hilarity of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, or "what the hell am I watching" the Moulin Rouge. Or the big comedy of "The Sweetest Thing" Then let escape to Cowgirls. It has some really fun parts. Hilarious actually. There is also very good music; bravo to kd.lang. So did I mention that he has 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ..... should I say more?
