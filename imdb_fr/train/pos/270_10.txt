I must say that Seventeen & Missing is much better than I expected. The perception that I retained in the overviews is that it is a little monotonous, but I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, a mom who insists that her daughter Lori (Tegan Moss), does not attend a graduation party a week week, but Lori ignores the wishes of his mother and leave for the party anyway. When Lori does not come home, Emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance. <br /> <br /> Seventeen and missing are better than so many other TV movies of this type, as it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie, and most of them are believable. This original LMN movie was created last night. 10/10
