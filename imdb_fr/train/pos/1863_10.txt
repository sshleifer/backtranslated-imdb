ANTWONE FISHER tells the story of a young US Navy sailor with emotional disorders. His problems lead him to Jérôme Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him to realize that his problems stem from his childhood. <br /> <br /> Prepare to shed a tear or two. The film could thaw the coldest heart. I loved the story, which goes from something so terrible to anyone in a positive end. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful film, mainly about forgiveness. Child abuse, adoption and foster care are other important themes. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner, Denzel Washington has done an impressive job since his debut as a director. There were a lot of scenes that I liked to watch. They included the beginning (dreams of a little boy, go see the gigantic pancakes!) And the end (dreams have come true), who have beautifully knotted the story. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged Antwone to search for her family to find answers to her questions about her family who had abandoned her. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene occurred when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction to her. Invaluable. <br /> <br /> All actors have well represented their roles. <br /> <br /> In addition to his responsibilities as a director, Mr. Washington continues to show why he won an Oscar and has succeeded in all his roles as an actor. He was very present in this film. <br /> <br /> The actor, Derek Luke, explained why he was so right for the role of Antwone Fisher. He portrayed a very real work and touching the heart. <br /> <br /> Joy Bryant who played Cheryl, Antwone's love interest, looked like a ray of sunshine on the screen. Chemistry has flowed well between the romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson who played the role of Ms. Tate, a despicable character, deserves special mention. <br /> <br /> Although we only saw her for a few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother gave an outstanding performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
