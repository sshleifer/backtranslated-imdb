All that a musical should be. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) does not miss a step and Frank Sinatra (like Clarence Doolittle) does not miss a note. The scenes with them are very good, showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven scenario. Sinatra "I fall in love too easily" is an indication of his best at the time and his future. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" with a Mexican girl is lovely. Kelly certainly earned his nomination as a best actor. And there's a bushel of really funny lines, like, "Do you think the navy is taking the dopes?" "Do you think someone sings a sailor to sleep?" and, "We had a little problem, we picked up a small child." A really nice film, ideal to get rid of the dust of a Second World War that just ended.
