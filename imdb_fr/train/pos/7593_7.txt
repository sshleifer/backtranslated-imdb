The movie is absolutely stupid. <br /> <br /> But did you expect a high quality intellectual movie based on a cartoon called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's game is not the most moving thing I've ever seen, but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it about as impressive as someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? Not really. Was it really entertaining if you took it to the surface value? Absolutely. It's a movie about Chinese idols and musicians able to play basketball with a level of unreal expertise. There's an evil guy in the Triad and a goofy glider that involves Jay Chou in all of this. A love interest. It's a formula, but really, suspend disbelief for a moment. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you signed? Do yourself a favor if you look at it - I ended up with a copy with some English subtitles that made the movie almost wise, but we laughed at it. They seemed extremely attached to Jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I rushed. I will watch it again. <br /> <br /> Especially for this fight scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I particularly appreciate the billiard table lit in Plexiglas. I would love to play on one of them. <br /> <br /> Pretty smooth for me, but I really like trashy movies.
