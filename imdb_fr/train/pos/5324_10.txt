Having just watched this movie after a showing of VH-1 in 1998, I had only comments to make. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this film on television, it was around 1981 and I remember to have recorded it. betamax from my mother. He ended up filming in black and white for some reason, which gave him a vintage look that I liked a lot more. <br /> <br /> I remember very well the movie starting with the song "My Bonnie", Panoramic Camera on a Liverpool Stage. I also remember the opening scene where Paul waved to girls and said, "Look, talent!" So it was with great irritation that I jumped into my recorded version of 1998 and that I "remembered" that the film begins with "She Loves You", instead of "My Bonnie". When you see the slowness of the camera in relation to the speed of the music, you may find that "she loves you" just does not fit. Also, in this "later" version, when Paul sees the girls, he says, "Look, GIRLS!" ... and, one way or another, after remembering the previous version, this word did not seem to fit either. I do not understand why they felt that they should Americanize this film for the American public. Personally, if I watch a film about a British band, I want all of the British colloquialisms to be part of their speech, their manners, and so on. <br /> <br /> Another irritant was how. "choppy" editing was for television. Just after Stu beats, for example, the film turns into a massive commercial break. Yes, I know it depends on the network, but it really destroys the effect of a movie cutting it into pieces, as we all know. What some people might find insignificant in terms of dialogue (and thus change their animation) could actually explain how to explain a particular action or scene that follows. <br /> <br /> The essential is the "best" The version of this film was probably the previous version I recorded in 1981 and that included the scene "Shake, Rattle & Roll", unlike to my version of 1998. I started to think that there must be two different versions designed for television and a link to the link "alternative versions" about this film showed me that I was right. The fact that the American version has scenes and / or dialogues shorter / cut / different disappoints me enormously and deserves to be mentioned if we care about these things. For now, it is best to try to get hold of the European version of this film, if possible, and (probably even less), an unpublished version. Unfortunately, I had to give up my old European version of betamax because I did not know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> All that aside, I found that this film was perhaps one of the best movies in the world. story behind the "birth of the Beatles". Aware of the fact that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and television to represent events in history, I have not let any anomaly spoil my enjoyment with the film. Of course, you see the Beatles performing Cavern songs that made me wonder, "Did they even write that at the time, I do not think so," but, nevertheless, I thought it was an excellent movie and the performances, wonderful. <br /> <br /> The actor who starred in John, Stephen MacKenna, really made the difference. I almost fell in love with him. His look, his mannerisms, his personality and his voice seemed to be perfect. He looked like a young John enough for me to double-tap towards the end of the movie when you see the Beatles playing for Ed Sullivan for the first time. I actually wondered if it was real pictures of the Beatles or not, until I saw the other actors on the stage. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an accurate and dead history of the Beatles' life and debut, you can not do better than "The Anthology of the Beatles" as it was "written" by the boys themselves -Same. However, if you're looking for a fun snapshot of their pre-Beatlemania days before they arrive in America and you leave your critical anal reviews at the door, you can not go wrong with "The Birth of the Beatles" - a MUST for any "real" or casual Beatles fan.
