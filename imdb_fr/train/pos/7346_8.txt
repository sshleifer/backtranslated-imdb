When I saw this animation for the first time (I was maybe 15 years old), I was really impressed! He has a completely different style of Japanese animation and I love him a little more. The general impression of the film is more sinister and dark ... The colors are not so ... colorful. The characters do not speak much, there are no long and boring conversations about this or that (as in Ghost in the Shell). With his dark images, his sights on strange beasts and his sense of magic, it looks like one of those ancient stories, full of violence and appalling creators, enchanted forests and deep caves, inhabited by dragons, throlls, orks ... and a mysterious hero to stop evil. ..
