A well-done but fundamentally monotonous low-life melodrama which, according to the interview of the principal director Isabelle Huppert, scriptwriter / director Pialat, infused many autobiographical details; given the mostly unfriendly characters involved, this does not make him any compliment - and he seems to have been a troubled man, because Huppert also says that Pialat often went missing for days while filming! <br /> <br /> The acting game is consistently excellent, however; Despite their relatively young age, Huppert and his teammate Gerard Depardieu (as a main character) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status that, with varying success, remains the same today. <br /> <br /> I have 3 other Pialat films in my pile of "VHS to watch", all in French without English subtitles; Because of this fact, but also the oppressive realism of LOULOU - despite its undeniable artistic merit - I can not say that I am particularly eager to watch them now ...
