It's a funny movie. It contains all the usual components of Disney (music, wide variety of characters, story, call), intertwined with superb animation and the excellent vocal talents of less known actors such as those of "Antz" and "Price of Egypt". <BR /> <br /> The characters work really well and have a powerful appeal, and the humor is addressed to a large level that overcomes generational barriers. The film is also presented in a superb cinemascope format, which adds a cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I have seen the movie three times, and I plan to take more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics saw this movie on my recommendation and were not disappointed. I work in a multiplex and I can honestly say that no one has ever released this film without a sense of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> See it and do not get discouraged because it's animated. You are sure to enjoy this movie and stay in the final credits! The bloopers and the shots at the end are the funniest part of the movie, which is full of laughter.
