This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The original drum and bass. <br /> <br /> There seem to be very few Who's movies in recent days, so it's all the more we see it, nowadays it tends to be a whole different kind of Who, a parody, a shadow of their (much) better years. To be fair, none of them have to prove anything to anyone, they earned their respect and saved them time. <br /> <br /> This concert sequence is for me one of the best. To capture an audience of about 400,000 people requires talent, charisma, wit and a lot of damn good music. <br /> <br /> We all know the other laws on the bill, The Doors (their last several weeks before the death of Jim Morrison), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many others. The fact is that whoever was there was the Who that the majority came to see. This show was a year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960s; Woodstock. The film and the recording were out, along with Tommy, The Who's biggest work to date. The always hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to live its own event, to be able "Grove and Love" knowing that this concert was theirs. To do this, you need the best of what Rock'n'roll had to throw at the avidly baited crowd. <br /> <br /> At two o'clock in the morning, at the end of August 1970, the MC announces, "Ladies and Gentlemen, a little rock'n'roll band from Shepherds Bush London, the" OO John Entwistle's suit is black leather, at the front, at the edge of a human skeleton from the neck to the toes, Roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit composed of Long tassels and long flowing hair, Keith wearing a white t-shirt and jeans, while Pete had his white boiler suit and Doc Martins he had preferred to wear. <br /> <br /> The Who never stopped their offensive against High Energy Rock for more than two hours, performing their greatest artist titles, such as Young Man Blues, Shaking 'All Over, and then queuing, Keith baiting on "Shut up, it's a bleeding opera" with Tommy, the Rock Opera, the crowd went wild, that's what they came to hear, and the Who did not disappoint, say in Overture and never look for air until the final note of "Tommy, can you hear me?" Incredible. <br /> <br /> Capturing a show of this magnitude from a group of this magnitude at its peak at a Festival that would be the last of its kind in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematographic history. <br /> <br /> The English DVD is provided only in a stereo soundtrack / PC Stereo, as in the United States, you can get it at least in 5.1, check the local press for more details? on that, all right. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes without supplements, which is disappointing. Yes, for a part of the history of rock and festivals, this DVD would plunge you into a nostalgic journey when you rely on reading, to listen to some of the best concert recordings of Who as they were supposed to be, Live, Raw and in the Face! <br /> <br /> I would have given ten DVDs to this DVD if there had not been the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been good. <br /> <br /> Thanks Roger, Pete, John and Keith
