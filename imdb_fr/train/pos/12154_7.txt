Yes, a clapper horror thriller ........ with Shelley and Debbie! Goody Goody. It's crazy and campy fun that's part of the 60's Guignol cycle that had infiltrated in the 70's. Directed in duplicate in Burt Reynolds' comedy FUZZ, this crazy freak is crazy enough to be really entertaining. As a mix of DAY OF THE LOCUST, ANOTHER and BABY JANE, I suggest to any prospective viewer to accept the idea that this is almost supposed to be asymmetrical and sit down with someone you can scream with and sew throughout the action. In fact, get drunk while you watch ... on cheap champagne. Again, with many film ideas in their thirties, they also deal with illusions; the struggle of time for a better life becoming bitter and twisted by emotional madness falling into murder. But this one is just crazy. It also reminds me a lot of BLOODY MAMA, the shlock festival De Niro - Winters, which gives this film a truly glorious aspect.
