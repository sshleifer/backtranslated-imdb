This movie was excellent, I thought the original was rather mediocre. This one, however, has all the ingredients, a 1970 Hemi Challenger factory with 4-speed transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar has built the best muscular cars! I was in Chrysler's paradise every time Kowalski laid that big Hemi block, and he certainly did it a lot :)
