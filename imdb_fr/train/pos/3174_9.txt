Very rarely, we meet an independent comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare jewel. The screenwriter not only took up the challenge of directing his own work, but also presented a hilarious show as an evil roommate. The screenplay takes an interesting look not only at the fate of the struggling writer, but so much comedy in the writer's sorry world that you can not help but commit yourself to Ernie's character. Very funny things. Despite the small budget, Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious aspect. He's not kidding when it comes to making a good movie. I can not wait to see what he will do next. This guy can make you laugh and think. It is special.
