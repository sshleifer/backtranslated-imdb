The Ladies Man is funny laughing, with a very varied cast and very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written). <br /> <br /> Ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant secondary role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays amazingly well for an idiot and has written himself some of the funniest lines you can find in any comedy. <br /> <br /> This is really worth a purchase that looks at it every 6 months or so will make you laugh as hard as you did the first time. <br /> <br /> I'm upset to think at the time of writing this that he has a lean 4.7 / 10 and I urge you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember the kids - "There is more movement in the ocean"
