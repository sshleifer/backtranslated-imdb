I loved this movie and, after watching it, I wondered how much there was "Caitlin Rose" in the world. How many other girls have been subjected to this type of sexual abuse and torment on the part of their classmates and are too afraid to open their mouths about it? How threatening and cruel are the teenagers to each other, because, as this film shows, who is right does not matter, who is popular and who fears manipulating the spirits? young people and inciting them to let this kind of immorality happen Tiffani Amber Thiessen gives a powerful performance as a rape victim, and Brian Austin Green is convincing as a torn guy between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend. This is the kind of film that does not get the visibility Remarkable, and brilliant, too good to be a movie made for television.
