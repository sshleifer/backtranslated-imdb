I really like this movie ... when I started to watch it, I thought I would get bored pretty fast, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a good movie and I've seen it many times before The characters are credible and I must say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green (the first time was Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this film if you are one of his fans, but I agree with another comment made earlier, namely that the end is a little disappointing. I wish it were a little different! No matter, good story captivating.
