I have a two-year-old son who is in the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I have never had the opportunity to meet him, but I have never heard anyone say a negative word about him. I hope he knows how much the creation of this program helped his companions in misfortune by raising awareness of this terrible situation. This man touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not. I think it should be mandatory in schools. I also agree with other comments - what should I complain about? He took everything life could give him and still managed to retain his sense of humor. God protects you. I could not look at the part that showed that her bandages were changed. I have enough problems with my son.
