I finally realized to see this after hearing great things about it. He actually exceeded my expectations. Given the budget, it was a surprisingly competent and well done movie. The lack of financial resources actually helped this film in several ways, especially given the plot. Like the Blair Witch project, this film was all better shot on video than on film. Another bonus: while most low budget horror movies (even the best of the best) suffer from a mediocre to unintentionally hysterical game, this movie actually had a talented cast (except one or two characters), in especially the two main roles. The only thing missing in the film was an original script. He borrows heavily from more famous films such as "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn", but if you're like me, movies of this nature never cease to be terrifying. In addition, the director keeps things interesting throughout. I would be very interested to see what the director would do with a larger budget and I have the impression that it will only be a matter of time before we find out ...
