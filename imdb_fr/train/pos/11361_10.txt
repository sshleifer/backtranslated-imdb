Although I saw this film years ago, its impact never left me. Stephen Rea's portrayal of an invader is profound and moving. His anguish at not being able to stop the dead is palpable. Everyone in the cast is terrific from Sutherland, who tries to welcome him and provide the police with ways to coordinate their efforts, for the troubled citizen x. Every day, when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers, I think of this film and the exhausting work that people are doing trying to find the killers.
