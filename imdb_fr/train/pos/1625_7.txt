A surprisingly good movie! There are some good jokes throughout the movie. The only negative is that some scenes go to extremes to show how stupid the two main characters are. We understood, stupid blondes, let's take action! <br /> <br /> The plot hardly avoids being called "corny". And the crazy are always an advantage, although the film for a strange reason does not play with this card even if the plot shows two women with black hair who act as the perverse part of our two blondes. /> In short, a good movie to watch. I almost gave him a 8/10, but let's not be crazy.
