Clint Eastwood resumes his role as Dirty Harry, which this time concerns the case of a vigilante (Sondra Locke) who kills the people who raped her and her sister during a carnival many years ago. Eastwood does his and the movie is mostly more action than talking, not that I'm complaining. Suddenly Impact is indeed a pleasant entertainment.
