One of the most provocative films of all time with excellent cinematography supported by Mc Clarens and an astonishing quote: "Do you believe in love at the first site?" <br /> <br /> A trace of expressionism was evident in this image catapulting films flawless integrity. Gabby (AKA Joey) played by Eva Longoria clearly liked the film and the role she played so much that she was not even bothered to mention it in her filmography. Lol. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film should be without a doubt, MC Clure's heroic rescue as he rescued the young child 'Handicapped' with the hurdle of speech. acted to perfection! James Cahiil's use of sound effects is unmatched, even to this day. The collapse of the drug he makes at the beginning of the film is extremely realistic. When I watched this film for the first time, I was so impressed by the blatant lack of respect for the Southside Gang Inthused brothers and CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). This is by far one of the most cumbersome crevasses that Cahill has committed to filming. <br /> <br /> Personally, this film has a sentimental value for me and I will download it in the near future. That's if I can find it anywhere, LOL!
