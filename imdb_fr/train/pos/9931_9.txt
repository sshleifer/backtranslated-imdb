I rented domino on a whim, not even knowing it was based on a true story, and even if it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see. I found it quite impressive. <br /> <br /> With Richard Kelly's writing, he mixes a wealth of intrigues and stories in 2 hours of pure entertainment. And once you've seen it more than once, you get it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect life in Hollywood to pursue a career not so subtle or perfect. It has an irritating acid travel style provided by director Tony Scott. And thanks to its fast music and editing, it offers the visual ability to hold your attention, with subtle performances and unexpected comedy, the film is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I suggest it to all those who want to think and entertain at the same time for 2 hours.
