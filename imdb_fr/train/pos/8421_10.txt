Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent Hollywood and the former imperial general to the Russian tsar who was there. Emil Jannings won a well deserved Oscar, in part, for his role as a general who, ironically, is part of the silent picture of a Russian general. The film goes back to his days in Russia, leading to the fall of the country to the revolutionaries. William Powell debuts on the big screen as a Hollywood director who plays Jannings in his film. The film offers an interesting look at the fall of Russia and a backstage imitation of Tinseltown in its infancy. Von Sternberg offers yet another classic, filled with great elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
