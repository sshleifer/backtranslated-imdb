The film focuses mainly on the intimidation of Robert Taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and on the people who have to endure it. Located in the middle of a dwindling buffalo hunt, it illustrates the end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter and is full of tragedies and remorse for buffaloes and Native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of Indians and his naivety that buffalo herds never disappear. In one scene, he shoots animal on animal, while in another, he murders Indians, then eats the food they had cooked on the fire. Beneath this merciless exterior hides an insecure man who is forced to beg his comrades (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. This is not the most enjoyable of movies and is weighed down by the drama it creates, leading to a dark and very appropriate conclusion in a snowstorm.
