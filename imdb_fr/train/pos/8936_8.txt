After "Beau travail", everyone was waiting for Claire Denis to create a follow-up masterpiece that would never have happened. Now he has. Denis takes a leap forward in this film, an orgy of beautiful images, elliptical montages and obscuring narrative events, which feel strange and even strange. There is a symbolic plot (partly taken from the Jean-Luc Nancy book of the same name) about a middle-aged man who needs a heart transplant and is looking for a long-abandoned Tahitian son. but it is above all an exploration of the idea of ​​personal and cultural intrusions. It takes a few viewings to understand and rhythm problems are close to the end, but they are always more advanced and captivating than anything I've seen this year. Miss at your own risk.
