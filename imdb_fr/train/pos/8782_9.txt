Slightly inspired by James J Corbett's biography "The Roar of the Crowd", Gentleman Jim is a wonderfully airy image that perfectly sums up not only the rise of the pugilist prowess that is Corbett, but also the wind of change in regards the sport of boxing. circa 1890. <br /> <br /> The story follows Corbett {a Errol Flynn} perfectly shot from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in San Fransico, to a random fight with a former boxing champion which will eventually lead him to him. fighter the world's toughest heavyweight champion, John L Sullivan {beefcake personified with delight by Ward Bond}. Not all fights are in the ring, and all the vignettes of Corbett's life make it a great and entertaining image. There are class problems to overcome here (perfectly played since the other members of the club pay for it to be overthrown), and Corbett must not only fight for the respect of his so-called peers, but he must also overcome his ego. as he grows up as fast as his reputation. With Corbett's marvelous family and stoic humorous support, Corbett's journey is exciting, joyful, audacious and as daring as he is; he is a character who is suited to the tag. Gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> The film never falters for a moment, and director Raoul Walsh testifies that even though we look forward to the last fight, the outer rings hold us firmly amused, even the sub-plot of love interest does not hurt this photo {thank you Alexis Smith}. The fighting sequences are going very well, and they perfectly show how Corbett became the champion, his brand of round-robin and slugger fighters is now firmly in the boxing history. At the end of the last turn, we all arrive on Earth as a post-fight meeting between Sullivan and Corbett, which puts all the brutality in context. This is where humility and humility become the absolute winners, and as long as this viewer goes ... .......... it will be enough for me to be sure, 9/10 for a really wonderful picture.
