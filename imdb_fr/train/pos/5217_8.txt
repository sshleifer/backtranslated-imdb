I caught this movie late at night on the cable and was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine the reason why this film was not better known is because the subject is very disturbing. But if you can handle the subject of sexual abuse, it's a well-played, suspenseful and very interesting movie. Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good in this area. And although the subject treated is not for sensitive souls, the film does not fail to be brutal (like the 8 mm for example). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who loves killer series and suspense-type movies.
