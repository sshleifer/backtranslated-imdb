John Roach / Mary Sweeney's film by David Lynch (1999) takes place in Iowa and Wisconsin well before the film's release. <br /> <br /> We enter the life of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) late in life. His health is mediocre, his life is usually behind him and he knows it. <br /> <br /> That makes what he decides to do even more remarkable and endearing. He decides (and at every moment in the film his own name resonates through his actions) to put a few things in the clear. <br /> <br /> Alvin is, at this time of his life, a man of great experience but modest mean. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) has a speech problem that makes communication very difficult for the public. But it's worth it, because the story of Rose can not help but appear as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> This film tells the story of a trip. But like all travels, it is a journey in the geographical sense and the human sense. At the beginning of the film, we begin to understand that it is an ambitious journey, that no old man of the same age should reasonably undertake. <br /> <br /> But on the way, we are slowly learning how much Alvin has so many skills that equip him to achieve his unlikely goal. His goal is very simple and straightforward. His brother is sick and is at risk of dying and wants to visit him. He got confused with him many years ago and they have not talked to each other for a very long time. <br /> <br /> On the way, Alvin meets a lot of people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they derive from having known him is the essence of this film. We get to know who Alvin Straight is, according to Alvin Straight. And at the end of the film, we know who we are ... better.
