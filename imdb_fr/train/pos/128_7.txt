Von Trier has already explained how he has inspired such a spectator's involvement in his films by placing his cinematographic world roughly in the middle of the real world and the imaginary world. So, as viewers, we think we are looking at a "true" story when we are in fact completely manipulated, often to the point that the movie works disturbing (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (Idiots / Idioterne). Of course, the Dogme films served only as a vehicle for this theory (in addition to giving a welcome spotlight to Von Trier). <br /> <br /> The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance his relationship with everyone, but quickly becomes a victim of the problems that others have created in the past. The idealist must inevitably reject society to remain idealistic and become the terrorist. Humanity is spoiled and purity only leads to (self) destruction. (These elements were also very present in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The film is also full of cynical nuances (even humorous) about the role of Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. <br /> <br /> As a technical realization, the film is wonderfully designed: changing and faded colors, overlays of screens, action on several overlays (with the filming of the next mayor as the most interesting). In this film, we can see how much the Von Trier film is a technical support. In his later works, he seems to give up on this (as if he was no longer interested in technical achievements, because they became so easily available).
