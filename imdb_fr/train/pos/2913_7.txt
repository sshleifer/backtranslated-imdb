"This Man's Navy" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and well-filmed look at the lighter-than-air (LTA) Navy activities. The crews of the LTA were justifiably proud that the convoys they were watching never lost a ship under the attack of the submarine. And filming in the various NAS sites gives a valuable insight into a type of aviation that has long since disappeared. However, the first half of the film is devoted entirely to Beery, his relationship with his service buddies and his meeting with Tom Drake and his mother, as well as the repair of Drake's leg. Only then, the second film begins. The second film is mainly composed of long-acting actors, who are fighting a submarine that has surfaced, the guys are killed and a lot of damage is done. The look is quite sober and realistic, I guess. We then move to Southeast Asia. Did the navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part is really wild, with an airship used to extract an air crew shot from the jungle. And the Japanese are shooting like crazy. Shades of Vietnam, except that the escape is oh, so quiet. It's an airship we're talking about. In the end, a WWII drama on an unusual part of the war.
