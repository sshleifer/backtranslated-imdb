Okay, Robbie looks a little hokey by today's standards, and some of the acting role is rather scalded, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12-year-old boy with a decent computer editing program. And do not talk to me about the poster. <br /> <br /> It's STILL a good movie, 40 years after its release. I grew up watching "science fiction" on the Sunday afternoon of the "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" of the local television channel. So I saw a lot of SF movies from the 50s. At a time when most movies just slapped a rubber suit and had it demolished a miniature city model, Forbidden Planet has always raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a sci-fi movie with a plot. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many SF films made in the 90s are still considered interesting to watch in 2030.
