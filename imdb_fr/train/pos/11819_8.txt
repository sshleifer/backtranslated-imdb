I just took this on DVD and watch it again. I like bright colors and dark images. Not a big fan of Beatty, but it's a great popcorn movie. Pacino is amazing, as always, and well, this movie marked the time when Madonna was her sexiest. I wish she was stuck with the "Out of Breath" look longer. The first big role of Charlie Korsmo, other than "And Bob?". The effects of makeup were at the forefront and still held most of the time. Beautiful landscapes and a good mood transport you directly into a comic book environment. Cars, wardrobes, buildings and even street lights and great sound, not to mention the perfect lighting, although the very red scenes can be a little awkward, as they tend to fade a bit. Wish Beatty had a chance to make a sequel. In all, a few fun hours.
