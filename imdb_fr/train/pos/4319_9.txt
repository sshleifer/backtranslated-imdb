During the second viewing of this film, I love it even more than the first time. It's full of nuances and a rather ordinary and often scary perception of life, but what elevates this film to a rarely reached height is its focus on the small impacts in our lives that we normally only shorter attention span. Here, the film mingles with the celebration of these incidents, meeting a tow truck driver and his client, the jogger hearing the cry of a baby in the bushes. The dialogue, the game, the casting and the staging are superb. Not two by four, no big revelations. What I observed was how much the characters were true to their basic nature and how much better their lives were when they were celebrated. Congratulations to everyone involved, we need more "Grand Canyons" in our lives. 9 out of 10
