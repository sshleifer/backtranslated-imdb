I have never seen this movie until I bought the tape last year. I was fascinated and entertained. It contains all the elements of what I like to see in a science fiction story, in a book or on the screen. There are social comments, speculation and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something strange and amusing when you look back in 1936 to the "distant future" of the 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must, and not just for Sci-Proud.
