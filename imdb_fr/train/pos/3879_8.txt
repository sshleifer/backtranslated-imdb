A typical Clausen movie, but again not typical. Clausen writes, directs and plays one of the leading roles. It's really a fantastic movie about normal people who lead a normal life to make the most of it. The 4 main actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convincing. You think he's really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a nurse who is really an actor, but it turns out she is the best nurse to take care of the old man. <br /> <Everyone has problems and those in whom no one believes do not end up being happy. But nothing good comes easily, they have to fight for their livelihood and their love.
