First, for the defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly misinterpreted by Alyce, the young British woman who plays the main role. Fountain plays the role of the heroine here, but his inexperience as an actor shows badly and his dance is better left out. Fortunately, she continued to improve the situation. <br /> <br /> But here FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN rank among the best - and they are excellent. Burns & Allen fans will be amazed at how easily they fit into Astaire's dance routines. The great fun routine that has earned a choreographer Hermes Pans an Oscar is particularly interesting. They join Astaire in what must be the film's most inventive film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we can not say more about the slow pace of the story, nor about some of the obsolete situations that require a lot of patience of the viewer. It must be said that humor falls flat and that the romantic misunderstandings that occur in all of Fred Astaire's films of this period are treated conventionally. Only musical interludes give the story the lift it needs. <br /> <br /> Some nice Gershwin tunes appear from time to time, but they do not all get the treatment they deserve. Other actors include Reginald Gardiner, at his best in a fine comedic performance as a complicit servant, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (Joan's father mistaking Astaire's gardener). <br /> It's a light effervescence. whenever Burns & Allen are here to remind us how funny they were on radio and television. Both of them are amazingly adept at following Astaire's footwork. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens ensures that Joan Fontaine's dance number on the hill, with Fred, is filmed at a discreet distance, but a smart camera can not hide the fact that she is out of her element as Astaire's dance partner, something she seems to be terribly aware of.
