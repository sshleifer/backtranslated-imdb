A vagrant looking for a job is mistaken for a handyman in a small town in Wyoming, resulting in all kinds of complications. Cage is perfectly chosen to play the foolish villain in the hopes of quickly gaining money and leaving the city, but he can not escape the title city. Hopper does what he does best, playing a psychopath known as "Lyle from Dallas", the real hit man. Walsh as a crooked sheriff and Boyle as a femme fatale complete the casting. The scenario of the brothers John and Rick Dahl contains delicious twists, and the direction of John creates a wonderful atmosphere of "neo noir". Light and very fun, he sucks the viewer from the beginning and never lets go of anything.
