I read a comment that called this movie "trash" and "waste of time <br /> <br />". I think this person pulled too much on his political underwear. <br /> <br /> I just rented the new Criterion DVD of Yellow and Blue. <br /> <br /> These films - although not very interesting - have at least a historical interest <br /> for the so-called "radical socialist student movement <br /> <br />" '60s. <br /> <br /> I had not seen any of these photos and their notorious reputation, <br /> <br /> I was expecting real porn (there is none). There is frontal <nudity (including male frontal nudity still verboten (automatic NC-17 - Orwellian-X) in the US But I did not expect movies <br> /> <br /> democratic socialist message in your face. <br /> <br /> Even though it tends to the simplistic, I thought it was good to assert his views from time to time. I laugh aloud <br /> <br /> and the director's comment makes it clear that there is a lot of <br /> <br /> parody in the movie so-called "pornographic" sex scenes < The first of these scenes is very realistic.The main couple is awkward, inept, funny and endearing in her first copulation scene. <br /> <br /> > The second - which caused the most complaints - rigged <br /> <br /> cunnilin gus and blowjob And the last is the end of an angry fight, <br /> <br /> believable. <br /> <br /> The extras include an informative introduction to the film, a <br /> <br /> interview with the American distributor of origin and his lawyer, <br /> <br /> testimonials in the United States and a commentary "journal" of the director <br /> <br /> on certain scenes. <br /> <br /> This is the film that the "blue noses" would not have left out and that led to the <br /> <br /> pivot "a prurient interest worthless social redemption" standard <br /> <br /> which, fortunately, is still valid. <br /> <br /> Lovers of historical curiosity will find their happiness <br /> <br />.
