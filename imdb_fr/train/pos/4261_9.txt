I loved this film. Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although he is present in almost every German film that counts. But also because he is not the main actor. Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to watch Juliet from 2001, and who really wears this film on her shoulders, takes over. <br /> <br /> A family leaves Italy for Germany in search of the "German dream" (It's my own invention and ironic ...) cheap labor in the industries steel and coal. However, they eventually open a restaurant and the journey that the film takes on its own is both poetic and funny and charming. From this moment, the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of becoming a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and the determination of his mother to return to Italy. The following is an excellent - and totally neutral - look at what life can become based on the choices you make. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film does not say what life was (Gigi or Giancarlo) more successful or more complete or more interesting. It just gives us a gratifying glimpse of what the search for identity should be when two countries and two mentalities are involved. and this look does not arouse bitterness or disdain for any country, making it a great film for all countries facing the pressures of immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin's moved from Turkey to Turkey in the 1970s in Germany also gives the film a great deal of credibility and emotional precision. The icing on the cake is the fantastic performances of all the actors, especially Metschurat and - it must be emphasized - the little boy who plays the young Gigi. The performance of this child would be an act difficult to follow by anyone! Excellent movie, go see it.
