Mary Pickford ("Born July 4" by Angela Moore) is "La petite am√©ricaine" (of French origin); she falls in love with Jack Holt (under the name Karl Von Austreim), who emigrated to America with his German father and his American mother. The French-American Raymond Hatton (as Count Jules de Destin of the group "Fighting Destins") fell in love with Mrs. Pickford. The triangulated love trio finally ends up in France, the Great War greatly complicating their lives. <br /> <br /> A rather entertaining film, but with propagandistic flaws, with Cecil B. DeMille. The torpedoing and sinking of a vessel carrying Pickford looks like "Titanic". The plot of the war becomes dramatic as Pickford slowly becomes a spy under cover for France, while the Germans occupy his ancestral home. Of course, the German lover Holt arrives. It was hard to believe that it took them so long to recognize each other before going to rape, but it was dark; and previous events had made them believe that they were dead. The film goes beyond limits in its symbolism. By the way, Pickford was Canadian - but few people could deny that she was not a "little American girl" for all intents and purposes. <br /> <br /> LOVING to find "extras" who will later become stars Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - in particular, watch Mr. Novarro as "star" in one the most memorable sequences of the film: Pickford and the wounded soldier who greet each other as he is taken by her on a stretcher. Novarro even asks Mary Pickford to write him a letter; obviously, he has a future in pictures. Ben Alexander is also looking to the future and plays the role of the boy "Bobby"; he becomes a reliable actor and grows up to become a partner of Jack Webb in "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> ******* The American girl (12/12/17) Cecil B.
