And that's why historical / biographical films are so important to us all, especially when they are as well done, like this one! <br /> <br /> Before I saw "The Young Victoria", I knew some things about Queen Victoria, but in the end, I had a lot more about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just great as Victoria (who would guess that!) and she will probably get an Oscar nomination this year. Personally, I applaud for her ... <br /> <br /> For the technical problems, I have the pleasure to say that it is a very successful production, with a superb artistic direction / decoration decorations and , of course, as it should have been, a formidable periodic costume design! <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that I want to know more and know more about this interesting queen, but above all, an incredible woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
