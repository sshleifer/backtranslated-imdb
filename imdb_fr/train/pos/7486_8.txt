For me, I really like this film for some reason, but I want to explain why I think people do not like it. First of all, there are people who like to hate Tom Cruise. I do not really understand. Second, Cameron Crowe, I think, manages to stop two groups of moviegoers with this movie. The casual, relaxed group of spectators, "who does not think too much about it," is puzzled when the plot takes a total of 180 at the end of the film. And the deep, philosophical and mysterious fans are devastated when Crowe asks one of his characters to fully explain the mystery. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie. And Tom Cruise is doing a great job. I think it's probably his best performance of everything I've seen but I have not seen all his films, or even the majority of them. The support cast is good too. Penelope Cruz gives a solid performance and Jason Lee was nice. <br /> <br /> I like history, and I think that's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything. It's a mystery, an adventure and a romantic comedy, but it's mostly a good story. And that has a lot of philosophical nuances, and a lot of similar ideas and stories like that are found in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) is the man who had everything he wanted, more or less lost, had a second chance with a catch to recover him, and finally face his demons and everything that happens , choose reality, simplicity and normality to see if he can finally find the thing he could never master: happiness. <br /> <br /> Many people were disappointed that Crowe revealed the complete mystery at the end. I think it is necessary. The public then knows without a shadow of a doubt that David is aware of his situation and makes the choice in the end all the more powerful. <br /> <br /> And the music in the movie is excellent. This is probably what makes the movie as nice as it is. In particular, "Njosnavelin" from Sigur Ros, which is an incredible song. <br /> <br /> In total, I would give it 3 stars out of 4. It's a movie with a substance for those who like to think and a beautiful story for those who want to relax. This "moderate" approach is probably the reason why people do not like it so much because it's not a complete mystery, nor a fulfilling love story. It mixes and corresponds to different elements and genres.
