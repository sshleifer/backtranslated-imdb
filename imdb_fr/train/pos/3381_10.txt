It's an excellent film but there could be more about Soylent Green. There should be more scenes of what they are doing to people. How do people act in 2022. I think it would be interesting to see if all this will happen in 2022 and beyond. Even if you always know what's the secret, it's a good movie. So will rent or buy this movie now!
