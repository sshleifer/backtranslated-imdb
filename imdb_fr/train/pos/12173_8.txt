First a quick 'shut up!' to those who say that this film stinks. You can not go in any movie while waiting for 'Citizen Kane'. It was actually a funny movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only flaw in this movie is that I do not think there was enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should have spent more time on it. Apart from that, the movie is very entertaining. Selma Blair needs to eat something. She worries me. But she always looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie for a date or a light on Saturday afternoon fun. Go see. <br /> <br /> NOTE: ** 1/2 on ****
