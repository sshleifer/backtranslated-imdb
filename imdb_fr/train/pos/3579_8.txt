The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama of the 1980s. Given the number of famous or imminent characters in the film, one wonders how it could have been so neglected. It is a slow, gloomy but touching account of a tragedy that strikes a farming family. The film is more or less an impeachment of Mido Stoic values ​​and suppression of emotion. The film will not suit all tastes, but anyone who can appreciate the human drama will want it. <br /> <br /> At the very beginning of the film, we see two brothers leaving early in the morning to pick peas and maybe pull one or two ducks if they are lucky. Climbing through a barbed wire fence, the gun accidentally discharges and the boy pulls fatally on his older brother. These boys have apparently never taken a course on hunter safety. The way for two men to properly cross a fence of this type with a single gun would be as follows: The first man climbs through. The second man then passes the gun through the fence. The first man then lays his gun and helps the other to cross the fence. At no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence. <br /> <br /> Anyway, once his brother is killed, Arnold, 12, regresses into his own world. He does not even run for help after his brother has been shot. He's just picking the peas and telling the family about the accident later. Arnold does not seem to show any regret or sorrow at any time during the burial or the investigation. His family seems to run away. Maybe they are even angry at him for killing his brother. Frederick Forrest, a delusional uncle, is apparently annoyed by Arnold, although the death of his older brother allows him to take on his girlfriend. Arnold's parents do not seem to understand how to care for their son. They do not even really try to talk to him. The only person he can communicate with is his grandfather, played by Wilford Brimley. After a while, Arnold even settles with the old man. <br /> <br /> Nothing seems to allow Arnold to open until he makes a strange car trip to Reno Nevada to search inexplicably for his uncle's ex-wife. Once he meets her, he starts to come out of his shell after apologizing to her for breaking his marriage by unleashing all the family's turmoil after the accident. From there, the film becomes a quick study of reconciliation and revival. <br /> <br /> The acting is far away in most cases. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are the perfect Stoic farm parents. Forrest is good, but maybe we are trying too hard to channel Paul Newman's performance into Hud. Cinematography is exceptional, too. If you like images of bad mood on ordinary people, this one may be for you. Some may even be invited to bring tissues. 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hunting dog.
