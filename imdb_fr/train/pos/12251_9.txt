It took me a while to watch this version, because unfortunately, I do not seem to be able to rent it in the video store, but in the other version, but I fell in love with it. I was always on the border with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, as they are not British, must naturally emphasize, and for me, this does not seem natural. He seems put on. Sorry but do not think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there. I could not attract any of the characters, but this version is more comforting and is the type of person I imagined to be Emma. This is certainly the version I will come back to from now on. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley is no longer handsome, but he is convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I have never pleased in the movie version, but it is better described in this version. On second thought, except for Mr. Knightley, all the characters are better interpreted and much less effective. Unfortunately, both versions arrived at about the same time and the Paltrow version got more publicity. Too bad ...... I also like the new scene at the end. Congratulations to Kate Beckingsale! Therefore, if you are a fan of Jane Austen, do not forget to watch this one.
