From the beginning, I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is probably the funniest I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm in September. <br /> <br /> Each element has come together so beautifully in this film. It's not often that you see a movie with as many jokes about penis, gays, and races as critics praise. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver each hot joke in a sensational way. Carell remains nice throughout the film where, at the end of the film, you motivate him to be more successful in his relationship than for him. The support cast is brutal, each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the peculiarities of this film is the abundance of memorable scenes we have given. This makes a movie easy to remember with tenderness. This film will often be mentioned when the words "chest hair removal" and "condoms" are mentioned in a conversation. <br /> <br /> Watching him at the theater, I wondered how many older people were there to watch him. I saw a group of four women from the mid-sixties come in. Despite an older audience, this movie still made all the theater laugh. <br /> <br /> I think the kind of people who will like it will be the office fans and Steve Carell. Many jokes remind me of the type of jokes you would see on Family Guy too. The film is deep enough for teen boys and pretty sweet and smart for middle-aged women. I do not recommend going to see this movie if you are not a fan of profanity or if you are easily. offense. However, when you are in the movie, remember that this movie is in a good mood. Jokes are not "gay jokes", they are just jokes. And they are funny.
