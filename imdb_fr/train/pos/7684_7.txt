Read all the reviews is very exciting. but can someone please tell me the name of the true artist who painted the pictures for the good times aired. I realize that everyone is referring to j.j. As a family artist, there was a real family who had the true artist, and he has not yet obtained credit in this regard. So, if you do not mind if someone can say the name of the real artist, I would also like to say "work well done". I know that this view is for GOOD TIMES cast but, would not you agree that it also touched the hearts of all of us. I would like to know if he is still painting or is still alive. I would like to have some of his work exhibited at home.
