Of course, it was corny and absurd and sometimes corny, but at least the filmmakers did not try. While most television films are close to mediocrity, this film is in fact redeeming. The cinematography was pretty good for a TV movie and Viggo Mortensen displays shades of Aragorn in a movie about a man who played according to his own rules. Most flashback sequences were a little lame, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. The role of Jason Priestly in the film as a rebel shock-jock annoyed me a bit, but again, it's a TV film! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona featured in the movie.
