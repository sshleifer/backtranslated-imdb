Babyface - Notorious film by Barbara Stanwyck where the guy of a local teacher tells her that she has the power - he tries to make him read Nietzsche - she says that the books have never served her anything. Finally, she has enough and is moving into the big city. We follow her men's track up the ladder of success in an international bank. The dialogue is rather cheeky as it was time last movies to be released before the code of Hollywood production self-inflicted. Look for a young John Wayne's cameo as one of Stanwyck's volunteer victims. Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge. An interesting film and prefiguring the future roles of femme fatale that Stanwyck would play at the time of the film noir. B +
