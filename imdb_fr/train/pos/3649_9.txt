I have seen a lot of TV movies since I was a student, the majority being the loss of normal time that American television loses. This one, however, was well designed and drawn and had a very nice twist at the end. Having seen only Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate, I was surprised by his excellent performance rather than the range of expressions from A to B that he normally gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after a long time in the Fly II. I am also happy to see Robert Guillaumme again in a leading role. I can not say that I've ever taken Jane Leeves seriously after her stint at Benny Hill, but she almost managed to stick to her role. Overall, a highly recommended movie.
