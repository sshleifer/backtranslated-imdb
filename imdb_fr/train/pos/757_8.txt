I need to be honest. I watched and enjoyed this show because it was rude, offensive, hilarious and scorching. Yes, there is a lot of humor for all tastes. If you like the kind of humor that makes fun of people falling off skateboards, for example, you'll have a great time. <br /> <br /> Or, if you like people who practice extreme stunts Damage, you will also have a good time. And if you like scatological humor and extreme situations, oh, you will enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the three types of humor proposed by "Dirty SÃ nchez". I like to laugh with the situations of the series. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one. So, if you're tired of Jackass's typical American stupidity, try it to the uttermost English stupidity of this show. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> It's a show that has little taste or class. This is not recommended for those who are easily offended or disgusted. <br /> <br /> Now, these guys need to see a psychologist. Especially the character of Paco.
