if you have a chance to see this movie, see it. it's quite shocking in places and really makes you think of a lot of important topics, but it's not didactic. in my opinion, it's a work of art ... great music, many styles, the level of actor generally impressive that is expected from BBC Drama. Nathalie Press (nicknamed 'Natalie' Press) is convincing in her role as a depressed teenager exploited by a classmate. Celia Imrie has that reassuring quality that gives the sometimes annoying action stability and the comfort of the viewer to know that someone is really "normal", but the real star is always Timothy Spall - surely one of the greatest actors of our time. !
