I realized a few days ago that the directors of this movie have put a pun on its title. This film does not deal mainly with the act of "giants of riding", but especially people who are the giants of the sport, the giants of riding, to change course. <br /> <br /> In my teens, I lived in a wedge block, one of the best bodysurf spots in the world. I went in waves of 15 to 18 feet, and on several occasions, I was hammered by waves of 10 and 12 feet. This experience is the reason why I am completely impressed by the surfers of this movie. The idea that Jeff Clark, seemingly an ordinary mortal, could afford to fly Maverick's BY DE HIM-Maverick for over a decade is beyond my comprehension. The first safety rule of any water sport is "Do not surf / dive / swim alone" He went where sensible people could not, and lived to talk about it. I would not go out if the water was 75 degrees and the sharks left. <br /> <br /> In the world of hot water: the first blow of wave to Jaws always makes tingle the skin all over my body. These are not just scary waves, they are uncontrolled waves of bowel evacuation. When we see Laird Hamilton not only survive on waves of 15 to 20 meters (I can hardly type those numbers), but also work faces as a fun day in Rincon, I'm blown away. The big wave riders have a dedication and concentration comparable to anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. I gave him a 9 instead of a 10 just because he failed to mention that there are some great wave runners in the world besides the Hamilton / Kalama crew, and I think they deserved to be mentioned. Splice in Ken Bradshaw outside the log cabins and a 10 is!
