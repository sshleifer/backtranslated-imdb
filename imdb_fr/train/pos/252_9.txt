The performances were superb, the costumes gave off a unique feeling for the time and, as a living Victorian historian, I was impressed by the precision of the weapons and the attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I would not say that you need it. Knowing the Kelly saga to stay in step with the film but to understand the events and attitudes of the moment, you will need some basic historical knowledge. Do not expect, as do some rather stupid people, any of the characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country of childhood. <br /> <br /> OK, the story had some fictional elements but these are necessary for a wider follow-up of the film. In the DVD, Gregor Jordan said he wanted his film "to spark interest", and that's exactly what happened with me. This film deserves our attention. <br /> <br /> See and you will not be sorry
