A director for the first time (Bromell) has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a hit-man of the middle class, the middle class and depressed, and on his fight against his relationship with his father . This film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman, William H. Macy's 6-year-old son, is the most refreshing little actor I've seen in a long time. Macy is brilliant in a part that seems almost written for him as a self-tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his company. It is always a pleasure to see Donald Sutherland and he is beautiful as Macy's insensitive father. The alternating audio track of the films is well worth listening to the director explain how he chose the actors, the places and the film. The basic Dolby 2-channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded. Cinematography creates the atmosphere with a very subtle musical background. All film buffs or observers of human nature will appreciate this one, especially if he is a fan of contradiction.
