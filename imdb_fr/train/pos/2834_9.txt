I have not seen much German comedy, but if this film has enough to pass, I have to see more! The simple yet effective scenario takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva, an unemployed mother, discovered that her husband, an artist, had an affair with a woman's wife. rich lawyer. I will not reveal anything else, but the result is a series of fun activities that lead to a perfect conclusion. My interest in international cinema has grown since I first saw this film. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... do not let the inclusion of young children make you think it's a family movie) who loves comedy - even those who do not know the language well.
