quote from Nicolas Martin (nicmart) of Houston, TX: "A good movie, but a reformatted DVD for television", April 8, 2002 - It's a charming and emotional film, but the DVD I bought has been "reformatted to Make your TV" next to Columbia Tristar's clods.There is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format, except that Hollywood treats all the movies like stupid garbage he is so used to producing, what a pity. " br /> <br /> What a shame (criminal!). However, there is another version out there. See here for more details http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/kingofmasks.htm <br /> <br /> Wonderful performances of the two main actors (The King and Doggie) BTW.
