I saw this movie at the cinema when it was released for the first time a few years ago and I liked it a lot. But I still wanted to see it again this year to see if it's still good compared to the movies coming out now, and I'd like to say that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life !!! !!!!!! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you should not miss a minute of this movie. If you do not follow the action completely, you will lose yourself and you will not understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this film so good, you can not wait for it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the producer!
