This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've seen in years. Her routine is hilarious and allows for a good conversation with other people who have seen her. I highly recommend this one. The part about the history of Europe is a little slow, but the last jokes in French are rather good, because it is not necessary to speak French to obtain it (although if you do, it is always hilarious). In addition, the role of the transvestite is pretty good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but fun the first time. Skip these if you can. It's almost not worth watching. However, this is really a funny and funny show that everyone should see. "I was dead at the time!"
