I have to warn you, there are spoilers in there. But to begin, I had "Spanish judges" in February I think. It was mentioned that it was the last copy, but as I saw it, it was not out of stock. But anyway, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised that no one in the critics mentioned the scar) although it's a small budget, having enough money to make this movie would be worth it spent. Man, what a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story is about a scammer known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who "claims" to have goods called The Spanish Judges. If you do not know what the Spanish judges are, or if you did not see the trailer for that film and it's the first comment you've read, I will not even say what they're saying. are. I think it would be a big mistake because nobody knew what it was. He needs protection. He therefore hires a couple of crooks, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino), and a scammer called Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who will not even tell her name to anyone because she comes from Mars, as she said. So they (mainly Jack) call him "Mars Girl". Everything starts well, but then there is a big match. A game that involves lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There was too much to play (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, were not part of it). They could have done better some scenes and the score could have been a little better too. Part of the score was actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. The fight scene at the end could have been a little longer and a bit more violent, but what can you do? One more comment on Matt: Damn, he plays a smooth and smooth rogue. <br /> <br /> I know this is a comment, but I need to make a correction with regard to NeCRo, one of the commentators: Valeria Golino not a newcomer. According to this site, she has been playing since 1983. For me, and I hope for others, she is well known for her loving love of Charlie Sheen for both "Hot Shots!". movies. But good criticism. <br /> <br /> Although I think it's one of the few movies I've seen and it's really good (that's why I gave it 10 stars higher), I give the note of what I thought. when I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
