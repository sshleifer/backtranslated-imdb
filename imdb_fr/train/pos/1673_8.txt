A nice Martino outing, it's a witty and pleasant giallo with great performances from the beautiful cast and mainly from the two main actors, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me, the puzzle of a plot is so complicated and confusing that you simply sit back and enjoy rather than trying to anticipate. Just when everything seems set, we are again caught up in a new series of twists, nice twists, it must be said. <br /> <br /> Sexy with a lot of composure kills this well-paced movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal locations. A super final on the Aegean rocks will close things and everyone had a good time.
