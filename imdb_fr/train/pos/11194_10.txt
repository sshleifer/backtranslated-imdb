Wrong scenario, wrong direction, best performance, overloaded dialogue. What more could you ask for? To laugh, it's just not better than that. The over-action of Zadora combined with the clich√© scenarios in which she is made of this hilarious parody of the machine "Hollywood". Almost as funny as "Spinal Tap", although it was clearly not his intention. Do not miss Ray Liotta's debut film "Looks like a penis".
