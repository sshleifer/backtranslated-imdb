Not knowing what this movie was made of, I checked it at the video store and after seeing it, I enjoyed it. Very little film by director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Beautiful story and characters. As a fan of Glenne Healdy, I was surprised by his British accent. The only exception for this film was the end. However, this is worth the rent.
