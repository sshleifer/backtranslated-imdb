This show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television. I mean the acting is awesome, the suspense, the drama, the comedy, everything is there, and with such a simple story: a plane crashed on an island. The characters are great and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox shows us once again how great he is. Josh Holloway is so great. Jorge Garcia is hilarious, I could go on and on. In addition, the unexpected plot twists, the stories of the characters, the music that is at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms once again proved himself an excellent writer and producer. I mean it's better than ALIAS and I loved ALIAS. Anyone who does not watch this show should definitely consider getting the DVD and watching it, because something is missing. This show could be the best show in the history of television!
