It's a bit disconcerting to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. But it's in this film that Gig got his name and also a great career after playing small roles under another name. <br /> <br /> I will go against the majority of the other comments and declare that I really appreciated. this film, mainly because of the vibrant performance of Barbara Stanwyck in the role of Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring and playful as the eldest of the three daughters whose mother died during the Lusitania and whose father was later killed during Woar's War I. <br /> In the house, Fiona resisted for years to settle the will of his father, which would allow a guy like Donald Trump, Charles Barclay, to get the family home. But Fiona keeps the secret on the fact that she hates Barclay as much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is the average and attractive sister, married to an Englishman but thirsty for her younger sister's boyfriend (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you are a Stanwyck fan, do not miss this tour.
