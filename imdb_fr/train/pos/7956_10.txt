It's just a classic film in which animal voices are really what they think. I do not know if a scene is missing from my video copy, but it never shows how the dogs came out of the pit. It also shows a survival instinct and animal tracking abilities. Put humans in the same position as helicopters. For once, an original movie is enhanced by a remake because the voiceover of the first one has been removed. This kind of film can only be used by the use of animals, because it would have spiced up the story by turning it into murder, proving that after all, animals are more interesting than men.
