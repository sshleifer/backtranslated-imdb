I think I read somewhere: Joe Johnston (the director of the film and one of the founders of Industrial Light and Magic for the filming of the first movie Star Wars) and one of his producers or something that racked his brains for a title. Something was missing in the movie "Rocket Boys" (I guess). <br /> <br /> One day, they were playing with a PC program that formed words from other words (for example: you type a word or series of words and it mixes the letters and form other words) I think the technical term is an "anagram" <br /> <br /> Anyway, they typed "Rocket Boys" and of course what comes back is "October Sky" . They were shocked to say the least. The title sums up everything in the film since the film revolves around Sputnik. At first, Homer Jr did not like the idea, but he got used to it after the release of the "movie poster novel".
