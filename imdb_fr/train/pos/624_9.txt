The summer has been so full of blockbusters and movie reels, not to mention some of the disappointments of those returns, that I've had the hard time finding a movie that I could just sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> In case you do not want to read further on the page (there are no spoilers), I'll summarize here: it's more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some which are dubious violent parties, a lot of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for little kids), but do not try to be too tacky or cross its limits. See this as a little more serious, a little more magical, Princess Bride, and you'll be close. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I may not be a spectator as prodigious as the others ... Maybe one or two times a month, if I feel active. I am also a big fan of science fiction and fantasy. I get tired of repeated recurring stories and movies with more flash than fill up faster than you can count to 10, and this film is rough diamond. <br /> <br /> At the end of here (August), I was pretty tired of the fractured expectations of the big hits that I avoided seeing Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust. Having had my hopes completely confused by Transformers for my addiction to fiction, the glimpses of Stardust seemed appealing, but I was certainly suspicious. <br /> <br /> Like many others here, I was totally surprised. I had thought of seeing another fantastic fantasy film shot from here for breakfast. Do not be fooled, it's really a fairy tale, and it does indeed have witches, magic, and absolutely requires the suspension of disbelief ... But the most refreshing thing I've found is that it's NOT based on anything. We've seen or read these last 15 years, and it's actually a very good movie. <br /> <br /> ((Unlike 90% of the other films that seem to reappear as thorns in one side, maybe a I could read a book this year and, in two years, the film would be released as a another "epic fantasy tale, like the LOT and the rest", says the NYT and such and such no doubt.)) <br /> <br /> Stardust had not stuck me in my seat because of the action cluttered at every turn, and I was not sweating bullets because of conspiracy after the fact, threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a strong boom. He did not even use huge sounds to draw my attention to what's happening on the screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you). It's not about trying to show the latest CGI techniques, nor offending my intelligence with muffled dialogs and simple story lines so I can understand them in Grade 3 (boy, I hate them). <br /> <br /> I just ... look. Watched, and enjoyed a refreshing creative story unfolds before my eyes. Of course, I may have known what was going to happen during most of the film, but that makes you forget that. My heart was even tight in some places, but the most important aspect I noticed was that I left the cinema feeling better than when he entered. <br /> <br /> It's really a jewel. After so many snowfalls this summer with so many remakes and movies up to my expectations, it was like a cold cup of tea to crown all the hard work I had done in the hands of others for trying to get them out with my money is worth it. <br /> <br /> This is probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you like fantastic movies that stand the test of time alone (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.), then you should really see this movie. This small diamond finds its place in my collection of DVDs as soon as it arrives in the stores, you can trust me. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful.
