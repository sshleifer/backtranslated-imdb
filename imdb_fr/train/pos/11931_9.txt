It was a first-rate film with a first-rate distribution. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and especially Christopher Lloyed play well in this lovely movie about real angels helping the Angels baseball team. You never know, it could happen. I loved Lloyd's role in that. He was hilarious. The story is about reorienting your life because the child's belief in Angels helped turn the manager into anger, hardened, and soured, Glover seeing the best of people. The film was well shot and also aimed to see the best people and realize your dreams. It was funny, charming, touching and sad, everything was very well done. You will love him (or love him). I guarantee. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
