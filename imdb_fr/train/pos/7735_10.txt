An excellent rendition of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-black thriller contains all the necessary elements: a deranged ex-boxer who has become a wanderer, an alcoholic widow with sinister desires, an ex-cop who has become a little crook and a kidnapping plot destined for the destiny. Still, the film never crosses the country of the clich√©, but remains fresh and intriguing. The performances are all superb, especially the role of Bruce Dern in the role of the sleazeball villain, Uncle Bud. The movement of the film is marked by a tense uncertainty which, intentional or not, adds to the sinister procedure. Highly recommended.
