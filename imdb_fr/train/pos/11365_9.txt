Okay, let's start by saying that this film is not an accurate interpretation of the crimes and lawsuits of Andrei Chikatilo. Although it may have been "official policy" in the Politburo that there are no serial killers in the USSR, in fact the judicial system has treated others, and "Killer X" (as it is called in fact) was already wanted when Fetisov brought Burakov the case. In fact, as soon as he realized that they had several murders in their hands, the authorities tasked a task force of dozens of officers to find and stop the killing of a man. which did not correspond to what is considered a normal serial killer. settings. It is good that the director and screenwriters regularly remind the viewer that the story is "based only on real events", which is not the case for a documentary. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS FOLLOW **** <br /> <br /> That said, it's a damn good example of a fast-paced Hollywood thriller that continues to light on the basics of what happened. It's easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of the events to allow compelling visualization. Yes, Chikatilo raped and murdered children and adults, men and women. Yes, poor laboratory work has left him free to continue killing for years. Yes, innocent men have been accused of the murders and "declared" for their crimes to the police exhorting. Yes, the gay community was harassed while the crimes were committed (albeit with the assistance of Burakov). And yes, Chikatilo was confessed not by the harangu of the special prosecutor, Gorbounov, but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovsky (although Gorbounov is far from the selfish martyr described in this film). Apart from rumors about truth and veracity, all these events are dramatized in such a way as to constantly tighten tension and fear. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt director and co-writer Chris Gerolmo to have a perfect cast. . Stephen Rea's growing emotional involvement in the murders and his expertise in detecting clues, Donald Sutherland's sneaky manipulation of the Soviet party's hacks and its subtle spine that becomes obvious when needed, the current underpinnings. Jealous of rage hidden by fear-filled behavior, Max Von Sydow's childlike enthusiasm for a criminal investigation reinforces the neat dialogue and editing in a way that can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Taken for what it is, "Citizen X" is almost perfectly perfect (the "almost" because of a moment of self-congratulation at the end that just does not fit) . Highly recommended as a well-told fiction, without being presented ... but given the movies of type "serial killer" that usually offers Hollywood, it's good enough for me.
