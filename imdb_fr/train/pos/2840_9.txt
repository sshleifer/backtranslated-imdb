I just saw a press screening of this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not often that I have the chance to see all my favorite actors in one movie at a time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the picking scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden again. I think their chemistry in front of the camera is the direct result of time spent together off camera. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly) Bret Ratner's play ... Without saying too much, I will simply say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging ... <br /> <br /> The old couple were really good together and you really feel that they have spent their lives together. <br /> <br /> The segments Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke have both delivered surprises that seem realistic and resemble the experiences I had in the big apple. All in all, the movie is a good place to make an appointment ... especially if you already love the city itself. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next in the Cities of Love.
