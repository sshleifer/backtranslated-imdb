A tragically wonderful film ... takes us to a Japan that no longer exists. Despite the technical expertise of Hollywood, I have not yet seen a film (Hollywood) that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea ... The Last Samurai Tom Cruise looked like the last installment of the Lord of The Rings trying to capture the old rural Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like serene but intense stories, this is a must-see movie. It will be a respite from hollow and flashy movies, much like the last 1000 blockbuster movies you've seen. I think it's one of the best Kurosawa stories. <br /> <br /> Although it is a film about geisha and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such contexts, it has not turned into a skin film. The characters are full of depth and act with a lot of intensity.
