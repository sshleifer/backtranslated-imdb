This is a fascinating tale of the hunt for the first known serial killer of the Soviet Union. I had listened, just waiting for a decent TV movie, but I found myself attracted by the compelling way the story was told. As others have already said, there is much to admire in this edition that unfortunately lacks in many releases on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit goes to Chris Gerolmo, whose clever scenario and direction attracts the viewer and makes it impossible not to feel emotionally involved. The acting is also superb, especially that of the two main actors, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their convincing representations give a lot of credibility to their arcs. The place where they meet for the first time after Perestroika is truly touching. <br /> <br /> If you prefer your crime movies with a little more depth and a little less brilliant, I strongly recommend that you search for the 'Citizen X'. <br /> <br />
