Simply the best Estonian film I have ever seen, although it is directed by Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller on a gang of thugs trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure belonging to the Republic of Estonia. But at the same time, it is a kind of summary of the situation of many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union collapsed and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now, the conditions could be better in most of these countries. But in the early 1990s, many of these new nations had to fight corruption and organized crime that they inherited from the Soviet era. (And many still do it ... at least to a certain level ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with credible characters and a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the most famous Estonian actor, plays Snaut in Tarkovsky's Solaris), an old gangster who is starting to get tired of his way of life. But the most amazing performance comes from Monika Mäger, a child-actress portraying Terje, a teenager, whose presence in the plot is essential. (and his name is not even mentioned in the IMDb credit list !!!) w <br /> <br /> There are not many movies in the world that manage to be both entertaining and artistic . But Tallinn Pimeduses does that. Unfortunately, Järvi-Laturi's other films are far from this type of achievement. His first, Kotia päin, was too artificial and his latest, History is Made at Night, was just a weird mess.
