To be honest, I watched this movie only because of my puberty needs. I mean, I could not have women at my age (I was 9 or 10 years old) so I thought looking at Elvira's cleavage was the most secret thing for sex. <br /> <br /> I ended up having a good time with this cult A classic horror comedy, Halloween parties, sassy humor and some sexy evils shown by Elvira. <br /> <br /> They no longer make movies like this ... It gave the feeling of an amateur effort a late night cable TV host. <br /> <br /> The truth is that he has generated a lot of fans because of his humor and Cassandra's ability to play. <br /> <br /> It's a classic that reminds me of the good days of USA Up All Night.
