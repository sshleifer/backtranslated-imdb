My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (retired, US Marine Corps), was at Guadalcanal and lost his leg to the Japanese. He also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical advisor of this film and I hope it has had an impact on the film by making it look like it was at the time, like I read in various comments written by the viewers of this movie that it seemed like real life. My father is a fanatic of facts and figures and he always wanted to see things as they were. I would like to believe that he has something to do with that. <br /> <br /> He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (ironic, she is Japanese), the Emperor of Japan awarded her, a few years ago, the one of the highest praises of his contribution and his activities to bring back Kendo and Iaido to Japan since McArthur banned them World War II. <br /> <br /> My father has already been a sailor, but I know that once a sailor, you are still a sailor. And that's exactly what he is and I love him and I respect him a lot. <br /> <br /> I wish I could watch this film if someone has a copy. And I would love to give it to my dad for his 94th birthday this year!
