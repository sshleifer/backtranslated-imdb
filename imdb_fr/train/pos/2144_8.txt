A sweet and totally charming movie, Shall We Dansu? made me laugh and cry. At his first appearance, Sugiyama-san was not very attractive. He was a strained employee, apparently devoted to his family, but too easily captivated by a face in a window. The object of his obsession is distant and cold. But at the end of the film, I was in love with him, his wife, his wife and daughter, all the dance teachers and the dance students. This simple story of transformation and renewal is a little gem that I would like to see again.
