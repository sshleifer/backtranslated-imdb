Soylent Green is a classic. I'm waiting for someone to redo it. They seem to redo science fiction classics these days (ie War of the Worlds) and I hope a director / producer will remake Soylent Green. With the current computer animation and technology, the situation could be excellent. Anti-utopian films may not be as far-fetched. The human race breeds like cockroaches without any outside influence to reduce it. As humans, we have the choice to assign responsibility for procreation of less important species if they are out of control, but there is nothing to control human reproduction except ourselves. Despite all the diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc., the human race multiplies like a bacteria in a petri dish. The classic Malthusian economy asserts that all species, including humans, will multiply beyond their means of subsistence. 6 billion and more and more ... it's obscene.
