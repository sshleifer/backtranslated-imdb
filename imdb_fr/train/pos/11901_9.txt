As far as I know, Balanchine's changes to Tchaikovsky's score are as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The last section of Grossvatertanz (a traditional tune played at the end of a party) is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before the end of their stage. <br /> <br /> 2) A violin solo, written for but removed from Tchaikovsky's score for Sleeping Beauty, is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the party. the scene of transformation. Balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship with music for the growing Christmas tree that occurs shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> 3) The jumper solo of the fairy Sugar Plum is removed. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the accusation that Balanchine has somehow desecrated Tchaikovsky's great score is misplaced.
