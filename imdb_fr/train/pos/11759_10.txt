The Best of Times is one of the best sleepers of all time. The configuration does not impose your patience, the development is constant, the many relationships that intertwine are lovingly established, the gags and snatches work and are all funny. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell at Reno Hightower makes one of his best performances and Robin Williams at Jack Dundee is sure of nothing. The distribution also includes many big fans. Jack's wife is played by Jack Palance's daughter, who is adorable, as well as Reno's wife, who is an excellent comedian. I can not tell you how many times I have watched this movie, how many times have I enjoyed it and how many times I would like more people to see it.
