Matthau and Lemmon are at their best in this one - everyone in the movie is also great. The dialogue is excellent and very very spiritual - and the scene where the Lemmon character tries to clean his sinuses in a restaurant makes me laugh every time I see him. Anyone who sees the sequel not so great should not be diverted from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just love it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character so right with tragic overtones only adds to the hilarity in my opinion. These two big guys made a series of movies together, but this one is the best - without a doubt.
