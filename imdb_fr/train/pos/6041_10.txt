This is to watch a few times. The excellent writing shows that they had to live this story or know someone who did it because they told it. Freebird made me live again and laugh at my failed youth. The title was an excellent choice. Great movie, frame, story, soundtrack and characters. It's a biker movie, but it would be a shame to classify it that way. It's funny, it's a bit like Trailer Park Boys in the UK. If you have never seen TPB, let it know if you like this movie. You will thank me. I hope to see more of these characters in other movies. After? Could be done. There are many more people I would like to see through their eyes.
