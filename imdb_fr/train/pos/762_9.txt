I like to watch people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie that takes you to a disco club called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas time, because a "MC Santa Claus" also appears. <br /> <br /> Even if it's an old movie, and even though I recorded it on TV videotape, it was shown by the State Movie Archive of Finland to the summer 2004 on their big screen, I went to check it. It's much better on the big screen than on TV. <br /> <br /> Even though many people here think that watching this on a big screen is a waste of money for the ticket price, I disagree with that and I think that when I paid my I saw the money, because it is on the big screen, especially in the forefront of cinema, an unforgettable experience and much better than video.
