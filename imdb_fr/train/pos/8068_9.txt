To watch this film from beginning to end without bursting into laughter, it takes almost a leap of faith, because we must continue to say to ourselves: "it's old", "it's a classic", "be nice", no not because the film is so bad, but because it's better, it's so good This is a dated movie. It is also a classic, if it is tarnished. In principle, I am not inclined to laugh at people, and I am more than irritated when others do it. Making fun of Informing in my mind, it's a bit like laughing at a clever idiot when he dribbles his orange juice over the tablecloth. Yes, we say, he's an idiot, but when he's on top, he's also a real scientist. The same is true of The Informer, which is sometimes very formidable, and yet it has great photographs, a good acting, a beautiful score and a good story simple and decent. In the end, that I will not let go, politics, religion and psychology meet, in a church, to make the scene as old-fashioned and exaggerated, and yet life is sometimes so. Uneducated people who have a simple faith behave differently than us (presumably brilliant) modern people, and the scene is not so incredible (I buy it, but I know the Irish) is also embarrassing. Yet people behave this way, they say things like that. Not everyone is connected and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be connected. Are today's people so much superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago? And how? I do not think so. We are just different. Now, go watch the movie.
