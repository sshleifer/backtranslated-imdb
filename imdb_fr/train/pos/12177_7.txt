Recap: The day after his bachelor party, Paul, awakened by his future mother-in-law, discovers that a woman sleeps at his side. Unfortunately, she is a bar waitress and not her fiancee. And suddenly, she arrives everywhere ... at the toll booth on the highway and at the dinner of her parents-in-law. And it's hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex-boyfriend has followed and photographed her. It's not just about saving your marriage ... it's about survival. <br /> <br /> Comments: In fact, it is much better than expected. Not the sweet romantic comedy I was expecting, but something much more funny, something that has a small advantage. This film was not afraid to push the jokes a little further. And Jason Lee now knows how to play comedy, especially when his character is half-panicked and in trouble, as he is here. And he received good support from beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And in fact, I thought Lochlyn Munro played an interesting role in the exercise. <br /> <br /> The focus was more on comedy than romance and the end result was positive. I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> 7/10
