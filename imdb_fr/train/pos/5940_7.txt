this short film trailer is essentially an illustration of Superman and Batman working together and forming a difficult alliance. Obviously, the two characters have very divergent views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment. It's funny to see these two iconic characters trying. I will not be interested in the story here. But I will enter the acting game, which is great.Everyone is well cast.The two actors who play Superman and Batman are well suited to their characters.The same filmmakers as made Batman: Dead End and Grayson have also done this short film. Of the three, I probably liked this one the least, but I still thought it was well done. For me, the best in the world is a 7/10
