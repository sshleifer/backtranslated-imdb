I saw it at the cinema during its initial release and it was disturbing while I'm sure it would still be the case. It was the first part of 68 and it was still around the American cities and there was recently a mass murder in my hometown where I saw that where a man was a victim of a shooting. The freshness of this event close to home, combined with this true theatrical story, created a very disturbing theatrical experience. It really brought to life the great acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I knew Truman Capote's true event story well, and Richard Brooks' script and direction conveyed Truman's event and interpretation to a compelling film adaptation. The music of Quincy Jones effectively marks his story. I have only seen it a few times since. It was too real. Almost like witnessing the crime itself and riding with the killers. I would rate this to 9.0 out of 10. Society is so insensitive to violence and crime today that it seems likely to be slow and moderate and may be perceived with less impact, but for people over of 50 years, this will be a distinctive sign in the examination of the criminal psyche.
