Stumble on. I must say at first that I was a little disappointed with the first episodes, but having faith in the series and the undeniable talent of Abe Forsythe, I continued to watch. I can safely say that I am now happy to have done so. The story is well developed and all the characters have a solid base and most information is not lacking. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can blame in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation. owned by Lizzie's character. <br /> <br /> A good acting game associated with a stellar plot really allows this show to be heard. Here is the hope of another season!
