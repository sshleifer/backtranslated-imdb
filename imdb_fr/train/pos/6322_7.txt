This film was recommended to me by a friend. I have never seen any commercials or trailers, so I did not know Clooney was there and that his role was so uncomfortable. I thought the whole cast suited and found the film rather nice. The opening scene, with the small band of bandits standing on the side of the road, looking flushed and haggard, immediately caught my eye. There was a way to say, "Do not go away, it will not be boring", and it really was not. It was an interesting and light comedy, with enough twists to keep you in the background, but when the end came, I felt a little deceived ... just a little. The events have multiplied so that you expect them to continue, but to a point that I can not define, things are stabilizing, which makes it a slight disappointment. I think I was expecting a bigger highlight, but it turned out rather quiet. If you watch the movie with that in mind and you can live without George Clooney in high doses, you should find this movie very entertaining and worth watching. I would now like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a rare find in the United States.
