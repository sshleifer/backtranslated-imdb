<br /> <br /> It's a generic story of age - think about "The Wedding Member", "Summer of 1942", "A Summer Place", or to "Little Women" - and there are times when Mulligan could have omitted the catchy music, not using slow motion or minimizing the golden beauty of the setting. Otherwise, it is done with a rare and perfect emotional height. Nothing is forced, every line has a feeling, and the rhythm is right. Even the bottom cast of a list helps: Bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the content. Witherspoon, in particular, is excellent: her line readings are fresh and original and her body language is quite appropriate for a 14-year-old girl, sullen and inflamed, on the eve of a woman's life. Waterston is also doing very well, although he has to spend most of the film riding up and down the family truck. <br /> <br /> We feel that the directors of the film were aware of its unpromising business prospects - nothing very serious. stars, no big car accidents, no special effects - and consciously decided to make the best movie possible, box office be damned. It's intimate and honest, and it sticks to the ribs. If you get lost in the end, you must not feel fooled.
