I really thought they had done an * excellent * job. There was nothing wrong with that. I do not know how the first speaker could have said it was terrible. ) but I try not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing, but this one got me. It was so good! I hope they will release it on DVD because I will definitely buy a copy! I feel that it renewed my faith and gave me hope that I can not explain. It made me want to strive to be a better person, they lived so much and we take that for granted, I guess. Compared to that, I feel that our own tests are nothing. Well, nothing, but they barely correspond to what they had to go through. I liked it. Who played Emma?
