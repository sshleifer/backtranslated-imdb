For a low-budget project, the film was a success. The story is interesting and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, who now plays in the television series "Dragnet", is sexier than ever. The sites were ideal for the plot of Ganster, and the director shows his talent by assuming many roles for his project. Of course, this low-budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for gun scenes, but the music keeps this script moving. Although this film has its share of problems, such as continuity, I must say that I would praise the director's next film. If you are a film student, you could learn a few things from the director's commentary.
