I agree with the previous comment to name the content of the movie "Daily Madness", but I would like to clarify that: "Dog Days" is about the way women are treated in (male) society. The episodes we see here show variations in women's daily discrimination, mostly categorized by age group. There is an elderly man who makes his new partner look like and acts in the same way as his deceased wife, treating her like a doll who will act "worthy to wear" her dress. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is almost a slave and he is a (violent) master. In addition, we find a man a little younger who does not communicate with his friend / wife and who, instead of being really jealous of his business, even makes friends with his competitors. A young adult man makes it clear to his friend - a girl who is really troubled to be pretty enough for him - that she must be the jewel by her side and follow her strict rules of etiquette. Finally, there is a man in his late fifties who, calculating his own advantage, delivers a woman in a simple hitchhiking to a furious customer who - taking her for guilty of scratching her car - beats her naturally. To complete the examples, we find the boyfriend of the man in the "master-slave" couple - after having abused her collectively - threatening and humiliating the first "in her interest" because she would get rid of her partner and would take for her. "control". All the while, the inhabitants of the recently built neighborhood in which the action takes place lie under the hot summer sun - absolutely immobile (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic representation of the archaic structures that still reign in the relations between men and women, but what I have seen has convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a useful tool to teach what's wrong with the least sensitive viewer - thanks to good visualization.
