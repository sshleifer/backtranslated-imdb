Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who is forced to retire after being forced to save the life of his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) when he stumbles a job by completing the theft of 50 cars from his brother one night. He has to gather his old crew whom he can trust to help him get out and get his brother out of Dutch. But the cops are on him, so can he get out? It was one of the best candidates of a film to redo because the original was far from being a classic. And if you do not wait a lot, and disable the thinking part of your brain to ignore the plot and take the film for what it is. You will end up enjoying the ride. Watch it on a double bill with "The Fast and the Furious" for a night of hijinks at high speed, but do not run the car right after. <br /> <br /> My note: B - <br /> <br /> DVD supplements: Jerry Bruckheimer interview of 7 minutes; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Action Overload: Highlight the reel; The big hunt; "0 to 60" featurette; Featurette "Wild Rides"; Moving stars; The video "Painted On The Heart" of the cult; Theatrical trailer and trailers for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"
