I was looking at this for the first time in a long time - I had forgotten how imaginative the images were and how spiritual the film was. I did not, however, forget the opening scenes that appear (with the Candlelight Club at Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic ever filmed. Anyone interested in politics or history will love the casual references of the film - Hunter-Niven will appeal to all lovers of romance, and those who love visual imagery will appreciate the representation of the afterlife. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie is "Odd Man Out" shot almost at the same time - but this one is superb. <br /> <br />
