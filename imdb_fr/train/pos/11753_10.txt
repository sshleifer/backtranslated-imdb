Hi I'm from Taft California and I love this movie because it shows how much we, the inhabitants of small towns, love our sports football is the main thing in Taft and this film shows how important it is that I personally think they should do another one but instead of the actors we use the kids to play the games show us our determination we beat Bakersfield every game for 6 years and since I was senior next year c is my last chance and then his college we had the semis in the lead state and I'm next if you want to know me, I'm Kyle Taylor and I average on average seven to eight yards per carry and about five times a bad match escape on a 75 or around this yard race in order to consult us on our website and go to our sports page bye
