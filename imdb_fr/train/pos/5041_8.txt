Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Constable Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer pursued by the FBI. When Constable Doyle arrives at the office, he tells him that the serial killer is his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks for evidence and the man tells the story of his life since childhood. It was a simple family of three: his father, widow Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father gathered the two brothers and told them that an angel of God had just visited him and instructed his family to destroy the demons. What happens next is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago in VHS and yesterday, I watched it, now on DVD. Although it is a low-budget film, the scenario is clear, flawless. The cast is outstanding, but I would like to recognize Matt O'Leary's performance as a young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to play by a young teenager. The management of Bill Paxton is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. An excellent start behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this movie: 'A Mão do Diabo' (The hand of the devil). If at least it was "The hand of God", it might be acceptable. But to qualify this film as "devil's hand" is indeed ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the screenwriter, did not deserve such disrespect from the Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("The hand of the devil")
