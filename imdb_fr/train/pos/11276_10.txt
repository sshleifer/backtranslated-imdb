Hard to believe, perhaps, but this film has been denounced as immoral by more pulpits than any other film produced before the imposition of the Hayes bluenose code. Yes, indeed, the priests told their flocks that whoever was going to see this film was committing a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I do not tell that. They had several reasons, as follows: <br /> <br /> Article: Jane loves sex. She and Tarzan are photographed waking up one morning in their shelter at the top of the trees. She stretches sensually, and with a coquettish look she says "Tarzan, you're a bad boy!" So, not only did they have sex, they also had naughty sex! A few years later, under the Hays Code, people (especially women) were not supposed to enjoy sex. <br /> <br /> Subject: Jane prefers a savage, a wise and resourceful man (Tarzan). to a respectable man from nine to five, civilized (Holt). When Holt first seduces her with a pretty London dress, she wavers a little; When Holt tries to kill Tarzan, and Holt and Jane both think he's dead, she hesitates a lot. But when she realizes that her man is very alive, the attractions of civilization disappear for her. And why not? The relationship between Tarzan and Jane is egalitarian: he lacks the "civilized" insecurity that would force him to assert himself as "the head of his wife." In addition, he still lacks many "civilized" things, such as jealousy. When Holt and his friend arrive, Tarzan greets them cordially, knowing full well that Holt is Jane's old flame. When Holt dons her in a London dress and slowly dances with her on a portable phonograph, Tarzan falls from a tree and pulls his knife. Jealous? Nope. He's just cautious about the strange music machine, since he's never seen it before. Once that's explained, it's cool. <br /> <br /> Subject: Holt civilized with dirty mind. Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy. As Jane slips into Holt's tube tent, Holt begins to look at his figure as she changes to formal wear. On the other hand, once Tarzan took off the dress, threw it into the hole of the pool and plunged after it, the most erotic nudity scene of all the movies follows: the couple spends five minutes in a charming aquatic ballet. filmed in three versions - dressed, topless and nude - the scene was cut before the release of the film, but the nude version is restored in the video available now.) And when Jane emerges, and Cheetah the chimpume steals her dress just for teasing, Jane says her irritation is only due to the proximity of "civilized" men and their hangups. Where is the "universal prurience" so dear to the hearts of seminarians? Nowhere is where. Another reason why the group considered this film as a sin. <br /> <br /> Article: The notion that man is the crown of creation, and that animals are here only for its comfort and use, suffered severe beating. Holt and his friend want to be guided to the "Elephant Cemetery" so that they can pick up the ivory and bring it home. They want Tarzan to guide them to this cemetery. You, reader, think "Big luck!" And you are right. He is shocked. He exclaims "Elephants are sleeping!" which explains everything to him. Jane explains Tarzan's feelings, which both "gentlemen" find ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Subject: Jane, the ex-civilized woman, shows much more resources than the two civilized men she accompanies. Holt and his friend blow and are besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. It's Jane who keeps her cool. While the boys panic, she takes things in hand, barks the orders and distributes the rifles. <br /> <br /> Subject: Jane's costume is a kind of poncho with nothing under it. (The original idea was that she was shirtless, the foliage artistically blocking her nipples, as is the case in a brief scene.) <br /> <br /> Finally, several men of the fabric complained from the fact that the film called "Tarzan and his companion" rather than "Tarzan and his wife." No comment! <br /> <br /> Of course, Tarzan, cared for by his friends ape, comes to the rescue, defeats the white hunters and incites elephants and African carriers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place of where he came from. The end. <br /> <br /> You have arrived there. A totally subversive film. Like all the other films about complex and interesting women (see, for example, Possessed with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey) that were such a fluid genre in the early 1930s and were abruptly terminated by the adoption of the Hays Code . <br /> <br /> The joie de vivre of this film is best expressed in Jane's soprano version of the famous Tarzan cry. A nice touch, which has unfortunately been abandoned in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's listen to him for artistic freedom, feminist Jane and sex.
