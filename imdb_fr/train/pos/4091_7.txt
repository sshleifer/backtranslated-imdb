I saw this film in a London cinema in 1975 and have not seen it since. I found it hilarious. I loved it's originality. It's rare for someone to make a film like this - and it's sad too. <br /> <br /> I mean, I've already read a book called "The Black Hotel" - and, as a film buff, I always "picture" books like movies. A little "adapt them", you know? But reading it, I thought it would make a good movie - but of course, it would have to be "adapted" - so much so that it would have little to do with the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, well WHY? Of course, it could never be broadcast on television on Sunday afternoons, but as long as it was broadcast in cinemas to ADULTTS, who knew what it contained, where is the HARM? Damn, my civil liberties were crushed here. A director SHOULD be able to literally adapt the movie "The Black Hotel". <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, censorship of adult films should not EXIST. But unfortunately, although I agree that with INTELLIGENT adults, such freedom could be harmless, there would always be some who would not have the rationality to differentiate between fantasy and reality, and who might be incited to commit foul acts. <br /> <However, it is difficult to see how "La Bete" falls into this category. <br /> <br /> When he appeared in England, the British censorship dismissed him. Despite the relaxation on 1969 nudity, given the theoretical theme of bestiality in the film, if the censor had managed to EVERYTHING, he was looking for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> BUT ... in those days, there was an alternative. G.L.C. It was a local town council with a department that had the power to pass a film just for London, where the public was considered more "sophisticated" than those who lived in sticks. <br /> <br /> The film was duly submitted and PAST. However, it later emerged that the "council" consisted of only four people - three having voted, plus one "president". And that day, one of the voters was sick. So, the two remaining voters and the president sat down to watch "The Beast". <br /> <br /> One of these voters thought, like me, that the film was hilarious and that it was unlikely that it would encourage rascals. The other lacked imagination and simply thought the room was disgusting. And the president did not understand. He therefore decided to privilege LIBERTÃ‰. <br /> <br /> When the missing voter finally saw the movie, they also found it disgusting, but it was TOO LATE! The film had received its "X-London" certificate and was open to mixed reactions. G.L.C. The censorship of the film was dissolved soon after! This is how "La Bete" was only opened in London by what could be called a FLUKE! But I'm glad it is. It's good! If you have not seen it, do it. It's a fantasy, and as such, it's a lot less disturbing than most things you see in the news these days ...
