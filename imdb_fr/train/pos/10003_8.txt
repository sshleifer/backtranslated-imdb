This is not the typical movie of Mel Brooks. It was a lot less cheerful than most of his films and was actually a plot that was to follow. Leslie Ann Warren did the movie, she is a fantastic and underrated actress. Some moments could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes might have been cut to make room to do it, but overall, it's worth the cost of renting and seeing it. The acting was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his features talking directly to the audience. Once again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but "Fume" and "Sailor" both played well.
