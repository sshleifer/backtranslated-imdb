If the very thought of Arthur Askey twists your guts, do not worry, you can still watch and love The Ghost Train, as the equally wonderful Back Room Boy is a movie that is just too good to be considered by one. performance, even that of the main actor. Personally, I love Askey, maybe it's because I'm going into his world, rather than waiting unreasonably for him to come into mine, which is a mistake that too many people commit . The ghost train is so intense that you can not look at it without being surprised by the dark, deep world in which it is transporting you. It is immersive so that few cheap and cheerful flag agitators have managed to find themselves during the desperate start. 40 and it's a film I imagine that few people have ever watched once. The actors are, without exception, extraordinarily good, maybe Linden Travers puts it a little heavy, but in front of an isolated station in time of war, it could hardly play the game without being noticed. The tragic death of the charming Carole Lynne at the beginning of the year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and it is now a thing of the past, but we wait patiently for support of the game.
