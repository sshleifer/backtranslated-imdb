Yaitate !! Japan is a really fun show and I really like it! It was broadcast recently in our country on Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. This is Azuma Kazuma who is trying to realize his dream of making Japanese bread that will represent his country. He works in the south branch of Toyo in Pantasia and he also helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) and other bakers (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) beat Saint-Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They fight against other bakers in many other countries and learn not only to make different types of bread, but also to cook other foods. It's a really fun and unique anime, as they also mimic other anime characters (like Naruto, Inspector Conan and One Piece) and famous real-life characters. This is one of Takashi Haschiguchi's best works and is truly a must for people of different ages.
