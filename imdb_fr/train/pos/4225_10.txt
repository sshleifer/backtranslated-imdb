Ruth Gordon is one of the friendliest killers Columbo has had to face. And the plot is ingenious all around. This is one of the best episodes of Columbo. Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles. And Peter Falk offers a little something extra in his scenes with Gordon.
