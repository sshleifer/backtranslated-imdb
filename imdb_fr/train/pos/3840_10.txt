Jerome Crabbe plays the lead role in this film. I saw this film 6 times and I'm still not tired. This film is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all the Dutch films of Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the largest directors. I saw all his movies except Showgirls. My mother does not like it so much, but I do not agree. I think all his movies are a walk to look at especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith has directed some of his films, including Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I hope Jerry Goldsmith will never die. The Dutch films are different but remain pleasant.
