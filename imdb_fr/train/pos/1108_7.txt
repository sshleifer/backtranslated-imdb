Some of Altman's recognized "masterpieces" seem to me sadder now. It may be me. Like the last review, I like this "minor" Altman (recently released on FMC), although I do not think it was aimed at a large audience. Organizational politics as "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of this satirical "docudrama" are now dated, like Dick Cavett watching the show Tonight Show, but I found some of the dialogue funny and insightful (for example, "You are for real. 'are a threat to anyone'). The story is not "deep", but I liked it. And the performances are amusing, especially Cavett (as "himself"), Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative figurehead, Glenda Jackson (who even became a member of Parliament) as a leftist ideologist ( in the opening scene, giving voice to someone dressed on the sanctity of politics) and Carol Burnett as a criminal record. All in the unique style Altman, although perhaps not as inimitable as usual. But quite inimitable.
