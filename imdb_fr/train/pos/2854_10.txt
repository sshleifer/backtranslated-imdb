Much has already been said about this film and I would like to join those who praised it. It is a very unique film that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without spoiling it. At times, you laugh hard, at other times you feel feelings for the characters you look at mistakes and failures. The genius of Sabu can be shown with regard to certain sequences of the film. The first is where the three men who are chasing each other dream about the eroticism of a young woman they had just passed on the street. This sequence is beautifully done and illustrates very well the characters of the three riders. It's both erotic and fun. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the film where the runners are tired. The first of them, the typical loser among the three guys, hallucinates that the woman who left him for someone else is back and you see them dancing between them and that in the next shot he dance with himself, which is deeply moving. All runners arrive at this point where they think they have lost something in return or be on the right track. And at one point in the movie, they stop chasing each other, queuing, laughing. So that's all the beauty and ridicule of what we call the life that Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His characters fail (do they do it in the end?) But he does not take away their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" that do justice to Sabu's claim that he is a genius. Go watch them! <br /> <br />
