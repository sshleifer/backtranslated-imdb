FREDDY went from scary to funny, in this 6th installment of the Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> It's been 2 years, and actually 11 since the movie was shot in 2001. And FREDDY has killed all the Elm Street kids except one, John Doe (Jacobb from part 5, and even the film gives clue about who he is), in which he uses to bring more children to come to Elm Street. Not only does FREDDY get his wishes, but he gets his daughter in Elm Street. When she finds out what's going on, she and other kids decide to kill FREDDY once and for all. We also have the opportunity to see FREDDY's strange experiences. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, Many people hate this movie, but I liked it. He tried to bring out what FREDDY was doing with his scoffers ... COMDEY and makes the series funnier than frightening So, this movie is really a comrade to talk about. This is not the wreck of the series, part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
