"Footlight Parade" fascinates on so many levels. Of course, the "theater prologues" allegedly staged could not have been produced in any theater on earth. Think of big pools and big three-story fountains for "By A Waterfall," for example. (Berkeley directed John Garfield in "They made me a criminal" six years later and the Dead End Kids sang "By a Waterfall" as they showered.) <br /> <br /> " Shanghai Lil "is the best production number in the picture. It is a catalog of sensitivities of the 30s of Warner Bros. Note the African guys mixed up in the scene with white and Asian prostitutes. Blacks would never be integrated into a social scene in other films of that period unless they were carrying on a train or servants in a big house. Here, the blacks sit at the bar and sing with the others. I also feel enthusiasm when the military dancers present Roosevelt's image in a "map section". There is also the NRA eagle - the logo of the controversial National New Deal Recovery Administration. FDR was the new president and the hopes were so great that he would take the country out of the depression. You would never see anything so focused on the outgoing MGM working class, of course. Warner Bros. fully supported the uprising dictated by the F.D.R. administration. <br /> <br /> Dear Miss Ruby Keeler has never been better than she plays the Chinese whore "Lil". She barely even observes her feet as she dances, which was one of her signature flaws. <br /> <br /> The pre-code is fun. The number "By a waterfall" is wonderful in this respect. The girls put on their swimsuits in the crowded bus that crossed Times Square with all its lights on. The girls with the elongated eagle passing over the camera provide the kind of crotch pictures that we would not see before age 35. In a few months, the Code of Production would eliminate such naughty pleasures.
