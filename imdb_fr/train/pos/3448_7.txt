A documentary without loss of words ... never ... <br /> <br /> Suppose the narration is more than a parody, suppose it is a commentary on Japanese society. And as this film is a documentary as absurd as it is rhythmic, the constant word game, as fast as it is, is as mediocre as translated, in its current version of the festival evaluator such as the one seen tonight at Copenhagen Cinematek. - is still very nice. <br /> <br /> But for the patient, and ONLY for the patient and the open mind, I'm talking to you, Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses, I believe this film is for you. It's a smart movie if you allow it to seduce you. <br /> <br /> Fairly beautiful, and quite kitsch, and enough Japanese subculture. And quite experimental. 2D static in a 3D world. In the end, fun for those who want to see a Japanese film that parodies the Japanese culinary culture. Well done if you want something completely different.
