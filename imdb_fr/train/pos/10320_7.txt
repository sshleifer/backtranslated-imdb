*** Spoilers possible *** <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and I'm happy to see that he laughed in the right places and was delighted by the sequences Action. Ron Ely is just like Doc. Cool, calm, almost always in control (and with an occasional nod). What more can you ask for? I've never read a Doc Savage book, so I do not know if it's true to the source, but I appreciated the light tone and the derring-do. Many people have compared this film to The Adventurers of the Lost Ark, which, in my opinion, is not fair. The budget difference is staggering (the Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the important localization work of Raiders. The special effects are also minimal, but go ahead, the story is very entertaining and the humor is right. Sousa's music is catchy (I love this theme song - every time I watch the movie, I end up humming the theme for days). The best way to approach this movie is to simply relax and enjoy. Highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the five fabulous and Doc chase the Indian sniper on the rooftops of New York, as well as the VERY fun fights sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. The villain who sleeps in a giant cradle is not so good (really!). Overall, a good movie to watch a rainy day. I give 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thank you to the Lord for being here!
