Moonwalker is probably not the movie to watch if you're not a fan of Michael Jackson. I am a big fan and I enjoyed the majority of the film. The end is not fantastic, but the first 50 minutes or so have been - if you're a fan. <br /> <br /> Personally, I believe that the first 50 minutes minutes are rediscoverable several times. The dance in each video is breathtaking, the fantastic music to listen to and the entertaining dialogues. <br /> <br /> It includes many of Bad's best videos and excerpts from his previous videos. It also includes excerpts from concerts. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Michael Jackson, it's a must, if you're not a fan / you do not like Michael Jackson, be clear. <br /> <br /> 9/10
