There is not a single Scorsese movie I would place on a list of my favorite movies. But it's the best thing I've done with my DVD player for about five years. Scorsese's patient elucidation of her movie's favorite moments and the way Hollywood works is incredibly courteous, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> This is 3 DVD-sided material. It should be a British production because everything about the American corporate culture would have flouted the unobtrusive, methodical, no-frills, content-driven approach that is adopted here. And an American production would have required him to say that he only liked films that were popular. I wish everyone took a page of his love for movies. You should love the movies you do for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. Not just more votes "Me too" for The Godfather, etc. People have no idea of ​​the ideas explored in their favorite movies. If they did, the films would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese SHOWS which ideas are explored, making it a compelling and involved speaker on the subject. I really appreciate his articulate and generous interviews of the last decade. <br /> <br /> On a negative note, Scorsese is the best player when he is excited to show you an obscure movie, rather than teaching you something well established. about the story of the film. And I wish he pulled those three hairs off the bridge of his nose. It's very entertaining.
