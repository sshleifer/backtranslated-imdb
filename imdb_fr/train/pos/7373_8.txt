Before the usual comments, my main curiosity about This Is Not A Love Song is that, even though the running time indicated on IMDb is 94 minutes, the DVD of Wellspring Media in the United States lasts 88 minutes. Any contribution on this subject is appreciated! <br /> <br /> Two very difficult friends hit the road for an adventure. In the end, they find themselves in a situation where an accidental gunman has killed a girl and the two have fled on foot into the countryside. Rather than mere chases, the film is complicated by Spike's silly and rather childlike behavior, which behaves inappropriately and holds his boom box like a teddy bear. Some viewers may not like the story based solely on Spike's character, but without a little frustration, the movie would have been too easy. You'll notice that the more stable character, Heaton, calls Spike "big man" as opposed to Spike's "out of control" attitude and behavior. Frankly, Spike's ridiculous actions also made me worse. In particular, the spray can sniff, but in a desperate situation, it is obvious that someone of his mentality would choose a temporary escape. But Heaton was there to keep control until everything went over his head. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan, Heaton being a marvel, and after a while, I stopped wondering why he wanted to pick up Spike from prison and continue a friendship, because of Glenaan's great performance. After all, there are plenty of reasons during their race that would be a good idea for Heaton to simply drop Spike and try to save himself. I suppose Heaton felt like Spike's older protector brother and that the loyalty between the two is hard to break - as long as the situation is not too desperate. <br /> <br /> Part of the cinematography is actually artistic, but it more flavor to tell instead of just photographing men running in the desert. The beautiful landscapes, the rain and the vast gray sky offer a dark tone that increases the sensation of tragic circumstances. The score is also unusual, and the use of Public Image Ltd.'s song "This Is Not A Love Song" and the title of the movie are quite intelligent. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is understandable THAT IT IS NOT A SINGING LOVE, because it focuses on two different personalities who escape from another man determined to chase them (played by a cool and calm David Bradley). It's not a big-budget action entertainment. For the rest of us who like to look for something minimal and dramatic, it's a time worth spending, and it offers extremely tense moments that hold you back a bit. You really appreciate the films recently released from Scotland, with movies like this one, Dog Soldiers and The Devil's Tattoo. I am also a little grateful for the subtitles on this DVD, because the accents are sometimes extremely fast and difficult to understand for some viewers like me. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, dark and often tense, THIS IS NOT A SINGING LOVE is a very tragic and yet captivating story. <br /> <br />
