David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes embody a young couple of journalists who want to travel to California, but can not really afford it, so they "go on an adventure" with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save on expenses. so that they stop at various places of murder along the way, sites where serial killers acted, since Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they do not know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis is a serial killer and a girlfriend who adheres to everything he's been told. As a rule, I do not care about Pitt, but he does justice to psycho roles. What is frightening is that he does them so well; Like him before, no, not killers, but with almost the same state of mind. Anyway, as the journey progresses, Carrie will guess that the others are running out of money, but Earley still seems to get his money's worth .. .. never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though. Lewis is doing her part in us A film in which she excels, a voice not too bright, that has a heart, but does not understand that she does not have to be beaten by Earley when she does something that he does not do not like. As things start to become more unacceptable, Carrie insists that the other couple be sent to a gas station. Unfortunately, that's when she's in the house where she sees a newscast that tells her exactly who they're sharing with, and then things get worse quickly. It's not the best movie in the world, but it's not bad ... I looked at what was supposed to be the "unclassified" version, but I'm wondering how much was cut in the rated version, because it seemed pretty tame, really ... not that it makes the family fare or anything, unless it may be the Manson family. 7 out of 10
