This film is a revelation for those who can only know the glamorous lifestyle of the stars. It tells you how people who want to do good can not. In addition, the scene of the explosion of a bomb is very real. <br /> <br /> What you read and learn just does not happen !!! <br /> <br /> Can increase your blood pressure level by 10% <br /> <br /> All the actors played their role very well. <br /> <br /> Some scenes could have been avoided to include teenagers. <br /> <br /> This film is quite adult in nature. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that can be seen in family. <br /> <br /> The casting is awesome !!!
