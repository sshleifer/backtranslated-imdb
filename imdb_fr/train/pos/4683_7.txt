(Question) What do you call 100 movie critics buried under the sand? (Answer) A good start. Well, I do not know Adam's Peter Mattei, but if he is the budding author, his filmography suggests that "Love at the time of money" is a "good start". A classy shoot with whimsical music box style music, this film depicts a string of tenuous relationships moving from person A to person B to person C ... etc. . The film gently examines the unfortunate circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shadows beginning and ending with a street prostitute and her client. The disadvantage of this film is the absence of a story that could have a link with the many critical critics it has received. I watched the monster "Angels in America" ​​last night and was bored at the end while this little concatenation of character studies held me to the lot. Pay attention. I may be the only person who really liked this movie. (B)
