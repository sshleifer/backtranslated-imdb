Chris and Andr√© are two ordinary teenagers. Misunderstood by some and chosen by others. But together, they stand and will all pay. Together, they form "The Army of Two". They organize and plan "Zero Day". That day, they decide to storm their high school and inevitably murder 14 people in cold blood. Told through the bands they made "Zero Day," it's barely a fictional tale of the Columbine tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of those movies that will bother you later. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) are doing such a good job that their characters look like almost all the teenagers without rights who walk on the streets. Their performances were very believable, you liked those guys a bit and it was scary. Shot in video almost completely from the teenager's point of view, "Zero Day" seems very real and authentic, as if you were there. These kids are trying to rationalize their actions for the viewer and the actors are selling it to you. But be warned that it follows the tragedy from beginning to end and that the end makes it shocking and disturbing for some.
