Years ago, I watched a soap opera on television. So I was curious to know this movie and I was so rewarded for finding it. It is a wonderful parody of soap operas, with jealousy, the insecurity of the usual actors and all kinds of beautiful excesses. But most of all - an incredible cast and screenplay. How to make all these leading actors play in such a stupid movie? And how did this little film lead the authors to write the perfect lines? I have never heard anyone talk about this movie or even admit to hearing about it, but it's wonderful and I highly recommend seeing it. Sometimes I put it on while doing housework, and I finally sit on the couch watching, laughing and enjoying all that is wonderful. Many congratulations to all who did it.
