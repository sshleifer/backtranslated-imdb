After Dark, My Sweet is a big modern black, filled with shabby characters, dirt roads and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most real blacks of the last two or three decades have been in the South, where men shine and ladies, um, shine too. Why? Because it's hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks better wet (at least men, sweaty women leave me moist). <br /> <br /> Anyway, there could be spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This film is a great example of all that a black should be: a steady pace (even if some attention disorders call it "slow"), clearly and broadly drawn characters (although not simple), and tons of atmosphere. Black, if it is, concerns moods and attitudes. That's why the big guys are not marked by your traditional definitions of "big" acting (watch Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were anything but real - but they had style, cold blood and crime movie that is exactly what you want). or quick adventures (again, all the big blacks seem to burn slowly like a cigarette). The big blacks create an environment and you live it with the characters for a few hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet lets you do it - and lets you enjoy the company of very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie intrigue - never allowing the audience to know what really motivates them - and Patric and Dern (I love Bruce Dern, by the way) are perfect, especially Dern (see previous comment). They take the basic contours of a character and give them depth and arouse our sympathies. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also interesting. There are better plots in the dark world (there is virtually no mystery here - it's mostly suspense), but this one is solid. In reality, the plot simply "acceptable" has more to do with the writing of Jim Thompson than anything else. With Thompson, the plots are almost secondary; he avoided the labyrinthine tales of Hammett and Chandler for simpler stories with stronger and more confusing characters. Look at a novel like The Killer Inside Me and you'll see what it's all about. When it comes to Thompson, it's not what it's about, it's like that (to quote Roger Ebert). So, really, the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the question and, if you do not like it, well jokes about you. <br /> <br /> This is an 8 star movie rather than 10 stars, because of the female lead role. It's not bad in itself, but it's not Angelica Huston or Anette (see Jim Thompson's adaptation of The Grifters if you do not know what I'm talking about - other than it's a better movie and that you should start there for contemporary black - it's the best of the 1990s and defies Blood Simple for the best title since Chinatown). She just does not have the chops (or appearance, by the way) and although she and Patric have some chemistry, I do not have it with her. So the.
