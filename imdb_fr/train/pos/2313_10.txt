This "adult" film tells the stories of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, who discover life and love a fateful summer. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his superb work in "To Kill a Mockingbird", the film never hits a wrong note. All the game is superb. As a Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a start of an amazing movie. Looking at this beautifully photographed and beautifully directed film, I felt like I was looking through a window of reality, rather than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at least 5 times and I can honestly say it's one of the best movies ever made about youth, love and feelings, challenges and changes of young age. Families with children aged 10 to 15 should watch the film together and use it as a topic of discussion, as this raises a number of issues regarding sibling rivalry, love management, responsibilities from a parent, etc.
