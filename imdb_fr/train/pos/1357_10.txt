Wow what episode! After seeing Mellisa constantly comment on Annie and Brandi's friendship last week, I almost vomited. But it was nothing until seeing Mellisa's tirade after being fired. To see her heckling over her cast spewing obscenities and screaming for someone to get her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing about reality TV. She kept shouting at people who were about to take their clothes, as if someone else was wearing one of her hideous clothes. Mellisa, are you 40 years old and still have tantrums? Then Joan starts calling Annie and Brandie all the names in the book, then gets up and leaves the show! The two rivers are spoiled kids who have only been left on the show for so long to keep the odds. Mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview, simply proves to America what everyone thought, you are a spoiled baby. WAH WAH I can not manage! I love how Annie told the cameras that she could manipulate Mellisa to think her way, then she did just that. Mellisa is by far the smartest candidate and clearly deserves to win the match.
