One of the greatest hits of 1926, Brown of Harvard is an exciting dramatic comedy featuring regatta and football scenes that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a big star. Haines is all that there is a patentee: a smart man who takes nothing seriously, until he is rejected by everyone, becomes a man / hero and wins the girl. Nobody worked this formula like Haines. An awesome comedic actor (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines could go from comedy to tragedy with a change of facial expression. It is a total joy in this film as it was in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is fine as the girl, Jack Pickford is very good as the sickly roommate, Ralph Bushman is the rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams and Grady Sutton co-star. This film is now known for its homoerotic relationships between Haines and Pickford and for his film debut as a football player at Yale (but I've never seen him before). Haines was one of the five box-office stars since 1932. It's unfortunate that he has been largely forgotten and most of his films seem to have been lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
