I just finished watching the 139 min version (widescreen) with friends and we were blown away. I will not mind repeating what others have said. What filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The huge battle is exhausting. We were then stunned to see that there was still 30 minutes left, but that did not stop us from being fully involved and entertained. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that almost ruined it and it's the horrible music / songs. The Blues, Country / Folk and Rock ballads do not belong to us and every time they are used, we burst out laughing. It's hideous. You have been warned, but the story and narration keep you rooted. <br /> <br /> Several exceptional moments allow you to appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence as well as slow motion photography that work wonders. I really wish I could erase the music, but alas. <br /> <br /> Look for this. It's fun, it's different and it takes you to unexpected places and it's very refreshing.
