"Masks" is a moving film that works on many levels. In its simplest form, it is the haunting story of a street artist who connects with a young child while trying to pass on his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Even if, at times, history makes the old man a job, he is so well conceived (written values, interpreted, directed, marvelous values ​​of production) that it is easy to go beyond his fate. And, if you stick to that, the film is finally very sweet and inspiring. Kudos all around. It's a wonderful movie for kids as well as adults. The trick is to make sure that Americans who do not like foreign language movies see it!
