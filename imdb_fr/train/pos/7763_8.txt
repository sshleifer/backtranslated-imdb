One thing about Hollywood, someone is successful and he is always in a hurry to be copied. Another problem is that players give some of their best performances outside their studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson has received such praise for his performance in the Texas-based giant movie, which Universal's executives have certainly thought of. in another modern Texas setting. <br /> <br /> In the same way, Robert Stack got great reviews for The High and the Mighty, the cracking pilot under the weight of a damaged plane that was natural to give him another crack . square. <br /> <br /> These two goals were achieved in Written on the Wind. Before Hudson owned a ranch, he is now the son of a hunting companion to Robert Stack's father who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, James Dean separated from James Dean's racism without the racism of James Dean. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency used by Stack's Hadley Oil Company. Hudson likes it, but she is dazzled by the millions of Stack and when he woo a girl, he has the means to really run a campaign. She marries Stack. <br /> <br /> Finally, Dorothy Malone is the amorous sister of Stack, who has a yen for Rock, but Rock is not about to get confused with this wild kid. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone spent more than 10 years in a lot of heroin roles of colorless films before landing this gem. She was awarded Best Supporting Actress for her role as Marilee Hadley and the merit was well deserved. <br /> <br /> If you like the splashing 1950s technicolor soap opera, this movie is for you.
