I always liked this film by John Frankenheimer. Elmore Leonard's good storyline and the main reason why it's not another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His tense direction and attention to small details make all the difference, he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can argue that this is the last good film directed by Roy Scheider. I always said that Robert Trebor gave a fantastic performance. Clarence Williams III had all the publicity with his scary performance and he is also excellent but I really thought Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as other films, but it's an effective thriller filled with blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real porn actors that appear in sordid scenes. What can you say about a film in which Ann Margaret is a victim of drugs and rape? A guilty pleasure for the least. Vanity has a really bad role and a very young Kelly Preston makes her first appearance. A classic operating thriller that must not be forgotten.
