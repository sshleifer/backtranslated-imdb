"Hitler: The increase of the evil" was the subject of controversy before its diffusion. This controversy could mask the success of the film. <br /> <br /> Those who criticized the film, which they had not seen, did so with good intentions, on the basis of the erroneous thought that it would be too sympathetic to Hitler. However, they misunderstood the point: humanize evil Hitler does not sympathize with him. It is far more unsettling to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of the greatest villains in history have been committed by a human being. A sick maniac, sick, certainly, but a human being nevertheless. It is necessary to know the story of how Hitler came to power to prevent this from happening again. <br /> <br /> "Rise of Evil" is highlighted by a brilliantly better performance of his Robert Carlyle career, which makes Hitler a human being without ever buying him back in any way. Carlyle perfectly captures the look and manners of the Nazi leader, without ever letting the imitation become caricatural or distancing (something that Anthony Hopkins was not able to realize when he described Hitler in "The Bunker", another very good movie for TV movie). Although repelled by Hitler's virulent depravity and anti-Semitism, Carlyle conferred on him a certain magnetism and power that the real Adolf Hitler had to possess. After all, would a nation have followed him? <br /> <br /> Of the various subplots, the most fascinating are by far the most fascinating features of Matthew Modine as a journalist Fritz Gehrlich, who devoted himself all his life to drawing attention to the reality of Hitler and Nazism. While the performance of Modine is a little scalded in the first part, it seems to have settled in the second part, but the character offers us a real hero in a movie full of villains. Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also provide important support. <br /> <br /> The first part of this mini-series in two parts has suffered a little from its excessive agitation, including a look at Hitler's childhood that lasts only the duration of the opening. credits. And in the second part, sections detailing the relationship between Hitler and his niece and mistress Eva Braun are less successful than the central plot, but allow us to better understand his mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> In the end, no film about Hitler can make us understand it. Fortunately, the average person is unable to understand a man attempting to exterminate an entire race. "Hitler: The Rise of Evil" tries less to make us understand Hitler, and even more to make us understand how he became the power. This is an important story to tell and it is impossible to believe that anyone who saw the film would accuse him of having anything but the best intentions in the world and the ability to do anything but good. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10. *** 1/2
