I did not expect much when I saw the jacket of the DVD. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl ?? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but the story started, then it took place in a beautifully photographed and rhythmic film. I was surprised and delighted with this (basically) true story. It made me want to know more about this fascinating character, which means that the director has fulfilled his role and that the film was a success!
