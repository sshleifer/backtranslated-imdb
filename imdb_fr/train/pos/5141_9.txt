I must admit that I did not expect much to see this film in my class of Japanese film, but this film really blew me away. The director does a great job with the title of his film, truly portraying an image of madness. I think that the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness, helping the viewer to experience the inner world of characters rather than the outside world to his mind. This film has just added to my feelings about foreign silent films compared to American films, in that foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than aiming at the fluffy film with always an end happy, exercising little imagination.
