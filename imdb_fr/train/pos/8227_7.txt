An interesting thriller that has Paul Winfield as a detective on the case of a murder. Paul Winfield was an underrated actor who played all his roles with such ease that it was hard to say that the man was even playing. Perhaps best known by young viewers as the voice / narrator of "City Confidential", Winfield ends his career with a mediocre film; but as always, Winfield shines. A treat to watch. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak is fine, Erika Eliniak, nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the interim department. Although, to be fair, this is one of his best efforts. <br /> <br /> Final result: a watchable thriller that no Paul Winfield fan should miss. A decent TV movie to help send Paul Winfield to celluloid heaven. Which actor. We will miss him.
