It's a rare opportunity when I want to see a movie again. "Girls Amati" is such a movie. In the old movie theaters, I would have stayed in place for more screenings. Was this story autobiographical for the screenwriter / director? He has the aura of reality. <br /> <br /> Featured actors present their characters in a believable and tender way. Who would not want Mercedes Ruehl to be an older sister? I love her work since "For Roseanna". <br /> <br /> In most films, we suspend the idea, because we know that it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. suspend this belief in "The Amati Girls". We feel such a part of this family! How I wanted to come to Dolores' defense when his family stifled his emotional life. And I wanted to encourage Lee Grant as she criticized Cloris Leachman's hair color. Humor is not ridiculous, but rather a quality of well-being that satisfies much more than falls and others. <br /> <br /> Love portrayed in this film family must be imitated and cherished. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that the surname, Amati, translates from Italian means "dear ones".
