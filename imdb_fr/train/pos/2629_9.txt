I was not sure when I heard about it. I thought how stupid Disney became. I was wrong. I found it very well. I mean it's not the Lion King but it's cool to see another side from a certain point. It was very funny. Also, it was not one of those nerdy disney suites where the entertainment was so bad, it was like the animation of the Lion King. The only thing that provoked me was the whole movie thing all along the movie. Do not give anything but you will know what I am talking about. I also had fun thinking that it was cool to have the majority of the original actors coming back. It was a very good movie in the end.
