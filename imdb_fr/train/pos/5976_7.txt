Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This zany episode of a film revolves around Heavy Metal culture and horror movies of the 80s - two things I really like. So, as you can imagine, this movie pleased me easily. Moreover, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays the role of a preacher. <br /> <br /> This film is about an unpopular young student who, like all the losers, found himself immersed in a world of "bad guy" Heavy Metal. His favorite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected - by reading his latest unreleased album. This allows the corporified singer to kill people with demons and help him. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's sometimes pretty old-fashioned, but you know what? He has a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as DJ radio), great special effects, very short nudity, a decent atmosphere ... In the end, it's a decent horror movie. But what really fears is music. Ironic, huh? Well, this type of "uber-evil" Metal is one of the most obnoxious, the most acute and the most crying, that Motley Crue rejects on the planet - and the "Metal" is little more than fucking Pop / Hair Metal 80s. It hits all the clich√©s here, to prance like a gay fairy, to look bad, to shout "Rock and Roll !!!" in a terrain high enough to make King Diamond fall. Aside from this atrocious musical performance, it's actually quite good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
