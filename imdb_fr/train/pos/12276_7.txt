Could such ambient production have failed its primary purpose, which was to adapt Allende's novel correctly? Obviously yes. Bille August has managed to make a superficial and superficial film where the basic elements of the South American mentality are presented simply as parallel events, resulting in total incoherence. I can not believe there was a whole production team that did not understand the book! There is of course a technical quality in this film and I think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands, but something is missing. And that something was the most important part.
