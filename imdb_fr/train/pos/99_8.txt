A Christmas together actually preceded my era, but I was raised on John Denver and the songs on this special show were still those of my family. For years, we made a crackling cassette from a disc, which meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I finally found a video on Ebay. After listening to all the music for about 21 years, I was able to see John and the Muppets in action. If you have the opportunity, it's a lot of fun - good music, comforting and old-fashioned. It is also interesting to see the 1970s versions of the Muppets and compare them to their most recent versions. I think Denver actually took a little heat to do a show like this - I suppose that normally the performers do not compromise their images by singing with the Muppets, but I'm glad he did it. Even if you can not locate the video, the soundtrack is worth it. It has some traditional Muppified favorites, but also some original Denver tunes.
