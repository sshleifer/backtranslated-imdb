Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are brothers and sisters raised in single-parent families. Jasbir (the sister) grows up in a thriving environment, but that does not lead her to reject her life and join a hippie movement that will eventually lead her to drugs. Prashant (the brother) grows up in a less prosperous environment but becomes a mature gentleman. The story shows that Prashant is making efforts to save his little sister (who is perpetually in a trance) from a hostile hippie environment. This film stands the test of time, commenting that sects and hippie groups are a place for those who give up their lives when they should rather stand up and count themselves in the face of adversity. Great musical compositions in this film that mean different things in different situations and for different people, and the director gives him a strange feeling.
