Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of the show "South Park", come back with something completely different. They create a new sport combining baseball and basketball. This sport is known as baseball. It's like basketball, except Here's how you play: you just shoot the ball while these two guys are trying to distract you from the shot. The sound is simple. In fact, I might try it one day. After the success of the game In the streets, it quickly becomes a huge success. Who would have known that two immature friends could invent a sport that has been so successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> "Baseballball" is a very crude and silly parody, full of a lot of blinding violence, but that actually offers some laughter and a lot of animation. An unequivocal recommendation for those who like burlesque and rude air.
