DIG! is funny, fun, fun, interesting, stylish and very well done. Knowing that it was done with such a reduced budget in 7 years, it is amazing that such a story can be told, especially with such a style and substance. If you are a music or documentary lover, go on an adventure. <br /> <br /> Focusing on the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols over the years is a great way to show the contrast between a decent group with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a megalomaniac great singer supported by a diverse array of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol and madness. If I did not know that these are images of real people, I'd swear it's an incredibly well written and imaginative script. The story is compelling, concise and simply amazing.
