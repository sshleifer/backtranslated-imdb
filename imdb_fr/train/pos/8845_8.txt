The beginning of this movie is a little awkward and confusing, but stay seated tight as you are ready for the journey of your life. The concept is compelling, with interesting features used to tell the overall story. The performances are excellent, Phillip Seymour Hoffman being the best of the cast, no surprises. Ethan Hawke also deserves credits for a very good performance. Mr. Lumet's directive is remarkable. The film has a feeling of the seventies in the respect that risks are taken in the narrative of this story, but unlike the majority of banal films that populate the landscape, it is a thriller that is sincerely based on relationships rather than special effects or product caps. You will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film.
