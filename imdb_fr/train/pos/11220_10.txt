Aim for the summit! Gunbuster is one of those animated series that have been written in a classic way. I totally loved this series and, to this day, it remains my favorite anime. And while this is not Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster first begins to be a parody of the sports drama of the 1970s, Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!) steam like a serious drama towards the end of episode 2, when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of her father, who was killed at the first meeting of humanity with the race of insects with which humanity is at war. It is because of the death of his father that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her lack of self-confidence sometimes turns out to be embarrassing and she hesitates. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, has even doubts about Noriko's choice as a pilot. However, Koichiro Ota, Noriko's coach, has confidence in her. And he gave himself a personal mission to see if she managed to become a pilot because he survived the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. <br /> <br /> Jung-Freud, a Russian, is another character. Squadron fighter assigned to Squadron Noriko and Kazumi are among them, Smith Toren, a loving love of Noriko killed during their first outing together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's involvement is also interesting, because while Noriko is in space, Kimiko stays on Earth to lead a normal life. And because of the dilation of time, Kimiko normally ages on Earth, while Noriko is about the same age as when she left school. At the end of the series, Noriko is about 18 years old and Kimiko is about 50 years old. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's an excellent animated series to watch if you're a giant robot fan. mecha and Gainax animation. If you like other Hideaki Anno shows, or if you're a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, then give this show a chance. This will grow on you.
