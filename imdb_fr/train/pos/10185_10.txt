Seeing this movie was the most fun I've had in movies for a long time. However, I am not able to say whether it is a good film or a bad film, because such simple qualifications simply can not be applied. This image has everything a movie can have. It has the characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action film, a musical and an absurd and unconscious art film. . Everything is there to add a myth. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is an Indian couple, Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), living happily in Canada, rushing to India to visit the husband's parents after a troubling report . The rest of the story unfolds in India, where the couple find themselves in the middle of a plot of fratricidal violence. At one point, the story borrows from "Not without my baby", but calling Chakti a remake of anything would be an injustice. <br /> <br /> The narrative plot is relegated to the background by many amazing interruptions, including Shah Rukh Khan's Aishwarya Rai's dream, which comes as if it were coming out of another movie. In fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear very late in the film, and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character. Yet he is catching up with a spirited and truly unexpected performance. <br /> <br /> Karishma Kapoor is the one who has the most work to do in this film. She does an admirable job in linking the twists of the film. and shoot with a credible emotion demonstration. Another notable presence is Nana Patekar, who interprets Narsimha, the tyrannical father of husband Shekhar. Nana Patekar dominates every scene in which he finds himself with a scary but nuanced character. <br /> <br /> The film is not devoid of realism. The violence is rampant, but really disturbs the abuse suffered by most female characters, Karishma having been brutally beaten several times. Sometimes this violence is clearly disturbing, but in the end, it becomes surreal because each dramatic sequence is usually followed by turns as comical and spectacular as the general effect is only cathartic. <br /> <br /> I've seen some Bollywood releases, and the mix of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm. But "Shakti" raises the bar by absorbing an even bigger masala without becoming ridiculous. It is a film that reaches the grandeur of a Shakespearean tragedy, where the audience of the populace and royalty is equally entertained. This is pure and free cinema, and the director Krishna Vamsi had to dream of a good time by putting all the secrets of the book. Perhaps the overriding message of violence generating violence and the inspiring expanse of maternal love were not my thoughts, but I went out to look at exalted "Shakti". Making movies can be the most fun in the world!
