This is the kind of love story I like to watch. And above all, it's for two reasons. One, it focuses of young, VERY young people. People who are still teenagers and who feel love for the first time, or at least think they are. We have all been present in our lives and "Man on the Moon" is a wonderful reflection on our memories, perhaps adding some more details and improving it more than any other. The second reason is that it is a love triangle. And I think that, as a teenager, it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters can really be in love, or are so new to love it, that they are convinced that they really are, and that after a tragedy or so, they will believe it all their lives. <br /> <br /> The cast of "The Man on the Moon" is full of talented names. This stars Sam Waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well able to play tough district lawyers as well as fathers who are both strict, caring and wise, as in this film. There is also Tess Harper, Jason London and a young and young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young and talented actress at the age of fourteen and you think that about ten years she will win the Oscar. All members of the cast perform very well and, thanks to the dialogue of the convincing scenario, they are made to look like real people in real situations. As if everything had really happened. This is the kind of movie I would like to see released more often. Love story or not. I would love to see movies that make everything real and that are neither fake nor incredible.
