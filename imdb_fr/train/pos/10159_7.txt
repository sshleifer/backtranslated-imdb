There are few films or movies that I consider favorites over the years. The Gospel Road was one of them. I looked at it as a young teenager and would like to have the opportunity to watch it again. My favorite parts were the fact that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was blond, <br /> <br /> 2 / the last dinner was a very hearty meal, <br /> <br /> 3 / he loved to play with children, <br /> <br /> 4 / His death was for everyone and for all times. <br /> <br /> The film may not have been theologically correct or of high quality, but touched my heart at that time. In addition, I'm a fan of Johnny Cash and it was a brave undertaking. If it ever comes out on DVD, I will buy it only for sentimental reasons.
