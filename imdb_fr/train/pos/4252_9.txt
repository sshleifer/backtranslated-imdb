this film takes you in the first minutes and holds you to the end. he has a very human history and very good music selected. The acting game Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) is satisfying. Recommended for people who miss action movies and want to see a good movie.
