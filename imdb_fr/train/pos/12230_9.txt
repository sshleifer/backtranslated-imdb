THE MAN OF THE FUSION ... tragic victim of the race to space, he perished. MELTING ... having never understood that the race was long gone ...! <br /> <br /> A man (Burr DeBenning) burns his hand on the stove But instead of shouting something that a NORMAL person would shout, he shouts something that looks like "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" This movie in which you played ... is not a normal movie. You've just made your first steps in The INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, the famous gore movie of the late '70s featuring the wonderful makeup effects of Rick Baker. Baker was about to become a superstar and did it at the same time as his famous "extraterrestrial cantina" in STAR WARS. For some strange reason, STAR WARS has become a household name, and INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN has not. <br /> <br /> This could have something to do with the fact that this movie is just awful. According to the opening credits ("starring Alex Rebar as THE INCREDIBLE FUSION MAN" ... that's really what it says!), To the chubby nurse who passes through a glass door, at the head of the fisherman who passes over a waterfall and graphically breaks Rocks, this film provides many, many moments of pure incomprehensibility. "Why do they ... but how is it ... why are they ...?" After a while, you no longer wonder why and you look at it like what it is: a very fun waste. <br /> <br /> An astronaut returns to Earth in a state of fusion and radioactivity; he escapes and, his mind disintegrating at the same time as his body, begins a murderous madness melting. The authorities quickly decide that the melt-up man must be arrested, but (probably not wanting to "panic"), he wants to be captured as quietly as possible. So they send a guy with a Geiger counter after him. Wow. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, surprisingly little happens during the film. The melting guy wanders around killing people. A doctor looks for him with a Geiger counter. Different characters are introduced, ask questions and leave. Finally, the doctor catches the man melting, but a security guard shot him for no reason, after explaining that he was "Dr. Ted Nelson". The melting man moves away and ends up dissolving into a large mud puddle. The End. <br /> <br /> It's so disconcerting that it ends up being a lot of fun, despite a rather disappointing end. Supposedly, a widescreen DVD version is planned. A very special film.
