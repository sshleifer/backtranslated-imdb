No, there is another! <br /> <br /> Because every fan of Star Wars had to have an opinion on I, II & III and that opinion was biased because we had missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy. , I am going to expose the strong points of "Return of the Jedi" and some corresponding negative points of the previous one. Of course, I loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but that was discussed too much elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we get in the original trilogy and in this film in particular: - A strong ecological concern - Anti-militarist positions - Fascinating ideas about the Jedi order and the Force - Cute creatures - The smile Harrison Ford - A murderous scene: Towards the end, when Vader alternately looks at his son and the emperor. The lightning bolts of death were reflected on his black helmet. And when he catches and betrays his Master to save Luke, putting his life in danger! Oh, my boy! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the INMHO suite: - the "human factor" element as a whole that the original cast was able to move forward is somehow absent - The Force seems to be more a question of superpu rocking than on wisdom - Too many Jedis at once and too many Light Sabers on screen - The lack of experience of some actors too often threatens the coherence of the intrigue <br /> By the way, if you taste the theory of Force as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, then you should read some books about Buddhism and its forms in Japan antique. <br /> <br /> The magic of Star Wars, IMHO lies primarily in the continuous spiritual heritage of a master to his apprentice, from father to son, despite the difficulties. "From my soul to your soul", (from my soul to yours), as Bejard would write to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru.
