"De Vierde Man" (The Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European pycho thrillers of the eighties. This latest work by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before moving to Hollywood to become a big star with films like "Total Recall", "Basic Instinct" and "Starship Troopers" is dedicated to a psychopathic author and disillusioned (Jeroen Krabbe) go to the seaside to recover. He meets a mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and starts a love affair with her. He becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and discovers that his three previous husbands have all died under mysterious circumstances ... <br /> <br /> "De vierde man" is heavily influenced by the old Hollywood film noir and the psycho-thrillers film Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells. It takes a long time to create a dark and captivating atmosphere, and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the necessary impact to advance the story. The suspense is sometimes almost unbearable and sometimes recalls the works of Italian cult director Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> The cast is also notable, including Krabbe's performance as a mentally ill writer who opened the doors of his international film career ("Living Daylight", "The fugitive"). If you have the opportunity to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV, video or DVD, do not miss it!
