Henry Fool is a better movie. But it's the perfect way to follow a movie like "Henry Fool". Take Henry very seriously, his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Even the foreground of "Henry Fool", when Simon puts his ear to the ground when Henry arrives walking on the hill, is even more evident through "Fay Grim". The over-the-top jokes, which are more or less meta-jokes (about the writing of the movie and the jokes themselves), are good but the beginning of the movie is a bit saturated in them. Also, Hartley's use of Dutch angles throughout the film is shocking, yes, it is an intention, but it seems forced and overused, it goes beyond the joke, what I would like to call, boring. It's a flawed film, but must-see for all fans of Hartley or "Henry Fool". <br /> <br /> And do not listen to stupid critics, do not look at this unless you've seen the first movie. The plot, satire and spirit of this movie are totally lost if you have not seen Henry Fool. It's a sequel. It's just silly.
