At first, this film seems so bad that I almost fell into a trance the first time I saw it. It was like a bad dream. A cosmic bore. But I gave it a second chance, then another, another, etc ... I finally became addicted to this film, because of its dreamy slowness, its wonderful natural settings, bathed in a soft autumn light and in particular the score, composed of a rock progressive 70s and absolutely exquisite folk songs of the actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lamb (the Troubadour). You should notice the song on the hazel wood, the silver trout and the lady who disappears in the air ... , heard in the middle and at the end of the film.There are at first some carnal scenes Let us appreciate the natural charms of Elizabeth Suzuki.If this film was shot by directors of the "repertoire" as Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, of Critics would have criticized. I personally think that this film is a million times superior to any of Fellini's cinematic # Â¤ @ t! Certainly not for the pretentious.
