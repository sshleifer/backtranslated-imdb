Of all British imperialist films such as Four Feathers, Charge of the Light Brigade, for example, this film stands out as the cream of the crop. This reflects a time when "the sun never set on the British Empire". To move on. I will not go into detail because so many others have exposed the many reasons that make this film awesome. I visited the hills of Alabama and photographed the passage through which the British walked and it remains as it was, unchanged by time and encroaching on man and vandals. And even if I know it's coming, I see Din dead, dead, on a stretcher and when we read these lines <br /> <br /> "Yes, Din! Din! Din! <br /> <br /> You Lazarushian-Leather Gunga Din! <br /> <br /> Although I have you belted and skinned, <br /> <br /> By the livin 'Gawd who created you, <br /> <br /> You're a better man than me, Gunga Din "<br /> <br /> At 54, I still have my eyes misted, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar. The range of emotions it contains is the hallmark of a good movie. Like the end of another great movie, Of Mice and Men.
