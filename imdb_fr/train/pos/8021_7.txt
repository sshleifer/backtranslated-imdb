Muppet's third film is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable, with the gang supporting their modest college musical with bright (but volatile) Broadway lights filled with naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt fails and Kermit (leader of the group and author of the series) gets noticed. then, the others separate so as not to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself befriends a young budding fashion designer, joining ends in serving food at his father's dinner (the old man therefore has a line in the non-sequiturs particularly tortuous!). We have the usual appearances of a number of stars: Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as an overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a trusted scammer), Elliott Gould ( who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (herself having her portrait in a fancy restaurant replaced by the false mustache of Kermit, sporting a false mustache, as an ostensibly famous entrepreneur to attract the Muppets show advertising), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (probably in the funniest film scene as a Broadway producer, in front of which Kermit appears, playing the role of streetwise, chummy and so on. hilarious and an afro wig!). The other Muppets follow more or less their usual rhythm, leaving (unfortunately) less room for Gonzo this time; while Miss Piggy is for me an acquired taste, the scenes in which this one spies what it takes to be the romance of Kermit with the waitress ?? and especially his violent reaction on this subject ?? are undeniably funny. What disappoints, however, is the decisive spectacle itself (after a fairly redundant middle section in which Kermit is amnesic and ends up recovering advertising on Madison Avenue) which, instead of the tedious routines expected, does not provide anything more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit eternal flame Miss Piggy!
