William Powell is a murder doctor and ex-wife in "The Ex-Mrs Bradford", also starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had contact with almost all the women he was teaming with. Although he and Myrna Loy were the perfect couple on the screen, the actor shot two other "Thin Man" movies, one with Ginger Rogers and this one with Arthur, both of which had a very good effect . <br /> <br /> We do not get tired of seeing Powell as a good-natured, good-natured professional and "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford" is no exception. The ex-Mrs. B assigned a subpoena to Mr. B, then reinstated him to help solve a mystery in which she had trained him. And this is not the first time she does that! It seems almost like there was a Bradford film before this one or the first in a series of movies - Mr. B complains that his ex-mystery writer is constantly bringing him in lawsuits. This time, a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies just before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution of the case is a bit weird, but it does not hold water. The point is the joke between the couple and the interference of the ex-Mrs. B. Jean Arthur is very glamorous in his role and very funny. However, with an actress who is as intelligent as Arthur does, humor seems more intentional than cerebral. I suspect the writer had something else in mind - say Carole Lombard's wacky side. When Arthur learns that the police have arrived, she says, "Oh, it's probably about my child support, I was waiting for the police to get involved with this," it's more of a Powell-skinned rib that a serious statement. It still works well and shows how a good actress can create her own role. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth watching, as William Powell and Jean Arthur have always been.
