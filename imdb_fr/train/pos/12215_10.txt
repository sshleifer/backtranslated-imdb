I loved this film from the opening sequence to the end. I found the style of the director / actor who spoke directly to me / to the very engaging public. <br /> <br /> What I found most exciting and refreshing in this film is its ignorance - and therefore its challenge - of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths and the lack of judgment - and the acceptance by the characters of themselves and each other - allowed me to embrace them and let myself be drawn into their world. Without preaching, with intelligence and gentle, loving humor, this film has the power to open up new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to seeing other offers from this creative and talented director.
