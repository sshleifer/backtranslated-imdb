Creative epic visual style inimitable. <br /> <br /> This film can not include the most alternative dramaturgy or the most artistic actors. But who dares to say that this film is not an art? I am not in favor of the idea that an important film must be serious, non-commercial or disturb me with questions. Even though there are a lot of movies that match these attributes, I like it. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey, of course, is not part of it. What you get is pure and excessive creativity with a very busy childlike energy. This film does not reflect the reality. It's friendly, naive and utopian. Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus. For me, it would be a beautiful combination time-place in which to live! Except this music ;-) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well done. I always liked the cinematography and the scenery of this film. Especially on this point, Bogus Journey dominates by far its precedent. In addition, the effects are good, and I think most of them are very well done without cgi. I usually prefer good old effects in big budget movies. Of course, it's "just another Hollywood movie" out of sight of some people. But I think that's in a very charismatic way. <br /> <br /> A word on the soundtrack: all the music of the band and the orchestra fits perfectly into the film. The sound design is not lacking either. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to get that piece of Winger from the "station" scene that builds the bill and Ted's robots into the van. I like unorthodox photographic work in its infancy. <br /> <br /> Let me conclude by saying this: <br /> <br /> This film is very naive and very imaginative! He is much better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, The Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of God. He's absolutely superior to citizen Kane, apocalypse now or Chris Markers without sun ... ... it's even better than Total Recall ... Not at all !? Yes of course! <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey by Bill and Ted is simply the best movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Who dares to disagree is guilty of "artistic behavior" or likes Terminator Salvation (what is the biggest self-defamation) <br /> <br /> PS: the first part n ' is not the best movie. So Bogus Jorney is a superior suite. Even Terminator 2 is not a superior suite! It's not!
