I happened to watch this movie by chance a few days ago by returning channels. My expectations were not great, but it was an interesting movie. In A Guy Thing, Jason Lee plays Paul, a Seattle-based flawless guy who is about to marry his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) and settle down to a flawless middle-class domestic life. We first meet Paul at his bachelor party, where he declares no desire to engage in the usual bachelor party activities that his (surprisingly few) buddies encourage, in case he should a little naughty and would get carried away in his troubles and conflicts. Of course, what Paul knows now is the morning before: he is in bed with a naked hula dancer and his mother-in-law phoning to inform her that Karen is on her way. Oh, and the hula dancer is Becky (Julia Stiles), Karen's cousin. <br /> <br /> From this tiny acorn of potential trouble is born a powerful oak of frenzied misfortune, while Paul goes from misadventures to mishaps trying to cover what he did while retaining the appearance of a good conscientious guy and family oriented, who is super excited about his upcoming nuptials. Her efforts to make sure Karen is not aware of the potential misconduct on her part ironically force Paul to approach Becky, who likes to have fun, forcing him to wonder if he really wants the life that seems to have been prepared for him. . The film contains the right mixture of comedy and romance. Well worth a look.
