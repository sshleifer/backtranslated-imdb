In the old advertisement for blank audio tapes, the slogan was "is this real or is it Memorex?" The same could be said for the events of this episode - a compilation and remix of "The Cage", the first Star Trek pilot. Mr. Spock cleverly requisitioned the ship back to the forbidden planet Talos IV to allow Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain who was burned and paralyzed, to return. Why the fight? Because any contact with Talos IV calls a death sentence. The reason why this is so is never explained - it has bothered me a lot - but, if nothing else, it adds to the story. After taking the boat to Talos IV, Mr. Spock went to Dr. McCoy (the highest ranking officer present, Captain Kirk was on board the ship) for an arrest and said, "The charge is a mutiny, Dr. I never received an order to take the ship. "The following is a court martial in which - thanks to the Talosians - we learn why it was so important (in addition to the obvious paralysis) that Captain Pike goes to Talos IV even at the risk of Mr. Spock's death. The illusions created by the Talosians, the background music and the whole scenario are fantastic. And Meg Wyllie as Guardian (Talosian head) is wonderful. Call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in this role but she was perfect! The Talosians, having abandoned almost all physical activity and becoming almost totally dependent on the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can not really tell if it's a man or a woman and it does not matter. This episode, more than almost every other in the series, makes me hope and pray that there are other worlds and that there are civilizations as advanced! What a beautiful thing if it were so! It's one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times I've seen it (I even see it on video), it never fails to fascinate me. Meg Wyllie looks like an alien and I do not mean that naughty.
