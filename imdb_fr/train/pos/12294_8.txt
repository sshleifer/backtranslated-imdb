I guess I always thought that the Hotel du Nord was linked to a studio, that the movement of cars and camera was too fluid and smooth to have been filmed on site. But no problem, the composition of Marcel Carne is still very underestimated. The plot sometimes seems a little agitated, as if it invented as and when, but because it is unpredictable, it holds the attention to the end. The money shots when the two lovers are alone in their room are assailed by dialogues rather staggered, but it is so beautiful to fall into some inanity can be accepted. Are these 2 young people the symbols of cancerous despair in pre-war France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are quite common; if the suicides are young and in good health and their life before them is free, do you think they are just lost fools? <br /> <br /> Arletty played well as a prostitute - she kept the zipper of her dress busy all along anyway! I've only seen a few movies with Jouvet - this is the most impressive invention as a pimp in HDN - my problem is superficial: every time I see his face, I think about Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> A A remarkably atmospheric film, well played and photographed, that has moved so much that it takes a few viewings to put everything in place. Annabella and Aumont have formed a couple of exceptional beauty. Fran√ßois (Heurtebise) Perier in his second film had a funny little role as a gay man. Overall: wonderful.
