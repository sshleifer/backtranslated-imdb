I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who was working on it, so I thought about checking it. I thought it was a very beautiful movie and I can not wait to watch it again. the actors were really good and I loved all the music! There was not a lot of discussion in the film, which at first seemed a bit strange - but once I got into the movie, I thought the story and the game of actor were really emotional and significant and that left a lot to the imagination. I want to see the movie again because there were so many things in the film that I forgot a lot of little things, but know that I left the theater thinking about the movie. the photo was beautiful and the set was really unique.
