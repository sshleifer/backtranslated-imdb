It's an absolutely charming movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's extremely funny and the cast is beautiful. Although Laurence Olivier is mainly associated with his Shakespearean work, he shows in this film that he is not forced to play only classical theater. He manages the transition from the cynical divorce attorney, who tries to avoid women and their traitors, to the puppy in love who falls in love with Lady X and played effortlessly by Merle Oberon. The dialogue is both spiritual and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanted. Ralph Richardson was also a pleasure to watch. I highly recommend it.
