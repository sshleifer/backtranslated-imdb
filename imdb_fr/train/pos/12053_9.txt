A well done ghost story that will give you goose bumps and some fairly fair fears along the way. The story unfolds slowly, creating an atmosphere until you are ready to see the woman in black. You will not forget it once you have seen it. No gore, no knives, no hockey mask - just a well-constructed story that is best seen at night with the lights off.
