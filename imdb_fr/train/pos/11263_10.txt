It's a great show! I had a high school American history teacher who looked a lot like that. There are many "facts" in history that are not quite true and Mr. Wuhl stresses them very well, in a way that is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wuhl teaches a class of film students but students in history and even the general public will understand the spiritual way in which he discovers well-known mistakes in the history of the world and will strive to impress them in the minds of his students. The use of live actors playing sketches is also very fun. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in the story she learned as a child who was upset.
