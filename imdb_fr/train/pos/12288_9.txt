The House of Spirits is a captivating account of family intrigue, South American politics and supernatural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons give life to Isabel Allende's novel with all her passion and suspense. It is, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba ages and softens in a very credible way, while Meryl Streep in the role of Clara maintains her warm and loving warmth throughout his relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas are a beautiful couple struggling to be accepted by the family into a racist culture. Esteban's sister, Glenn Close, gives a very touching performance. The Portuguese countryside is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical Latin American country. The settings at Clara's house and Esteban's ranch are efficient, and the vintage American cars are a pleasant addition to the post-war atmosphere.
