I found the one and only comment about this film completely uninformative and too hard, so I decided to write mine. I saw this film for the first time when it came out and I have caught it many times since. First, let me tell you that, overall, this is what makes this movie gets RIGHT that makes it worthy of being profitable. It does not matter if he has low budget quirks and other flaws. It's worth watching. The idea of ​​basing a film on Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario and bringing people back to life is a brilliant illusion. The film talks about the kind of humanistic catalysis inspired by Whitman in people. And in this sense it is absolutely correct. The cast of actors - especially Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. The writing and the dialogue are strong and pay particular attention to the manners and inflections of the time. All in all, what does not like? Also, name another movie in which Whitman is so alive?
