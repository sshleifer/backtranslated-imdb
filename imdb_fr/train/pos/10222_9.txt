The unlikely pair of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team up to give us performances and interesting topics in The Angel Levine. This is an interesting variation of the themes of It's a wonderful life. <br /> <br /> Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and both belong to a special class of poor elderly Jews in New York. Mostel was a tailor and proud of his job, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly bedridden. He is reduced to asking for social assistance. Desperate, like Jimmy Stewart, he asks God for help. <br /> <br /> Now, if he had had someone like Henry Travers, things might have worked differently, but even Stewart had a hard time accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing in mind: he had passed 100 years of this mortal spiral and all his links with earthly things had disappeared. God sent to Mostel something quite different, Harry Belafonte, recently deceased, who should have at least received a basic training for the angels before being entrusted with a mission. <br /> <br /> Belafonte has not accepted the fact that he has passed from life to him, he is still a lot of problems. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know he's dead, who was hit by a car early in the movie. You put his problems and those of Mostel and you have a good conflict, starting with the fact that Mostel can not believe in a black Jew called Levine. <br /> <br /> It was the farewell performance for Poles and Jews. actress Ida Kaminsky who was nominated for best actress in The Shop on Main Street a few years ago. The other important role here is that of Irish actor Milo O'Shea playing a good Jewish doctor. Remembering O'Shea's brogue in The Verdict, I was really surprised to see him and hear him take the role of the doctor. <br /> <br /> Angel Levine raises interesting and troubling questions about faith and race in this society. . It is presented to you by an excellent distribution and of course created by the famous writer Bernard Malamud. Make sure to catch it during the broadcast.
