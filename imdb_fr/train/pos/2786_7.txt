What surprised me most about this film was the audience it attracted. Similar films such as Anita and I have never caused as much hype as this film, although I think it's probably because of the mention of "Beckham" in the title more than anything else. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant film conveying a brilliant message - you can do anything if you're determined enough and put your mind on it, which is such a positive message for anyone watching this film. <br /> <br /> I think that's the case. Keira Knightley's best films, and I think she's a brilliant actress and was excellent for the role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Unfortunately, I can not say that for Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I do not think he was such a good actor and, to be honest, his eyes were a little scary. <br /> <br /> All in all, a brilliant film and a brilliant story
