I watched this short film on a DVD of the best New Zealand shorts, all very well, but The French Doors was amazing. It starts slowly and you wonder if something is going to happen. As you relax in the buzz of home improvement, the most frightening thing happens. <br /> <br /> EEEEkkk, I wanted to stop watching, but I was stuck. <br /> <br /> The films plunge into the primordial fear of the black and with little, if any, special effects. It cools you to the bone. A simple but brilliant concept has opened all these memories of my youth and my life in the most unlikely but scary situations. <br /> <br /> The visual style of the filmmakers is at the rendezvous and the main character guides you convincingly throughout history. It's a short film that I have not seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> French doors have all the characteristics of a great functionality, alas they end after about ten minutes. Nevertheless, a great end that begs you to want to know more. <br /> <br /> I loved and played well and thank you for the ride. These New Zealanders are really talented. <br /> <br /> A new fan.
