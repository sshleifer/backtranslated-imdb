Brokedown Palace tells the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who leave for a spontaneous trip to Thailand and end up in jail after being taken with drugs in their luggage. In this way, the film had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film, such as "Return to Paradise", but instead, the film chose to focus little on the situation of girls and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale perform very well. The film deals much more with their interaction - suspicion, jealousy, questioning and testing of their friendship and finally sacrifices made in the name of friendship. . This film chooses not to delve too deeply into politics, nor even into the harshness of prison life (which is a little ignored), and focuses more on these problems of friendship. <br /> <br /> and some parts that did not seem credible or realistic. We did not feel the real fear or desperation of their situation as well as we could have it. And we have very little life outside the walls of the prison, with Bill Pullman playing the so-called shabby lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold. In short, this film should certainly have been a much darker film than it was. <br /> <br /> But overall, I appreciated. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect and the script had enough twists to keep interesting. Worth to be seen.
