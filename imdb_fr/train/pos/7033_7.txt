First, do not call it a remake of the movie '63. Although this version is more faithful to the scene, it is extremely long. The cast was good with a few exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good casting choice. She was almost 30 when she shot this movie, and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while, he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly exaggerates her role as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny like Harry McAffee and showed that he could even hold a tune. Like the 1963 film, they chose a stranger to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun with his role as Birdie and it shows. I even have the soundtrack and I love listening to his singing. So what made it a flop? It was long for one. They put new songs and scenes. Even if some of the new songs were good (like "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Now, do not get me wrong, I liked it, but I'm looking at the 196 movie (see my review). It was only some actors who exaggerated their roles, made changes and, again, LENGTH. One last thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with the role and the music. Give her some words and she could sing them. So, here's my advice from someone who made some Bye Bye Birdie productions: If you want to watch an entertaining play, watch the movie '63. If you want to watch a more realistic version, look at version 95. Just take it in moderation. Do not be a hero and try to look at it all in one sitting.
