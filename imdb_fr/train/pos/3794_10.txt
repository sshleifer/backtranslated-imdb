"Our Song" tells the story of the three teenage girls Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn - the best friends hanging at the end of the summer. Teen Summer - Although we do not know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is / was the same for all of us. A lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of the school. Welcome warmth and idleness. <br /> <br /> But if this teenage experience is universal, downtown 90s is a different place than most of us know - maybe a country as foreign as anything other country. Young bodies sculpting new silhouettes ... making signs of new territories ... the labyrinth of adulthood. The young spirit who enters into himself, speaks for himself, says that's what I am, that's what I want to try to be. It has always been so. But that's what's happening in Brooklyn in the late 90's. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay is the author / director of this film project, but he recognizes all those who have made suggestions to him . The opening slide "A film on" seems to list everyone in the universe. It's a gesture, but at the end of the film, we know it's a real one. [The closing titles also feature some of the most valuable and appreciated credits on the market that I have read.] Jan McLaughlin's sound recording deserves special mention. McKay is a modest leader who knows who tells this story - these are his three graces, Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. They are the real thing, their interactions have the fire of true friendship and the focus of reality. This is not a musical video shortcut telling teenage life. He has the seriousness of his long, blind look. <br /> <br /> Spend time with them, we do not feel really included but we feel privileged to listen. These are real voices that speak clearly about crises. and the monotony of everyday life. We are witnessing the modern mathematics of teenage life - how its problems are interpreted, calculated, summarized and resolved. Small scenes illustrate great thoughts. Lanisha is suspended with her father in her safety work - this is the only way she can spend time with him. We see the love that exists between them but also the failures of the family and paternity. In a connected scene, Lanisha defends her father with her mother and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and love her back. Later, the three friends were plunged into darkness, sharing their visions and dreams - and we remember how crazy / funny children are and, more tragically, how realistic is the idealism of our children. days. And in the end, Maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself. We see her take the courage to master all her fears and doubts. It shows us the strength we need to be able to accept the fragility that makes life more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> `The greatest gift of our song is that we deeply feel the ephemeral nature of friendship - how, one day, alive and invigorating, this intimacy can, the next day, turn away and s' remove. It's awful, but it's like that, is not it?
