Although not in the whole movie, Andy Griffith still plays his part in this CBS TV movie. The plot is easy: Griffith's character dies and his last wish is for his wife and children to scatter his ashes at the place he named (Mountains Somewhere). Although this is never seen on television and is never broadcast on video, if you have the chance to watch this - TAKE IT.
