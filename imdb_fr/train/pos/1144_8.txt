In 1955, the British composed a comedy titled Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall. To date, this is one of the finest examples of British comedy and, more particularly, the popularity of the sitcom on television. It was and remains an excellent example of self-referential cinema. <br /> <br /> It's the same for Soapdish, a movie I'd never heard of a few nights ago when I saw it on TV. At first, I doubted a bit because comedy is so difficult to do well, as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very intelligent satire on American television broadcast during the day. In fact, it's been a while since I laugh so much. So, if you like satire, I would recommend seeing it. <br /> <br /> The main actors ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty ?? simply do a great job, revealing how the job of acting is superficial and superficial. As I looked at him, I thought, how does this dirt reverberate in real life? That is, if the actors ever have a real life? As you probably know, Peter Sellers, for example, had the reputation of hiding his real character behind a multitude of characters, so that no one really knew the real person. So while I watched Sally Field play Celeste Talbot playing Maggie, I was thinking back to that previous British movie where Kay Kendall was playing Laura in a TV sitcom in front of Peter Finch ... <br /> <br /> wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns? And this feeling was crystallized when Celeste finally confronted his daughter (Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue) and, in a moment of emotion, repeats the fictional lines she had used, during a previous episode of her soap opera. day, in front of his fictional girl it's like that! Are you confused? Well, that's not all, but the dialogue is stunning for its originality, its comedy, its crap, its anger, its depravity, its duplicity and even ... his love. <br /> <br /> The story? Well, there are a lot of stories in this film, all intertwined, all coming together at the end (of course, but not like a Robert Altman movie, all right), and not all of them finally resolved. Life is not like that anyway, right? The pace is almost frantic, and you really have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the gags of sight and subtle jokes. Spend the 97 minutes of your life and watch it; you will not regret the use of time. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is performing well, although I've never taken many things to Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps the most entertaining exchange is between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and, for my money, she steals so many scenes from others, she gets my vote as an outstanding player. I do not make you shit, she gives the dog term a whole new face ...
