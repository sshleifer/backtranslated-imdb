The cast of Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was just great. Cassidy personified arrogance, self-confidence, charm and wit - all with a mischievous and condescending smile. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is by far the best murderer (after appearing three times) in the Columbo series. This performance (and the first) is my favorite episode of Columbo - hands down. Steven Spielberg did some amazing camera work (yes, there were sometimes some camera shadows on the actors) capturing the nuances and jokes at different and intriguing angles between Columbo and Franklin. In addition, the scenic views and tight shots of Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin's Pavilion) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this episode yet, then you must - it's a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was very contagious. His death in 1976, at the age of 49, was very sad and even tragic - he surely had his best years ahead of him. Rest in peace Jack, you will live for eternity thanks to your excellent work.
