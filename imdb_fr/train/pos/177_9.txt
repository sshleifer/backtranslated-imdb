It's a film of well-being and nothing more. And for that, it's very fun to watch. Of course, it touches on political issues. But what? I'm sure she was not trying to make "Good night and good luck" here. Let's not try to do anything other than what it is ... light. <br /> <br /> And very nice to that! <br /> <br /> Do we remember 1984? We have become very sophisticated according to the media, whether we watch or not. I tend to differ on this point. Goldie knew it was fun and she decided to do it. <br /> <br /> As his lighter price: protocol, overboard, homestay, wildcats, soldier Benjamin, it looks like it was old time, lamentable game, death invades, First Wives Club and the remake of Out-of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what she's doing ... she plays all the roles for the camp that you can get out of! Goldie knows herself very well and knows what she really knows how to do. <br /> <br /> She always made me laugh happily and innocently. I loved her in Laugh-In and in everything she's ever done. She never tried to be anything other than what she is ... and it is this bubbly and gigantic girl next door who happens to be very pretty and smiles and a laugh that will always make me love and remind me that life is short enough and that you just have to lighten up, because before you know it ... you are old, wrinkled and suffer from one of the inevitable evils of life. If it happens even if late. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Goldie for what she is: an adorable and comical actress.
