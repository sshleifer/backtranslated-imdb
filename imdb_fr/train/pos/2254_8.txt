Fox's epic story about one of America's greatest pioneering efforts is presented on DVD with some truly remarkable "supplements". BRIGHAM YOUNG (The "Frontiersman" was added for the European release), telling the story of the great leader of the pioneers who, under inspiration, brought members of the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of Last Days) in the Salt Lake Valley, In 1847, after the assassination of their people by their prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (interpreted by Vincent Price) was presented on the screen in 1940, just as states United States was about to enter the Second World War. Darryl F. Zanuck, chief of the Fox, had the audacity to move and give the Mormons a breath of fresh air, as it was the first film attempt to show their faith in a favorable way to the screen. Now, Fox, in collaboration with James D'Arc, curator of the excellent motion picture archive at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has brought this film to DVD in an original edition. D'Arc, who wrote his doctoral thesis a few years ago, provided one of the most detailed commentary tracks ever made for a DVD. He separates fact from fiction and lets listeners understand why this film has been so popular with church leaders, even though ornaments to the truth are ubiquitous in the film. One of the fun things about Dean Jagger is the actor who plays the lead role. Several years after the film, he married a last saint's wife and was eventually converted to the LDS religion. There is a lot to learn from D'Arc's knowledge and it's great to have it on the DVD! The disc contains more than 100 images from the Fox & BYU archives, as well as news footage of the incredible premiere in seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks FOX for another great DVD - and thank you James D'Arc for your comment!
