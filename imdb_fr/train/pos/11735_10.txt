This film is pure Elvira and shows it to his chest ... I mean the best! The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and is animated by Elvira's spirit and charm. The spectator has the opportunity to see Elvira in a new light as she wrestles with the prejudices of the people of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she traveled from Los Angeles to witness the reading of her great aunt's will) Morganna) and at the same time, he tries to help long-suffering adolescents who have been deprived of distraction by the matriarchal chastity Paria and the rest of the city council. She also has to contend with her appeal to Bob Redding, the owner of the local movie theater, and to another woman (Patty) who also looks at Bob but does not deserve her love as much as Elvira. And, later in the film, she will also have to deal with the complications of the offspring of a "great metaphysical celebrity" and the accusations of witchcraft that will be brought against her, which will mean she will be burned. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, urban and naive in this film, while cracking daring jokes and delivering quirky replicas with a double meaning. <br /> <br /> This inspirational film give up on yourself and always try to follow your dreams. In the end, Elvira's dreams come true at last. This is the best thing that can happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film countless times and I never tire of it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I found myself captivated throughout the film. A review will not do justice to the movie itself, so I can just tell you to PLEASE watch it because it's one of the best movies ever made! In the meantime, I wish you "unpleasant dreams!"
