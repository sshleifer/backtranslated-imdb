CONTAINS SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I saw an ad about it in a video. Then my sister discovered that we had the book, so I read it. I rented the video the same day that I finished the book. I thought it was very memorable as was the book . The cast was brilliant.Tara Fitzgerald was excellent, Helen and Rupert Graves were as odious as Arthur. The costumes, the music and the settings are breathtakingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> WARNING! NEVER READ MORE IF YOU HAVE NOT LOOKED AT THIS <br /> <br /> Disadvantage, sex scenes have been added and scenes of violence.This is why the video is ranked 15. It There are other elements that have been added. After the first part, I felt that the precision was coming down. Although the book is better than that, I'm happy to have seen it and would recommend it to those who read it, who are fans of Bronte or who like costumes (I'm all 3!), Provided that you passed quickly through sex. scenes. The book is rather underestimated. Anne Brontes' books do not seem to be as widely read or also known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights who have done it on television and in movies several times. Another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised to see how much religion was there, but here they had thrown everything to the ground! <br /> <br /> 7 \ 10
