Accountant Shohei Sugiyama (Kôji Yakusho) is tired of his routine life, limited to hard work and stays at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and the daughter of his teenager. One evening, as he was returning home by train, he saw the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) on the balcony of a dance school. A few days later, he decided to go to school and secretly take dance classes every Wednesday. night. However, he is ashamed to reveal his secret to his family. Meanwhile, Masako feels the behavior changes of her husband happier and engages a private eye to check if Shohei has an affair. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching "Shall We Dance?" and I really loved it. What a charming and delicious movie! The story is incredibly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The cast is excellent and I was particularly impressed by the cold beauty and grace of the wife of director Masayuki Suo and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On September 6th, I saw the American remake of "Shall We Dansu?" for the first time, and I found that this entertainment was delicious. But now, I can say it's another useless remake, and I recommend this original movie instead. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dance with Me?")
