In the near future, the ordinary man above any suburban suspect Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) is hired by Digicorp, a huge corporation, to be assigned as a spy and steal the secrets of their competitors, Sunways. Throughout his training, Morgan undergoes brainwashing, adopts a new identity of Jack Thursby and goes to boring lectures. In one of them, he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who tells him that nothing seems to be so. Morgan recognizes a new reality, in which he does not know who to trust. <br /> <br /> The unknown "Cypher" was a big surprise for me. This film is not yet released in Brazil, but the exciting and exciting story is quite complex, with many plot points, and with a scenario, direction and outstanding performance. In the very last turn, I remembered the "Total Recall" by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This film certainly deserves to be watched more than once, and I really did not like the last scene, the one where the independent spy has the disputed record in the sea. I only know the director Vicenzo Natali of the fantastic " Cube ", and this second job that I see is also beautiful. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
