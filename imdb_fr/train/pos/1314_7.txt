When a small town is threatened by a child murderer, a policewoman chases him pretending to be his friend. As she becomes more emotionally involved in the murderer, her psyche begins to get beaten, making her lose focus on the job of catching the criminal. Not a high-voltage excitation film, but a solid police work and a good representation of the fainting spirit of a psychotic loser.
