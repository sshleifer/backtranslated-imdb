this film is so complex that you can give it any description and keep rolling with it. you have an uncertain, troubled and fascinating main character (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) trapped between two (three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues, we see him working his magic around the three women he loves. it could be the premise of a movie about poultry, full of rigid, cold and uninspiring comments. Yet director Jean Eustache manages to keep him fresh, ironic and witty. As it's a long film, we can only laugh when, after 2 hours of politeness, Jean-Pierre Léaud suddenly shouts on the phone while he remembers a derisory sentence taken from a film. this kind of situation is purely cinematic and can not be fully restored in a comment. no one can reproduce Françoise Lebrun's tragic and painfully beautiful monologue towards the end of the film. 3 ½ hours and worth every minute.
