I saw this movie in 1984, we started watching "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went to see this movie. If you have a conspiracy theory circulating in your head, you will want to look at this one. <br /> <br /> The question you have to ask yourself when you watch this film is this: do you think the government would be able to do that? (In my opinion, they could do it without a doubt) <br /> <br /> But I do not want to give too much information, it would be a spoiler and I think you should watch the film yourself. <br /> <br /> But just to let you know, we're still talking about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to others is not the easiest thing in the world.
