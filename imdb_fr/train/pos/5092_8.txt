I thought that King Solomon's mines were beautifully prepared. My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her acting was superb but her makeup and hair were not vintage and always seemed to make her look uncomfortable alongside other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was a great choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see an actor at once strong and robust in this role after filming, film after film, actors with blond hair like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. It was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. This version can not be compared to the 1950's version with Stewart Grainger. It was a movie on the big screen and not a movie made for television. I thought the two Quatermains were credible, but the two media must remain separate. I can not wait to see this again, and I hope Patrick Swayze will turn to this type of role again.
