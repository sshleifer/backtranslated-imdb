I attended a Cracker Bag screening last night before a preview of Disney's Holes. I do not know who decided to show it but I am very happy that they did it. The cookie bag is an absolute jewel, a snapshot of Australia in the early 80s, as it is perceived through the eyes of a child. The "conversations" between Eddie and his brother were hilarious and, as in the rest of the movie, so true to life. Each shot brought a great nostalgia, because it reminded me of my childhood (the same age as the helping director perhaps helping a little) and that the sound multiplied the feeling. I only hope that I can see Cracker Bag again someday.
