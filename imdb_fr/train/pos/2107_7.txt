I recently bought this movie with a group of other eBay LaserDiscs. Usually, I am in the war and in action movies, but I sometimes like romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you're bored by today's FX specials and the brightest romantic comedies, you should have a look around Shop Around the Corner for a quiet evening. What I like in the film is that the characters are very modest. There is nothing wrong or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek, for example: when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees, he tries to shoot himself in the head. Not just because of the humiliation, but because he was unfair to Stewart's character. (OK, weired example.) <br /> <br /> Yes, the focus of the film is narrow and the plot is predictable. Yet, I have always loved that. If you like Notting Hill, then you'll love shopping around the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
