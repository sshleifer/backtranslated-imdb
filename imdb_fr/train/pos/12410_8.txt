This is an excellent example of what can be done on a low budget movie. The acting is excellent considering the scenario and the atmosphere of the film is very disturbing. The gore is well made and used sparingly (watch out for the excellent death of barbed wire) and the action is striking once used. It's true that there are sometimes dark lines in the script, but compared to other movies on the same budget (or more!), It is barely noticeable. Overall, this is recommended. Believe me, it's better than it looks! 8/10
