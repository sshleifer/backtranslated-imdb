I enjoyed the photography, the textures, the colors and often, contrary to a comment, the lighting. What I missed was a coherent scenario. I found it often disjointed, poorly edited and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125 m. Maybe cuts and subtitles did not help. I applaud all the films that escape the Hollywood mold, but it left me disappointed. Miss Gillain was bright and the performances were all good, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If you'd like to see another movie that has some affinity with this one, try "Hideous Kinky" with Kate Winslet.
