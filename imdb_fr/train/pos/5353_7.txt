Defined in 2017 (although it can easily be confused with 1987, judging by hairstyles and clothing), The Running Man is a complete man, Ben Richards (Schwarzeneggar), accused of a crime that he did not commit. After a break in a daring jail, he is captured and registered as a competitor in the brutal game show The Running Man, accompanied by a few other escapees and the beautiful woman symbolic Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso). <br /> <br /> Used by the totalitarian government as a means to control the masses, the show opposes colored opponents (and often enough campists), each with its own style of murder: Dynamo draws electricity from 'a special costume, Buzzsaw uses a chainsaw, Sub Zero has a razor-edged hockey stick, and Fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish the contenders. But these murderers are no match for Ben Richards, who portrays each of them in a properly horrible way (followed by the obligatory word of mind). <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, Ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle with the authorities and takes revenge on the villainous host of the series, Killian. <br /> <br /> Twenty years ago, Arnold Schwarzeneggar ruled the world of action movies and, to his many fans, he could do it. not bad. The Austrian "beefcake" had a formula that almost guaranteed the box office success of his films: cartoon violence, logicless plot, pretty female sidekick and spiritual one-liners, minus the acting ability to match profits enormous. The Running Man faithfully followed this successful recipe in front of a T audience and Arnie's audience (most of the time teenager) greeted her (me included). <br /> <br /> Now, two decades later, and having just finished watching the movie for the first time in years, I find this movie strange: totally devoid of technical merit, decent acting and convincing effects, and yet quite entertaining. Conducted by Paul Michael Glaser (better known as Det. Dave Starsky of the cult crime series of the 70s, Starsky and Hutch), and adapted from a story by Stephen King (written under the pen name Richard Bachman), The Running Man is cheesy 80s, it looks incredibly cheap and very old, but despite (or maybe because of) the mediocrity of the film, it has a special charm that is difficult to to describe. <br /> <br /> Without trying to create a realistic -future scenario, the movie provides a lot of involuntary laughter. Discover the scene in which Ben discovers the secret cache of banned Amber tapes (!); marvel at the beautiful "futuristic" graphics used on the billboards and The Running Man board game (as a graphic designer, I found them particularly entertaining); be amazed by the blatant lack of convincing technological advances. <br /> <br /> The Running Man may be a waste, but it is extremely entertaining to say that I do not hesitate to recommend it to Arnie fans and science fiction in general.
