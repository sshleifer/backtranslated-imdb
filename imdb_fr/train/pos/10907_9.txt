I was watching TV and HBO showed a double problem of incredibly horrible medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey, that sounds funny," I really like documentaries, so we've started to watch them. At first, I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but it was later explained that because of his health, he had never crossed puberty, hence his shrill voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor associated with a wonderful sense of spirituality ... I cried, looked again, laughed, got up to go get another Kleenex, and then cried again. Once "time was up," Jonni Kennedy flew to heaven with the angels. He was more than ready. he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I highly recommend it. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you do not have a heart.
