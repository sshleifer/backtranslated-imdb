I loved the movie. I even liked most of the actors. But for me, the very bad attempt at Mrs. Davis's accent and her stiff acting make it really a compelling film very hard to watch. Seriously, if another modern actor played the same role with the same style as Mrs. Davis, they would make fun of the screen. <br /> <br /> I really think she called this one. Now, if she had had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman playing the role of the woman, it would have been a lot nicer. <br /> <br /> I guess I just did not "had" Bette Davis. I've always thought of her as an actor who "plays herself" no matter what role she plays. The possible exception is now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many other critics will explain with care (and I hope civil) detail how completely wrong I am about it. But I will continue to watch the films in which she is because I like stories / writing / support casting, but, I will always think of, different actresses who could have done a better job.
