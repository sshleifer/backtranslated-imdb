My wife is a teacher and she knows the story very well, having read it in many of her classes. It never seemed so interesting to me, and I bought the DVD, thinking it would be a movie that would not really be my domain. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie has a lot I found myself thinking that I was right. It starts a little slowly and I must admit I was a little bored - but I was curious enough to stay with that. Boy, I'm glad I did it because it ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding film. I would definitely look at this again! <br /> <br /> The cast was very good. As I have not read the book, I can not guarantee the accuracy, but I must say that Jon Voight was really delicious. You loved the characters you were supposed to love, hate the ones you were supposed to hate and laugh at those who were supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I can see that some people might not like this movie. . It's tedious sometimes, especially at the beginning. All backtracking can be annoying (although they are essential to the story). Once the story begins to appear in the end, however, I think you have been rewarded for your patience. In the end, I think it's a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
