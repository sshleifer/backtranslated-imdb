Each film presented by Bette Davis is worth the experiment. Before Davis co-starred with Leslie Howard in "Of Human Bondage", she had already played in about twenty films. Legend has it that Davis was "dispossessed" of a 1935 Oscar for his performance as a cockney speaking waitress, single mom and manipulative boyfriend, Mildred Rogers. AFI is said to have comforted Davis by awarding him his first Oscar for playing Joyce Heath in "Dangerous". I imagine that Davis fans of "Of Human Bondage" who subscribe to the legend of the thieves oscillators will have, next to my criticism, the film of 1934 for which the AFI did not attribute its performance to the "Dangerous" movie of 1936 for which she received her first Oscar in 1937. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch all the movies, TV interviews, TV interviews, videos and commercials of Bette Davis in series popular. With hindsight, it's easy to understand why this movie, "Of Human Bondage", allowed Davis to be nominated for his performance. She was only 25 years old when the movie was completed and about to hit the Hollywood red carpet. The audience began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of her performance in "Of Human Bondage". That's what makes it his legendary performance. But RKO saw his greatness in "The Man Who Played God" and borrowed it from Warners to play Rogers. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go with AFI, in hindsight, some 41 years after their clever decision to award Davis her 1st Oscar for best actress for "Dangerous", 2 years later. In doing so, AFI may have helped bring out the best of one of Hollywood's most talented twentieth century actors. Because from "Of Human Bondage," Davis knew she had to delve deep into herself to find the representations that had earned her the golden statue. No doubt, she deserved more than 2 Oscars; perhaps as much as 6. <br /> <br /> "Dangerous" offers an exemplary contrast in the depth of Davis's acting characterization. Because it is in "Dangerous" (1936) that she becomes the greatest actor of the twentieth century. Davis is so talented that Joyce Heath is centered on the red carpet. While in "Of Human Bondage," Davis is quite on the edge, still on the sidewalk and ready to take off for the rest of her 60-year career as an actress. <br /> <br /> Perhaps by not awarding him this legendary Oscar in 1935, instead of giving birth to a star, an actor was prompted to immerse himself beyond the celebrity in his soul for the most great work of the gifted actor. <br /> <br /> It is well known that his opponent at the time is Joan Crawford; a star whose performances are not yet at the height of those of Davis. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a "star". Howard Stern is also a radio host. Many people on stage and the big screen are stars. Few have become big players. The essential difference between them is something that Bette Davis could feel: the difference between the desire to play a fantastic role or to become a star performer. <br /> <br /> Try to compare these two movies as I do, by watching a movie right after. The other. Perhaps you will recognize what AFI and I did. Davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century at age 25 and reached his goal at the age of 27. She spent her 50 years setting the bar so high that she was not hit. . . However. <br /> <br /> If AFI had sent her the message that she had arrived in "Of Human Bondage", the story of Davis' life as a great actor might have been conducted in the Kingdom of stars.
