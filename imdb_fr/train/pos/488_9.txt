Part of the joy I got from this movie was that I knew nothing more about it than playing with John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to watch), was a period piece and involved in chess. Everything that has evolved before me was completely unexpected. I will not give much more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is magnificent as an eccentric, haunting and deeply vulnerable chess genius, and that he corresponds to her, step by step, as a strong and attracted woman. It's about love and obsession, rather than the revered board game and having attracted me gradually over the first half-hour, has become totally compelling. And I challenge anyone to guess the end.
