Well, to begin with, it was actually THE most elegant movie of Clausen on that date. <br /> <br /> The man has always had the sense of the characters with a touch of humor, but I think he adds in this film a dimension incomparable to everything he did earlier. His work - in very black and white terms - was accepted by a broad but not critical audience, and we have always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the public know what he has to say. <br /> <br /> In "Villa Paranoia, however, for the first time, he surprises with an invisible wisdom and a respect for minorities.Not only the Jutland - in" the country "- it deals with the eternal question of lack of love, but in a brutal and sometimes brutal way that allows you to stay in search and stay focused.He himself manages to play ****** d! **** d, who wants the right thing, but does not know how to get there, and people are suffering so bitterly. <br /> <br /> I must say it's one of the best movies I've seen this year and I'm expecting a lot from his neighbor.
