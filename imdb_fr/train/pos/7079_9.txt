I really enjoyed that. I am a big fan of movies that disturb your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to discuss. This was a remarkable example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at this (well almost always, let's not forget Jabberwocky and the Grimm brothers, are we going?). <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the way he treated the theme of time travel and avoided paradoxes - the way past and future events intertwined and intertwined. <br /> <br /> It was also very well done aesthetically - the art direction was really great, and I wish I could have seen it on the big screen. The upcoming scenes are similar in many respects to Brazil, and even the scenes present were often really fascinating. <br /> <br /> But the most striking thing about this is perhaps the fact that he starred two actors that I normally do not like much, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both delivered amazing performances here. Pitt in particular - I had already seen one or two films before that allowed me to realize that he could play (contrary to what I originally thought), but this one really surpassed them. In fact, I found myself asking my friends at one point: "Are you sure it's Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (although it is true that it is saying little).
