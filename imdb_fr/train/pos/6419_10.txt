This film is an excellent military film. It may not be an excellent Hollywood movie, but it does not matter. Hollywood has the reputation of sacrificing precision for good entertainment, but that's not the case with this movie. Other critics have found this movie too slow for their taste, but ?? as a retired soldier ?? I appreciate the pace with which the film crew deliberately told its story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allocated to it. The story itself has been told and told over and over, but is it for a professional soldier? and an African-American to that ?? to tell the story as presented by the film crew and the one presenting the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's work to become a marine diver and his life as a marine diver after graduation is not the only story presented. Here too, I tell how the grand master master challenged his commander's illegal order on Sunday not to pass Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear during his test dive, no matter how well he did it. , and paid the price of the loss of a striped. and a change of mission. It also told the true story of how Brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the Spanish coast in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another seafarer. was in the line of the line of fire that would have been broken in two if Brashear had not pushed him out of the way and shot himself. It was a complex story that deserved to be told, and I would admit that two hours and nine minutes were not enough to tell the whole story, and the scenes removed on the DVD let me say that the team did his best to tell a story. as complete as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a beautiful story told in such a complete way and to see the traditions and honor of the Navy preserved so naturally and completely.
