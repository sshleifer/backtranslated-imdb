As a popular sport, surfing has been appreciated by many people. Just after watching the documentary, I realized how dangerous it can be. In fact, surfers were also scared of big waves. Even someone was killed by this. But they continued to surf and have fun. Only the brave can do it. <br /> <br /> According to what the surfers said, we can clearly know what they felt when the big wave hit them. You must adapt to the best and avoid the direct hit of the big wave. When you win, it will obviously bring you enormous satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The astonishing cinematography can not be neglected. It's pure visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> An excellent sports documentary. 8/10
