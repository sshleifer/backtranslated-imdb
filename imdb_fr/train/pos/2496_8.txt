No waste - no room, even near waste. Not an original? This is the last thing we can say about "2.4 children" .Pedictible? certainly not! Although it was a somewhat unusual series for the BBC, it was hilarious, funny and witty. I especially liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - who, in my opinion, were remarkably well trained. Gary olsen was also very good, as were all the other members of the cast ... I never knew why he was unthinkable to read here today about the death of Gary Olsen at a relatively young age. I wish they would do more comedies of this type, a lot more (and show them here in Israel). Bravo!
