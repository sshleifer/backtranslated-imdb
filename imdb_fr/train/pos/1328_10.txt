Without "mental anachronism", this film that I would like to find on DVD offers an extraordinary dive in the vital and mental context of the thought of the people before the "disenchantment of the world". Thirty years ago, a director and a filmmaker could test such an empathy and such romantic truth to make a masterpiece leave me speechless. It would be necessary to be able to see and review the film to better understand that the temporal and cultural distance make us lose the ability to understand, analyze and finally accept this or that example of "primitive thinking." Because this thought that remains almost impossible to Feeling in the secularized world, however, contains some keys to our behavior, only future generations can analyze them with sufficient relevance.If anyone knows where I can get a digital copy or VHS for me or a DVD? Thanks in advance.
