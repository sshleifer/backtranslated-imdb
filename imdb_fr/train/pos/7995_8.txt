Here is a serious revenge story featuring a relentless and brutal Denzel Washington. It is composed of three personalities: a former sober mercenary, now drunk, drunk, then a loving father for a little girl, then a brutal maniac in search of answers and revenge. <br /> <br /> The story is about Washington's commitment as a bodyguard for a little American girl living in Mexico, where kidnappings occur regularly (at least according to the movie). attaches to the child, played successfully by THE child actress of our time, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington sues those responsible and spares no one. Attention: this film is not made for the gummers. <br /> <br /> It's an elegant movie, good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people have found it too frenetic for them, because camera work is one that could give you a headache. I thought it was a tense scenario and it was fascinating to see, but it is not (the shaking device) for all tastes. <br /> <br /> Besides the two stars, there is the always interesting Christopher Walken, in an unusual style discreet role, and a number of other notable actors. <br /> <br /> The film reveals the fundamental emotions in each of us, but it works.
