I just finished viewing the first disc of a 4-disc collection (26 episodes) created in conjunction with UCLA's film and television archives (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (apart from the first episode), the picture quality is pretty good. The DVD box is featured on the title page here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is as charming as when I saw him for the first time (5 years old at the time) and Wally Cox is really endearing in this role. If you are in the mood for a quiet comedy that will overwhelm you instead of banging your head, you will cherish this opportunity to experience all the wonderful characters you will remember from your childhood. Although some of the gags are a little tacky, most are ingenious and well executed ... and even the nerds are fun. It's a television series that lives up to my childhood memories.
