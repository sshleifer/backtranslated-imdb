It has been said that Deanna Durbin invented adolescence. This first film was one of the best. The humorous story featured a lovely 14-year-old Deanna, a beautiful beauty with a beautiful voice, playing "Miss Fixit" in a family separated from her divorce. For a summary of the plot, see other IMDb entries, but quickly, Deanna and her two older sisters plan to leave Switzerland to go to America to prevent their father from remarrying. With an excellent cast, especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray in the role of the sisters, a good realization and a good editing, the film succeeds in captivating one even during the subsequent viewings. Of the three Deanna songs, only "Il Bacio" belongs to the classical repertoire, but when she sings it in this police scene, the place of the film in the story is assured. At least, it was for this viewer who, at the age of 15, was enamored of life with Deanna and classical music. One of the many cool things that happen in THREE SMART GIRLS is the brief glimpse of the drunken person stretching their necks to give Deanna a last glimpse as the cops charge him! The success of this film has had the unfortunate result that later authors of Durbin vehicles found themselves locked into the "Miss Fixit" theme, which quickly became obsolete. Deanna herself never did it. Her status as an actress is more debatable than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me that, like many other personalities in the film, she substituted the "natural" for the histrionic capacity she lacked. The scheme worked well for 21 feature films.
