Hello, this little film is particularly interesting for an artist, a filmmaker, a music creator or a visual artist, because: <br /> <br /> One can feel and examine David's touch / style directly from a short piece of its simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic spacing of shots, pans and sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even as a simple film, this creation is multi-layered. For example, there are sounds that buzz throughout, while others appear (although subtle) at certain points to support certain moves. <br /> <br /> You can also see several types of pans: some go up and down in a gentle way back. There is a diagonal section. Zooms also go back and forth sometimes. <br /> <br /> The lighting and the composition / arrangement of the elements of the space are, as usual and of course, the work of a painter / artist. This is even felt in this piece of shit. That is to say: one can already make exquisite art by the simple art of setting the look / seeing and composing the scene. Then come the visual elements: like the digonal, the parallels, and so on. The light is degraded and the colors, although without much research on the textures as in the big productions, also go very well. It's a sort of artist's sketch ... <br /> <br /> All this is not calculated, but done with an inner feeling and this feeling gives the touch / feel of David, as with all true artist.
