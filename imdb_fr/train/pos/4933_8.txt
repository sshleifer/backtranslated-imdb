Refreshing "lost jewel"! With an effective dialogue and excellent acting, you build the characters and get involved enough to worry about what's happening to them. The characters of Douglas and Widmark are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual perverted presence. Widmark wins the fist fight scene, a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a "logical" ending and a long chase that shames Hollywood's excessive chase sequences. You know how it will probably end, but the suspense and the interest endure. The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you'll ever see. The movie seems to slow down a bit after the middle, but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion.
