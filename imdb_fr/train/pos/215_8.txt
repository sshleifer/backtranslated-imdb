The word "classic" is too common nowadays, but this film deserves the call. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (probably the best live comic actor in the world) and the late George Burns make it a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to think what the film would have been if death had not prevented Jack Benny from playing the role of George Burns, as expected. As things stand, the meeting in Matthau's apartment is not likely to be overwhelmed as a dividing factor. Certainly one of my deserted island movies. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
