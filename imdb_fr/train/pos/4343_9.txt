Excellent endearing film where Peter Falk and Paul Reiser join forces as father and father. <br /> <br /> Dad introduces himself one evening to say that after more than 40 years of marriage, his mother (Olympia Dukakis) had left. <Br/> <br /> The sequel to the film describes father and son on a day trip to collect dad's thoughts on what happened. With them at home, girls can play detectives. <br /> <br /> The story tells the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life, which should have been, why mom complained to dad while they were discussing life. <br /> <br /> We see an unexpected fishing trip and a game of billiards leading to a fight. Both men seem to come out of their daily lives. <br /> <br /> The end is painful as we learn why mom suddenly left. It becomes a story of courage and human spirit in the face of adversity. It's never too late to change.
