It was a very good film and it is absolutely unfair to judge it regardless of when it was released. There are films that do not age but it is clearly outdated. However, I saw this movie when I was a child and for more than twenty years, images like story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we can enjoy it again on DVD. In fact, I remember this film as the subject of several discussions and meetings in which old boys talked about things we have in common. As a result, there was a small sense of disappointment and even sadness when we finally got the DVD. First, there was a theory about the naivety of our generation. Second, I think there is something more. I say that this film has something that should be interesting for all modern filmmakers, especially those who focus on the kind of decaying horror. It's mutilation, the idea that gives coherence to the film; the fact that a human being is mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture. I remember how sick the feeling was when the monster tore Kurt's arm. And at the end; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. Another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere that prevails without loss of intensity in all the scenes, that the action takes place in a secret lab, an isolated street where the man in the car is looking for a woman's body, a cloakroom. striptease, etc. Maybe the reasons why it's not a good movie are just technical things. For example, on the scene of the accident and the man saving the head of his fianc√©e, a more precise work done for another modern director of the second unit could be interesting. Same thing with all the action scenes, including that of Kurt's arm. In addition, something could be done with the makeup of the monster. Some remakes were good; I think that in this case, an attempt was worth it. Nevertheless, the black and white tones must be preserved.
