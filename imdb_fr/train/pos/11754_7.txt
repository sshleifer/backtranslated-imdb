Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos, but stands out a bit. Donald Moffat is as a name as his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is excellent as a quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are wonderful, carrying the film through most of its difficulties. It fills the time well, but is little more than that.
