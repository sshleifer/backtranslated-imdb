Pushing Daisies is just a beautiful fairy tale, with nuances of aesthetics and romance "Amelie". He has a beautiful palette, well thought out and detailed plans, names and dialogues whimsical and too cute to be real, a great imagination and a deep romance. <br /> <br /> Look at the blue sky pop you can not find blue in the rest of the scenery or clich√©s (with a few exceptions). <br /> <br /> Look at a strangely natural song and quite satisfying, come out of the scene. <br /> <br /> Her score is beautiful, her casting is extremely nice, there is good music and the two main romantic stars can not touch each other, otherwise she will die. How much sexual tension do you need? (Actually, I wish they could find a way around this one, but that's life.) <br /> <br /> It's just a show for which it's a pleasure to spend an hour, and I highly recommend it. There has not been another television like this and I would like to see more. This allowed me to go through a week of crappy shitty week, because it's a good company. <br /> <br /> Bring him back!
