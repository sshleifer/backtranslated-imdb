I remember the release of this movie for the Oscars and its victory in no category. For my life, I do not remember what was happening, but I can say one thing: it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not convince me at all. <br /> <br /> This is essentially the trials and tribulations of a black woman as she grew up from girl to woman. There are many insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but you have to see them all to see how much this woman has endured. Along the way, we see other women who have had to face their difficulties and accompany them to the redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives his best performance of all time in this film. Danny Glover should also have been at least nominated for his role in this movie. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this film is that it treats his subjects with humanity, not like some zany shows like the most recent "Beloved" did. I encourage anyone of any race to see this movie. 9/10
