After Chicago, I began to lose all respect for Richard Gere and then came The Flock. So far, a beautiful smile and some ordinary facial gestures can help you, but he proved to me that he had finally mastered his art and could act with the best of them. Clare Danes was also superb as a "trainee / replacement". Some have suggested that there is too much unnecessary violence, but I do not see it that way. Nothing that I saw detracted from the power of this film. I was really shocked that I did not hear about his theatrical release and met him at Blockbuster instead. Really an exceptional film with the right mix of action, suspense, thrills and social awareness. As good as 7even? Perhaps. And you'll find that Gere plays better than anyone else ever got out of Pitt.
