Burlinson and Thornton give an exceptional performance in this film, with Dennehy. Although it is originally thought that it is only love, it really goes further than that. The beauty of nature captures this movie, ranking among the best I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic !! All horse lovers will love this movie! <br /> <br />
