I just finished watching this movie in my GCSE history class. it was exciting and it was a brilliant glimpse of what had really happened to Steve Biko during the apartheid law era. How can anyone say that this film was the most boring or the most boring of the two-and-a-half hours of their lives, I do not know, because it made me addicted from the beginning to the end. It was great to see how Denzel Washington described it and showed how he was fighting apartheid law and getting equal rights for blacks. In one part, Steve Biko tells a policeman that we are as weak and human as we are, it shows them that he and all other Blacks in South Africa are no different from Whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he believed in what he believed in and did not totally believe in apartheid. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and then woke up the world. I really enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it to people. it helped me to see that racism is not fair and that everyone is equal, their destiny should not be determined by the color of someone's skin. not
