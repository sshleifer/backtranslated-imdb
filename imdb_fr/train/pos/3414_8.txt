This interesting documentary tells the remarkable story of an expedition to bring Tibetan blind children on a hike in the Himalayas; but also a personality conflict between two remarkable people. On the one hand, there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind climber to climb Everest, and the team of mountaineers (lights) who guide the children. On the other hand, Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for blind Tibetans, accepts the expedition but later has doubts about its evolution. At one level, Sabine simply does not understand the mountaineer's philosophy (the focus is on the summit); she is probably right in identifying the mismatch between the mountaineers' goals and the desires of the children, but her certainty about her own justice makes her a difficult person to understand, especially since she has a right to effective veto. In the context of this confrontation (reasonably well organized), we have a glimpse of the lives of the children themselves. I enjoyed the film, even though it airs a message clearly designed to be uplifting - even if it details the quarrel, the film asserts relentlessly how all those who appear there are astonishing. But it is difficult to challenge this assessment, even if it is presented in a somewhat subtle way to the viewer.
