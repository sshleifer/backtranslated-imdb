Have no illusions, this is a story of morality. Granger is the ex-buffalo hunter in trouble, tried once more in the plains by Taylor. Granger can see that the end is near and deeply feels the cost of hunting the flocks, the Indians and the land itself. For Taylor, on the other hand, killing a buffalo, or an Indian, is equivalent to "being with a woman". Although Granger's role as a tortured hunter is superb, it is Taylor who steals the show, as the "ordinary man" insane and immoral in search of money and good times. There is not a lot of bang-bang here, but the story is moving fast and we are treated with a nice Nolan performance. The theme of this story is just as poignant today as in the nineteenth-century report to the land and its content, as well as to racism. Given the timing of this, the censors had to struggle behind the scenes of the "bawdy house", Taylor's relationship with the squaw and much of the dialogue. Although low, it is really an excellent image of the West.
