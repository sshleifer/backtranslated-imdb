Bonanza must have laughed at all the women to say how fatal it was for women to mingle with men from Cartwright. After all, Ben Cartwright was three times widowed with a son at every wedding. And all the women involved in Adam, Hoss and Little Joe were going to die because we could not get rid of the widow and the three sons who had started this classic televised western. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Bonanza had been done today, the writers would have had rotating female characters coming in and out of the Cartwrights' life. People have relationships, some are good, some are not, it's life. And we are less demanding of our heroes today, so if a relationship with one of them goes south, we do not have to kill the character to keep the nobility of the survivor intact. But it's as if Bonanza was finished today. <br /> <br /> But we still waited a lot of our western heroes and Bonanza, although it took a while to take root and a change in the NBC's listening time certainly helped, the secret The noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his devoted sons were one of Bonanza's successes. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal dad for television, whatever genre you want to name. All his life was devoted to the hard work of building this huge Ponderosa extended for his three children. The children's personality was different, but they all shunted away. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights have become and still are an American institution. I think more people care about this family than the Kennedys. The popularity of Bonanza in syndication testifies to this. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts as the eldest son Adam was released from the show. Rumor has it that he did not care about Cartwright's noble characters, whom he considered chilly. Maybe if it had been done now, he would have liked it better as I describe it. <br /> <br /> This was only the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three TV series to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, most reckless, but most romantic Cartwright. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. the show continued with the two younger sons, but when the great Dan Blocker left, Bonanza's heart died out. David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright had adopted the young Mitch Vogel. But fat, loyal, but a bit thick, Hoss was easily the most adorable Cartwrights. His sudden disappearance after surgery left too much of a hole in this family. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights of Ponderosa are therefore history. I had a real glimpse of how America had taken the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real city of Virginia. It's nothing like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, pretty much where you see Ponderosa on the map in the opening credits, is the Cartwright House, the whole being maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the ranchhouse and Cartwrights are real. <br /> <br /> And if they were not, they should have been.
