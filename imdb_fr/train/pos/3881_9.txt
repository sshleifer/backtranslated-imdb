This film took me with the incredible opening sequence that brought me into a complete reversal of perspective, so I became hooked when the title appeared. The theme of this film is that everyone acts, tries to reinvent itself, but not in a delicate way like Identity or the Uspect Suspects, but in the way we all try to make the mundane life in which we find ourselves a little more interesting. The scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular. At one point, Jorgen (who owns the chicken farm) attends a seminar while laughing, where he is the worst student. His discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his desire to change. The film made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most banal people I see every day. There is not much intrigue here. It's pretty easy to guess the old man's secret, but the fascination is trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they find out. This film pleased me in the same way as Sideways, although the characters could not be more different.
