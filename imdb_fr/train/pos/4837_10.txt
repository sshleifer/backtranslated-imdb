I was a young film student in 1979 when the Union of Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia, Bulgaria to create Konchalovsky's "Siberia"; Tarkosvky's "Stalker" and Danelia'a's "Autumn Marathon". I was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and only then, I saw "Siberian" 4 and 1/2 hour epics and was speechless. Much better than Bertolucci's "1900". From afar! <br /> <br /> Hopefully Andron will come to the negative and make the "restored version of the director all the way" someday! In DVD of course! In addition, I fought hard to defend this cinema against most of my colleagues who equated the Soviet film in bad taste! Time is on my side.
