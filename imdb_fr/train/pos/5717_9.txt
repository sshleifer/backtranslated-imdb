Omigosh, it's really the scariest movie I've ever seen. To say that I like horror movies would be an understatement, and I've seen a lot of things (given the limited availability in New Zealand, that's a lot), but I never had to sleep with the light on ... until I see The Grudge. <br /> <br /> Some may say that this is a ring scam of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror movies), two similar (but different) stories, but the Grudge at his film - at the movies, I even shouted at one point in the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is great, especially from the side characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she's such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real jerk and William Mapother seems to be having fun. However, although I'm normally a Clea DuVall fan, she does not really seem to be in this movie. Among the secondary characters, hers probably have the most depth and background, but she does not seem to be complete. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, she stays pretty much the same in all her films and roles, does not she? The ghosts were really scary, the music and the sound effects were chilling (especially the noise caused when the KaDee Strickland character answered the phone in his apartment), the end was cool too. <br /> <br /> Super highly recommended. 9/10
