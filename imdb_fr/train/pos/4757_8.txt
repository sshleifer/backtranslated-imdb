Rod Serling was, of course, a genius and his wonderful, playful and creative mind left part of his life time and examples of television at this stage of development. There are no more shows of this type now, but rather Housewife sluts such as Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pitiful stabs against humor and witty jokes that dot our high-tech screens. . <br /> <br /> Jack Elam slipped into the episode with such precision as an actor and with his usual madness that I can not help thinking that Rod Serling was adapting the show to the week spent around Elam, although it was an accessory to the unfolding of the story. This episode ends as usual, but shock and humor mingle with a dexterity particularly "serlingesque". Rex Lewis Field <br /> <br />
