After watching the short film "Batman Dead End", I did not really know what to expect from World's Finest. Of course, Superman AND Batman. Comics All the best in my world have them as a team. <br /> <br /> After seeing this 3 1/2 minute trailer, it made me wish someone would make a serial movie fan for World's Finest, If it's not a feature film . <br /> <br /> Of course, some of Superman's stuff was ridiculous, but film trailers in theaters are still teasers, which only give you some aspects of the product. This seems to require a complete product. <br /> <br /> Except for director Sandy Collera's parent playing the very poor Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a real movie was shot, the actors would be chosen for the film, although I think Nina Kaczorowski would make a good Lois Lane, especially if we gave her a dialogue closer to the character. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Clark Bartram wearing the Dead End Batman costume, but it should be updated a bit more and not look like Batman's 40's with his cloak and his leather hood of the '80s and' 90s. His behavior resembles that of Batman, but I still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just letting his eyes appear through the mask. I think the goal was to make him as close to the comic character as the movie character. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn can not play Superman, period. He stands with a clumsy look on his face that simply says, "slap me." And online delivery seems to be a problem for him. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would like to see a full story and a film based on this ingenious work. There was a rumor about the best film in the world being made, and with the correct additions to the script, that could be it. Let's hope more like that are done.
