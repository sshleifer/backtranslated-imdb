There are many people in our lives that we only meet once in our life, but for one reason or another, we remember those people for the rest of our lives. These unique friendships in a life occur between distant people and there are always natural reasons why we do not meet them anymore. We do not even know their names, because we are never introduced to each other, and sometimes we forget to ask their name. It's funny to see how much humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because the meeting could spoil good memories, or we do not know it. We are too scared to check that. <br /> <br /> The movie "Before Sunrise" just surprised me. I never intended to look at it until the end, but as the discussion between the couples seemed interesting, I took a look for the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect, but the young couple either. They had time to chat with each other until sunrise and everything could happen before having to separate. I think this film has had good reviews because the situation has been experienced at least once or twice by all the inhabitants of this planet. It makes us all think of all the people we have met once in our lives.
