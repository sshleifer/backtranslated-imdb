American Jesse took the train to Vienna to fly to the United States. On the train, he met a French girl, Céline. Although they met for the first time, they spoke as good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse begged Céline to accompany her on a tour of Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolded. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, they were cautious. The funniest scene was their listening to CDs in a music store. They glanced at each other, but their eyes did not touch. After a thorough conversation, their relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene they claimed to call their respective friend. Their deep love for each other has been fully expressed in words. <br /> <br /> Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come as you wish. Love needs mutual understanding. Without this, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is what matters most to love. <br /> <br /> The excellent screenplay and the performance allowed the film to be a great success. <br /> <br /> One of the best romantic movies. 9/10
