I read the negative reviews before watching this movie and undeterred, went ahead and started watching. I admit that I had to rewind several times because the film is incredibly complex, complex and full of details. It's a good thing, but also, quite unexpectedly, in this culture of car chases, explosions, free sex, and general violence that is a substitute for conspiracy and character development. In fact, what a welcome departure, however, I am so used to not paying much attention to what I am looking at. <br /> <br /> This movie is packed with character development and line of land; the kind we used to analyze when I was in high school. This requires real mental participation on the part of the viewer. What a beautiful change. I would compare this to "All Men of the President" in terms of generic content. In other words, it is a mystery that very serious mistakes on the part of elected officials and those who have sufficient influence over them to "appropriate". <br /> <br /> Unlike "All Men of the President", this film tries to give some characters a real personality. In this sense, the film is a character study like "The Negotiatior" with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In this film, their characters are both employees of the city and the plot is extremely intense. However, the plot depends on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other, to trust each other and finally to unite against the corrupt police department. There is more gunshot fire in this film and the specific plot is different but, in general, there are a lot of similarities. <br /> <br /> I will say that the town hall needs a lot more concentration. In fact, I was struck by how much it parallels the past and current political scandals I've seen in my life going back to Watergate. The fact is that the public knows that something is wrong, that's for sure! but it's hard to follow the details. This film is not nearly as complex as real life, but it is actually realistic to life in its complexity. I think this is one of the reasons why the previous posters criticized the film: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If we watch this film knowing what they will see and able to live this experience, it's really excellent! I watched it 3 times in a row! The acting is superb and the staging is flawless. The weakest link is John Cusak's accent.
