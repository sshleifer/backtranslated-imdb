Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude toward sexuality. He has no problem lurking naked dancers, but when women start having sex with men, that's when he loses them. He believes that when women have sex, they lose all sense of innocence and / or "beauty". So, he wandered away in the Hollywood Hills of Hollywood Hills, ending up killing the men with a high-powered rifle with a rifle scope. <br /> <br /> The main apparent reason for the existence of this movie is to engage in sexual activity activities again and again. "History" is an afterthought. This will certainly please many happy heterosexual men, as we are treated with enough nudity scenes (the women here look terribly good without clothes) and sex to serve a major dose of titillation. Of course, seeing a good deal of it across a field of application greatly increases the creepiness factor and illustrates compulsion to voyeurism. (Among other things, Mike watches the couples through the viewfinder for a few minutes before pulling the trigger.) All this is underlined by terribly intrusive, though rather atmospheric, music on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Those who have a penchant for sordid waste will benefit to one degree or another. It even includes a lesbian dating that confuses Mike and makes him uncertain * how * to react. It takes place at a very slow pace, but ends with a funny irony. It's a weird and twisted rarity only if nothing else definitely holds certain viewers glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
