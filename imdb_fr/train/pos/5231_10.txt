to communicate in the film the essential things of life - what is life like, what does it make sense? - is purely impossible. Of course, each film (story) presents possible answers to these questions, but communication requires a direct call to consciousness. This occurs if the contribution of the senses cancels the "contribution" of our mind, that is, our thoughts. Few directors know how to communicate essential things. Tarkovsky is one of them. His "Stalker" shows images of existence, communicates life as it is and yet escapes your mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff are doing the same thing.
