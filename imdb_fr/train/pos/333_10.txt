In all honesty, this series is a classic (on television) just like the original poem of world literature. Far from being a brutal exploitation, it is a magnificent and respectful rendering of one of the texts that define Western culture. <br /> <br /> I was moved by the tragic fate of Ulysses and his disciples; touched by the tragedy of the fall of Troy (which was felt but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals. (It is worth mentioning that the gods that appear here are not ridiculous CGI creatures waving wings, nor poorly molded bikini models.) As in Homer's work, they act through lethal agents or, rarely, are represented by a classical statuary.). <br /> <br /> Too bad it is not available on DVD, especially because of the very inferior and derisory adaptations of the Odyssey that can be found in video stores.
