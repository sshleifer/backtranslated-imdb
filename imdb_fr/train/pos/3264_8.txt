What a loss the death of director Emile Ardolino has been! He could take a light scenario and, with the right casting and editing, twinkle and shine like a star. This particular star is perhaps not the brightest of the sky, unlike the big romances, but it's definitely the one that keeps you listening until the end. You really want to know how things are going to be. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect for Cybill Shepherd, who at the time needed to capitalize on her successful "Moonlighting" for the new generation who (luckily for her) probably did not know the number of misfires that she had on a big screen after a very promising start. In this movie, she is quite a new widow and still lives as a widow who lives vicariously through her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson at the dawn of celebrity culminating with "Frozen Green Tomatoes" two years later) . She may have looked too young for the role, but it works well for the unfolding of the story. It's his film, but it does not go beyond its limits. <br /> <br /> SHepherd gracefully allows Robert Downey Jr. to make a large part of the film and shows a comic flair more mature than in his film. previous films at this point. And Ryan O'Neal (in his best role for years) and Christopher MacDonald support. The natural charm of Masterson coincides pretty well, or she has the power to make her character look like a breath of fresh air with every word. <br /> <br /> Ardolino makes good use of the sex appeal of his casting. He did the same with "Dirty Dancing", but this film is not so hot, so you can watch it with your parents if they were in the room. (Use your best judgment, these are your parents, after all.) I give this movie a high rating because it is very user-friendly, romantic comedy lovers will find it sublime, and those who just watch with them should in find full humor to savor too. <br /> <br /> Once again, Emile Ardolino deserves credit for having taken advantage of a charming screenplay by Randy and Perry Howze. (Where are they now?) Ardolino's next film would be the sequel to "Three Men and One Baby," but his latest Sister Act would finally give him the nine-digit hit he deserved. Mr. Ardolino, your cinematic touch is missed!
