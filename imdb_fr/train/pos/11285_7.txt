Like Tarzan the Ape Man (1932), but more. There is more than anything, more animals, more varied African tribes, and scenes in which thought should be, if it were good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan fights with crocodiles - the crocodile machine turns in the water like a rolling pin, around and around, jaws beating. Tarzan can kill him with his omnipresent knife if the saurian blasted was to remain motionless. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a growing number of animals. His friends are real chimpanzees, people dressed in great ape costumes and elephants. In fact, they use Indian elephants - much more friendly and catchy than African - with ears in costume attached to the head. Human history: Another white man, worse than the rest, joins Holt to look for ivory from the elephant cemetery. Tarzan will not show them the way, so the villain pulls an elephant so they can follow him to his deathbed. Tarzan intercedes, and the villain shoots him, but, of course, he survives and returns to save Jane. All the others die, Holt and the bad guy and each of their "boys". People are goods, especially Africans, and there does not seem to be much distinction between blacks who die because they work for whites traveling in taboo countries and blacks who kill them. It must be Tarzan's latest film before the Hays Code forces Jane to wear more clothes. There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane is swimming naked, and although the light glitters, movement and glimpses are very appealing. Apparently, one of the friends of Weismuller's Olympic swimming team filmed the nude scenes, not Maureen O'Sullivan. However, she runs the film with the same kind of loincloth as Weismuller (plus a bikini top), showing a magnificent glimpse of the thigh and hip. They still do not need to talk much. They sleep together and spend time with cool animals and stay away from cities. No wonder they are happy.
