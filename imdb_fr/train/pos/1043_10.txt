Since I remember and I'm only 18, my mother and I look and watch older movies because I find them much more rewarding in the long run (but do not get me wrong, I love movies Today, I do not have as much as I like movies from the 40s and 50s) Anyway, I must now say that as soon as I started watching the movie, my eyes were stuck on the television. Of course, my favorite character was Lucile Watson's grandmother. But I liked how Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. The children ... did not behave like children. But there is a good reason for that, after having to hide and running all your life, seeing the horrible things that the children saw these days destroyed their innocence. So people who said "oooo hated the way kids acted ... blah blah blah" read between the lines and know they've seen things kids should not see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas ... dear Paul did an amazing job !!! Now, I know a lot of people are furious that he goes to the Oscar, but Bogie did not do it, but they both did an incredible job, so I think it could have been that way. But Lukas' performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie, I was in tears. I liked this movie so much and recommend it to everyone !! :-RE
