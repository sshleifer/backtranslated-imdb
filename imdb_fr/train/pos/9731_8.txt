Sidney Young (Pegg) is moving from England to New York to work for Sharpe's popular magazine hoping to live the lifestyle of her dreams, but struggles to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> According to Toby Young's book on survival in Europe, American Affairs, this drama has received mixed reviews. Losing the wrong way to lose friends has been described as funny but incoherent with a lot of charm for the actors. A fish like an ordinary fish makes fun of the pond, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This 2008 image works because of its actors and the story simple but clear. We start in the past, then in the present, and work to see how Young stood out in one of the best American magazines. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) loves words too much. Whether it's hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law, the English actor brings charm and lightness to every scene. Here, when the scenario is good but far from his own standards, he brings a lot of energy to the photo and he is the only one to have the trouble. His antics with "Babe 3" are unforgivable, just breathtaking, like his dance too exuberant, but he succeeds wonderfully well. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson are good at portraying the stereotypical patterns of the magazines where Dunst fits the confused love interest. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone that she can play here with a strange hyperbole of a stereotypical movie star. The fact that her character, Sophie Myles, appears in an image of Mother Teresa is as laughable as the antics of her character in the pool. To emphasize this point, there is a dog, and Pegg finishes it in a true Brit comedy, with an original touch. <br /> <br /> Even if a British film, Young is adapted to the American lifestyle while he tries to integrate and we can see the different approaches of the narration. Young wants the dirty right down to contrast with American professionalism. The inclusion of modern stars in the tabloid will make this film obsolete, but the concept of exploitation of movie stars gives this advantage. <br /> <br /> The first image of Weide is not perfect. There is a lack of concentration because the plot becomes too soapy with an obvious twist and there are too many characters to be needed. Physical comedy can also be exaggerated. As a comment, the bloopers on the DVD are some of the best you'll ever see, which last almost half an hour. <br /> <br /> This comedy drama is directed by Simon Pegg and with the collective approach to tell stories and a strong comedy, it is worth watching.
