I loved this film. I saw him for the first time at the age of 20 (barely four years ago) and I enjoyed my experience so much that I brought my own copy the next day. The comedy is well played by all the people involved. I always have to go back and look again at the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water at a depth of 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another. Also look for Jason Robards' father who plays Mr. Retch. The talent ran in this family.
