Sad story of a B-17 pilot shot. Brady is shot on the occupied territory. Local breeders offered him kindness and protection at the cost of their lives. I had never heard of this movie and it hung on me for two hours. After the movie, I'm glad I took the time. It's quite a story told to explain the look on Brady's face at the beginning of the film.
