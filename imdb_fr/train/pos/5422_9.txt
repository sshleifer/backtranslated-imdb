The story of the untouchable who acted as a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands of lives, is told in the film "Gunga Din" of 1939. Based on Rudyard Kipling's poem, the film is brilliantly directed by George Stevens and stars Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor Mclagen. The title role is played by Sam Jaffe. His name, Dr. Zorba, became the boss of Ben Casey. It has become synonymous with thorny uncontrollable hair. Say "Dr. Zorba hair" to anyone of my generation, and they know what you're talking about. <br /> <br /> Located in India at the time of British occupation, three soldiers - two romantic and frisky characters at Grant and Fairbanks, and McLagen as a jumbo - are cuts - in reality, three boys overgrown. Gunga Din is the water carrier, treated rather nasty - anyhow verbally - by McChesney (McLaglen), but Cutter (Grant) likes him a lot. When he catches Din (pronounced Deen) playing the soldier and greets the unit during his maneuvers, Cutter gives him some guidance. <br /> <br /> The happy band of musketeers will separate Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces that he will marry a pretty young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leave the service. However, when Gunga Din and Cutter meet Thugees, a murderous cult led by a guru (Eduardo Cianelli), Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit and Ballantine insists on re-enlisting to help save Cutter. It's a friends movie after all. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" begins with lightness, a zany comedy and a magnificent and vast comedy, especially of Cary Grant, who is quite funny. He and Fairbanks are so handsome that it's hard to decide which one to look at first. Much of the film is made up of huge, very exciting action sequences. In the last part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense and exciting battle. <br /> <br /> Grant plays the most obvious role, Fairbanks is the romantic lover of the disease and McLaglen the incarnation of McChesney, mainly because of Gunga Din, is the most unimaginable character, even if one detects his tender heart in his love for his elephant Annie. Its softness is reflected towards the end of the film, especially in the very touching and heartbreaking final scene. <br /> <br /> Always a sweet and friendly actor, Sam Jaffe gives a great performance like Gunga Din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, a powerful imagination and big dreams. Without much dialogue, Jaffe beautifully expresses the soul of Gunga Din. <br /> <br /> This is truly the ultimate adventure movie, of gigantic scale, with good actors, catchy scenes, a magnificent musical score and beautiful cinematographic images. Another of this remarkable year, 1939. Highly recommended.
