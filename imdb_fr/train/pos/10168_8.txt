Look at Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a film about a dead girlfriend who haunts the new girlfriend. This is Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives and the guy who wore "Panther sex cologne" in Anchorman. If you're waiting for a Golden Globes nominated movie, you have to rethink how you watch movies. However, if you are ready to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie, you are in the right place. The characters are all funny. They work very well together. The real match is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He is as funny as on Friends and she was funny and pretty at the same time. I went with my wife, she appreciated and me too.
