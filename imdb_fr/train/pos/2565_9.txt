I really enjoyed this film about the sometimes-developed relationships between the US military and Japanese women in postwar Japan - as well as the barriers created by prejudice. Brando passes scorn for the Japanese (which is natural given the Second World War) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and want to marry her. His performance is correct (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and the film is wonderful. Red Buttons received an Oscar for her moving performance from another GI who fell in love in Japan (although the Japanese playing in front of him also did a remarkable job). <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin it. but the film is good to watch with a box of tissues. <br /> <br /> This film manages to say something and be entertaining at the same time. A jewel generally underestimated.
