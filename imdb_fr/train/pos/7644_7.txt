Jim Belushi is great as "Average Joe" who gets his 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is the mysterious bar seller who not only listens to Belushi's "story", but "heals" all the problems of Belushi's middle class: a magic potion to provoke an avalanche of changes in Belushi's life. <br /> <The flashbacks show a 15-year-old man is horribly ashamed of having caused the defeat of his baseball team in high school. Belushi continues her "pitiful life", apparently happy, but still wondering "if ..." During what seems to last several days, Belushi lives a "different" life, that of huge success, admired and hated by others in equal measure . <br /> <br /> It's not quite "it's a wonderful life", but some elements are similar and very endearing. The "end" is predictable, but still satisfactory. Watch for the very young Cortney Cox in her role of "fatal attraction", like another woman. A very nice movie!
