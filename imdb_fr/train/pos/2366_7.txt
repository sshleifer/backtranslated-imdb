This film (with the alternative title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And it was an excellent introduction. Although I had never heard of him before, he seemed like an excellent fighter. The action scenes in this movie are great! By the way, there are many too. The rookie fight at QG Peacekeepers is particularly good. There is really something funny to say that only one guy who beats the mouth of a group of people is really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the bad guy. Roles like this fit him well (but not the others). Matthias Hues has also done a good job, as always. He is an excellent fighter and a macho type character, and was a good rival for Wincott in this movie.
