I do not think most of us would tend to apply the term "must-see" to action movies, but I was very impressed by the quality of this film and it deserves the stamp " must-see ". <Br /> <br /> Mandy played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the late Bruce Lee and sister of the late Brandon Lee) is recruited by Martin, a professional thief to help set up a diamond robbery in a museum for a union criminal and be rewarded generously for that. They hardly know that another couple of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a couple of lovebirds), who were pushed back by Mandy and Martin earlier to participate in the deal, are also considering stealing the diamond. <br /> <br /> The way each pair of robbers plans the flight is a pleasure to watch. Things go wrong, while Martin and Mandy find themselves unconsciously behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself rooting for these thieves as they realize they need each other to stay alive from the criminal group, who are not happy at all that the diamond is not in his hands. <br /> <br /> Fans of action will not be disappointed, as there is a good deal of fighting, martial arts and melee fights. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that this film is not only action, but also romance and laughter (and I'm not talking about your typical characters from action movies ) who sneak <br /> <br /> It is not easy to tackle the bad guys, but we see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. <br /> <br /> A great movie and a NO to miss! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
