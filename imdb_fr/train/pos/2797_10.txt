10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a British Indian doctor, currently in India. Beckham put me off, 'cause I'm a big fan of Liverpool and personally think Owen is really cool. Since Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was dead, of course, that I would not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> But then, I was in Delhi to meet friends and I had an early flight. I thought, what the heck, let's watch this movie, because it was a late-night show. <br /> <br /> What a fool I was. I should have seen this movie the day it was released. I imagine that Beckham's name was used to attract the audience (which attracted me in the back !!!), but I really can not imagine a better title for the film. <br /> <br /> And Nagra, Knightley (drop dead gorgeous) and Rhys-Myers did a great job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football, do not like Manchester United (or even England), then it's DEFINATELY the movie for you. In fact, I'm only 29, a psychiatrist by profession, but a child at heart. This movie has dropped "Star Wars" from my No. 1 position. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there are not many comments on this film by Indians like me. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
