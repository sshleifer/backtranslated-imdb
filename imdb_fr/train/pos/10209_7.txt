"Happenstance" is the most inspired Parisian movie in New York that I've seen since "When the cat is away (Everyone searches for their cat)". <br /> <br /> A film from last year, released now to capitalize on the attention Audrey Tatou is looking for "Am√©lie", her title in French is more appropriate: "The flutter of the butterfly wings" as a summary of chaos theory as a determining element of our lives. <br /> <br /> Tatou's gamine-ness is less annoying here because it only shines from time to time on this glowing smile in the midst of her unfortunate adventures and as part of a larger ensemble Multiethnic so big that it took me a long time to fix the problem. the characters, especially because some of the cute guys and older women looked like me and some of the characters were fantasizing about what they should do, so I did not know if they were doing it or not. <br /> <br /> But I loved the urban coincidence of coincidences, from immigrants to love nests, to crowded subway cars and cafes lying around. <br /> <br /> The subtitles were rather unpleasant to both parties once. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 12/8/2001)
