As has been well documented in previous posters, the true stars of Rockstar: INXS - and much more, Rockstar: Supernova - are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. I do not know who they are? They are the impressive rock band and rock house whose music and talent have made this show more than a sad clone of American Idol. <br /> <br /> Remember the string party? It was musical precision and perfection if I've ever seen it. Suzie McNeil's epic interpretation of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody", Ty Taylor's memorable cover on "You Can not Always Get ...", JD Fortune singing "Suspicious Minds". The common denominator is the impressive House Band. <br /> <br /> Even if INXS was at its peak, they are unfortunately only a shadow of their personality, although the JD show has somewhat breathed new life into their music, This show is entirely dedicated to HB. <br /> <br /> Note to producers: The third season (if we are lucky to have it) should be Rockstar: House Band. Get these boys a good singer and they go places.
