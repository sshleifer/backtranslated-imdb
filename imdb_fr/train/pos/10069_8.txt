This film is worth the detour for visual beauty and acting alone, but there is also an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and performers (gathered in a supporting role of a travesti opera star) are condemned to be relegated to the rank of sub-servant in China. This further reinforces the unlikely link between an old street artist and a girl who triumphs over Aboriginal culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to ignite. emotion rendered useless by the performance of the actors. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to the unsatisfactory action movies of the summer.
