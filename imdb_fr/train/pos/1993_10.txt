This is a musical adaptation of "Oliver Twist" by Dicken. Most of the time, the original story has been preserved, but some sub-intrigues (such as the summer he devoted to recovering and the half-brother) have been omitted for the unfolding of the film. The biggest difference in the film and in the story is that, at the end of the book, Fagin is hanged - a very different end of this musical film. <br /> <br /> This is a unique musical piece - one whose style and scope have not really been equaled before or since. Not only are the songs often quite memorable and memorable, but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold. While in most musicals, a few people, or even a small group, choreographed dances, the figures are often hundreds or more. It's truly a sight to behold and I was lucky to have seen it at the theater when it debuted and is one of my earliest childhood memories. I just saw him a few moments ago and I must say that the film has improved over time. Beautiful scenery, acting and wonderful singing - it's a special treat that's hard to dislike. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the movie tonight, I was surprised by the height and femininity Mark Lester's vocals were for the movie. Well, according to IMDb, her song was dubbed by a girl and that would certainly explain her voice.
