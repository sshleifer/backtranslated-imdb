If you're a fan of Altman's big ensembles, as great movies like Mr.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and less-known films like A Wedding show, you'll no doubt be entertained by HealtH. Centered around a health convention where two women run for president, HealtH brings together many of Altman's regulars in the 70s, such as Paul Dooley (who helped write the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, as well as newcomers to Altman such as Lauren Bacall, James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many Altman movie sets, this movie has many secondary intrigues, but it's not as overwhelming as movies like Nashville or A Wedding, but rather more centered, perhaps like Mr.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is an obvious satire of the health movement, filled with contradictory and extravagant characters, with invited stars like Dick Cavett commenting tenaciously. Altman's characteristic pessimism with regard to politics and audience appeal is highlighting, but the most appealing of this film is the sheer fun that most people seem to have. It would be one of the last Altman movies like this for a long time!
