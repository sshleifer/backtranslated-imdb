Huge, exhaustive and passionate summary of American cinema through the eyes of Martin Scorcese. Needless to say, there is never a moment of boredom in its 4 hours of operation. Many genres, periods and directors are all examined and discussed more from the point of view of the movie buff than the contemporary director. For anyone even interested in distance by American films, or cinema in general. A masterpiece and the best of BFI's Century of Cinema series. <br /> <br />
