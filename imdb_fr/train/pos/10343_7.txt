Melvyn Douglas, star of "Amazing Mr. Williams", shot five films in 1939, including Ninotchka with Garbo. Her co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who also made five films this year, three of which were made together! Douglas is Lieutenant Williams and his teammate is presented with a dead body, and they must understand what really happened. Viewers will recognize his colleagues - the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) have always played roles of authority ... senators, bank presidents, police. This fool has a flair of comedy: the police are always blows, and even Williams and his girlfriend are fighting verbally. A few funny gags - Williams even takes the man they stopped with his girlfriend. There are many fun things here, so go beyond the slow start and wait for the funniest things later. You do not want to give spoilers, so you'll have to catch it with Turner Classic Movies. Director Alexander Hall did mostly comedies and would have been engaged to Lucy at some point.
