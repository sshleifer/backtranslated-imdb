The problem is that the film echoed the concept of the '60s concept that comics could only be made as "camp" (ie the Batman show of the' 60s) for television and television. the film. So, you have combat sequences with subtitles (come on!), A Doc Savage absolutely unromantic (he was uncomfortable with women in the skin, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair in a night sheet (a guaranteed scene to give you nightmares for several nights), and the totally hokey ending with the secondary villain wrapped in gold as a Herv√© Villechez posing as an Oscar. And when they do not make bright music for the march of Sousa, the little music "funny" tarnishes much of the drama. <br /> <br /> Even as such, this movie is ... okay. It's fun and when it's serious, it's a very accurate representation of the pasta. With the exception of Monk, as mentioned before: he is extremely muscular, not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a pale skinny guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with a scarf (inexplicable). <br /> <br /> The sequences of Green Death, for example, are remarkably horrible and are not something I would recommend for children. But they are very close to the feeling of pulp. When writers and producers have understood, they understand - I'll give them that. <br /> <br /> But if the producers have made Doc with the caring and scripting magnets of, say, Reeves two Superman movies, think about what we could have had then. I think the problem is the schizophrenia of the film. There is a definite feeling of trying to pay tribute to the 30 years, but they are also trying to give in to the attitude of the "hero must be the camp" created by Batman. It feels like there was a sober first draft of pulp style then someone came in and said, "Hey, let's make it funny - it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!" <br /> <br /> But Doc still lives, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch does not pay tribute to Doc Savage in this film, the man is really crazy. So, when the show goes on television (apparently in the mid-season between 1999 and 2000), Doc Savage, updated in the 90's, will live again.
