<br /> <br /> Everything is relative, seems to be the main theme since the beginning of this set of eleven pieces of eleven directors. That is, what could be the number one priority for people like Bush, Blair and Company might not be for a lot of people, ordinary citizens. From the opening scene, an Iranian teacher tries to impress the most important thing that has happened to her little students. As a result, children are not impressed, because the death of a neighbor and things like that affect them much more closely. that all that could have happened in New York, United States, anywhere, this series of documentary-style plays establishes that not all things are equal for all men that some world leaders would like to prophesy. <br /> <br /> While the attack on the WTC was obviously an odious event, it seems like politicians and cameramen have a tendency to blow things up in a disproportionate way - marvelously manifested in one of these rooms. Would the same reaction have occurred internationally if the attack had been perpetrated on Lagos, for example, or Jakarta, for example, or even Rio de Janeiro, for example? I think rather than no. The information seems to be distorted according to the place where the events take place: for example, an earthquake in Italy gives more time to an earthquake than an earthquake ten times more destructive in outer Mongolia, for example. Greater distances seem to reduce the scale of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This series of eleven plays puts things in perspective - or maybe I should say some pieces, as every director freely invented his own story, his own perspective translation, of so that it is not possible to judge all the merits, but individually for each eleven-minute segment. <br /> <br /> We must in no way infer that this is an anti-American film: it would be too simple a reading of the various messages that appear through the segments. However, it is not pro-American either. The eleven segments adopt a variety of attitudes and the common link - if one exists - is that the disaster of the WTC attack must be viewed from a different perspective. It is only then that people like George Bush will even begin to understand the planet he lives on. <br /> <br /> Clearly in a segment, my belief that I have been feeding for two years already: America has not learned the lesson. And the lesson is that the United States must share this planet with the rest of humanity - not dominate it with ruthless economic persuasion or simply by force. Instead of learning that the United States can no longer continue to trample everyone and everywhere, its political leaders, aided and abetted by Blair (and even by Aznar), have become even more arrogant and intolerant, do no good to anyone in Afghanistan. or Iraq right now, let alone much else. The White House mentality is totally rejectable: the United States and the United Kingdom have invaded Iraq and caused all the chaos. It is therefore necessary to resolve the disorder they caused. Do not insist that the UN and other countries make an effort to find the solution out of the turmoil. <br /> <br /> The radical positions adopted by the United States (or even by Israel) will be welcomed only by the radical positions of the Islamic people, who have been preparing for years a fanatic fundamentalism, if only for to hide his own machismo from uselessness, that is to say, stoning women to death or simply wrapping them from the top of their heads to the dusty ground. <br /> <br /> The world is in a catastrophic situation, fueled by the greed of a few rich countries that seem determined to see and understand nothing in a more multilateral perspective. This film in eleven separate pieces accurately describes this dark and dumb posture.
