I enjoyed watching this movie on TCM and watching a very young William Powell (Philo Vance) play detective as he did with Myrna Loy in "Thin Man Series". In the 1930s, William Powell starred in the Philo Vance series and, in this photo, the famous actress Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) became one of the suspects in a murder / suicide case in which a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barrot)) is found dead and Archer was in a locked room inside. Ralph Morgan (secretary of Raymond Wrede / Archer) played a leading role and was the brother of Frank Morgan who appeared in "The Wizard of Oz" in 1939. Eugene Palette (Detective Sergeant Heath) appeared in many of these movies Vance films and also gave an excellent performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember that the least likely actor could very well be the killer. Enjoy a classic of the past.
