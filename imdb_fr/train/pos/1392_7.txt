Sci-fi budget bizarre, trippy, with no history or subject to tell, about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They become witnesses of a series of events whose degree of strangeness increases; apparently, they are caught in a spatio-temporal chain where past, present and future meet. <br /> <br /> This is the excuse for a very amusing special effects parade - a constant sound and light, dinosaur-like creatures that have a small, friendly AND friendly little ET that enchants the small- girl, and so on. This picture shows a little imagination, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> Very nice Richard Band music, captivating special effects, such as David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Kuran. , a friendly family are essential assets. It generates a feeling of childish amazement; it may well be that it is rather a boost for the children (or the children inside many of us) who are able to hide the flaws of the story or the presentation. I struggled to resist. ; it's a short and enjoyable entertainment (80 minutes) and a decent credit for director John "Bud" Cardos (from the renowned "Kingdom of the Spiders") and executive producer Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
