This image of 1935 is distributed with all kinds of Ocars for the best director, John Ford, the actor Victor McLaglen and the music of Max Seiner. Victor McLaglen ("Gypo Nolan"), "Call Out the Marines", 42 years old, gave a remarkable performance as an Irish rebel belonging to a hard and fierce crowd, all fighting for a cause and becoming poorer and poorer. with a lot of drinking. Gypo Nolan made a big mistake in deciding to become an informant for her best friend to take a trip with her daughter to America and a new way of life. Preston Foster (Don Gallagher), "Guadalcanal Diary", 43, played a prominent role as leader of the Irish rebellion and was eager to capture his group's informant. Gypo Nolan is haunted by his friend's betrayal and begins to feel like a Judas. Excellent film for 1935 and superb interpretation of McLaglen, but rather depressing in all aspects of the film.
