After reading the reviews of this movie, I naturally started to look at it with a lot of doubts about its usefulness. However, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The majority of the critics I read said that the complicated plot made the task too difficult to follow. And while some parts leave you confused, the end goes on so much that you want to kick your foot because you missed so much. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch", in the sense that it's not so funny (actually, it's pretty dark), and it's a lot smarter, in the way you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints (and, in one of the best scenes in the movie, Jason Statham spends five minutes in an elevator arguing). This film is similar to the two films I just mentioned, it is full of memorable characters, especially Statham, who plays fantastically the main role, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the film in Speedos but gives a great performance nonetheless. If you have time, and if you then have time to think about the film and even see it again, you really start to see all the symbolism and clues that are presented in the film. I think it's fantastic and Guy Ritchie is a director at the top of his game.
