As an old white housewife, I can always understand that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. anyone who appreciates his work, as in Deep Cover, would like to watch the incredible range of actors of this actor. Since I think it's his first film, it could be even more interesting. The acting game is pretty good. If you can not take the junky worlds of Manhattan or the reality of crime life (it's not a glorified action), then this movie will not please you. This is the usual contribution of Mr. Fishburne to incredibly subtle relationships. I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins fight one day in a movie.
