A beautiful film by Powell and Pressburger, which I now want to explore further. The film talks about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how difficult it is to distinguish the two. Well done and played, although David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims. Fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This film made me think while I watched it and after.
