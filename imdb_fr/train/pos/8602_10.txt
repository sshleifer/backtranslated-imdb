We used to say, concerning Nathaniel Hawthorne, that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I think the same comment might be appropriate for McDonald-Eddy's photos. And especially this one. <br /> <br /> It apparently has many features of a failed film: it's kitsch, the script, because of censorship, seems inconsistent ?? However, this film also has some good points: the good music of Rodgers-Hart ("I married an angel", "Tira drew it pulled"), a good acting with E.E. Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you can not like it, you can not forget it. This strange film actually leaves a very strong impression, dreamlike, and it is likely that you keep it in mind for days, even weeks. Why? In the thirties and the beginning of the forties, cinema did not have the same meaning as today: it aimed, like a dream, to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality. Of all the dream films made at this time, this one is particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> In short, let's say that the best way to enjoy this movie is to watch it without wondering. be it good or bad. To watch it, as if you were watching a dream.
