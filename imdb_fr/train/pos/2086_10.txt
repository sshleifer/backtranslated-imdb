Faithful to the work of Pearl S. Buck, whose years spent in China in the childhood of missionary parents have allowed her to better understand Chinese culture and her philosophy, this film adaptation is brilliantly achieved, both technically and artistically. Wang Lung is a humble farmer who recognizes the basics of life: surviving on his land and being newly married to Olan, a servant of a rich and powerful family from the village area. Despite Wang Lung and Olan's efforts to cultivate the land, raise children and earn money, famine threatens to destroy everything they have worked for. Choosing not to sell their land, a traditional Asian belief, they go to a big city to wait for famine. When they are in the city, they are reduced to begging and are among the hundreds of other unfortunate homeless families. Although not a looter, Olan is caught in a crowd plundering at a rich man's house. She is summarily arrested for execution by the army, but is saved at the last minute. Her good fortune, however, is finding valuable jewelery on the plundering site that allows her and her family to return to their farm and start over. The newly discovered wealth transforms Wang Lung. He becomes selfish, egocentric, and takes the credit of discovery. He becomes a very wealthy farmer, but that only makes things worse, because he becomes increasingly ungrateful, arrogant and hard to reason with. He loses contact with the fundamentals of life that money can not buy: loyalty, commitment, trust, justice and honesty. As a punishment, nature returns once again to Wang Lung by sending a plague of locusts to destroy everything he has. Sitting on his knees, Wang Lung seeks the help of all his friends, former friends, workers and his family. With all this help, he manages to save the farm. From this experience, he returns once again to humility and an appreciation of the basics of life.
