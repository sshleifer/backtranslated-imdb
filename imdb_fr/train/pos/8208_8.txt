I liked almost every movie in the Dirty Harry series except the one I think is called "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was a little weak in the areas too, but I still enjoyed it. This one is one of my favorites of the series, if nothing else for the superb series of "Go ahead, make my day". This one also presents an interesting plot, although familiar, in which someone kills those who have wronged him. Just think "Magnum Force" with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot. Certainly, there is a little more than that because it presents a very beautiful final confrontation in an amusement park. Dirty Harry is offered a bulldog and Sandra Locke in a rather humorous scene. The only question left is why Clint Eastwood must have had the very poor actress Sandra Locke in so many of her films. It brings the score one point each time, although overall, the movie is nice for me. Admittedly, she is not too bad here, but her character could have been much better by someone else. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, sometimes, they almost seem to be commercials for guns. I like weapons as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes from him explaining all the strengths of his most recent weapon and the number of bullets it contains? Yet, very nice entry into the Dirty Harry movie series.
