This film illustrates the worst of the war, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women, returning home can be the start of real problems. I remember my father and his brothers coming back from the Second World War. For one of my uncles, the war was never over. He survived the D-Day invasion, akin to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For him, not only were the memories lost, but they tortured him. He became an alcoholic, like many of my cousins, his sons. Jump in 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. When I saw this at KC FilmFest, I was reminded that there are things about the war that never change. The idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war, you will come back with more compassion for the soldiers who are trying to do what they think or they said. <br /> <br /> The slogan of the film platoon on the Vietnam War says it all. "The first victim of war is innocence."
