I give this film an A + for the pure camp! Maria Riva, Dietrich's daughter, wrote in the book about her mother: "If we see the garden of Allah in the context of the high camp, it can be very amusing." And how! I laugh with rapture at the excessive score and the dialogue surprisingly, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic. Viewers who read the stories of Boyer's forelock (he could not get stuck in the heat) sneer at each appearance. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer seldom look at each other by giving their lines - instead, they look far into the distance, probably so that their faces can be photographed in the best light and with the most advantageous (if you play with a turkey, look as well!). Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. As Riva notes in his book, Dietrich managed to steal Paramount's Travis Banton and have him design some of the most divine dresses, such as the beige chiffon dress and cape. <br /> <br /> I totally agree with the other commentators I love Technicolor. It's hard to believe that the film was shot in 1936 - the color is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In short, if you look at the garden of Allah with indulgence and you accept the ridiculous, you can not help but take advantage of it.
