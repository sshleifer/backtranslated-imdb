This film is a kind of Carrie meets Heavy Metal. This is a type of high school student who is very flirting and who takes his revenge completely with the help of a ghost of Heavy Metal. it's a classic. The soundtrack is A ++++. You have living legends of metal in it. And Marc Price was great in this movie. It's a must for metal fans.
