This show is my escape from reality for ten years. I will miss him very much. Even if Atlantis filled the hole a bit. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (on TV anyway) has been beautifully done. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. As if he was trying to explain how it was on the set of the series. (All those who have been working together for so long have had ups and downs, but over the years they have become a family). I thought it was a wonderful way to end the criticism of others. <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special and, on many occasions, I crossed thresholds of disbelief and astonishment. Wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From episode one, I became addicted. The mixture of action, science, drama and especially comedy worked so well that I did not want it anymore. <br /> <br /> There are no real words to fully express what this show meant to me. I can only thank those who have kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years. It inspired me to do a lot of things that I thought impossible. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the movies next year and I really hope there will be more. I never want the show to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
