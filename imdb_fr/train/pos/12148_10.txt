This movie has a lot of comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this one. He displays his comic side and it was really weird to see him get beaten up. His training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought that knotting would be so deadly ?? Many large waterfalls and choreographies. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang to the mix and you have a great final showdown! Do not mess with Manchu thugs; they are ruthless!
