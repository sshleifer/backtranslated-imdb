A very interesting entertainment, with the charm of old movies. Tarzan faces the greatest dangers without hesitation if the moment demands it and we all benefit from his success. The most unstable for me is a man without special powers who faces problems and beats them with human skills (he was a great swimmer and had a loud cry)
