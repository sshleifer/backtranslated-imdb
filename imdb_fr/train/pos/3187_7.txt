A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVDs each containing two movies. One of them had Three Broadway Girls (an alternative title for The Greeks had a note for them) and this one, Happy Go Lovely. It is essentially a behind-the-scenes musical comedy set in Scotland about a mistaken identity involving one of the dancers hitch-hiking in a millionaire's limousine. Vera-Ellen is this dancer and-wow, what legs! Ceasar Romero is his producer who tries his luck after the departure of the first main woman, because he thinks she is dating the millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is this rich guy who, looking for Vera-Ellen, is confused with a journalist who is supposed to interview him but is blocked by Romero. What I just mentioned can be confusing, but (above all) makes sense if you are ready to check your brain by watching this charming comedy to be shot with wonderful musical numbers performed by the exquisite Ms. Vera-Ellen. Romero may be a little frenetic here, but Niven becomes hilariously perplexed. The impression I saw was actually quite good considering her age and the fact that she is in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen is doing pretty well with her lines since she's not really an actress. So, on this note, I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely to movie buffs who love old-fashioned musicals.
