This is not a critique of the film, but rather a commentary on our blindness to our past. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or a sequel - except it was about Iraq rather than Vietnam. Similar to Winter Soldier because of its one-sided message, both films illustrate how we happily rush into conflict based on false pretenses and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to bear the brunt of this greedy war . Both films show that the forced mentality in the minds of the young and eager makes them effective killing machines, but training is sorely lacking to teach the skills of diplomat and policeman needed to effectively win the heart and mind people they are supposed to have. to fight for. This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam and will probably do so in Iraq as well. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided that it could easily be portrayed as leftist propaganda. Not by me, but by those who seek to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced point of view would be addressed to a wider audience.
