At least something positive came out of Damon Runyon's misguided attempt to romanticize the Mafia. "Guys and Dolls", the seemingly indestructible musical, was filmed in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful and enjoyable film featuring a cast of such stars as Vivian Blaine Broadway), Jean Simmons (whose character looks suspiciously like Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday") and two of the greatest men of all time, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both recently awarded Oscars for Best Supporting Actress. ("From Here To Eternity") and Best Actor ("On the Waterfront") and were in top form. A song by Brando singing "Luck Be a Lady Tonight" says a lot about the origin of Dylan's voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show under the nickname Nicely Nicely Johnson, who destroys the house with "Sit down, rock the boat". The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds yet another page to the gangster gallery of his malefactor. The film has a glossy and caricatural look, anticipating Pop Art from the early 1960s. The characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although the social attitudes and gender roles of the film are dated, it is very amusing, and even the laughter of The Salvation Army is harmless and reflects no real animosity towards organized religion. The mere fact of seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is reason enough to watch this film, but it offers many other attractions during its 149 minutes.
