I loved the idea of ​​this movie from the moment I saw a trailer. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as a kind, cheerful and slightly crazy genius was enough to make me see the film. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> The story is pure fantasy, but beautiful. A mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four physics godparents, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Add to that a jealous fiance (who embodies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower, and you'll really enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with great actors and deliciously sweet and crazy performances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein like a naughty imp; Cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan go one step beyond their usual com rom level. Stephen Fry is a joy as "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancé; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The film fell below most radars, but it's a charming treasure that does not fade with repeated viewing. It offers world-class writing and performance and is a treat for everyone in a less than sweet world.
