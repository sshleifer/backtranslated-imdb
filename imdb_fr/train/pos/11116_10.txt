"The Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas" None of these answers compare to the brilliant complex of "The Sopranos". Each character has layers on layers of absolute truth, completely and totally in three dimensions. We care about Tony Soprano wholeheartedly, despite the fact that in the simplest model of good versus evil, it is diabolical. Soprano is the most provocative, complex and fascinating protagonist ever created in history. If you're in the mood to be openly challenged as a spectator and forever change your feelings about entertainment, watch "The Sopranos". I challenge anyone to sit down and watch the very first episode of Season 1, without wanting to continue the series. Each season is completely brilliant in its own way. DVDs are essential to the person collection **** out of 4
