what a relief to not imagine this program! the taxman summary is great. I also remember having found it haunting and not particularly family-friendly, I had to have 10/11 by the time I looked at it. I think that for a girl, this age was mainly related to the very blond hair of the lead and its state of permanent sadness. I remember the theme played on a flute - although I do not remember how it happened. I think the intro showed him playing - or maybe he played the flute in the program and especially when he was sad? Perhaps I am destined to never know how it ended or to see an excerpt or to hear the melody, but at least I now know that it's not just me.
