A series of vignettes, most using television of the 1970s, but also with some digs to the government and the American companies. One of the longest segments, "The Dealers", is not that funny for me and I do not know what parody is. Some of the others, however, are splitting up completely. I particularly enjoy the cooking program segment. Most of the vulgar words I know are used in the film and, if you oppose frontal nudity, stay away.
