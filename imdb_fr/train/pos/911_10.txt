VIVAH is in my opinion the best film of 2006, from a director who has enjoyed success throughout his career. I'm not very excited about romantic movies these days, because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and therefore predictable. However, I watched this movie three times now ... and believe me, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional way, displaying simple characters in a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage. The film is entertaining in every way because it can be reflected on what we do (or would do) in marriage. In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya did his homework and portrayed a very realistic story in a very entertaining and entertaining film. <br /> <br /> Several sequences of this film interest you immediately: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao), he tries to look at her without making her too obvious in front of her family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, when he comes to see her - that is to say a shy Shahid not knowing what to talk about. about but drawing from a decent conversation. Also the naive nature of Amrita, the limited eye contact, the shy characteristics and the gentle answer to Shahid's questions. <br /> <br /> * The emotional depression of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) when she feeds him at the Shahid Feast in the form of the daughter-in-law of another rather than the niece beloved of his uncle. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the film belongs to Amrita Rao. The actress describes Poonam's role with such conviction that it's impossible to imagine someone else replacing her. She is beautiful throughout the film and perfectly represents a traditional girl innocent and shy. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor also plays very well. He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to playing in a film by Sooraj R. Barjatya. In fact, Shahid and Amrita are a nice couple on the screen, without a shadow of a doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very good). <br /> <br /> Overall, VIVAH keeps its promises: a well-made and realistic story of two families. The film features high-level performances, excellent story and quality music, but is also performed by the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. It's to do!
