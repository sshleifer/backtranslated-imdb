I am a 53 year old university teacher. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, witty, fast and totally charming. The plot was quite easy to follow for a 10-year-old, but winding enough to keep an interested adult. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest of the cast was perfect. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing came out. On the other hand, makeup, costumes, light, cinematography, editing and staging were excellent. Overall, I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that professional critics (almost all adult men) have savagely attacked the film. Apparently, they have something against films that portray strong, intelligent, independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist nature than anything about this wonderful family film. I highly recommend it to all children and all parents.
