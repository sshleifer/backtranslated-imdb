The first of Ghibli's official films, Laputa looks more like his predecessor Nausicaa, but while Nausicaa was an SF epic, it's more of a comedy-adventure-action with a pretty weak SF principle. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour of the movie, I thought I was going to like it. Once again, Miyazaki admires the attention to detail and his ability to create an imaginary world in a meticulous and beautiful perfection. The animation, even if it is not yet in the league of the last films of Ghibli, is a little better than in Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that a character is drawn in an anime more "lupine" style. Here, there is a whole lot: pirates. They provide the comic element of the movie, but I'm not sure why he needs a comic element. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa and I think it was better for that. Again. That said, Dola, the leader of the pirates, is without a doubt the most memorable character in the movie (though she's basically a woman, Long John Silver - do not be surprised if you sometimes remember "Treasure Planet") and well expressed by Cloris Leachman in the American dub. <br /> <br /> English interpreters have done well for the most part, actually. However, something started for me in the shape of a pear about this movie towards half of the mark. I think the best way to describe it is that the characters are engulfed by the vast expanse of history. I will come back to it later. <br /> <br /> There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people love it, that I feel almost naughty for giving only 8 out of 10, but me the key word here is "admire". It was more impressive than personally affecting and after two hours it was starting to drag on. <br /> <br /> The bottom line for me was this: I really noticed that I did not care much about the characters. . Disney would have taken care to develop the characters, to make you really crack for them, rather than leaving them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to move while admiring the incredible views of the film. Even that would have been bearable if there had been a very hard story in history to make up for that, but there was basically a lot of gobledegook on princesses and magic crystals. As far as I'm concerned, it's Laputa who falls and that's what prevents him from being a potential film of 10 out of 10. That said, it is clear that Miyazaki was one step ahead of Disney in 1986, while his film of the same year was a sacred "Great detective of the mouse". <br /> <br /> Laputa is a good movie, in some ways, an amazing movie, and you should definitely see it, but I think it's overrated. I definitely prefer the "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind". <br /> <br /> If you can see them in chronological order, watch Nausicaa's squirrel fox appear briefly in Laputa.
