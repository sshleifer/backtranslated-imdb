It's an almost action-free film that follows Jack, an insomniac who goes through hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, throws himself out of a building, and often does not know how to distinguish reality from hallucinations. <br /> Dominic Monaghan, as Jack, is really believable. Confused, frightened but lethargic, and sometimes accepting what he sees, we follow him to try to fix what he sees and find a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> Introduce a talking dog (another hallucination) and children who suddenly appear in the bathroom and Jack's room without any explanation as to how they got there (more hallucinations) and you have an interesting, bewildering, 43 minutes.
