I read a few previous comments stating that this film was losing speed towards the end of the film and that it had a similar ending to Cape Fear. I completely disagree. I will give a simple criticism for normal moviegoers. I thought the cast was perfect. I thought it was one of Ed Harris' best performances. What an evil psychopath !!! I have a lot of respect for his game after seeing his performance in this movie. I was riveted all along this movie. If you like crime novels, this is a movie you want to see. I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this film. This movie is full of stars and I highly recommend it!
