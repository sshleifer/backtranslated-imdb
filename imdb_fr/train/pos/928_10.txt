I had watched as many shows as I could on television, but unfortunately, I started a job that made me work at night. I at least managed to record a few ... and, of course, I bought the DVD of the complete series, which just came out. Looking at the DVD, you can see that the animation was a bit harsher at first, but they fixed many of the flaws after the end of the pilot project. The voices are good for the characters and the writing is excellent. It is rather refreshing to see the animation find its roots by reintroducing themes for adults. The fact is, with the way society has evolved over the past century, you have to be a little more blatant about it by today's standards to be recognized as an adult-oriented show. The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations similar to those we often encounter in real life. This is your typical sitcom in this regard, but the humor is more like what is expected of television late at night, like a talk show skit or Saturday Night Live ... at the time when SNL was really funny. Good job, Dreamworks. Perhaps you will need to work with one of the most liberal networks to ensure that this series continues ... and also to improve the marketing of the series' products to help you withstand its high costs. It's a challenge to do it for a cartoon of a mature nature. Hmm ...
