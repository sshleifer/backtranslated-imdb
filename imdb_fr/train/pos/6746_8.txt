This is an excellent example of a fairly simple film noir story that is treated exceptionally - thanks to Otto Preminger's excellent staging and great performances. Dana Andrews is a hard-headed detective who uses his fists too often instead of his brain. Shortly after the beginning of the film, Andrews is reprimanded for this and is warned that if this continues, he will be removed from the force. A little later, while investigating a crime, he was attacked by a suspect and Andrews was forced to fight to protect himself. This time he does NOT use excessive force, but the attacker is killed. Andrews panics and assumes he will not believe it. He tries to hide death - although an innocent man is eventually blamed for the crime. <br /> <br /> The film is much more than that - including a conspiracy involving a slimy villain (Gary Merrill) and a love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). In summary, this is one of the best examples of its kind - with excellent sandy dialogue, superb lighting and a simple but very effective story. That's what Black was supposed to be.
