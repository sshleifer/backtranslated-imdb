This film brought together a large group of adult actors and young actors who will stay in the movies for a long time if there is justice. The staging and editing were great. I can search for the book that has been adapted, it must have been great. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were fantastic to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but were fun when they were on the screen. The children of the camp could not have been better. (As I said, I liked it!)
