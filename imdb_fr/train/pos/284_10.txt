the only season just aired here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely great! I like that! all the stories are so good! and it's a much more realistic vision of the lives of teenagers and the family today. yet he has always maintained strong family values ​​of staying together and staying together. their problems were real, and it really attracted you to the show. the show is essentially about this family called "the days" and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mom), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (athletic girl), Cooper Day (foreign son) and Nathan Day (son of genius). every episode a day of their life, with the perspective of the coopers. I loved Cooper. His vision of the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things that could have gone on, I'm really sad that another season was not done. it was a great show that I will miss.
