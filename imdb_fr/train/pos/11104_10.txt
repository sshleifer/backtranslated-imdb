Since the saga of the godfather was the mafia's point of view since the executive suite, this series is a complex narrative of the mafia from the point of view of the worker. If you have never watched this show, you are expecting an extended treat. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never free and it is necessary to oppose Tony Soprano, the thinking man's gangster, to the reality of the life he was born in and , frankly, would never have left even knowing how so many of his associates ended up. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then hit a man with a frying pan to death and, while dismembering and disposing of his body with his nephew, take a break, sit and watch TV while eating peanuts Take out the pot of butter and give this nephew advice on his upcoming wedding, as if they had just finished a Sunday afternoon of American football. Even Carmella, his wife, was offered a chance to go out, but she really prefers life with Tony and the benefits that come with it, and look on the other side for his inaccuracy against life alone. If you followed the whole thing, you know how it ends. Otherwise, believe me, you've never seen a TV show finish like this.
