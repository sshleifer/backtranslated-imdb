I was ready for a Tyrid talkie soap opera, but I was happy to find a quick script, an underlying moral, an excellent representation of all the actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense and a beautiful cinematography - there is even a photo of the majestic stone Buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor to her most gloriously beautiful and friendly, before she abandons herself to the panting hysterics that stained her later work. All the support players complete the whole thing, and I wonder who trained all those elephants. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the stone-buddha sequence, you can really discern that it's Vivien Leigh on long shots. His form and manner of movement are distinct from those of Taylor. The only thing that marks this sequence are the poorly made process shots, where the bottom moves much too fast for the walking horses. <br /> <br /> If you want a stimulating film that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.
