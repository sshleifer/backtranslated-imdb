When I was 8 years old, I always watched movies and television that I did not have, and that was one of them. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it must be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, the acting is great, they do not do comedies like this nowadays (movies that are really funny and make you laugh without using feces or a kind of body fluid inducing vomiting, like in those Judd Apatow's delayed movies with no non-comic actors like Seth Rogen, barf). <br /> <br /> This film is a classic with actors who can really play and deserve all the honors.
