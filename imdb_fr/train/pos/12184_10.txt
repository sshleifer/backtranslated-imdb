In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of Evil), Orson Welles has entrusted him with the role of an exuberant man. In "The Lady of Shanghai", it's the only time I see him play the role of victim. The role of the culprit, he confided to Rita Hayworth, I guess it's because he was in love with her. So it's an interesting movie. But I find the story so excellent. The direction is great, as usual with Welles: two scenes are particularly brilliant: that of the aquarium and the last with the mirrors. This film is brilliant. (10/10)
