Everyone is aware of this '' Zero Day '' event. What I think this movie did is what Elephant did not do, it's that they made us see how these guys were. They showed their lives for about a year. Throughout the film, we learn to love them, to laugh with them even if we know exactly what they are going to do. And it gives me chills. Because I felt guilty about being encouraged by their comments, and I just thought that Cal was an adorable guy. Even if I knew what was coming, you know? Even at the end of the film, when they were about to kill themselves and decide if they had done it by 3 or 4, I thought it was funny, but I was horrified to see their head get lost. Of course I was. I must love them. Maybe they were mean, but I felt like they were really normal, they did not really realize it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> That's the IMO, the main strength of this film. It makes us realize that our friends, our parents or anyone else can plan something crazy and we will not even notice it. This film, as good as it is, made me feel bad. And that's why I can not go to sleep now. There is always that little feeling in my stomach. butterflies
