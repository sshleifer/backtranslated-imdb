Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's best work since The Truman Show and has been a pleasant surprise after some of his recent "Hey Hollywood - look like I can play!" Disappointments at the box office. It's great to see Jim recognize and exploit his strengths. It will not get an Academy Award, but the film itself will last longer than most of the Academy's "award-winning films". He is at the top of his form in this latest film - it's like the return of an old friend. <br /> <br /> Carrey, Freeman and Aniston do a great job together - comfortable in their comic roles, great comics, and obviously have fun together, but without the comedy type "hey mom - look as I am funny ". Steven Carrell was the enemy of Carrey (Carrell of the famous celebrity Daily Show), who had filmed some of the best and funniest scenes of the film. Over the past three years, I have laughed louder than everyone about Carell. <br /> <br /> I can predict that the religious crazies in the United States are revolting against the treatment of God, but the bottom line of the film is faithful to all the great theological beliefs - we are a mass protoplasm that tries to cross our short life by exercising our free will. Without married people with children, there is a good chance that this will become the target of people with misplaced priorities (who know the types - men adorned with gold watches Sunday morning and televised late at night, selling prayers to God) . And again, about 0.5% of the country will be interested and 80% of the media will report. <br /> <br /> The essential: it is a purely entertaining film, each spectator wondering by laughing what he would do, and a feeling of well-being at the end of the film. A walk in one of the main streets of America must confirm that God has an extraordinary sense of humor. What better comic genius to remind us than Jim Carry. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Jim - It's great to see you again !!
