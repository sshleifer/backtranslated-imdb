I present only one excuse for this film: there are many, far too close close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond stamina, that's fine. They drove me barmy for the first ten minutes or so. But after that, I made a kind of truce with terrible cinematography; and well before the end of the movie, I had stopped worrying about it. It's a comedy too rich to be destroyed so easily. It's hilarious, it's witty, the comic performance of ALL actors is irreproachable, and despite the fact that Usher is watching his characters with a cold fish-eye lens, he may not care. many, but he manages to present them with warmth. "Mystery Men" is actually not only funnier, not only smarter, but also deeper than anyone else seems to have credited. The jokes in Austin Powers movies, for example, while being less funny than the jokes here, are also much more tricky. The satire of "Mystery Men" bites when there is something interesting and gnaws gently when there is none. He does not make fun of anything. This is why, contrary to what some critics (I must consider them as unobservant) have said, there is no shortage of ideas. <br /> <br /> The "super" heroes form an attractive group. Of course, they are second-rate, but they are not just second-rate. The Blue Rajah, for example, only throws cutlery at people, and it's NOT SO good. On the other hand, he is not comically bad. He is better in his limited field than most people and he practices diligently. He's not a jester, which makes him a lot more funny than he was. If Superman is the Christ in a cape, the Mystery Men are all minor demi-gods of the hills of Mount Olympus, in capes. Much more funny; also much more endearing.
