This film is good for what it is and unpretentious; I would not look twice, though: I'm a finalist for Peter Cushing and that's why I watched him. The best thing about this movie is: BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared to other similar films, it does not drag the feet forever because each of the four segments (plus one) lasts less than 30 minutes, the last being less than 10. Good strange vibrations. In the first segment, a horror writer with a "block of writers" settles in an old, isolated house in search of inspiration. He even finds too much when he begins to visualize one of his fictitious fools. Plot of land similar to PREMATURE OFFICE. Well used the twist point of view: is the writer mentally ill ... or (as the end shows) does his trophy wife want her lover to play with the husband's phobias to drive him crazy and protect his assets? ... will bigbo survive to enjoy the fruit of his ingenious plan? <br /> <br /> In the second segment, two long lost friends find themselves in the same old isolated house but do not seem to be able to stop themselves from visiting a weird horror museum presenting the wax statue of love lost of their youth who had separated them. The guards of the Gothic museum learn that the depicted woman is a dead assassin armed ... or was she? <br /> <br /> The third segment was the least interesting for me. <br /> <br /> Fourth shows a horror movie actor - who thinks he's the best of all - stuck in the depths of low budget C movies. Seeking a costume to give more credibility to his fictional vampire, he gets the real deal. This segment does not have the same solidity as the first two. <br /> <br /> The action is right, the two initial segments representing the major part. Good movie, taken with a grain of salt. Not the best Cushing, nor Lee ... but worth watching.
