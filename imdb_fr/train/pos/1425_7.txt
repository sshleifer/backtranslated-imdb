Film directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield remind us that it is time to improve our way of life to save our beautiful planet, just as Al Gore shocked us with his painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary "An Inconvenient Truth". "Planet Earth" is also a call to wake up that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world. Al Gore showed us the dark future of planet Earth by presenting concrete facts supported by documented examples through long monologues always interesting. The creators of this documentary choose a different but equally powerful method to achieve it. They do not present us with a future representation of what might happen to our planet if we do not radically change things, but instead they show us the true beauty of planet Earth in all its incredible splendor. We see places where we knew it existed but we would never have thought so beautiful. In this film, we see a wide range of the most extraordinary places such as abandoned deserts, giant forests rich in fauna and flora and frozen landscapes as far as the eye can see. And in all these extremely different environments, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the kind of film that had to be done, in combination with Al Gore's, to make us understand that our planet is too precious to meddle with. Patrick Stewart's voiceover is always relaxing and so very successful, although at first it sounded like I was watching an X-men movie instead! Cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing in this documentary. Sometimes what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera actually had to film all those delicious pictures. <br /> <br /> In short: It's really a must for everyone. because it concerns everyone on this beautiful planet! The truth is this: I never thought our planet was so incredibly beautiful!
