I know it's not what you expect from a movie with this sort of lineage <br /> - it's a direct descendant of the best years of our <br /> <br /> lives and men. .. films about hospitalized men <br /> <br /> dealing with tragic circumstances. But this film is full of surprises and remarkable performances. It features stellar performances of <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt (including a nude scene) <br /> <br /> and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe. As Emanuel Levy wrote <br /> <br /> in his book Cinema of Outsiders (about the independent film movement <br /> <br />) "The Waterdance is coherent, attentive to the details and <br> /> <br /> not sentimental with a perverse mood on earth, it's both funny and sad, and the whole cast is awesome. "<br /> <br /> I was extraordinarily moved by this film. It's a hard blow, yes, but also <br /> <br /> very tender moments and bursts of laughter. A rare jewel.
