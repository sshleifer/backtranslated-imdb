This show was absolutely great and I can not wait to watch it. All the characters were funny and awesome in their own way, each episode provided a non-stop laugh, and it was completely fun and different from many other shows. Everyone was completely crazy and amazing, we could not help but love this show. There had been some episodes of dead weight, but That '70s Show has always managed to create a kind of friendly atmosphere, where it has it's one of the best shows ever aired, and I'll watch it every time that I can, because it never gets old, never becomes lifeless and never becomes uninteresting.
