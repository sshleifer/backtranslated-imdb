It was the second time I watched the film (via the French version rather than the first, which had been dubbed in Italian) and I feel that it was improving afterwards. <br /> <br /> A convincing film if it is built slowly beautiful studies of superbly realized characters and whose Parisian decor is equally impressive. In the long run, it's not Polanski's top quality and I would rank him ninth in his filmography, but it's still a confident mix of subtle thrills and, surprisingly, often broad comedy. It also has a nice cast, all in good shape, but mostly Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> In spite of everything, I am a little disconcerted by the sudden impulse of Trelkovsky. change of previous tenant; apart from the owner of the cafe in front of the building, where we give him what Simone had once without asking him if he wished, there is little evidence (as far as I know, anyway) that that's what everyone wanted from him! Okay, so he found Simone's stuff still in the apartment, but what drove him to wear his dresses and make up himself as such (although he apparently started doing it unconsciously) ? After his nightmarish vision in the bathroom, the last part of the film (where Adjani has almost disappeared) is almost anti-culminating - especially the scene where the owner and other tenants witness his suicide attempt as if he it was a night at the Opera, a concept already used 46 years earlier by Jean Cocteau in THE BLOOD OF A POET (1930)! <br /> <br /> The end is both predictable and unresolved: what motivated the two occupants of this particular apartment to jump out the window?!; I remember that factor that had bothered me at first reading too, and I'm sorry to say it's not clearer now! Note that the first two-thirds of the film are quite solid, but I would like Polanski to have been less dependent on obscure plot points.
