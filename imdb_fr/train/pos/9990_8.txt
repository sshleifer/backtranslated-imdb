I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. This film is in the same kind of niche as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List", but deals with the whole theme of aging with incredible authenticity. It's really very difficult to have the main character as improbable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar is hard to understand. Her world is hard and she is not at all a warm and endearing woman. <br /> <br /> The first scene shows it without compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taken to a retirement home by her son and daughter-in-law. She understands him on the road and panics. Its edges are really hard. She is naughty. She is demeaning and selfish. She is a stone. I did not like it, not even a little bit. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we have ideas. We discover why she does not like petunias, why she favors one son over another, how her losses shaped her character ... I started to see the angel ... and I started to appreciate it. I loved her especially when she unveiled her secrets to the boy in the cabin. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Glory. Glory. Glory. What a scene! <br /> <br /> It's not a "feel good" movie, but it's certainly a film that empathizes with the viewer. I understand more clearly that the limits of a person's life are there to protect, they are for a reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she is not even my mother law or neighbor ... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. These parts seem to me more logical now that I watched The Stone Angel.
