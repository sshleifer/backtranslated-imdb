I love this show and my 11 year old daughter and I love watching it together. He teaches good old values ​​in a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (though with a somewhat predictable story most of the time). It's also very fun to make fun of ... you know, rewind and insert your own dialogue, instead of those of the actors. <br /> <br /> I have my digital video recorder to record all the episodes and I happened to catch the end of an episode (just before the next start ... so I do not know which one episode it was) but there was an absolutely TERRIBLE sequence error! Adam had given the Sheriff Coffee a small sample of "leather", torn in the cloak of an outlaw as he tried to escape, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Well, Roy had the coat, so put it on his desk and put the shade where it was torn. The shade was EXACTLY rectangular ... that I think it would be almost impossible to rip a piece of leather (Naugahyde after the 1950s? Yes, leather? I do not think so). Well, the nuance was perfectly aligned and the mystery was solved. <br /> <br /> Not 10 seconds later in the scene, we see the coat, still lying on Roy's desk. But this time, the shade looks more like the shape of North Carolina and is now in a completely different place on the coat (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which was smack-dab at middle of the swatch) is now gone ... as is the seam in the coat. My daughter had a good laugh while we were playing the short scene again and again! It's important for youtube, I tell you! <br /> <br /> We are always totally in love with the show and sequencing errors make it a lot of fun!
