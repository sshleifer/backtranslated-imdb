FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood movies. His influence has been felt for more than a decade. However, some of the elements of how this big-screen entertainment was aimed at an audience of the mid-fifties who are now gone are quite old, and the sometimes slow pace of the film does not help. However, the fascinating central idea of ​​the story involving Krell's ancient and extinct civilization and the "monsters of Id" has not lost its appeal and continues to make this film a must-see movie. What interests me most to say here is that the current DVD of this film is terrible. The film has never been so beautiful on home video and its elements are in urgent need of restoration. I hope this will happen soon and that we will have a special edition of this classic SF.
