This film surprised me. Some things were "clich√©" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith. But for the most part very entertaining - good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the two thugs Wannabe Julio and Ramundo (providing comic relief). It's a movie you can watch again, for example ... a Wednesday night where nothing else happens. I gave him a 9 for entertainment value.
