Basically, I like the movie Verhoeven because, in his film, I appreciate a brilliant pscychosexuelle story that I saw before in "Basic Instinct". It's really a wonderful thriller that I really liked. movie. <br /> <br /> Well, it's his previous direction to that of his movie "Basic Instinct" and I was very curious to see this movie and, yes, the film filled my hopes and expectations. <br /> <br /> This film "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant and complex pscychosexual drama for some audiences. The story of this film is about a homosexual writer named "Reve" (Krabbe), an alcoholic who lives on his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that could warn him of a future accident.After the end of his lecture, he presents an attractive woman named "Christine", who has a mysterious past that she does not want to reveal. She makes love with her at home because she is a boy. The next morning, he looks at his sexy and macho photo of his boyfriend on his table. , the person he met at the station. He is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite her to her home. <br /> <br /> that's all. I do not want to reveal the whole story because it's a Verhoeven film and the end of the movie is really surprising! <br /> <br /> especially, I like the character "Reve" which is interpreted brilliantly by "Krabbe" .I like basically his role because, as a gay, I am purely identified with his character and yes I like his charming face. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mr Verhoeven for doing such a black comedy. I'm rating this movie 10 out of 10.
