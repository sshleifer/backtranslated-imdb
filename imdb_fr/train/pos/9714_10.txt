What do you get if you cross The Matrix with The Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've all seen The Matrix. The creators of The Matrix say it is "inspired by anime". Looking at the trailer of this classic, you can see where they drew the plot. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds in Japan in the 1980s, and it really shows. The costumes, the music and the words (in the recent English version of AD Vision) are as if they were directly removed from the time. I think that was done at that time too, but because of some points of the plot, it does not date from the movie! <br /> <br /> As you've probably guessed, by referring to The Matrix, the world is not real. It's not really the 1980s. In fact, it's more like the 2480s. After a nuclear war, the Earth's ecosystem (or "Biosphere Prime") was destroyed. The survivors force us to escape into space, where the conflict has continued. Once the planets (or "biospheres") were all abandoned, people started living in the megaZones - cities inside spaceships, where, thanks to the techniques of hypnotism and illusion from Truman Show-esque, they were led to believe themselves back on Earth. in the most peaceful period of recent memory ... The 1980s. When young Shogo gets a mysterious motorcycle at the cutting edge of technology, he discovers more than he is supposed to know ... The Garland (a bike that becomes a mech), a weapon of the 2400s, helps Shogo to flee the pursuers. military. As more and more discoveries on the megaZone come to light, the war is coming closer to home and, because of conflicts between the army and the computer, the war also applies to the megaZone ... apologize if these points are perceived as spoilers, but the plot is described in the same way in the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Emotions are strong in this film, much more than The Matrix. You really believe that the war is going on and that Shogo is really marked by what he discovers. What begins as a cool 80s film becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not the cardboard cutouts we saw running in circles in Matrix. There is really the sense of suffering that people can live after being caught in such a conspiracy and a war. It may choke you towards the end ... I know it hurt me. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite impressive for its time and the image quality on the ADVision DVD is amazing for its age. The style of the works of art is beautiful and is reminiscent of traditional cartoons, very cultural. Get ready for a lot of violence and blood, there is also an erotic sex scene. <br /> <br /> The end can be seen as a "there can be no end", similar to the matrix, or, supposedly, can be followed by the result that I have not yet had the pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is one of the best anime I've seen, in fact one of the best movies I've seen, and that many see as one the greatest anime of all time. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend the DVD ADVision, because its version of the English language is amazing and makes the film justice, and can be bought with a toolbox to contain the two suites when they are released, which will have the same voice distribution. <br /> <br /> In the end, MegaZone 23 is an incredible film, which deserves to be highly regarded, and should be an essential element in the collection of any anime fan. Heck, even my mother appreciated.
