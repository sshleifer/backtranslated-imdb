Congratulations to Fawcett for taking on roles that at the time were considered controversial. If I remember correctly, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980s, and the rights and emotions of women were rarely examined so thoroughly during this period. <br /> <br /> Fawcett is simply a woman followed, then hunted by actor James. Russo. He is adequate as an obsessed psychopath, but sometimes a little transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has a role a bit, as does Alfre Woodard as a roommate. Woodard worries about the legal consequences when Fawcett, the victim of rape, takes revenge on the culprit. The scene where she throws a pan of hot oil on Russo is classic and, as a rapist, he deserves it. It then keeps him in slavery and the consequences must be confronted. <br /> <br /> A very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of violated rape victims, physically and mentally. Highly recommended. 8/10.
