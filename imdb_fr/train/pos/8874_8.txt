Higher education is a slap for those of us who have been in the closet for too long, regardless of their ethnicity. it is a subject that most of us would like to ignore, but we can not afford to do so if we are to truly accept and understand diversity. Some have criticized the film as hateful or dumb, but the fact is that ignorance reigns supreme in the world and many continue to help it dominate our society. learning.sure, it sounds like a chimera, but you have to start somewhere and that helps.
