The first 50 minutes of this movie were rather boring. It was about Doyle's personal problems, including his sick wife, the death threats of his fans, an urgent editor, and the feeling of guilt felt by his mentally ill father. Although these subjects had a significant impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. We finally understood in Doyle's head how he created Holmes and why he had to "kill" Holmes. The actors are excellent. Among them were Tim McInnerny's intriguing Selden, Arthur Conan Doyle, Douglas Henshall's and Brian Cox's defining role as "model" for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations are good, especially for a TV movie and the work of the camera is nice. If the first 50 minutes were as good as the last 40 minutes, it would have been a small masterpiece.
