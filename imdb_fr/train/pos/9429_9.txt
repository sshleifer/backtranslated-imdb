This film is a classic in every sense of the word. It's very fun and also very disturbing. The game in this movie is well done. The story itself is credible, suspenseful and well thought out. The development of the character is also well done, the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this movie. The villains of this movie are very menacing. From the first moment the public sees them, they can say that they are ready to do something. This film shows how a human being, taken from civilization and placed in the middle of the woods, is confronted with a situation of life or death that can become almost as savage and wild as the animals that inhabit it. This film will not please everyone, there is a lot of disturbing content that can make some viewers uncomfortable. It is definitely worth watching. This film is a masterpiece.
