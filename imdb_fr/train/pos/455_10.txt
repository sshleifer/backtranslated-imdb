"Magic" is not a word too strong for the fate this film makes. You find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more benevolent way ... Any film that has a civilizing effect on viewers deserves serious attention. We are rarely soaked in such beauty. As if that were not enough, it's funny. The performances are, without exception, extraordinary, but it is worth mentioning in particular the miraculous Miranda Richardson and the superb Josie Walker - both open like roses. <br /> <br /> Why is this film not on DVD? He deserves to live forever.
