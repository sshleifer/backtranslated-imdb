<br /> <br /> I saw The Glacier Fox at the theater at the age of nine. I asked my parents to bring me back three times. I started looking for it on a video about five years ago, eventually finding a copy on an online auction site, but I would like it to be picked up by a new distributor and rebroadcast (I understand that the original video was short), or have the rights purchased by The Family Channel, Disney, etc. and shown regularly. This is a fascinating film that plunges you into the story of a fox family's struggle in northern Japan, told by an old, wise tree. The excellent soundtrack compliments the film well. It would be a good seller today, better than many of today's weak children's movie offerings.
