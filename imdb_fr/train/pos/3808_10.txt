I voted for a 10 out of 10 just because it's the best animated story I've seen in a while. The animation is beautiful. The artwork behind each landscape was beautiful. From colors to lighting at non-standard artistic price. I was amazed. Going beyond the beauty of the screen, you immerse yourself in a story that is both timeless and fresh. The development of the character is brief, but these decisive moments are exactly what is needed to tell the viewer what, why and how the character has managed to be where he is. I am impressed by the whole affair and think it is a must for the whole family.
