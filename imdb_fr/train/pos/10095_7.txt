My parents took me to this film when I was nine years old. I never forgot it. I had never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two when she did Elephant Walk) Remember, I'm nine, so the feelings are not sexual, I could not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and watch her. She started showing her age (she is almost seventy-four), but I still think she is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women ever to have lived. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie several times. since, and it's a sandblasted melodrama. What saves is, of course, the beauty of Miss Taylor, her grandiose landscapes, her impressive elephant scramble and her well-made remark about human arrogance in the face of nature. -pass a few hours watching the movie channel or rented video.
