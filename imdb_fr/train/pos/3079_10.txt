By listening to an audiobook, Cambpell Scott is the reader. I was so excited to hear her voice and it reminded me of my disappointment that "Six Degrees" was canceled. They never seem to keep good shows long enough to capture an audience that can connect to the story of the show. What a pity, and a pity for the network not to give this show a chance of all seasons. It was an excellent show to watch with excellent distribution. The network gave "Men in Trees" a second chance. It's also a great show, but they removed "Invasion" and it was also something completely different to watch, not the same old theme. Why can not networks do things right?
