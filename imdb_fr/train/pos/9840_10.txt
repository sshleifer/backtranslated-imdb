Born Again the Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a man could come back from the dead <br /> <br /> And live in the head of a little girl <br /> <br /> There would take revenge <For the murder he met <br /> By the guy who is now in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me, Born Again is a very underestimated classic This episode is part of what set The X-Files for me before I started to watch it. I had already seen some passages before the first appearance of the series and I was much too young to watch it, like excerpts from The Jersey Devil, but I remember very precisely watching this episode at the age of 11 and being absolutely frightened by the scene. where the guy is strangled by the bus then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you that I could not sleep for weeks! For this reason, the episode has a special aura about it now, from the creepiness factor that I have since become to appreciate. That's enough to let me look beyond some of the obvious flaws in the plot, such as why the girl had to wait until 9 years old for her previous spirit of life to actually start taking revenge. Or what she was doing just sitting randomly in a bus in the middle of the night. You would think that his parents would have been worried. And maybe they were we do not really see this part of the story. And was it with telekinesis? Aside from adding the really great Carrie factor to the already scary story, there was really no valid explanation for that. But even with its small imperfections, it's in my mind a classic episode and has little reason to dislike it. 10 of 10.
