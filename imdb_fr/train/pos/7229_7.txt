The cat and the mouse are involved in the usual chases when Jerry dives into an invisible ink bottle and discovers that it makes him disappear. Instead of taking the opportunity to spy on a mice room, he uses his invisibility to torment Tom. And it's quite funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat pleasant cartoon. And the action never leaves the inside of the house, which is usually the mark of a T & J shorts below average. Another value of 7/10. <br /> <br /> However, I do not know how an invisible mouse can create a shadow on the wall, it challenges the physics and the very nature of the invisible.
