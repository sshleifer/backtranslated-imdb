If you like kung-fu movies and you have not seen this movie, you're wrong. This film is one of the only kung-fu products to be recommended to fans of all types of movies. Normally, it takes a hardcore fan of the genre to see everything in these films, but this one has it all! The story is well told and complete. The fighting scenes are excellent and tend to end before you get bored completely (unlike Crouching Tiger). Start a little mystery and torture and you'll have a hell of a movie. See this one at any cost. My wife even took advantage of it. <br /> <br /> Wu Du it! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
