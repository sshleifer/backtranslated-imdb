A brilliant concept, an excellent distribution, and what a pity that there is no more time to flesh out the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, now there are real women! Still, Dench and his character alone had enough substance to carry the screenplay on some of his smaller moments. I have it on tape and I will continue to watch it, hoping that a clue in the end lets us think that there will be a sequel. <br /> <br /> Top drawer! - No question! - No arguments! <br /> <br />
