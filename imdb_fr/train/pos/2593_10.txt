It comes out of the left field and it's REALLY not what you expect. But I love this. The most memorable movie experiences have just been surprised, if you ask me. If you are not aware of the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so strange ... you are spoiled. <br /> <br /> The distribution is fantastic, but it does not stretch so much that it is palpable. The special effects come out of nowhere (seriously, it's like a romantic comedy strangely dark until they do it - so WOW) and they're awesome. The cinematography in general is pleasing to the eyes, the editing and the sound are of very good quality and the twisted history unfolds without clich√©s. Although none of these aspects individually make a blockbuster, the "what the hell?" ALONE factor makes it a movie treasure. <br /> <br /> People who criticize this film have no meaning. It's one of those often-neglected 90's films you've never heard of, or that you like so much that you jump on the mention of its title. <br /> <br /> I'm part of this last group.
