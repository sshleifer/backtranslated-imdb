This film impressed me so much that I watch it at least once a year. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I find it stimulating. And I always find the human and real characters. It's a film that shows you the harsh reality of life in Los Angeles, starting with the recurring search witnesses that detect the dangers present in helicopters, to detect the dangers so close to the ordinary lives led by the characters. It's also a movie that shows you how a stranger's kindness can change your life and make a difference. Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, intentionally or unintentionally, has a big impact. I found that this film was in many ways similar to Robert Altman's Short Cuts movie. Both had a list of perfectly selected actors and actresses and the two films allowed you to see gradually how the characters interacted with each other and affected each other, for better or for worse. Grand Canyon did a better job in providing a consistent message (hope against a desperate reality) than the Altman film, although I found them both intriguing in their own way. This film is to see absolutely !!!
