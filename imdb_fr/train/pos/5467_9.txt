In my opinion, this has to be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best performances. She was one of the few actors, at the time and at the present time, who could say more than one look at a whole page of dialogue. And I was lucky to see the original uncensored movie, with the extra 4 minutes of extra footage. Too bad the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman who can barely work together for her father in his illegal speech. Her only connection to something is her good friend, Chico, played wonderfully by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is African-American (and a white woman is the best friend of a black woman in the 30's was as controversial as the subject of this film), Lily is not, but they have a special link. And it's not sexual. Only 2 women are stuck or pushed into a situation beyond their control. After the death of Lily's father, who does not know what she's going to do, she's told she has the power to go out and get what she wants. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the point of this film. Then, "they" had to leave and ruin the last minutes. So until the last minute of the movie, it's a great movie to watch. The film's "lesson" is as valid today as it was then, and I'm sure it will be 100 years from now. Women, it's horrible what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, take note.
