Great voices, lots of adventure and intelligent dialogue make this movie a great movie. The addition of "character" to the three main animals gives the story much more depth and meaning, especially the relationship between the eldest, Shadow, and the young adventurer, Chance. Previous versions of this movie were unable to give animals a real personality or pattern, which is done perfectly here. Sally Field is adorable in anything, but really shines in this film as a proud feline, Sassy. Excellent contrast between the life perspectives of cats and dogs, and just the right spirit and warm fuzz to make the plot and resolution excellent. There is even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery. Perfect for a party alone or with children. Hat at Disney.
