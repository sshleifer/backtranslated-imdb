I would have given 10 complete votes to this series if not fantastic if Claudia Black had not continued! His inclusion as "Vela" lowered the series in my opinion. Bringing her regularly with Ben Browder to replace RDA was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we were shocked by the loss of 'Jack' and we did not really need this excellent The series turned into new episodes of 'Farscape'. <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of the movie "Stargate" and when the show was announced, I had reservations that it could be up to the movie, but after watching the first episode , I must admit that I became addicted. I have always looked forward to new episodes
