John Waters (happy birthday, John!) Made this parody of the world of celebrity and art. Edward Furlong plays the main character, a Baltimore working class teenager who loves to photograph. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers her work, she offers him his big break, which he accepts. But once he hits hard, he has to reconsider everything. <br /> <br /> Basically, "Pecker" looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity. The kind of thing we could expect, of course, but with Waters, there are always some things that shock us (you'll know them when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also featuring Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
