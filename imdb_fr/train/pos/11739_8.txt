"Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is a kind of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with touches of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her job as a television host for horror movies after the owner of the new channel has refreshed herself. She is now counting on a show in Las Vegas to complete it, but learns that she needs more money to start the show. Things seem desperate to raise this money until she is informed of the death of her aunt, who then takes Elvira to Massachusetts for the reading of the will. A house that needs repairs, a dog and a recipe book are all that's left of her aunt, and again, it looks like Elvira is struggling to find the money for the show from Las Vegas. Adults in the small, narrow city make matters worse for Elvira. Only the handsome kid in the area (Daniel Greene) and a group of teenagers will make friends with her. Elvira's uncle "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard) insists on reaching an agreement with Elvira for the recipe book, but Elvira soon learns that she has a powerful legacy, which includes casting spells and very pans. effective. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get his hands on it, knowing he is powerful. Elvira then faces burns at the stake of the city's former witchcraft charge and the clash between her and her uncle. The plot is quite simple, but humor and well-developed characters keep it at a good pace. "Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is full of cute, brutal, rascally and clever humor, carried by many visual gags, word games, plates, props, songs and parodies. The hidden keys of the film make it one of the best horror parodies ever made. It's a well made film with a great interpretation by all the performers; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (from "Grease.") There are also some pretty special effects. Many people (including myself) wondered if Elvira's character could make a feature film and the answer is delightfully YES!
