The book on which this film is based was excellent; It took me some time to understand Houellebecq's unconventional style, but once I understood the mood behind the writing, I found myself completely immersed in the world of the author's sadness. In fact, no other book has touched me so much. This is not necessarily a good thing - it has elucidated my own personal struggle and made it more difficult to accept the futility of my own struggle. Houellebecq's ideas are masterfully captured by Harel. The apathy and indifference of the hero towards a world that rejected him are perfectly illustrated. It is a film that reveals the society of today for the humble man in all its horror. Let's hope things will change in the future, but for now, we have to accept the rat race as shown in this movie. It is probably better that Harel or Houellebecq no longer create a work of genius like this one. One is enough for every man.
