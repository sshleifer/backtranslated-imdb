Sensational. I loved the whole series and I am shocked by the comments of people who thought that it had ended badly. Maybe he missed a few seasons 4 and 5, but was better than anything else on TV. But 6 and in particular 6b ​​were nice permutations on the themes developed during the first three more muscular seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B started with such a gloomy mood and Janice still has insightful insight into the family's anguish - that sad phrase about knowing Tony's inclination to sit and watch. Anyone who has missed the implications of this for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi's discomfort with the psychiatric study and his references to the sociopath's illusory sentimentality towards pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series, with Tony's panic attack on the ducks leaving his pond and resonating with the "wave of Phil" Goodbye "to his grandchildren before the final episode's knockout (so as not to get into Chase's dark mood). <br /> <br /> I could go on again for a long time, but I'll just add that I thought that Final Show - starting with Vanilla Fudge's first songs to provide the ironic flair ("You Keep Me Hangin 'On") at the most extreme moments, where Tony becomes complacent again with his family pulling apart, like AJ's SUV or Phil's head were, quite, quite PERFECT.The best TV of all time. <br /> <br /> Rather well in a dying environment pathologically feeding the "fantasies of jack-off ", AJ mocks (then in which he collapses quickly). A piece of pork pie to Mr. Chase.
