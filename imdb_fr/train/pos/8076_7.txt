The family speaks of two families looking for each other's blood. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is a gift from the underworld that operates from Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once by mistake, he kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (a brother, a wife and relatives). Aryan (Aryaman), Shekhar's brother wants revenge for the death of his brother. He kidnaps Viren Sahay's family for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The film has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs to him completely, where, instead of his dialogues, the expression is more important. Akshay's tiny role has also paired him with Amitabh. I did not understand what Bhumika Chawala was doing in this film. <br /> <br /> There were some points involved in the script; as; Amitabh has been shown to be the most wanted criminal in the city, but he is unscrupulous in the city. The abduction of his family also appeared vague. How can the family of such a big gift not have a security cover?
