I saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and I found it beautiful, especially since it was based on a real man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as a lonely Englishman who endorsed the Gray Owl half-breed character. The photography was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film inspired me to do more research on this character, Archie Belaney, known as Gray Owl. I want to read as much as I can about him. At the time, I did not know Richard Attenborough had directed it. But I'm not surprised. I like all his films, whether he acts or realizes. I gave him the best rating. However, I would have liked to know more in the movie about WHY he took this character because he only shows the two aunts who raised him with his room in their house. <br /> <br /> You can not go. wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and artificial special effects every few minutes.
