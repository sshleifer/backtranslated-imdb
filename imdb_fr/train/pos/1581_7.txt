Goebbels' motivation to go back has not been explored. Following Stalingrad, the Reich decided to embark on a "total war". This is mentioned in the film. Part of that was using women in the war effort, which Germany had not done to a large extent. A massacre of women by SS allegedly faced Goebbels with a major public relations disaster. His preference was to keep the problem as quiet as possible, since Jewish men could still be arrested later. I understand that the majority survived the war. <br /> <br /> His other problem was that the "Red" Berlin had never been so enthusiastic about the Nazi cause and had to be handled with caution. Once again, a massacre of women could have cost the Nazis the mediocre support they had in their capital. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to note that the majority of SS uniforms had marks indicating that the men wearing them were of German nationality, but were of German origin in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
