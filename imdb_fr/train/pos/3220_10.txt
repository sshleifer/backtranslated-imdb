Soldier may not have special effect in Lucas's academies or special effects, but he certainly does it for me. I will not tell you what it is, I am sure you have already read the summary. It's a futuristic and doomed action / science fiction movie. Kurt Russell does not say much, he usually looks strange or drone on the face but it corresponds to the character. There are big action and fight scenes; some scenes are unrealistic, but Hollywood makes a country believe it should have to escape a normal life. I did not see Soldier 2 but this one is one of my favorites. I'm lucky to have a woman who loves guy movies; we both like this film and recommend it to anyone who likes hard-science / sci-fi movies.
