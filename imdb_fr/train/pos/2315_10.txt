There is so much value in this film that it's hard to know where to start. Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal of Reese Witherspoon. That his performance stands out in the excellent casting is a eulogy. Robert Mulligan has rarely disappointed those of us who have admired his work. Every image of Man on the Moon is proof that the making of a film is at its best.
