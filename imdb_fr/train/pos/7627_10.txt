I remember watching this film some time ago and after seeing 3,000 kilometers in Graceland, everything went back to normal. Why this has not been released video or DVD yet? It is sacrilege that this cinematographic majesty has never been published, unlike other garbage. In fact, it's John Carpenter's film that has not been released yet. In fact, I have not seen it on television either since the day I watched it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for Elvis's role. It is certainly a role for which he was born. John Carpenter's horror break brought this jewel that I would love to watch again in front of the television. It is well played and well played with regard to singing. Brilliantly announce most of Elvis's greatest hits. I think it's also the film that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter, which allowed them to make several great movies (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big Boredom in Little China and Escape from LA). before someone makes a remake or his own version of his life, which, in my opinion, not only tarnishes the king, but also spoils the magic of it.If that does not happen, we will be at Heartbreak Hotel .
