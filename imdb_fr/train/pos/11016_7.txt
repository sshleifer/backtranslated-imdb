Good action show, but nothing new. This one took place high in the mountains, which showed beautiful landscapes and others. A man attacks a group of mercenaries, lead flies, and he hits the buttocks. It could have been called "Rambo goes to the Rockies", it was this pat. There was a very effective scene right from the beginning of the movie that made me tremble with fear. Not a bad image, but just the same old, the same old.
