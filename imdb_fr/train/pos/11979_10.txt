I try to watch her every day most of the time, and even if I look at her for 4 years, I have not seen all the episodes. <br /> <br /> The Show tells the story of Danny Tanner, a guy who knows her new to the sport. His wife is killed in a car accident by a drunk driver and he asks Jesse, an Elvis maniac with a motorcycle and obsessed with his hair. Joey, an adult child who does comedy and cartoons all the time to care for his three daughters, Donna Joe, calls him DJ, Stephinie who is the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br /> They all live under the same roof and have no one to help them. <br /> <br /> Later in the show, Jesse gets married to a girlfriend and later marries her and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (It's starting to happen in the new seasons) This show is great, if you like Zack and Cody's life in Suite, it's so Raven, the world meets a boy and Designing Woman, you'll love it. (It's getting better at the end of the season) Look, you'll love it!
