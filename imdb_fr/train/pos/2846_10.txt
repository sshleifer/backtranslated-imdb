I am neither a writer nor a critic ... I am only a student who saw this film a few minutes ago ... AND I want to thank the people who worked on the creation of this film! It's not the best most .... but it touched my heart ... why ??? I would like to understand it myself ... it's easy and accessible.it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret It's about love and compassion, the life we ​​have but we miss it sometimes because of material things ....... Look at all the time we have but we miss it. We need to live as if we are dying ... we care every second and remember: if we do good things, good things come back to us! Happiness is real ... .and it has a particular taste in New York ... I love this city and the world we live in !!! thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
