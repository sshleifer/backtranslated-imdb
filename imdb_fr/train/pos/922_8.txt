At least half an hour a week. I have not been interested in anything about the 3 major networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) for years. All lions are interesting, although Larry can sometimes be boring. I really like the action figures of Middle Earth they bring with Hunter. Most other characters are also interesting. Siegfried and Roy are sometimes entertaining. The animation is top, and certainly the best CG that has been done on a weekly TV show. Usually, when they hire big names to play in a series, they try to hide a bad script or characters. This is not quite true in this series though. There are some weak characters and improved by the voice, but overall, the characters are autonomous. <br /> <br /> It's definitely for 16 years and over. There is nothing here that most children have not heard before and most jokes probably were flying over their heads. It's certainly not as rude and upset as South Park, but it brings the same feeling of "Bash everyone". An example is that he makes fun of both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand at the same time in an episode. <br /> <br /> Father of pride and other Dreamworks productions like Shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of humor that has grown. It may not be as witty as Spielberg's classic television series, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> I hope that this season ends well and that it is renewed for the seasons to come. Otherwise, I'll never find a reason to look big again.
