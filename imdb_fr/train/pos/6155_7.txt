"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure film with certain charm, although it is not one of the best works of Disney. He usually has a good story, good songs, good characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good scenery and beautiful landscapes of England. <br /> <br /> It also combines very well the real action and the animation. The animation itself is, of course, pretty good. The animation is very similar to that of the animated film "Robin Hood" of 1973 and the same can be said of the animated characters: there are many wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippopotamuses, lions, crocodiles and others as in "Robin Hood". "In addition, the king (a lion) seems to be a mix of Prince John and King Richard, besides the bear really looks like little John. > <br /> This film is often compared to "Mary Poppins" with a reason, both combine real action and animation with a similar illustration, both have similar settings in London, both have their own magic and a magical woman The children (Carrie, Charlie and the cute little Paul) look a little like Banks's kids Both films were made by Robert Stevenson and David Tomlinson However, instead of a very serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a happier and more magical man, Professor Emelius Browne. This film, with its magic, also has slight but significant similarities to the Harry Potter stories. <br /> <br /> The majority of the songs are good. "The Age of Not Believing" and "The Beautiful Briny Sea" are the best. "Portobello Road" is good too. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is once again awesome in this movie. Angela Lansbury is great in the role of Miss Price and the three children's actors are equally good: Cindy O'Callaghan in Carrie, Ian Weighill in Charlie (a boy at "the age of not believing") and Roy Snart in the most younger brother Paul. I love black cat. It's really cool. It sounds a bit like Salem, the black cat in the television series "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch". I find cute every time one of the characters in the movie turns into a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute animals, soft and adorable. I just love them! It is even more funny to see Professor Emelius Browne turn into a white rabbit because when he is again transformed into a man, he tightens his nose like a rabbit. It's really hilarious, combined with his comic figure and mustache. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a decent film, but its end is pretty bad. The first few minutes of the movie are nothing special, but it improves a lot. The end, however, is weak. This is my main criticism on this subject, in large part because the issue of the animated knights is a little too much for me and also because of the feeling of war.
