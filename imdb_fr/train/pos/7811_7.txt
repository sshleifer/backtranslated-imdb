Steve Biko was a black activist who had tried to resist the white minority ruled by South Africa in the same way that Gandhi had attempted to resist the colonialism of the British empire in India. Richard Attenborough's film, Cry Freedom, is not about Biko or Apartheid but about Donald Woods, the editor-in-chief of the white Liberal newspaper who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film has a shocking view after Biko's death in jail as a result of tortuous behavior by the South African "police". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, must choose to do what is right and flee the country to publish books on Biko or allow his wife, interpreted by Penelope Wilton, to force him to forget the books. In this case, Biko dies in vain. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods escalates into a norm because of the number of people escaping over the borderline after Biko's death. Denzel Washington, an Oscar nominee, is only good in his fourth film as Biko, but something is wrong with a film that attempts to portray apartheid struggles with a greater focus on 'a white family for more than half of the movie. Attenborough would have served his purpose better by focusing on Biko's rise to power instead of starting where Biko befriended Woods. Perhaps a black actor who plays a lead role in a two-and-a-half-hour movie is not really good at the big box office, but the film is still a huge box office failure. Film policy aside, the film still entertains and sends a message or two, though PG-sounded style. *** of 4 stars.
