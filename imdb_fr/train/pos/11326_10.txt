I watched the first 17 episodes and this series is just amazing! I have not been so interested in an animated series since Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on a video game, but I'm not sure I've done it before. I have not played the game yet, but from what I have heard, he is following very well. <br /> I give this series a 10/10. He has a great story, interesting characters and some of the best animations I've seen. It also contains good Japanese music! <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this show yet, watch it. You can find episodes of under-bed on some cartoon websites, straight out of Japan.
