One of the first OVAs ("original video animation") I've ever bought, it must always be one of my favorite anime titles. A cyber-punk science-fiction comedy in an unlikely context (for a comedy, that is to say) of pollution in a near future in a dystopian society. <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of Dominion are the armored police, formed with the philosophy "if we can not beat the crime, we will have bigger guns" philosophy, and which, as its name l indicates, patrol the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, and which are actually much more dangerous than all the criminals are trying to catch. Most, if not all, of these cops are psychopaths and borderline neurotics (?), Which gives a new meaning to the phrase "loose cannons". <br /> <br /> Just as colorful and fun as their opponents, the terrorist Buaku and his man (wo) men, the Twin Cat Sisters, whose existence always seems to involve giving a hard time to the police shielded. <br /> <br /> The animation is not at the cutting edge of technology, but it is very pleasant otherwise; the colorful palette and caricatural look of the characters and the mecha harmonize perfectly with Dominion's comical atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The dubbing in English is, once again, very funny. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they've ever made a soundtrack to this movie ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, Dominion Tank Police is awesome. He is a Japanese cyberpunk with a lot of comedy, lots of characters and completely extravagant situations, which makes him never take himself seriously. Highly recommended.
