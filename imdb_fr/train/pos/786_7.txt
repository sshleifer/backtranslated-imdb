Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are again excellent in this movie. When you enter 40 and have been single for some time (or your entire life), you may feel that you are falling apart. The film recalls that love can be found anywhere if your antennas are very active. I liked the quick sexual encounter, which must be devoid of character for a normally reserved school teacher (MacDowell). His ex-student is pretty cute and still has a crush on his teacher for so long. <br /> <br /> However, I think some parts are rather unrealistic or impractical. For example, on a scene where the jealousy of other women takes precedence and a scene has been set up for Andie MacDowell to drop the young man, a mature policeman (MacDowell's other friend) would allow his friend to commit such a sinister act? Is it so easy for anyone not to stop in front of a car? Of course, the accidents happen all the time, but I was hoping to see the heroine marry happily with the first man she was involved with (this was the hardest part to believe!) For such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long?) ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps movie producers are aware that a lot of romance between an older woman and a younger man does not last long. In addition, they know that a happy ending will not please the public, especially women of over 40 jealousy who are waiting for miracles. The sad end with a hint of hope for the sad woman who has lost her true love is sweet, but if the man continues to live, will it last? For how long? Nobody knows. Nevertheless, it's a film to make you want to see it again later ... maybe a year later.
