It's not bad like movie, with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best, we could be with either Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint, etc. to have the chance to spend another hour in the company of old friends, from the most mundane to the most mundane, passing through assassination and assassination - it's always a pleasure for me in my book. <br /> <br /> Barrie is a tough woman who takes her revenge and revenge her dead and framed father, police detective, planning and executing with his coterie a series of assassinations in the underworld. Which would surely have the opposite effect! Sanders joins the party simply by dancing in the right club, in the right place, in the right city, at the right time, with the right lighting falling on him and on the first killer (at the right moment!) And killing him. <Br /> <br /> The story and the acting are acceptable, the only criticism I have to face is the end with the hasty and almost laughable discovery of who was the genius (Waldeman) - did they almost forgotten its relevance in the plot? That said, a solid entry into the series.
