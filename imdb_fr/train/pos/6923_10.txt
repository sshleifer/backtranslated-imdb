CONTAINS SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor has sat higher on the saddle in Westerns than James Stewart, and this film proves it. This superb story of vengeance centered around a Winchester rifle has only one weak point I can think of: Will Geer's cast as Wyatt Earp very devoid of Earp. The cast of the villains was good: Stephen McNally, also Hollywood Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntire (versatile to play both good and bad) as a skilled runner. The clash between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great! I would stack this western against all the harvest of westerns made today. They would have no chance!
