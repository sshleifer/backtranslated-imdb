What begins in this film as generational conflict ends with understanding, solemnity, and grace. The film winds through Europe with the father and young son cramped in a car over 3000 km. Cramps force lifestyles, beliefs and life skills to collide. There is really no clear winner. All of this adds to the end as an experience, experience of many layers of life. For those who are interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and sweet perspective, without being pressing on the agenda. It is a story of the young son's passage into adulthood, his disdainful and rebellious nature turning to openness to receive more lifestyles.
