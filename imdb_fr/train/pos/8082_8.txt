It's been a long time since I watched this LOTR. I am currently looking for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is quite faithful to the original work. The visuals are captivating and sometimes haunting. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Sometimes the movie is confused or confused. There is once or twice when the plot slows down. But overall, buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
