There's a story (maybe apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the beginning of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think of the Fifth Element fixture) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was titled "Things Bruce Willis Does When He Works". It ended with a simple message saying, "Please, do not do anything of the above in my film". <br /> <br /> There is a fact about this film (it's absolutely true). Gilliam did not participate in the writing. <br /> <br /> I argue that these two factors played a decisive role in the creation of the extraordinary success (if not commercial) that are the Twelve Monkeys. <br /> <br /> Visually, the Twelve Monkeys are all that we rightly expect from a Gilliam film. He is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but beautiful) strangeness. Gilliam loves to deceive his audience. Although the end of the Twelve Monkeys will not surprise anyone who attended the first real, Gilliam heavily borrows Kafka in the watch movement, a relentless bureaucratic movement of characters to their destiny. It is this journey and the developments of characters that they undergo that disturb. <br /> <br /> I like Gilliam's films (in Brazil in particular). But they all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas and enthusiasm that his films almost always get confused (Brazil in particular). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's feat, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the conspiracy department. Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way that is not usually seen in the ex-Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the truth of the rumor above, Gilliam also manages to get a first-rate performance (and very atypical) on the bald. Bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the actors, especially a bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> It's been more than ten years since this movie came out. When I looked at him again, I realized that he had not really aged. I had changed, of course. And that made me watch the movie with new eyes. It seems to me to be an appropriate tribute to a film that deals, at least in part, with reflections, modified perspectives, and the one-sided absurd journey we all make in time. A film of the first order. 8/10.
