Do not worry, Disney fans - this special edition DVD of the beloved Cinderella will not turn into a pumpkin at the midnight strike. One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the adaptation of the fairy tale Gore Brothers Grimm to the beauty of Disney has become a classic in itself, thanks to some memorable tunes (including "A dream is a dream that your heart makes "," Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo "and the title track) and incredibly cute comic reliefs. The famous slipper (click to view larger image) We all know the story - the wicked stepmother and step-sisters just will not have it, this haughty Cinde thinking she's going to the ball designed to find the handsome prince a proper but persevering love, pet mates, and a timely entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things are going well. There are some striking sequences of pure animation - for example, Cinderella is reflected in the bubbles that drift through the air - and the design is rich and evocative. It's a simple story, here, with comic stories, especially Cinderella's mating buddies (disguised as the dwarf acolytes of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a miserable cat named Lucifer. There is also much harrumphing and exposure gushing by the King and Grand Duke. It's a much simpler and more graceful work than today's frenetic animated films, which makes it both picturesque and very rewarding.
