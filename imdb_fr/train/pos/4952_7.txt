Reviewed at the second screening of September 12, 2006 at Paramount Theater 1 at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film was screened the day before in the world at the Elgin Theater VISA Screening Room. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman in the role of a popular actor at one point who is on the downward slope of his career and who's roles that may be under him, but that he always does it with a positive attitude knowing that he has to pay rent, etc. The downward slope is indicated by the fact that he has a long time between his roles with previous films in DVD bins and his driver by an unsafe production assistant who freeman Freeman on a local market where he will do research for a position of supermarket manager. He soon discovers that the real market is managed by an employee at the iron fund "10 articles or less", interpreted by Paz Vega. When Freeman never comes back and Vega needs help preparing for an interview, circumstances make them travel to the city to bring Freeman home and give him a job that will allow him to pursue a more upward career. . <br /> <br /> While the movie was nice, it seemed like it was still a skit or a work in progress. There were two long musical sequences (one with Vega and Freeman teaching each other some children's songs in the car, one that literally plays like a video clip of Paul Simon) that looked like padding to get the time back and the film was only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing that Morgan Freeman is as appreciated as him because, without him, it would have been too little. Of course, it was funny in places and Paz Vega is also a delight, but it was not enough to say it was a complete movie. <br /> <br /> They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car. to ask directions and Paz Vega said she never does that. Who ever heard of a guy who wanted to ask his way and a woman who said no !? In the real world, it's exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay in the credits. The side with a Target Store salesperson who teaches Morgan Freeman how to drive sales is hilarious! One of the first moments when Freeman's driver insisted that it was his voice when reading "Books on Tape" was also quite funny. <br /> <br /> Director / screenwriter Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were present for a brief question period after screening. Silberling answered a question by saying that the script was not specifically written for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took on this role, he was actually changing very little of what was there. It's a compliment to both Silberling's writing and Freeman's ability to simply slip into a role and make him feel like he was born.
