"The Groove Tube" was first broadcast on video, in the first "cinemas" in Boston. In one room there were television screens on tall stands, with old movie seats, in small groups facing the screens. There were old refrigerators filled with Pepsi and baskets of York peppermint pancakes. In a second, smaller room, there were no seats, only large pillows. It was the smoking room, that is, people did not care. This act only added to the hilarity of the video. <br /> <br /> I was an "assiduous spectator"; The scenes I've loved most and remember most to date are: Koko the clown, The Kramp family cooking (Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening), Security Sam / VD PSA, The Hitchhiker of Chevy Chase with the bare running in the woods, The Finger Ballet what was finally revealed to be the naked body of a woman. The last article was very reminiscent of the incredible Ernie Kovacs. Now, I have lost a lot of readers under 48 ("who is Ernie Kovacs ??"), but believe me, it's a funny thing. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons I was a "steadfast spectator" was that my friends and I would bring other virgins "Groove Tube" to see him. We sat down and sneakily watched the faces of the "virgins" while PSA "Safety Sam" was playing. As the camera zooms in on "Sam", we wait "Oh!" of recognition on the face of the "virgin". Each time was more hilarious than the last. And then this "virgin" would then bring a friend to see the show, repeating what we had done. To understand this joke, you have to watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of it is dated, but most plays, movies, TV shows and now videos are. Just watch any video made in the 80s. <br /> <br /> I saw "The Groove Tube" in a movie theater, a grainy transfer of the original video. It had been cut and some of the most striking scenes of the origin were missing. <br /> <br /> The first "Saturday Night Live" show, featuring Chevy Chase, sparked instant remarks on the "Groove Tube" theme, so it was a precursor for Chevy. <br /> <br /> I can not watch a tin can be shortened without hearing the voiceover, "smear your hands with a generous amount of Kramp Easy- shortening lubricants ..." and thinking about the recipe of "Kramp Holiday Loaf "It always makes me laugh in the Baking Needs aisle of the grocery store. <br /> <br /> The early 70's was a tough time," The Groove Tube "was fresh, new, and really had the humor of the moment, it offered a "trendy generation", a humor that was not available in any other format / medium.
