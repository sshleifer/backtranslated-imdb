Here's a decent horror movie from the mid-1970s on a hell door in New York that happens to be an old brownstone. It looks like there are a lot of hell gates around, but of course, this involuntary model decides she needs space from her fiancé and fiancé. She chooses one, disguised as a nice apartment of a reasonable price. She meets several strange neighbors and even attends a birthday party for a cat. When she meets the real estate agent because she hears strange noises at night from top to top, she discovers that she and an old priest are supposed to be the only tenants. Whoa! So who are all those nuts? Her boyfriend (a sticky lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) begins to search and discovers that things are not what they seem to be, not far away. This has some decent scary scenes and the idea of ​​the old crackers who are his "sometimes" neighbors being different from what they seem is quite intriguing. A little decent gore and even a parade of less normal people at the end make this watch decent, and although I've often seen it on TV, the uncut DVD version is much better. This is not a bad little horror movie, maybe a good companion to "Burnt Offerings". 8 out of 10
