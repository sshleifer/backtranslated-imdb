That's what I call an excellent movie. he lives through the talents of a fantastic actor and a simple but human story. there are real characters that can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, just like live. The bus driver and his son gather people in the country (Yugoslavia) to get to the capital Belgrade. The funny and cruel situations that happen along the way connect people and pigs traveling together. <br /> <br /> look at it and you'll remember it all your life ... it's filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> and another reason for its magic: hard to get !!
