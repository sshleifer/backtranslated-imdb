SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary on the attacks against the WTC.2 The French filmmakers who are in New York to film the actions of a NYFD are confronted with this event and make the most of it. Nothing really happens that gives the film an even more horrible scenario. The day of the attacks, it seems like a boring working day, but it will change soon. If one of the directors goes on the road with the firefighters, he films the first plane crashing, it is the only sequence of the first impact. He rides with the firefighters to the WTC and enters the building. When the second plane crashes, people understand that it is not an accident. In the next period, we see firefighters preparing a plan to save as many people as possible. Meanwhile, we hear sounds that sound, it's the sound of people who jumped from the tower and fell to the ground, this is the most grueling moment of the documentary. Then, the tower collapses and our French friend must run for his life, you hear him breathing like crazy as he leaves the building. Then a huge sandstorm hits him and the screen goes black, he was very lucky to survive and he can now film the deserted streets of downtown New York. Because this documentary has so many historical footage and the film had to be something totally different, this documentary will probably stay in everyone's memory. I saw the attacks live at home because I had the afternoon of, that makes it even more realistic to watch. 10/10
