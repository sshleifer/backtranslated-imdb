I just saw this movie on HBO, and it was really good ... a tragic love story! I really enjoyed the fact that the guy at the heart of the story lost the use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story involving a physically disabled person. The love that developed between this character and the woman who enters her life has described how I would like to think that love can heal someone's heart. Laura Leighton, who turned 27 when she made this film, was great as a woman so full of life that she is able to rekindle this guy's heart. Unfortunately, since his family is rich and his family is not rich, "problems" develop. <br /> <br /> The channel is playing more with HBO this month.
