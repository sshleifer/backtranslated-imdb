Oh my god, we do not like that when our superhero love is developing a brain. <br /> <br /> Something happened to people, they lost the ability to enjoy, a simple well-being, story / comedy love? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed out loud at least five times and I'm not ashamed to say that I had a tear in my eye many times. The cast, the acting and the script are great, I watch a lot of movies and I've never seen one in this genre that has been so successful. Those who disagree please tell me where I can find them! I'm sure the book is good too, but I think you have to judge it for yourself.
