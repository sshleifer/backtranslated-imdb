Very good film of Preminger; labyrinthine sometimes, as it explores places and places from different angles and perspectives as if it were a film about nature about the inhabitants of the modern city and about their lives. In this sense, he is visually and spatially satisfying, because his hero, a good bad-tempered cop, falls into a very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews plays the main role as if it was Hamlet and has never been so successful. The story may be a pure melodrama but Andrews gives it weight and elevates it almost to the level of tragedy. As a girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but banal. Gary Merrill is a very interesting villain. Its natural warmth contrasts nicely with the freshness of Andrews. his smile, his lovable appearance as a villain seems to continually challenge his sworn enemy by the simple fact that he is emotionally open, as opposed to the closely injured and moralistic policeman who pursues him. <br /> <br /> There is no major surprise in this film, which seems transitory for all concerned. For director Preminger, it's a sort of meeting with his stars Laura, Andrews and Tierney, who reached their career peak at the time the film was shot. The actors - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - are naturally more optimistic because they were all climbing. Preminger, always calm observer, lets events unfold without expressing a strong point of view, because the morally ambiguous end is somewhat disappointing, because the game of the cat and the mouse between the two antagonists seems more voluminous and more archetypal to contain , much less solve. <br /> <br />
