Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action thriller by Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Installed on a planet full of trash, Soldier plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell barely speaking title, an "obsolete" genetic soldier left for dead. The support cast of settlers, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and the surprising Michael Chiklis, is capable of doing so. They spend most of the film being scared of Russell, and the rest turns to save their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he has ever given. With almost no words to say, he transmits emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and looks. It's almost a performance of mime. When action sequences resume, it hurts and does so in a strong, silent and factual way. There are defects. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes an excellent impression of Frank Burns of M * A * S * H ​​as Infernal Commander, and Gary Busey breaks his belly (and almost his belt) as Todd's mentor. This is an underrated and excellent sci-fi film, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the Blade Runner universe - David Webb Peoples wrote both scenarios.
