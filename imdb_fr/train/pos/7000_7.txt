When I saw the title for the first time, I was already deducing the theme of the film - it was clearly not a reference to the British currency, so it was necessarily Shakespearean and about a pound of flesh - taking them or giving them. Will Smith is a good actor, so the serial killers are out. It can only be a man who gives them, so you have to talk about guilt. I ruined everything for myself by researching and knowing the story before looking, because the beauty of this buildup is the way part of the main character's background is drip fed to illuminate slowly the audience of who he is and why he is doing what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Guilt is a very difficult subject to do simply because it is deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you hope to ride a roller coaster - you know it will be unpleasant. I would not say that the film glorifies suicide; he plunges into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. <br /> <br /> It overflows with symbolism everywhere, which is a telling sign that writing is intelligently thought out with meticulousness and in the concern of multiple meanings and a nature of deep reflection. The most important theme that struck me was that he did not only give his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but physically gave him the best gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan is thwarted by falling in love - what a complication in the second act. Absolutely masterful. <br /> <br /> Yes, the pace is very slow, but I do not know if it would have been better in a shorter time. I did not feel the tension and terrible inner turmoil as much as I could, but maybe it was just me who spoiled it before me. That said, it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and challenging tragedy that deserves the rewards it will inevitably get.
