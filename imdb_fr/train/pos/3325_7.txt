OK, normally, I would not watch a film of the Farrelly brothers. I do not remember looking at one. I do not remember watching a film by Jimmy Fallon either. Well, I looked at the taxi, but I said penance and I was forgiven for this mistake. But, this movie had Drew Barrymore and I just think she's the cutest thing. I do not know what it is, but I smile all the time as I watch her. She captivates me that way. I mean, I even looked at Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates. How sad? It was not the best baseball movie - it was not supposed to be. It was a love story about a sad puppy clinging to the one thing that never left him until he found something worth giving up. The end was predictable, but there were so many things on the way that were worth it.
