I had to see this gem twice to really appreciate it. When a widower, father of two, interrupts the sleep of his two sons with a shocking revelation, they are torn between believing and not. As the terrible events of this tale unfold, we learn a lot about the father, his two sons, and their fate. From one shocking twist to another, this film never allows a lull in the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father, but the most outstanding performances are those of his eldest son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his younger son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. It's one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while and you'll want to watch it a few times to appreciate all the intricate aspects of the plot. I give this film a 9/10.
