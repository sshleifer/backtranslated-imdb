All children who are old enough to sit in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn pictures and the wonderful music of this sincere and humorous rewrite of the Grimms fairy tale. They will sing 'Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo' before they can formulate a complete sentence and will continue to sing it until the end of their days. It is a classic for all children, especially young adults of spirit.
