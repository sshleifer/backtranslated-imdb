Nothing is more pleasant for me than a story of suspense or suspense that lets you guess the end of the process. And that's exactly what's happening in DEATHTRAP, based on a chilling piece by Ira Levin ("Rosemary's Baby"). <br /> <br /> And in this film, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE manage to make the kind of cascade that Caine and Laurence Olivier started in SLEUTH - with about as much skill and as many puzzles as ever in this extraordinarily clever game. <br /> <br /> But it's supposed to scare you, surprise you and let you guess about the outcome, it's hard to write a comment on the plot. Let's just say that what we know at the beginning is all you need to know about the movie at the moment. MICHAEL CAINE is an extremely jealous playwright whose last play failed miserably. When a young aspiring writer, CHRISTOPHER REEVE, sends him the manuscript of his play, Caine realizes that to pass it off as his own would solve all his problems and he would regain his reputation. <br /> <br /> From then on, A story of fun and games for the audience as Ira Levin's story unfolds, surpassing Agatha Christie for the number of twists. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve perform brilliantly, each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches drawn from a scenario that combines drama and humor. <br /> <br /> Summary: Worth a look - but not everyone is happy with the end.
