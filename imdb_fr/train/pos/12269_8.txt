Best of all, the gorgeous blonde Marisol Santacruz and the lovely brunette Adriana Vega offer sweets for the eyes wearing a skinny swimsuit. The smooth and agile cinematography of Antonio de Anda, the breathtaking sceneries, Pedro Plascencia's robust, thrilling and exciting score, the well-developed characters and the pleasant 76-minute duration further enhance the overall sound quality of this bang. - the hybrid horror / action winner.
