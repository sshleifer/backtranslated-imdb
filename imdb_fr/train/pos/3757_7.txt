As with a group of guys at school, we have to agree. Even the Grim Ripper made us smile. These two extraterrestrial things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the most stupid and yet the most fun of all the movie. It's a lot better than the first one. And yet, for some reason, I feel that something is missing. Something huge. Something important. Makes a better house and girlfriends. No, I would say better villains. Use clones instead of robots. I gave him a 7 out of 10 because of these two robotic wells. <br /> <br /> The sinister Ripper, do not be scared, he's not a deadly guy, it's funny. When he fell from the sky, I split my belly. Splat, I'm not sure of these extraterrestrials. Where are they? Scientific? No way.
