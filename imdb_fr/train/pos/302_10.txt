This film is perfect for all the romantics of the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best line of the movie! "Sam" strikes near us, it's fun to watch and so much fun to play. Ben Gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with. I'm sure I met Arthur on my travels somewhere. All around, an excellent choice to pick up any evening. :-)
