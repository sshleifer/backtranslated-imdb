Another Downey to see! If you are an obsessed fan like me, you must see this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old graduate from Yale, who realizes that the life he has just entered is the one he left 26 years ago. Alex is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a savvy lawyer married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed at the age of one when he is hit by a car. He asks to go back, but this time in the body of Alex Finch. Between Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion and a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this film is 15 years old, it remains to wonder if there really is a reincarnation. . And if so, how often do you meet the same souls, life after life. I do not know the answer. But I know you have to see this movie. It's a riot and Downey looks so good in a tuxedo. This film makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. It is simply recycled.
