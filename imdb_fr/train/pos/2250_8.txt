It's a wonderful film about the Mormon fight and their last establishment in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are particularly powerful and the message must be reminded - God does not speak, but he communicates, if only we listened. As I write this in the midst of the horrors unfolding in and around New Orleans because of Katrina, I was particularly moved by the fact that the Mormons had to leave everything behind and leave after have murdered. People came to this country to escape religious persecution, but they could not. The struggle of the Mormons to cross the country, the cost in human lives, the suffering they suffered were truly impressive and showed their tremendous strength. As for the current Mormon beliefs, this is not too thorough, and polygamy is mentioned but is not at all a centerpiece of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is first rate, although others who commented on the real characters and can talk about the veracity of representations. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine and Jane Darwell, they all run perfectly with the scenario that was given to them. <br /> <br /> Even though the film could have been self-contained Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the cast to bring the crowds to the movie theaters to see a movie about Mormons. The power is beautifully beautiful as a young Mormon and Darnell, like Zina, is not Mormon but remains in the family after the death of her father. Power does not have much to do until the end of the film, when it will have a big scene, and that Darnell (still teenager at the time of the filming) has even less, although they form a charming couple. Their destiny remains uncertain with regard to its conversion and one wonders about polygamy in their case. However, you can not beat one or the other.
