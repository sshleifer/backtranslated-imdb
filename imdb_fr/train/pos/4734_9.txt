I am a big fan of Jet Li! He is Hong Kong's best action movie star alive ... and therefore - this movie has rocked! I saw it in the video store and, as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store, I did not record it at first and had to watch twice. I immediately knew what I would rent. My only disadvantage (I guess I was expecting it) is that it has been dubbed (AAARGh) and not subtitled. Otherwise, the original / strange / cool plot of the movie, and the full action have made it one of the best Jet Li movies ... even if they all fall into this category ....
