I'm really aging, I'm watching this 40-year-old film, and I wonder what my grandchildren are going to look at in 40 years, that's an old saying, but they're not doing it anymore. it .. it is not only the story, it is the music, the acting of the actors, young and old .. the actors, it seems, were born to play their roles ", young oliver" , old Fagin ... too many to mention them all, the role played by Judge Oliver stands in front, I've seen other roles over the years ... the artful dodger, Ron moody like Fagin, M. and Mrs. Bumble, the film not only won 5 Oscars, but took some Golden Globe awards too..if you decide to see this movie..Do yourself a favor, take a few if not all the kids, to see this chef -d'Å“uvre
