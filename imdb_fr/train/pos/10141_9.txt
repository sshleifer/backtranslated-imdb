I was all ready to pan through this episode, seeing that this "Master" did not really have horror movies to his credit .. but it's by far the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> good !! I do not know how he reacted, but we have a real talent in this episode! And even if you could see things coming a mile further, the plot was at least fun and managed to keep me engaged for 56 minutes, which was missing so far in the series. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the piece at the end, not a twist to speak of, but just a funny little piece where it becomes, as always, the hubby pecked. <br /> <br /> Really good effort. As I have said in other journals, they are not real masters who do a lot of these episodes .. but they may end up eventually becoming masters in the future.
