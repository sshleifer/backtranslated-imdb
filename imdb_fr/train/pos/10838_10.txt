I agree with what "Veinbreaker" wrote about the "Ahhhh" feeling that you feel at the end of this movie. I absolutely loved the places they chose to film. The songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic sound track on which Hans Matheson sings. It's trippy. Nighy was fabulous in his role, Nail "nailed" him, Beano was the typical drummer and Rea kept him. Bruce Robinson was great. Helena was a lovely girlfriend. But I felt that Juliette Aubrey's performance was magnificent. The scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Perfectly played and the music behind the stage was on the spot! Too bad few musicians have ever watched this movie! They should do it! I told all my musician friends. beautiful quote from Jimmy Nail's character: "it's supposed to be rock & roll, not the ghost of the opera f ***** g!"
