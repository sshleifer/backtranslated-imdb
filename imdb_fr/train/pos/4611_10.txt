Version: Release of Universal DVD / Hong Kong Legends R4. Subtitles Cantonese / English <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, five years ago, the world obsessed with "The Matrix". I was perhaps one of the few fifteen-year-olds who still believed that Terminator was better than Matrix. I was just a teenager, looking for a good action movie, then there was a bright light on a TV channel that I had never really watched, a small channel called SBS. One night, I noticed in the TV guide that a film starring Jackie Chan - "Police Story" would be released later. Fifteen years old and having only seen "Rumble in the Bronx" and "Rush Hour", I said ... "WOW AWESOME", I sat down to watch it and I continuously shouted "WOW AWESOME" during the movie. Two weeks later, after SBS showed the "Police Story" trilogy, I knew I had found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong policeman who bombs a big drug lord, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu's secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), is currently being held by the police to testify against Chu, and Chan is in charge of protecting her. Things go wrong - reaaaal bad - when Chu's file is rejected and he decides to want the death of Fong and Chan. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is one of the best action movies of all time and certainly one of my favorites, Jackie. Movies Chan. It starts strong and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed. Everything in between is great. However, some of the fun parts may seem a bit bland to more than a few people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, it's still one of Jackie's best efforts. For an action movie, the story is pretty good and Jackie is a much better actor in this area than in the new crime story. These are not "miracles", but it may be a good thing. <br /> <br /> "The history of the police" is one of Jackie's finest works. It made me addicted to Jackie Chan's films and should provide a good start for all potential Jackie fans. The bad news for those who see this first is that Jackie Chan's movies do not get better - 10/10
