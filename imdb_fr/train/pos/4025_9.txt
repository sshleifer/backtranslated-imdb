Superb. I first thought that, given the communist tendencies of Amrita Pritam and Dr. Dwivedi's nationalist film, it would be more frank than novel, but when I read the novel, I was surprised to find that it was the opposite. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Marita Pritam for not being pseudo-dry and to Dr. Dwivedi for being objective. This film addresses a sensitive subject in a sensitive way. The victims of all wars are women as a poet would say and this film personifies him. It is also a sad commentary on the Hindu psyche, because they can not stand against the kidnappers of their daughters or the Hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his executioner. On the other hand, it also shows the economic angles behind the score or, in fact, the reason why girls were kidnapped. I think the kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls, they would become the legal owners of the houses and therefore the new government. will not be able to ask them to return the houses. This man aside must salute the courage of the characters of Puro and his Bhabhi. They are two simple girls in the village who do not care about the outside world and who risk losing everything by trying to return after being dishonored. Because there are many documented cases where such women were not accepted by their family in India. <br /> <br /> It is therefore not surprising that you have to ask a woman to understand the pains of other women.
