So, I will not spoil you, I will be very brief. There are excellent actors and fun lines of attractive distribution. A recent graduate of Harvard Med School (Brian White) discovers he does not know as much as he thinks of people. He goes to a small hospital in Florida to do his internship because a friend (Mya) left for a job as a television producer. Its main resident (Wood Harris), helped wonderfully by his "creative collaborator" (Zoe Saldana), puts him in tune. They help protect his career and show him the broader possibilities of being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money (as it seems to be true for many of my friends pre-physicians).
