Los Angeles TV reporter Jennifer (the beautiful Barbara Bach of "The Spy Who Loved Me") and her two assistants Karen (the seductive Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the pretty Lois Young, who is killed first, but also discovers his delightful body in a free nudist bath scene) goes to Solvang, California, to cover an annual Danish festival. As all the local hotels are full, the three charming ladies are forced to seek room and board in a posh and threatening distant mansion belonging to the bizarre Ernest Keller (delightfully played to geeky perfection by the great Sydney Lassick) and his kind sister Virginia ( a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has a dark, wicked and deadly family secret that resides in his wet basement: a corpulent, pathetic, depressed and incestuous Mongolian named Junior (an alternately touching and terrifying depiction of Stephen Furst; in "Animal House" "), which naturally relaxes and kills deadly.Dammely directed by Danny Steinmann, with a uniform staging, an extremely perverse plot, an excellent makeup by Craig Reardon, a beautifully scary atmosphere, a a wonderfully wild climax, a slow but steady rhythm, friendly and well-drawn characters, and a surprisingly heart-rending final stop-shot (the sub-parcel of incest contains a punch of unexpected and poignant strength), this psychopathic sleeper unjustly neglected in the early 80s is worth the detour.
