Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a schoolgirl with a scowl and 2 x 4 on the shoulder. She is ready to confront anyone, especially her father who pays for his brother's boxing lessons. Diana decides that boxing would be a good way to focus her anger. <br /> <br /> I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. Watch how their emotions toward each other are shaped by the square circle.
