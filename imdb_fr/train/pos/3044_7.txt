For those who may not know what a movie looks like to an actor, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous and really does not make sense. It's full of clich√© situations, clean lines, melodramas, comedies ... name it! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can do something convincing, and this film is no exception. Everyone turns in a decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But it's the Megastar that obscures everyone with its imposing presence. Without him, this film would have been a non-beginner ... The story is about separation / wrong identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good vs. evil - all, really! Amitabh's is a brilliant performance on all levels, in an otherwise idiotic movie! And did I mention that it's ridiculously funny?
