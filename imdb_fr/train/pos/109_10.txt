It's the film for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a black and captivating atmosphere of post-war Germany. You are absorbed in the dream and you only go to the end credits. The plot necessarily comes in second place, but it's still an exciting story with difficult issues raised. Just wonderful.
