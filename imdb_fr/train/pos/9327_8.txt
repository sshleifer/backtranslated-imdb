I'm writing this after just seeing The Perfect Son at the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney Australia in 2002. <br /> <br /> When their father dies, two separate brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that the brothers are dying of AIDS, they begin a comforting reconciliation. The two protagonists do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that develops between them as the film progresses. However, I have a scruple about the movie - while the dying brother is sick, he does not look. A person with 0 T4 cells would look quite sick - there was not even a makeup job to make the actor sick. A little complaint, but that makes it a little less realistic. Despite this little criticism, The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie and if you have the chance to see it, do it. I hope a DVD soon available!
