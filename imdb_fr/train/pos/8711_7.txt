I do not understand that so much Norwegian garbage has been remastered for the DVD release, and jewels like this one still can not regain their past glory. I give it a 7, not because it's very good, but because it's one of the few SciFi films made for Norwegian TV. This film is nothing less than a historical gem that prefigures in many ways the first Alien film. And, my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Ridley Scott or a member of the team did he see the miniseries? Although unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar. Okay, the budget is much lower in the Norwegian film, but considering that, it's a really well done job since the sorry age of Norwegian cinema, which has also lasted until the 90s.
