I enjoyed this movie. But I was surprised to see people see a comedy. It was fun sometimes, but really, it was not very funny at all. If I expected it to be a comedy, the movie might disappoint me, but I had no expectations and found it entertaining and engaging. Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. I was less preoccupied with the satire of capital or work than with the basic story of a man who fought for his invention. A man who is less interested in the monetary gain of his invention than in seeing it materialized and put into production. He is absolutely heroic when he refuses to take money and the sexy woman in exchange for deleting his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; I compare it to The Fountainhead.
