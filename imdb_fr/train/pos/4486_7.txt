SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon, with a flawless idea, and almost every short film is a jewel. Although I must say that it is really a lower shorts compared to another classic shorts of Tom and Jerry, there is no way to hate this cartoon. Of course, it's understandable to say that this is one of the worst episodes of Tom and Jerry, and I can say I agree, but the fact is that all episodes of Tom and Jerry are great but some are better than others. Well, that would be part of the "others". <br /> <br /> Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom listens to an old scary radio show and becomes easily scared. Jerry observes how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is. He creates scary dilemmas for Tom, and Tom becomes frightened by his spirit and his life. Jerry then puts a sheet on a vacuum and control, giving the impression that the vacuum cleaner is a ghost. Tom discovers that Jerry has done all this and is pursuing him. Tom accidentally bites the housekeeper. However, in the end, Jerry eventually became scared after seeing his reflection in a cup of flour. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's far from the best of Tom and Jerry, but it's still a fun and entertaining piece of time. It makes me wish there were more cartoons like this one. The slapstick and gags that Tom and Jerry are famous for are as good as ever in this short film, but it seemed to me that something was missing. It was slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts. Anyway, it's a good short film that does not quite match the other cartoons of Tom and Jerry, but it's still nice. <br /> <br /> 7/10
