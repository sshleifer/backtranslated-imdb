A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between director Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking a mysterious "ghost woman" and Franchot Tone as a crazy and murderous sculptor. In addition, Elisha Cook Jr. has played fascinating smaller roles as a drunken trap drummer, as well as the other characters that are part of the plot. If you're used to seeing Raines in healthier places, she's allowed to go too far here, especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays a very different character, and even if he is not convincing, he acts phenomenally. Although the plot is too artificial, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
