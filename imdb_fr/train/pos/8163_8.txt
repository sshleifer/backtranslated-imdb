Corbin Bernsen gives a terribly intense and captivating performance as Dr. Alan Feinstone, a prosperous and prosperous Beverly Hills dentist, obsessed with perfection. When he discovers that his beautiful blonde trophy wife is cheating on him and the IRS is starting to harass him about tax problems, Feinstone crackles under pressure and takes violent action. Director Brian Yuzna, from a dark, witty and insane scenario of Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli and Charles Finch, exposes the neurosis and psychosis bubbling beneath the neat and neat surface of rich and rich America rich and delightfully mischievous . In addition, Yuzna spoils even more horribly events with a twisted sense of black humor. Bernsen shines positively as Dr. Feinstone; it expertly projects a truly confusing underlying spookiness, located just beneath the falsely calm and assured veneer of Feinstone. Supporting actors are also excellent: Linda Hoffman as Feine Brooke's unfaithful and unfaithful wife, Earl Boen as mediocre and mediocre agent of IRS Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as fiery assistant Jessica, Patty Toy as that insightful assistant Karen, Jan Hoag as a happy assistant Candy, Virginya Keehne as a stupid teenage girl Sarah, Ken Foree as a detailed detective and detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as an equally astute partner of detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as as a pool cleaner Matt, and Ruffalo in the role of the trademark Steve Landers. The f / x first-rate makeup is just as gore, rude, and overwhelming as it should be. The clever cinematography of Levie Isaaks offers many angled camera angles and some tasty close-ups. Alan Howarth's quivering and fiery score also hits the most chaotic part. A pleasantly deformed treat.
