For me, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. Overcoming racism, struggling in life and proving that it is not a simple "cookie", Carl Brashear is an incredible character to play, which gives Cuba its best image, the best performance of his life. De Niro , who is a living legend, gives SOMETHING to the film.He hated his character in the movie, but he gives so much good to this movie, superb performance.And the appearance of the beautiful Charlize is always a big plus for each film. So, if you have not seen this film, I highly recommend it to those who love bravery, greatness and who seek inspiration. You must watch this great drama. My vote 9/10.
