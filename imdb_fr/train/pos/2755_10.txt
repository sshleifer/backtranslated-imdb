When I saw this film for the first time, I thought it was the typical case of "love your neighbor" ... The more the film was filmed, the more I got involved. Playing is beautiful from both actors, the staging was excellent, the story unusual. Shouted my eyes, first time in my life for a movie. A real must have in any videoteque serious. 11 out of 10
