Cliffhanger is what appears to be Slyvester Stallone's latest action film before becoming an underrated actor. He is a mountaineer who has to help his friend after being hijacked by mercenaries who want them to find three suitcases containing more than $ 100 million. It offers an excellent action sequence, an advantage of your seat and a good time in the cinema.
