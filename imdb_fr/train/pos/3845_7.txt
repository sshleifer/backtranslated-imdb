Erotic thriller shifted, entertaining, slow pace, with many graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, it will be difficult even for them not to appreciate the many imaginative sequences contained in this film or to ignore Krabbe's first-rate performance. Verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, playing with the hero's visionary vision. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes, everything has become blurred and the unsatisfactory end is certainly not as good as the rest of the film. (***)
