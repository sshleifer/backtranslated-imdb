it was one of those $ 0.50 offers today - and much more complex than most people realize - and it was in color! not only are the effects extraordinary, that is, shit like "earth vs. flying saucers" - the real "killer" is "the universality of intrigue" - everything is based on two principles - the old concept of a hidden desire of an incestuous father to look for his daughter and the idea of ​​what would happen if the technology of a world reached the point where all the desires of the citizens became manifest. <br /> <br /> needless to say if all those we wished dead died, not many, if there were any - and this became the fate of the population of the "forbidden" planet - rather modern, in fact. unfortunately, the 'material' of 'The Krell' - wasted by ignorance, remains, and 'Morpheus', the incestuous father, knows how to access such technology --- and does so to avoid losing his daughter. ancient land, beautifully rendered. <br /> <br /> and considering his age, it remains a breathtaking suspense, an action, a classic of human emotion --- and visually very modern --- do not go that one upward - it presages all modern science fiction --- and its psychological content elevates it beyond any kind --- timeless work --- <br /> <br /> and the sound of sound! you will see / hear no pure 'synth' and a background of Moog perfectly syched --- a 'not miss' ---
