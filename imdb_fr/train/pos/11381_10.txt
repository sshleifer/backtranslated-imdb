The best part of An American In Paris is the long ballet sequence at the end, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living personification of several major painters. Kelly has already been established as a street artist in Paris. The sequence is thus the logical end of a music overflowing with life and energy, Gershwin's tunes, and members of the cast such as Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was at his best here - it's a bit different from Singin 'in the Rain, and the effect of all the film topped with ballet gives it a decisive wow factor. No wonder that the sequence ends "That's entertainment" after the passage of all MGM musical highlights!
