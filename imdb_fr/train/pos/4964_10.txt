I really like this show! I always liked the Space Ghost concerts of the 1990s! This show was hilarious and I can not believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would put such a funny show out of the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something like that. The show talks about Brak (comics Space Ghost, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives his everyday life with his mother and his father and his best friend who likes to go, Zorak! My favorite episodes were those where Zorak got that very good singing voice, but his voice brought him no money. Another episode I like is the one where Brak and Zorak have not finished their homework, then come back from Sunday to Friday. current homework did not exist! Another episode I like is the one where Brak's father and their neighbor, Thundercleese the Robot, keep coming into this tree, and are devoured by a giant worm. Another episode I liked was when Zorak made a bully statement and then a new guy took his place. I also like a lot of other episodes! One thing that never fails to make me laugh is when Zorak gets beaten, damaged and zapped!
