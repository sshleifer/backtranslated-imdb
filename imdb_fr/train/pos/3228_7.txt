David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... if it sounds weird, you're right, because that's the case. <br /> <br /> Peoples is known for his scripts that have moral implications on what is right or wrong, the value of life, etc ... He has dealt with these issues in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and in all his scenarios, there's something like that. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first blockbuster movie was a violent thriller. . Unsurprisingly, all his other films have been! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications! <br /> <br /> The writing of peoples is pretty obvious in the first half of the film. The soldiers trained from birth, learned to kill, and never lived a normal life. They are replaced by better genetically engineered soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left for dead. There, he has to face a group of refugees, some want him to stay, others hate him and there is an interesting drama here. BUT THEN ... <br /> <br /> ... The bullets begin to fly as the new soldiers move around the planet for military exercise and try to kill everyone. A loud, violent and noisy action ensues and the Peoples script transforms into an Anderson action party. It's hard to believe that the script was written that way, but the final product is better than I expected. Entertaining, a little, even if it's true, not very, exciting, and exciting once the action begins. 7/10 <br /> <br /> R-rated: a lot of violence
