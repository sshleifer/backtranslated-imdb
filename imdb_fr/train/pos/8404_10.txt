Drive-in movie with a simple mind but good on a high school graduate with a simple but good spirit who dreams of owning the world's coolest van to use as a "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends all his savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams. The sharing and love starts quickly with the girls Bobby picked up at the local pizzeria, but he discovers that a lot of responsibility, danger and grief come from owning a mechanical wonder. <br /> <br /> The Van is a guilty pleasure to me. It captures casual mood in the mid-70s and has enough unintentional humor to place it in the "so bad it's good" category.
