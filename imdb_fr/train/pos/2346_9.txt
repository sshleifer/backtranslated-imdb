Very nice pilot. The show breathes Tim Burton's best films ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Cinematography, storytelling, music, outdoor sets all scream Tim Burton. There must be a link or a strong influence, I just have not studied the world enough to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As I saw on the forums, yes, Anna Friel plays the role of a poor man Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen, I see Zooey. Do not get me wrong, Anna Friel is doing a great job. Her character is very sweet and adorable and you easily attach to her. It's more of a distraction than thinking, "Why did not they buy Zooey Deschanel?" <br /> <br /> Lee Pace is also doing a great job. I kept trying to remember where I knew him and just watched him. Wonderful !!! Superb ephemeral series of 2004. If you like Pushing Daisies, you must absolutely rent Wonderfalls, another creation by Brian Fuller. Hmmmm <br /> <br /> I loved seeing Swoosie Kurtz (The world according to Garp) and Ellen Greene (Little horror shop) again. Two underrated character actresses who never fail to bring it with their performances.
