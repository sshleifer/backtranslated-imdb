There was no day in 2002 when I was not chased by a scarecrow. I had the impression that this film treated a serious problem. <br /> <br /> It reminded me a lot of memories because it was so realistic <br /> <br /> Even today, I have nightmares about corn on the cob, and I can not even m approaching canned things in fear of my life <br /> <br /> I must admit that at one point in the film I had to turn it off because it was too close to my home > <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, watching this movie, you could be educated on what we felt for us victims <br /> <br /> This movie we learn not to take life for granted or spoil the corn, believe me, I went there and I have scars <br /> <br /> Look at the movie, its incredible and educational
