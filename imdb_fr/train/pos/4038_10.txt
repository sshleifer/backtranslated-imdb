It may be the only film that is about to capture on film the world virtually impossible to capture the experience of American colleges from the late '60s to the early' 70s. Go ahead, name it another film that even approaches this one: "Getting Straight"? "RPM"? These are caricatures. "Return of the Secaucus Seven" has its highlights, but it is a retrospective movie about (self-obsessed) individuals more than a film about a time and place portrayed * at that time. "Drive, He Said" describes - with subtlety and nuance where it should, and a quick kick in short films where it's the only appropriate way - the anti-draft movement, the ambiguity of big sports academics (especially when there is a war), the sexual revolution of the time, and the general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was like that. <br /> <br /> The entire cast deserves praise (as does the director, of course), but special praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern, as basketball coach, and Karen Black, the hero is very unusual-- except for this time-- the interest of love. William Tepper, as a director, also applauded the applause for both his perfect capture of the student-athlete of the day and for playing college basketball in the film (remember Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story "Yikes!). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a classic of the genre - and the latest movie that someone currently in grade 6 should write about ("boring", "repulsing" - uh, at right, my son, please come back to your movies Arnold). Why is this movie not available at imdb?
