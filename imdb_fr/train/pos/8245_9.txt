Even without saying a word, Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "Mom"? Even better. Zombie girlfriends? <br /> <br /> "... my dad tried to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's a bit like if the plane met (meat?) The night of the living dead, sponsored by Zomcom .. <br /> <br /> And do not forget my coffin with the head > <br /> And Fido in an Aloha shirt It's really cool! <br /> <br /> And yes, the social comment is too complicated to comment on. <br /> <br /> Just say that everything really works!
