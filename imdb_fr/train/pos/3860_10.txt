In Holland, a gay writer, Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), gives a lecture. He spends the night with a beautiful woman, Christine (Renee Soutendijk), and sleeps with her (imagining herself to be a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but he takes a look at the photo of Christine's hunky boyfriend, Herman (Thom Hoffman), and decides to stay to try his luck. Things then become strange. <br /> <br /> A large art house rated X is listed in the United States in 1983. Why was it rated X? Let's see ... there is strangulation, frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt ... and that's is all a comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did this after "Spetters". "Spetters" was attacked by critics for its extreme sex sequences and denounced as a junk. Thus, Verhoeven imbued this film with a very obvious symbolism, thinking that critics would think it is art and praise it. He was right! The critics loved the movie without realizing that Verhoeven was giving them a big joke. It's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> He is beautifully photographed by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there is so much symbolism and "hidden" layers in the dialogue that you never get bored. All the game is awesome - Krabbe plays a completely despicable character but (in a way) root you for him; Soutendijk is simply beautiful to watch and plays her part to perfection - the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is scary; Hoffman is incredibly handsome with a great body - he deserves the credit for doing the church sequence and talking with Krabbe in the crypt. <br /> <br /> It's not for the easily offended people you like extreme movies that challenge you (like me) it's for you! A 10 all the way.
