Two women, sick of their dominant husband, take a vacation in Italy for a month with two other very different women. They come back refreshed and full of energy in this wonderful little film by Merchant - Ivory. <br /> <br /> Beautiful landscapes and the location is not bad either. Seriously, a very good time 7 out of 10
