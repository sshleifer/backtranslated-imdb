First of all, I would like to say that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee is much better than before XD! It's probably one of the most original films I've seen so far; shows a background of poverty of a Cambodian. Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) will kill people to survive. did it all his life. The duty of Sam Lee (Wai) is to capture the Cambodian for good. There are tons of violent actions, but has a good story. The film shows the struggles between these two characters; they fight each other like angry dogs. GO AND WATCH PPL ... STRONGLY SUGGESTED !!! (GO HK MOVIES)
