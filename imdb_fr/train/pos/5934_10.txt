Sorry to say that I have no idea what Hollywood does. Of course, give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way, Hollywood, I think they might cover the Batman movie story, but please, do not entertain us with what we really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting more. I looked around to see when he was going out. It was like a terrible joke. The graphics were good and the story sounded solid and had all the attributes of a good movie. Unfortunately, that will not happen for now. Congratulations to the producers, the directors and all the actors, but I hate you for that. You let me want more.
