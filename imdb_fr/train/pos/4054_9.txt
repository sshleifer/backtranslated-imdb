The first time I saw this movie was in the 1980s as a little boy. My father actually recorded it on television. I had to watch more than 20 times, before the relatively recent DVD release. <br /> <br /> Of course, I bought and watched the DVD and was surprised how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I always have on VHS, the atmosphere of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. However, the new version, with Van Der Beek et al, is more comical. <br /> <br /> To put it differently, it's like watching the original American version of Akira with this dubbing, before watching the remastered version with literal translation of Japanese. <br /> <br /> I'm not complaining at all, the story and the quality of the animation are not spoiled, but it raises the question of whether Miyazaki wanted a clearer narrative or more dark and theme in his movie .....
