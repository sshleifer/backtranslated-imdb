A young cat tries to steal the soul of his brother to death, but he only gets half and then has to go on an adventure to get the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm not sure what's going on in this movie that's full of very strange and very surreal images that some parents might be confused about (for example, cats cutting a pig in pieces) it's a very strange film that some have compared to Hello Kitty on acid, I think it's more like Hello Kitty, like Dali did. (It's certainly more alive than Destino, which was directly based on his work) <br /> <br /> If you are ready for a very offbeat movie that will challenge your perception of things, then watch this film.Be ready for some very strange images that will be etched in your memory for always. <br /> <br />
