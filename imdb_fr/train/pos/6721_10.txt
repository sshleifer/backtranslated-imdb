If it were possible to distil the heart and soul of sport - no, the pure lifestyle - surf to its perfect form, this documentary did it. This documentary shows that life is not just about the waves, but about the people, the pioneers, and the vanguard of the modern age who push the envelope of the great wave beyond ever before. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - a virtual legend of my skateboarding years in the early 80s as a teenager from SoCal - has published incredible amounts of archive titles and interviews to create what is not just a documentary, but a masterpiece of its kind. When his heart and soul are in the subject - and this is clearly here - his genius is charged with a pure vision that does not glorify, hype, or sentimentalize his subject. It respects surfers and the surf / beach lifestyle, but does not bleach it either. Sport also has a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> We could say a lot about this documentary, surfers, the beginnings of this sport and the huge wave surfers he describes. . Greg Noll, the first personality of the big wave who has undoubtedly been a pioneer of the sport; Jeff Carter, a great guy who practically rode alone for 15 years on the extremely dangerous big surf of Maverick, in northern California; and the centerpiece of the documentary, Laird Hamliton, the current big-wave messiah. <br /> <br /> There is an immense heart and heat among all these guys - and some girls who show up on camera - and a deep and powerful love for the surf and the ocean that shines through every word . I found the story of how Hamilton's adoptive father met him and how Hamilton, when he was a little boy of 4 or 5, had practically forced him to be his father particularly comforting (and, once again, rid of his syrupy sentimentality). If you like to surf - or even if you do not like - it's a wonderful documentary that needs to be watched, if only because you're a student of the genre or someone who simply appreciates works incredibly well made of art.
