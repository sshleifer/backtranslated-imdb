ONCE ONCE, there were different types of movies. These different movies coexisted even though everyone had something different to offer .... <br /> <br /> That sounds obvious at first, but I thought I'd point it out during this review because it seems that few people have forgotten. This is just a fun movie for fans of Pavarotti. That's all it is. It does not pretend to be anything else or grandiose. People who make fun of him as a promise that does not keep his promises do not see the big picture - literally. After all, Hollywood produces movies that are shameless vehicles for people all the time (Bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife with Whitney Houston are two examples that come to my mind.) <br /> <br /> I would like to first talk about the film as a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world - and worse movies. The singing is fabulous and the selection of Arias is fun. The film begins with Ave Maria de Schubert, then Matinatta de Leoncavallo. Pav sings tunes from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sings popular music such as "I left my heart in San Francisco" and the song nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe, "If we were in love "with music by John Williams and lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman - the previous three Academy Award winners. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. It was built for Pavarotti, so of course it will not be something that is deep or universally applicable to the average viewer. This is the story of a famous opera singer traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago. When asked to sing again in the same place, the "MET" of New York, he loses his voice out of fear. Dr. Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian :)) played by Kathryn Harrold - gives her a helping hand to heal her psychosomatic reaction. He offers her the chance to have fun with him and she reluctantly agrees. <br /> <br /> They embark on a love affair, knowing that he is married and promises not to fall in love with him and that he thinks he is right. another woman. Despite all this, they fall in love (hence the song "IF we were in love") and with his help, he overcomes his fear and returns to the MET where he triumphs. I will not say how it ends, but it's pretty predictable. Which is not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The performances in this area are not so bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you're expecting a performance from Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks, you're wrong, not Pavarotti. He knows he is not a thespian. What he is is cute, charming and charismatic. He's having fun, and if you can let yourself have fun too, it's not that bad. A fun line is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she is a "thirsty plant, Finished can water you!" and of course, she says, "I do not want to be watered by Fini!" Kathryn Harrold is very kind and does a good job as a semi-outspoken woman who is learning from this extravagant man to live a little. One of my favorite phrases in the movie is: "Life never needs to be to its size." And there is Eddie Albert doing his usual good job as a Finished Manager. There are several cameos "themselves" real conductors, singers, etc. The film is shot on site at the Lincoln Center Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti, or if you can just let yourself go and enjoy a "little adventure" as he proposes in the movie, then you can enjoy this film for what it is is. I know I do it every time. :) <br /> <br />
