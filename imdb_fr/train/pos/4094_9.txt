For all those who have only seen Disney Productions, the superbly animated version of 'Beauty & The Beast', or even the surrealist vision of Jean Cocteau's fairy tales, will be completely disconcerted by this French version of 1975 (but with a director Polish). The plot concerns a French family of declining aristocracy who marries in a well-made English family. The major problem is that the husband carries an old curse on the family. The film also includes many flashback sequences (potentially) explaining this family curse. From the opening credits, to the end, it is an erotic carousel almost without stop, with sexual content VERY explicit and graphic (hence the X score of the film in the United States in his first film, which does not has not been evaluated yet). The film's somewhat scornful attitude towards the ruling class is likely to remind one of Bunuel's flights to similar territory. If you have a taste for the really weird and you are not offended by "taboo" material, then this film may scratch you.
