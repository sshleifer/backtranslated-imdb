"Margaritas and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This extremely entertaining film captures you right from the opening scene and never stops giving you laughter, surprises and unexpected touching moments. I had more fun watching "The Matador" than almost every other movie in 2005. It's a crazy movie with an unforgettable character, interpreted to perfection by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a facilitator (hit-man) who specializes in high-end corporate concerts (assassination of rich guys). He is also experiencing a midlife crisis. After realizing he had no real friends, no permanent home and no future, he falls into a Mexican hotel bar one night and runs into Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Danny is a down-and-out family man who is about to lose the big business deal that may be a game changer for him. He loves his wife a lot, especially since they lost their young son a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Both men are a chalk and a cheese. They have little in common except that they are in the same state of desolation except one. night. And one way or another, a conversation is initiated that sets off a series of events that will change their lives forever. <br /> <br /> The friendship they make reminds me a lot Laurel and Hardy. One is the heterosexual man and the other is the persistent idiot who creates problems for them. The game is superbly timed and finely tuned, thanks in large part to the outstanding performances of Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake ... This is Brosnan's movie. He prints one of the most memorable and friendly characters of the decade. He could shoot your mother and apologize immediately after, and you will probably forgive him. Brosnan is perhaps the ultimate movie charmer, but it's his most endearing and complete performance to date. I would not be opposed to seeing an Oscar acquiesce to this role. <br /> <br /> Take a scene in which he openly greets a high school girl with the impurity of her thoughts and utters the line, "All blushy blush ... no idiot fuck". He does it with Bond's familiar smile and manages to get by. He managed to tell a young boy, "Tell your mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years, then come back to me" without seeming so improbable. In fact, it makes us even more like him. <br /> <br /> And yet, the film manages to surprise us with really touching scenes, most of which end in the end when the film takes unpredictable turns. However, when Julian flips through his little black book to find someone to call for his birthday or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console themselves in their room one night, the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion. <br /> <br /> "The Matador" is elegant and energetic. It's constantly entertaining. And it has a pivotal role for Brosnan's career as a lone striker looking for normality, friendship and the way to do at least one good thing in his life. It's a forgotten gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler from IndependentCritics.com
