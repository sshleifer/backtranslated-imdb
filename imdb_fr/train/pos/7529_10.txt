Two years have passed and most people look different, some for the better and some for the worse. I still appreciated as much as the original. <br /> <br /> Some defects they had however, like that of changing Joker, no longer allow him to red lips and more like black hair and black pupils, still expressed by Mark Hamill who is a plus I guess. They made Poison Ivy whiter by suggesting that it was becoming a plant and Catwomen was very different and less "attractive" than it was in the original. <br /> <br /> Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and Scarecrow look tough, especially Scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The series is not as dark as the original, because Batman does not work as lonely as before. Most of the time, he works with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) often comes to the rescue. Batman dropped the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit. Looks like he's getting a little bigger but still gives tons of ass. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as the original, mainly because of Some characters have been reorganized, but the stories are still so exciting and the dialogue still elitist. "Over the Edge" may well be one of the best episodes of Batman to date. So be sure to check. <br /> <br /> General 8-9 / 10
