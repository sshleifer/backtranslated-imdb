The plot is really horrible, the atmosphere really depressive, unusual for a low-budget production like this, and at least for a German production. A bit of Indian spirituality, mystic thriller and mixed slasher film. The development of the plot and characters is excellent, the scenery very close to reality, without any studio atmosphere. This could be perfect, but unfortunately some things have been a little disappointing, which is not necessarily typical of low budget movies: <br /> <br /> 1.) The distribution is sometimes not superior to the average . Almost all actors are like laypeople. Some of them do good or very good work, but some act as actors of German crazy shows! But I was very, very disappointed by the role of Mathieu Carri√®re! His acting (in many of his older films, his game was perfect) was below average! But perhaps this is why he is now involved in German soap operas or television series on private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) The dialogues sometimes take place at the level of serials. <br /> <br /> 3.) The bad sound sometimes made it very difficult to understand what the characters are saying. I saw it on DVD and was happy to be able to rewind and listen to it again. This is due to the decor (large halls like the hospital or the esoteric group) and sometimes to the strange dialects of the actors! <br /> <br /> But overall, it's an interesting movie, interesting to watch, far beyond commercial movies, which are often more terrible.
