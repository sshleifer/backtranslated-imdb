This film is an exception to the rule that a sequel is more serious than the original. His comedy at its best. This film is a quick action comedy where it seems like something happens every second. On more than one occasion, the entire audience laughed at a joke. <br /> <br /> It's a great benefit to have seen the first movie, but it's not a necessity. <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta kanal 2 have the advantage of being a parody of the latest reality television series such as survivor (Expedon: Robinson in Swedish). This is a Swedish film intended for the Swedish public. So, do not see it if you are not familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise, have fun! Johan
