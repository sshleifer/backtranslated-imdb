In Lizzie Borden's "Love Crimes" (1992), Sean Young plays a D.A. in Atlanta. It is a loner who gets involved too much in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who presents himself as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes them in a compromising way, then leaves them. <br /> Naturally, This lonely hard guy decides to enter the life of this ridiculous phony by posing as his prey, with the intention of bringing him to justice. They meet, they make love, then the next thing she knows is that she is on her lap and she is spanked. (Note: The spanking scene only appears in the "unrated" version of this movie, the version noted by R forgets it, as well as in several other scenes that would make the plot clearer.) This psychological thriller includes several scenes of feminine nudity and disturbing images. like Bergin chasing one of his victims into the room, harassing her with a whip. <br /> <br /> Like thriller, "Love Crimes" is at its best when Sean Young plays his cat and mouse game with Bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. It is unfortunate that the film does not end, it simply stops. It is true. The director Lizzie Borden may be short of stories to tell, but after 92 minutes, the credits return, and we end up with an enigmatic "What just happened?" bewilderment. <br /> <br /> The course of Young's plan is set in an engaging style, but the absence of consistent ending will be a shock factor for some spectators. <br /> <br /> Dan (daneldorado @ yahoo.com)
