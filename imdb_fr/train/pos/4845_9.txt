Hello Playmates. I recently watched this movie for the first time and it's also my first experience of Arthur Askey. I must admit that I was very impressed by this film. Fan of black and white movies in general, pimlico passport, the lavender crowd and Tommy Trinder (apparently a distant relative), this film seduced by the fact that it provided a good old-fashioned British humor. I notice that some people here have criticized Askey's performance, but in my opinion, it stands the test of time as a beautiful example of a comedic actor from the forties and if something adds to the board by creating characters that are more than mere stereotypes seem so dominant in the movies now. If you can get this film, I recommend you buy it, a pity that these films are generally no longer broadcast on Sunday afternoon. I am also happy to have had the opportunity to watch another movie by Arnold Ridley (Godfrey soldier in dad's army). Thank you
