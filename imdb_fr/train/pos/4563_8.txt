It's hard to imagine that this film is based on a true story, and the way Christy managed to accomplish this miracle is so moving. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine all the efforts he has made to create this disabled character. Watching it on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> The film is not as pessimistic as I thought, the story is rather brilliant and intriguing. Christy is not despised by the normals, her life is so colorful and charming, although we can be aware of the loneliness and painful hindrance through her eyes. <br /> <br /> An important factor in Christy's success is her mother's support, which seems more touching, and unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar for this role. This fat little middle-aged woman uses it to make her dream come true. So much luck for Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as a young Christy, what a performance for a child! Christy's love story is very well done and confident. Christy wants love and nothing is deduced from the right to love, her crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed by her role in the Harry Potter series, the disgusting Aunt Petunia , so her appearance in this role, it really exceeds my spirit, but anyway any woman has her own youth ...) is paranoid and offensive, I have sympathy for him, love is a sword to two cutting edges, happiness and agony are just next to each other. <br /> <br /> By the way, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (in America, THE BOXER, etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying ', god knows why he chose to lead this shit! Really a career spot for him, what a pity!
