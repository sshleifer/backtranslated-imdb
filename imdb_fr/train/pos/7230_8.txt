"The Invisible Mouse" is a delicious and different cartoon from Tom & Jerry. It features the usual chases and battles between cat and mouse, but in a different way this time. Jerry accidentally falls into an invisible ink bottle and is obviously very happy because he realizes that he can prepare many "surprises" for Tom, frighten him, torment him and disturb him. <br /> As much as it's weird, it's also very cool and fun to see what we do not see: Invisible Jerry. It's fun to see things go up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?) - it's as if these things had a life apart or almost like a ghost affair. It's just as amusing to see Jerry eating candy and fruit while he's invisible. I really like this instrumental music that plays when it is not visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes in this short film are those where Tom sees Jerry's shadow and hits him, and even when he tries to hit him with a frying pan and Jerry writes "m ' missed". I also like the moment when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becomes visible again and with a happy air. <br /> <br /> Overall, this short film contains the basic ingredients necessary for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, entertainment and fun. some beautiful illustrations too.
