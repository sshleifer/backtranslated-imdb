Everything is not said in this excellent first feature film by CÃ©line Sciamma. Friendship, the "desire to integrate", the first sexual feelings ... All this and much more is sublimated in the scenes of synchronized swimming underwater. <br /> <br /> The three girls in the film try to find and express their personality in a very different way. It's a much less violent approach to understanding adolescence compared to, say, "Thirteen," but a trip that is worth it anyway. <br /> <br /> A must-see and let all the American cinematic preconceptions go to it. The soundtrack is A + in passing. <br /> <br /> Good cinema!
