Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I had not watched this movie for about five years the last time I saw it. The magic remains. There is something that really contains this storybook feel, the songs entertain and the secondary character is all please. The wicked in the form of half-sisters are perfectly bad and vile. Then there is the most magical of all Disney, the mice make the dress and well you know the rest. To summarize, the four Disney Princess movies are all great, but it's a charming magical experience to watch and enjoy. Oh, and of course, Cinderella is beautiful as the main character of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Disney movies can really lose their charm. With Elene Wood and others, the film has such a sensation that you can not help but smile. <br /> <br /> They say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course, in the real world, some are believers, others are hopeful. In this film, it's even more magical when his rainbow comes to smile. <br /> <br /> And of course, the rest is ... Cinderella
