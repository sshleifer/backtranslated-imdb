it is reminiscent of Stephen King's writings and terrified childhood memories, drawn from stories like this, as the exact opposite. There is no terror in this childhood of which none of the friends - who are still friends 20 years later - remember or seem to suffer. At the top of the line, everything is described as a friendly scramble, perhaps periodically described as an "attack" on one or more of them, but everything is forgiven. There is no * anxiety * embedded in the film and the participants later in life describe the relationships - all we see is young people who have grown up to be basically the same people. More mature, but still the same people and the same structures of power. <br /> <br /> Totally incredible! Not just because people can grow relatively unscathed by social conventions - but also so that friendships can last. In this respect, this film is a tiny pearl - as we presume, it is the intention of this film: to paint a picture of the untrained emotions that unite people. Which, compared to recent movies depicting the dark sides of childhood - the violent inhibitions of Bowling for Combine is what comes to mind, but since the mid-80s with the growing worship of children and children. childhood (accompanied by thousands of commercials, animations and series directed directly to children) several films and documentaries have succeeded in portraying the dark side of growth - abuse, loneliness, the push for excellence - which results in adults having a dark and twisted mind. /> <br /> And here is a movie that says: It's possible to have a happy childhood, look! "<br /> <br /> Thanks for that OR the illusion of the counterweight ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
