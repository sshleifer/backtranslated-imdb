I always wondered what had happened to that magical feeling that old Slovenian films seemed to have in them ... Well, over time, I wondered if this feeling was just nostalgia. Or did this "feeling" decide to pack up and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our cinematographic history, never to come back? Where did he go? Because for me, he came back the first time I saw "Ekspres, Ekspres". And it's old again. <br /> <br /> This film presents three qualities that make it unique and as pleasant to watch: the fluidity of the story, the warmth of the colors and the, what I appreciated most - the absence of excessive use of verbal communication (which many other (not only) Slovenian writers should at least consider). It's not helpful to use words when you understand each other as well (yes, or better) in other ways. Just look at Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. <br /> <br /> That's why, in just a few words, I would recommend "Ekspres, Ekspres" to you all, as a Slovenian film to see absolutely, no matter what you've heard about Slovenian movies (if you've ever heard anything, it's ...). <br /> <br /> Oh, and this scene where Bakovic dances on Vivaldi's music ... A treat. <br /> <br /> Indulge yourself. Look at this.
