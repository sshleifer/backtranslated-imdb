I can not believe that people are looking for a plot in this movie. It's Laural and Hardy. Lighten already. These two were a riot. Their comic genius is as funny today as it was 70 years ago. Not a dirty word of either mouth and they were able to keep the audience in the stitches. Their comedy was not very sophisticated. If a fighter cushion can not make you smile, there is no reason to look at what these guys have done. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at funny things without intrigue. I guess it takes a simple mind to appreciate that sort of thing, so I qualify. Two teams of comedies do not calculate, we are too sophisticated ... Are not we lucky?
