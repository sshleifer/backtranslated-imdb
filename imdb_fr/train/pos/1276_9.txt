I like this film. The black images combined with Spillane's no-nonsense character, Mike Hammer, work wonderfully to create an atmosphere and feel that is rarely found in low-budget crime movies of the early fifties. It may not be 'The Maltese Falcon' but this film brings its own contribution to the genre. Spillane is often criticized for his supposed misogyny, etc., but his "ladies" are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer, played by Biff Elliott, is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist he meets during his investigation into the death of a friend of the army. When the penny finally drops his face is an image. It is good to see that the censorship of the 50s did not force the filmmakers to omit the famous last line. A real classic low budget.
