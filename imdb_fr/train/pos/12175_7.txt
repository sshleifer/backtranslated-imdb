How about a man who was about to get married and who organized his bachelor party with some of his closest friends in a Hawaiian bar? All is well until he removes his "bachelor hat". How about talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of her finances? A new low, right? Well, Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, leads this experience of a nauseating blur and a new depression. I must say that this is one of his good main roles. However, I think his role in Vanilla Sky has been better played. <br /> <br /> Her financial name, Karen, is portrayed by actress Selma Blair while Karen's character, Becky, is portrayed by the charming and talented Julia Stiles. Going back to where we left off, Paul now has to go from one problem to another. He gets sick, has to take care of some people and has to play with his partner. Otherwise, any member of each family could have P.O'ed, including a family member who had no bowel movements. "For 14 days. * Vomit * All this leads to the long-awaited wedding with a hilarious scene before recapitulating all the hell that Paul and his brother had to go through. <br /> <br /> Overall, A Guy Thing is pretty much fun, sometimes the story may not seem to be anywhere and you're tired of scenes here and there, but it's a mixed film, and if you're Canadian and a fan of CTV Brett's sitcom Butt, Corner Gas, you'll recognize a small role played by Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays Hank's hilarious role in the series.This film is fine.This is another feather in Lee's hat (an empty hat, however). <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
