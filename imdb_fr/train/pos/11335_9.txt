Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer against Kramer combined with the imagination of Pan's labyrinth. Even the beginning of special effect seems to allude to Pan's labyrinth. But it's a story unfolding in modern times, not in a war of sixty years ago that has even more resonance today. Jake's Closet tells the story of a boy, an only child, virtually alone during the summer holidays, facing the destruction of his family. It's a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense, a horror movie for the thinker. If you are looking for a slasher film, it will not be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful, this is the movie for you. During the screening I saw, I swear there was a moment when the entire audience shouted. I strongly recommend to catch this movie.
