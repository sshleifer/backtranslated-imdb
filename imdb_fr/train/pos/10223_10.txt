* some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find that the harsh criticisms (acting, stale dialogue, unclear scenario) were unfounded. Belafonte is great as a brandosque, threatening and swearing spirit who must win his wings but who, realistically, is ill equipped with his past life to do so. He learns too late how his hectic and materialistic life was empty of love. Mostel is as tall as an anxious man with his dying wife, Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing). The two social worlds represented by the characters collide and complement one another alternately. The result is hilarious and moving. (30). The disconcerting end is actually pretty consistent with the rest of the movie. After looking everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up and sees a falling feather, and he searches frantically for it as if he were finally ready to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte was not allowed to finish his miracle (to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's faith), so he never had his wings. The feather floats out of reach of Mostel, a metaphor for the lives of both men: it's too late and you do not have a second chance. Like "It's a wonderful life", this film is magical, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.
