"Opening Night", released in 1977, wants to be ambitious. He only succeeds with the amazing performance of Gena Rowlands. Her acting character Myrtle is not necessarily a person we would like in real life. She herself is absorbed in herself, often odious, and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words, not very different from some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman about to collapse. We do not know if the demons she fights are real or imaginary, even if we reveal the secret early. Rowlands is visibly well led by her talented husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also plays a role in the film. This film is not without flaws - it is too long, and the last part of the film where Myrtle goes on stage very drunk seems almost cruel. The "improvisation" in some dialogues - at least on stage - lasts far too long. Some secondary characters perform well, including Ben Gazarra, who plays the sly producer Myrtle. Joan Blondell's character is never completely developed, and I never understood why she was in the film, except to calm Myrtle. Watch this movie only for Rowlands - it fascinates all the time - and it's hard to get out of it, though sometimes it's desirable.
