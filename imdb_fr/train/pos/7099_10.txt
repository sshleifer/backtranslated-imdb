Terry Gilliam tells the fantastic and twisted story of a virus that destroyed almost every inhabitant of the planet and forced them to go into hiding. The best performance of Willis so far. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes 12 Monkeys from most science fiction movies with time travel is that Bruce Willis's character really deals with the psychological effects of time travel, to know what reality is the real reality: the place from which the temporal traveler comes or goes. In addition, the film recognizes that things of the past can not be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, can not be stopped or modified. As Willis asserts, "it has already happened", while he is in a psychiatric hospital, the major dilemma in which the film trudle is not a banal and excessive conspiracy to save the world; Instead, it's Willis's inner struggle to survive simply. It's an innovative and innovative concept that works great thanks to a tight Peoples script and Gilliam's unique dementia brand. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story of 12 Monkey is totally nonlinear and chooses rather to deform. and bend the way the story is told by skillfully incorporating a multitude of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future and even a scene from Hitchcock's Vertigo. All serve to envelop the viewer in his disturbing cacophony of madness and futility. <br /> <br /> Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate shading and shadow rivaling Tim Burton in his striking landscapes and images. With a cold cinematography, wide and immersed, Gilliam plunges into the colorless scenery and darkness of his characters. The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic and white whiteness and contribute to contrast with the characters often twirling. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, Brad Pitt steals most of the scenes, filling them with a quirky, offbeat, patent-driven performance that earned him an Oscar nomination. As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not returning to his heroic clich√©s and his cardboard hero, but rather describing Cole as a simple, poignant and tragic man. Madeline Stowe is also a psychologist from Willis. She manages, investing her character with wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she believes to believe in a false "religion". <br /> <br /> Gilliam's expert, overwhelming and complex treatment What could have been an action / sci-fi film makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish futuristic landscape. His rich, well-thought-out and complex scenario, as well as the bravura performances of the entire cast and his dark and dark cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness. Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a sumptuously sumptuous show of a film brimming with brilliance. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
