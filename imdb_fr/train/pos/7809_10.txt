This film moved me beyond understanding, it is and will remain my favorite movie of all time, mainly because it contains almost all emotions in 157 minutes. What is most difficult for me is that every time I want to hear the music and the extraordinary songs of the movie, I have to put it in my DVD player. I wondered if anyone knew who would sing the songs in the movie. and where they can be found, as I have looked everywhere, I can think sporadically over the past 5 years. My favorite quote from the movie is when the lawyer says in court "But your own words ask for a direct confrontation, is not it a direct call to violence?" Biko responds, "Well, you and I are in conflict now, but I do not see any violence!" <br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
