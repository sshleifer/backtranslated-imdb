I liked Top Gun. This caught my interest. Predictable intrigue, decent character development and history. It is quite similar to High Noon in that the city's inhabitants seem weak and afraid to stand up to a villain. This film has quality actors who have not really had the chance to share all their talents. In addition, some actors did not receive credit for their roles. Denver Pyle was a handsome man in his youth. John Dehner, Rod Taylor are outstanding in their roles. Sterling Hayden did his best with mediocre equipment. It's hard to imagine him as a bandit. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a nauseating character. She seemed flattered that two men fought for her. Ugh. Finally, how can one travel without luggage? Especially women.
