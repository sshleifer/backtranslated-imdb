This film makes no pretentious effort to hide its true genre - a campy B movie. It will explain to you at first the definition of campy. He should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese. But the two get together in this movie so that you can go, "Hmmmmm ... it's so stupid!" and then do you laugh. For example, there is a scene in "16th Century Japan", which shows a pair of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. At the bottom of the temple, many tourists are looking for slippers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the acting goes from decent, bearable, to oh my God, but that's what makes it funny. You will see honest actors and you will find others really terrible. I have to digress, though, because I saw Stephanie Sanchez in several rooms and she's great. His airtime in the movie was quite short though. I have also seen Bryan Yamasaki in several plays on the islands during my visits and he is also better at the theater than in this film. Anyway, it's an entertaining movie, if you have nothing to do on a weekday night.
