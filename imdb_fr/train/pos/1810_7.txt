I can understand why some people like this movie and why others do not. For me, though, I really like it, even though I've noticed some good excerpts and less impressive passages. The entertainment was excellent, as in Charlie's dream. The characters were a mix, the best being Anne-Marie, voiced by the late Judith Barsi (I was physically sick when I read what had happened to her). Carface is also a very convincing villain, especially voiced by the wonderful Vic Tayback. (I especially liked "The morons, I'm surrounded by morons") and with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all Don Bluth's villains. Charlie and Itchy simply lacked the same brilliance, but I loved King Gator and his song. Part of the movie is very haunting, like Annabelle "You Can Never Come Back", which still scares me. Unfortunately, there were pieces that I did not like very much. The story tended to become clumsy and fuzzy, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered the same problem. There were also dark scenes, which the young children would find upsetting, but the end is very poignant. However, the biggest defect was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung. None of them stand out except "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives", and Burt Reynolds can not sing and Dom DeLuise sang a lot better. All in all, a viewable movie could have been longer, but it is definitely memorable and I would definitely watch it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
