Trapped: Buried alive brings us to a complex that has just opened and will soon close. <br /> <br /> We start with a guy blowing galleries, to avoid the risk of avalanches. In a way, it does not make sense. in any case, he is about to destroy a particularly big one, when he notices that the complex is open. despite all his efforts, the higher authorities tell him that his day is over. <br /> <br /> soon, as everyone expects, an avalanche occurs. <br /> <br /> Listen, I'm not going to reveal anything anymore. All I can say is a movie B designed for the family channel (which I just saw, and the fact that there is no advertising proves it is a movie B ). Anyway, it's a pretty decent film, but partly unreal. <br /> <br /> first hand, when people are buried under ice and snow, they are buried. not just traced by the powder. or, what about a CD for a screwdriver? It is not possible. Finally, what I can not emphasize enough is that an explosion can not stop an avalanche, guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Also, it's worth being rented or watched on TV, but I do not own it. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The film is rated PG, but maybe it should have been something a little stronger. a boy almost loses his foot in an elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, a guy is heated with electricity and diesel, and in the weight room, dead are lying. <br /> <br /> enjoy it.
