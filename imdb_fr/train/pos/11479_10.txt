This film was excellent, a little scary, but excellent for that. For those of you who have heard of Columbine and who know the story, it gives you an idea of ​​what these young people have done and why. In the back of your mind, you know that people think about it, but you never realize how serious it is, and this film makes you realize it. It's serious that good. This also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone who is for sure. I read a book about the Columbines massacre and it made me think, this film makes me afraid and scares me. On the other hand, it's like a guide on how to kill someone for serial killers. I recently received a threat and got rid of all thoughts, but after this movie, I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never really know who they are, so take it seriously and do not underestimate anyone.
