This film may not put the Catholic Church in the best light, but it tells a story based on real events. Unfortunately, everything in life, including religion, is not beautiful and pink. Sometimes people and groups do things that at the time seem like a good thing, but in retrospect, they're not as good as they used to be. "A Love Divided" tells the story of a family. Yes, she integrates religion, but in reality it's a family and that family's ability to stay together, whatever it is thrown at. This film is also based on real events, which does not mean that this scene-by-stage story is true, but if you looked at newspaper articles from that period, you would be able to see that neither one nor the other other churches did not treat the incident as a useful way for the family. The two churches are at fault here, the Catholic Church for imposing such a regulation on the family and not reacting to the violence that accompanied it and the Protestant church for telling the mother that she simply had to obey her husband and his priest. and do not fight. In this case, both dropped this family. I think the film does a good job showing this fight both in the church and in the family. This in no way means that the Catholic Church is down, quite the contrary, it shows that an incident can change the course of the ideas of this religion and that a person can have a much more important effect than only herself .
