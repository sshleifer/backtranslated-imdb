It was my favorite movie in my childhood, and I've been in the staging many times, so it will always be my favorite music and I doubt anyone can ever remake the story of Oliver Twist on the screen, better that this one. <br /> <br /> My "mean" favorite must be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only did he scare my life when I looked at her as a 6-year-old girl, but now as a woman, I can better understand this character from Nancys, the maid / prostitute who helps Oliver get the life he deserves. <BR /> <br /> Jack Wilde as a clever dodger was fantastic and I do not think anyone can surpass him, as a pocket picker on the street and Fagin's best friend. The music is fantastic, especially the numbers of Fagin. I'm also very grateful that I did not give Bill Sikes a music number. It would not work as he was such a sinister character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did a great job of embarrassing ending for Nancy, keeping this movie rated G by hiding her shots, but giving enough to show Bill's violence towards her. <br /> <br /> This film is both charming and charismatic as a musical song, as well as a moving drama that follows a young boy seeking to regain his place in life.
