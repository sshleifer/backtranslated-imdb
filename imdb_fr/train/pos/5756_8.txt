Anarchy and anarchy reign supreme in the stormy hamlet of Elk Hills. The city's alumni replace the scathing and insightful veteran Aaron (a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by Kris Kristofferson) and many of his veteran comrades who clean up the premises. The plan turns sour when Aaron and his cruel followers decide to seize Elk Hills after getting rid of all the bad elements. It's up to Ben, Aaron's well-behaved and kind-hearted brother (kindly portrayed by Jan-Michael Vincent), to stop him before things get too much out of hand. Screenwriter / director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank"), Armitage produces a formidable, amoral, cynical and subversive winner, who takes advantage of Western Western's modern exploitation: he cleverly creates a sober tone, Realistic bright and flawless throughout, and stages abundant action scenes with considerable muscle aplomb (the explosive climax is particularly strong and waving). The leading cast of well-known B-feature films is a major asset: Victoria Principal, Linda, Ben's fabulous girlfriend, fabulous Bernadette Peters, singer Little Dee, Brad Dexter, unscrupulous mayor David Doyle, a banal president, Andrew Stevens, affable station agent, Charles Cyphers, one of Nam's veterinarians, the movie John Carpenter, Anthony Carbone, a sophisticated casino manager, John Steadman, former owner of a food court, Paul Gleason, right-winger Shakedown Bully, and Dick Miller as a talented pianist. Moral: Do not hire other people to do your dirty work. William Cronjager's brilliant cinematography, Gerald Friedbill's harmonious and harmonious score, and plenty of raw violence add to the trash fun of this little unjustly neglected doozy.
