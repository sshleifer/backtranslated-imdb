What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days, which leaves them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? Answer: Too many! This film is not like that. It's a story of real people who are sometimes a combination of both friendly and unfathomable. <br /> <br /> Disadvantage: <br /> <br /> The development of the character is insufficient and some intrigues remain twisted in the wind. <br /> <br /> Upside: <br /> <br /> Forcing viewers to think about the choices they made for good or bad in their own lives. <br /> <br /> Well done by: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. <br /> <br /> Contains a good light humor.
