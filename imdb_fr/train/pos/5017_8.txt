I was 15 years old when this movie was shown on television. Having grown up in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teenage life there. This film touched my impressionable teenage heart and I fondly remembered it over the past 12 years. I recently had the chance to see him for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time thanks to the LOVE channel. I'm still crying because the film touches and touches my inner confused teenager.
