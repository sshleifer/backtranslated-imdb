I took a flyer to rent this movie but I must say that it was very very good. On all fronts: screenplay, casting, director, photography, high production values, etc. Proves that Eva Longoria Parker is a head-to-head in rom / com, above actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who treat her. Who thought that? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class of their own regarding this respect and should try to fight for projects as good as "Over Her Dead Body". Bell Lake is also excellent and this is the first time I see it. And finally, Paul Rudd must shine in a very good movie, instead of smaller movies. <br /> <br /> A film like this never holds its rights from men with tight minds. Too bad. As other critics of IMDb have noted here, there is nothing wrong with this gem - no hacking to write or play. <br /> <br /> And his representation of the news of Los Angeles and California, in general, gives each scene a bright, beautiful, clear and remarkable in every way. Never before has a film been so beautiful. Ah, what talent and care can do for a movie. <br /> <br /> I will not divulge the plot, but as a hardened and hardened soul, I was willing to suspend disbelief and buy in the supernatural theme in order to enjoy excellent entertainment and lightweight. It reminds me a lot of the old "Topper" movies, which were also very nice. <br /> <br /> This film features popular but hackneyed films such as "Ghost" for their shitty and sentimental parties. are. We already know that the taste of the public leans heavily towards the mediocre. Some of us, however, retain our praise for those who are truly worth it. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed other neglected gems such as "Into the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, "Chances Are" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Making Mr. Right" with John Malkovich, etc., you'll enjoy this. <br /> <br /> A work of first order all around (although it's hard to believe that a straight guy can claim to be gay for more than five years.) But even this plot takes nothing away from the movie . overall excellence.
