Finally, a film where the public guesses until the end what will happen. Well, we all know that the lives of Andy's brothers (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will sink into destruction because there is no other place to go, but we do not know how nor when. until the end of the film. Hoffman is superb, as usual, and even Hawke was honest as a younger brother who basically does what he is told, since he really can not think for himself. Hawke might have been a bit out of his element, but he played the role pretty well. Add to that Andy's wife, perfectly interpreted by Marisa Tomei, deceiving Hank; The embezzlement of the company by Andy to pay for drugs and sex addictions; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened on the day of the flight. This film will make you think.
