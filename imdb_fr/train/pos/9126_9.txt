This film is remarkable and wonderfully marked. Oscar de Prince for music was well deserved (many people do not know he won one). I think it's one of the best movies to watch on DVD late at night. A good surprise: Prince does a great job as a comedian and is quite good at conveying pain to the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good in their supporting roles. Very cool landmark movie.
