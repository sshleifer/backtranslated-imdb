The main reason for seeing this movie is Warren William, who is at his best as a shyster campaign director. Electric, he constantly tries to deceive the public and defeat the other side in the midst of the greatest catastrophes. William is a great actor - I think he never had his due. Bette Davis as his girlfriend also shines in a role underwriting. Personally, I found that Guy Kibbee was not quite right as a lame candidate that William and others are trying to pass off to the public. He looked more like an empty canvas than a person. I would have preferred to see emerge a real character rather than a non-character. The story itself is improbable, silly and clich√©d. But Warren William and Bette Davis deserve to be watched.
