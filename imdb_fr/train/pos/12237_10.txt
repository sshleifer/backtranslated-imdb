Mating Game is a charming and wonderful film from a bygone era. Hollywood must consider a charming remake of this movie. My wife and I would go see him. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I watched on AMC. <br /> <br /> This movie has Tony Randall at his best. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> I loved it. We plan to order on DVD to add to our growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Hollywood does not produce more films like this. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood ... it's time to take some of these types of scripts out of the old safe, update them a bit (without altering the movie and the original script as you did with other remakes) and have a casting call. <br /> <br /> A remake would be a big hit on the silver screen, DVD, and on the cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
