Although I do not consider myself a big fan of fairytale movies, Stardust intrigued me after seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the caravans as a villain (especially since I was about to see her under the name of the chief Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, is she so mean here as a witch, especially with her ugly makeup at the beginning and the end! Robert De Niro is also great as a pirate captain who has to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Just about everyone like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others are doing a good job here. Although Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Bernard daughter) and Kate Magowan have stunning faces, especially when we first meet her. The newcomer, Charlie Cox, is very much in the lead role of Tristan and he looked so much like his father, Dunstan, a young man that I thought it was him in the early scenes with Magowan (actually, Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and although I can see some similarities, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale told by an old man to his grandson . Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you see and hear could have happened, even with all the hilarity that occurs all along. So on this note, I strongly recommended Stardust.
