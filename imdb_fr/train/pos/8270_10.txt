It is an extraordinary film, which always deceives you. It seems to go to the clich√© in several places, then something amazing happens, which will really scare. It would be too much to say much more, but stay with this movie and you will be richly rewarded. William Haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star who deserves to be rediscovered. The gay relationship in his relationship with Jack Pickford is astonishing - there's even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this subtext subtly and with great depth of emotion, so that there are very moving moments. And I never thought I'd be as involved in a football game as in this movie - and I do not even understand the rules! The son of Francis X. Ralph, the rival of Haines for the girl, is also excellent (yes, it's not really a gay movie). Magnificent silent classic - a fine example of commercial cinema from the 1920s with an advantage.
