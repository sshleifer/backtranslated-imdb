The Sentinel is a film that was recommended to me by my father years ago. I have seen it many times since. He always manages to entertain me, while being scary. The flashback scenes are what really made it for me. The father of Cristina Raines, who runs every day with fright, always manages to get cold in the back with his two women. this is typical of your good against evil, but at least it manages to be entertaining. I think this ending is one of the most beautiful in horror history. It has a lot of shocks and suspense, see Burgess Meredith act like Chazen, puts me on the edge of my seat. The Sentinel has the perfect tension. We are never quite comfortable when Allison is on screen. We know that something awful is still waiting for him and that makes things even more tense. This movie is often overlooked by horror fans, but I personally think it's one of the best, and it's certainly enough for all Horror fans to be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Performances. Cristina Raines has her moments in wood, but has come largely for the most part. She is beautiful to watch and her chemistry with Saranadon seemed natural. Chris Sarandon is great like his boyfriend, Michael. He had an instant presence on the screen and I could not help but love him. Martin Balsam, Jose Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos. Burgess Meredith is great as Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we discover is absolutely terrifying. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wlaken are doing well, as dumb detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has a scary scene not to spoil. <br /> <br /> At the end of the line. The Sentinel is an effective horror movie that Horror fans unfortunately tend to overlook. It will give you the chills and fears you need to be satisfied. Well worth a look. <br /> <br /> 7/10
