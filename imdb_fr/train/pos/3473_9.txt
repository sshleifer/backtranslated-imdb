I admit that I had some concerns when I saw for the first time the excerpts of this film. Did the VH-1 walk on a hollow ground here? I mean, Harris and Quinn do not look like or really look like John or Paul. But I have to admit that this movie really surprised me. It is far from the exploitation film that I expected. Instead, it is a study of character, a discreet, fanciful and ultimately bittersweet look on friendship, and the ultimate lesson we all learn: it's difficult if not impossible , to grasp what we had and what happened to us.
