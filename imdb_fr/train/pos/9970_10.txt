A brilliant use of oversized colors illustrates the optimistic extremes of current Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element in the scenes (Santa and Pedro summarize the behavior of the society observed with the telescope) is unique (and obviously, Jean-Luc Godard, although subtle, stole this theme in his film "Pierrot le-fou") . Highly recommended!
