It's a great movie, and it's the kind of treasure that you can only catch with sporadic movie shows, as it's not available on video / DVD. The way the film starts with the arrival of the two lovers and ends with their departure (although a lot of things happen between them and they do not stay in the same place during this time), gives you a closing feeling that everything is fine with the world. If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do it. I can not wait to see him again and wish him to be released.
