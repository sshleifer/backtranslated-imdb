It's a short film made by fans that pretends to be a foretaste of a new movie that combines Batman and Superman! This is the kind of movie that fans love and watch in places like ComicCon and was directed by the same person who produced BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> For this film, I could easily choose it apart. Of course, the CGI effects are not perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. BUT, it was done on a tight budget and for a movie fan, it's amazing. I was particularly impressed by the super-buff Superman - he was not a rude little guy! If only it was a taste of a real movie, they could have brought fans from here to Omaha. Good work.
