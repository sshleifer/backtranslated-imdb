I am a fan of both actors / singers especially Gackt and when I first discover this film and watch the trailer, I find it ridiculous. After a long wait, I finally looked at it and here is my comment ... <br /> <br /> I consider that everyone knows the scenario and will not talk about it, instead, my first applause goes to the actors' game, generally that the Japanese films have not been brilliant and Even in MoonChild it's just wonderful and he's immersed in it, especially since Gackt pretty much reflects the emotions and changes of his character. I like a lot of his scenes both dramatic and humorous. Throughout the film, I did not like some cinematography, especially lighting and colors, but because of the small budget, it always has brilliant moments, but the real jewel of the film is the story. it's fine for me, and the theme of the film's friendship is really well developed and sometimes touching, however, the story emphasizes a cruel world that nobody guarantees life and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme visuals. An interesting note aside, this film has some similarities with the excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the vampire that is also played by the most beautiful actors (not handsome, handsome) of American cinema, in fact Moon Child is somehow can be seen as brother with Interwiew, yet original on his own. Only problem that MoonChild is it's a little slow sometimes, I'm a fan of Japanese cinema and I usually do it but it's not a change. MoonChild has unnecessary scenes or characters. I hope to see their other movies in the future, and I recommend it to anyone who loves vampire-action-science-fiction and romance movies. 8/10
