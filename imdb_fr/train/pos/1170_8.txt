Night Of The Living Homeless is a funny parody of the 1978 film (and the 2004 remake) of "Dawn Of The Dead". Only this time ... with the homeless.The episode has homeless people all coming to South Park and people They treat the homeless as zombies who want change and some of their parents are found on the roof of a supermarket, as in the film.At present, it is up to the boys to know where they come from and how it's a pretty fun episode with some good times like boys singing their own version of the 2pac / Dr.Dre song "California Love" .It's a good episode. <br /> <br /> 8 / ten
