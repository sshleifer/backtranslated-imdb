Last November, I had the chance to see this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I must say that it was very amusing. Apart from some technical errors, it was a great experience. I loved writing and acting, especially the guy who played the main role. There is a lot of heart in this film, a lot of spirit. I had the chance to speak with some of the filmmakers once everything was over and they seemed really nice. Overall, the movie was a positive experience, and I would recommend it without hesitation. The story was fun and cool, as a woman, I encountered many of the same problems as the main guy and I could really understand his problems because of that. The film does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The friends of the film are very well written, they are realistic. I know people like these, I only wish friends to Imy and I could look as cool as these people when we talk. The whole movie is really cool, I wish there were more movies like this one. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
