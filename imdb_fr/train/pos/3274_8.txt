This is one of the three 80s films I was able to think of that were unfortunately neglected at the time and, unfortunately, still neglected. One of the others was Clownhouse directed by Victor Salva, a horribly neglected movie due to Salva's legal / sexual issues. Another would be Cameron's Closet, which seems to me somewhat underrated - not great, but not as serious as the reviews I've seen. Paper House is well worth your time and I think it's one of those very quiet movies that will stay in your brain much longer than you think. I mean, 10 years after seeing it and I let it pause again, while something I may have seen 6 months ago went into the ether.
