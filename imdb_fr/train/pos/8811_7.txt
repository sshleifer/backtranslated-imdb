Eleven different directors from different parts of the world come together to present their views and ideas on the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you will see in any movie. Films like this are rarely made and appreciated. This film tries to touch all possible centers of the WTC. Here are some of the most important stories in the film that make this film so unique. <br /> <br /> There is the story of Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran), where somewhere in Iran people are preparing for American attacks. There, a teacher tries to educate her students by informing them about the killing of innocent people in the WTC massacre. Then comes the story of Youssef Chahine (Egypt), where a filmmaker encounters a face-to-face conversation with a dead soldier during the WTC attack and a hard-core terrorist who participated in the WTC attack. Then we see a story of Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) where a group of Five innocent children sees Osama Bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and earn American rewards money. Then we see the story of Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico) where you see a black screen and slowly, you see the real pictures of WTC buildings falling apart. And people who are stuck in the building come out to save their lives. The other most important story is that of Mira Nair (India), where a mother has a hard time enforcing her dead son, whose name is falsely trapped in the WTC massacre! After the attack of September 11, our heart beats loudly if we hear two names around the world. The first is World Trade Center and the second is Osama! This film totally changes our perception and constitutes a strong point in claiming something more. <br /> <br /> I will definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes to own this type of DVD collection at home. It's worth every penny you spend. But please, do not wait for anything more besides the movies of this DVD. There are of course filmographies of the directors but no additional features.
