Jazz lovers will love this classic short film that features some of the best jazz men who are just doing their job. It's like watching a no-frills video clip today. <br /> <br /> The men of jazz offer us an additional treatment in the person of Marie Bryant who sings a classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. I had never heard her sing before, Bryant looks remarkably like Billie Holliday. It's a compliment people. <br /> <br /> Their instrumental work is also at the top. With the black cinema of its time fed many white stereotypes, this film must be watched and cherished. No big production values, just a lot of good music.
