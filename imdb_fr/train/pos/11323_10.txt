Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a video game. In one way or another, producers have reversed the trend to make this series a success without any of these things. It could not have been otherwise, because the character development is great, just the way it is described in this series and any modification of it could only ruin perfection (you'll understand once you've seen all episodes). <br /> <br /> Despite a relatively slow start (the producer has taken his time to introduce the characters), things are rapidly growing and, shortly after the mid-show, the action becomes so intense that you find on your seat. <br /> <br /> The subject of the series focuses on the Holy Grail War that has been taking place in the city of Fukuky for 50 years. The pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that began in the last battle and enveloped much of the city. Saber. His first contact with Saber left him stunned, "Such immeasurable beauty ... I was lost for words". <br /> <br /> You must not compare this series to another to understand its plot. FSN offers more than just sword fighting, good animation, spectacular lights, great soundtrack, excellent relationship and character development. It presents the changes that occur in the personalities of the characters as events rush. This action reveals dynamic and behavioral patterns dynamic and credible in individuals (who do not look like the linear type used by other series) who permanently shape their personality to reveal, under the mask of perfection, defective characters. <br /> <br /> The character of Saber is linked to a medieval legend that has been modified to fit this series and must be accepted as such. You should not watch FSN think that it does not present the historical fact to the viewer. Just remember that this is a series of adventures / fantasy and not a documentary. Enjoy it as long as you can. The end is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes, I would have seen them in the same breath.
