If the redundancy of getting off the boat, the boat, the bus, the bus ... is a way to waste time, then you should go back to the Hollywood movies that summarize this part in a montage to get to the money shots. and, in so doing, leave you unconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life. Long sequences of trips allow the viewer to feel the same frustration and the same wait-and-see attitude that the characters must undergo. Frustrating? Yes. Vital? Effectively. the limbo of this trip is the key to "uprooting" this Turkish family. Beautiful movie with a lot of acting. Sad, but it's worth it.
