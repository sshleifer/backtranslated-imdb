A number of posters commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. It's always a problem with long and complex dramas. The crime is essentially banal, so the result is always anti-climactic, while the detailed presentation diverts from the human drama. The author has used a number of smart devices to try to solve this problem, but without success. The answers to exactly what happened and why could be provided, but if so, they are well buried. The viewer inevitably feels a bit deceived. <br /> <br /> But in a way, it does not matter. The drama never concerned the crime, or even the investigation, but the impact of events on the lives of those involved; the family, the investigators, the witnesses, the press. And as such, it was striking. The writing was a step ahead of the drama series in prime time, and the performances were consistently good. In an overall play, it's foolish to focus on individuals, but Penelope Wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as a mother, wife and daughter, and Janet McTeer was in great shape as an old man. cop badly bitten. <BR /> <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the treatment of the breed, as an elephant in the room that nobody is willing to mention. Subtle and powerful things.
