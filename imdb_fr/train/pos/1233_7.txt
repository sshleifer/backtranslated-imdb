A strange role for Eddie Murphy to take at the peak of his career. Although there is a lot of "Eddie Murphy's character," he plays a really decent character. The rest of the cast is good, especially the lovely Charlotte Lewis. The beauty and serenity of his character prevented the tone of the film from becoming too much Murphy.
