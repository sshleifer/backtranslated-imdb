I love Eddie Izzard. I think it's great and the other special television shows should also be examined. He also has a good book "Dress To Kill" to buy, which I think people should read. I loved the fact that this program won an Emmy, and everyone who loves history will probably make fun of Eddie. Enjoy :)
