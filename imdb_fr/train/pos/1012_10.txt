Stargate SG-1 is a version of the movie "Stargate" of 1994. I am so happy that they decided to develop the subject. The series begins with the very first episode. A retiree, Jack O'Neill, has to walk through the door again to meet his former companion, Dr. Daniel Jackson. In the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who does not let anyone through, and there is Teal'c, a calm and compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> The main villains are called Gouald, they are parasites that can be introduced into the brain, thus controlling and doing bad actions. Any Gouald who has tremendous power is often considered a "Lord of the System". The warriors behind Gouald are called Jaffa, who harbor the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until the Gouald can be inserted into a person's brain. <br /> <br /> Through the episodes, we come mainly to see SG-1, the An exploratory team composed of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam goes through the wormhole that transports them instantly on other planets (this device is called the Stargate) and they encounter new cultures or villains. Some episodes are aired around the world, meaning they do not pass through the Stargate once, but rather deal with urgent issues on Earth. <br /> <br /> Over the years, you begin to see a decline in the SG. -1 team as welded, and more character building stories. This, in turn, means even more episodes on the world, which is perfectly understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- Although most of this show is good, there are some examples of scenarios not always packed and the less emphasis on door trips these last years. But still, first-rate science fiction!
