Pinjar is truly a masterpiece ... It is a film that inspires reflection, makes you think and questions our culture. This is without a doubt the best Hindi film I have seen so far. This film should have been shown in film festivals around the world and would have been a serious competitor in Cannes. All the characters were perfectly chosen and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai haunted their roles. <br /> <br /> The story told by the film about the score is a very important story that should never be forgotten. <Br /> <br /> He has no bias or prejudice and has given the score a human story. Here, no country is described as good or bad. There are evil Indians, wicked Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful and haunting. Everything in the movie was amazing ... and the acting game took my breath away. All were perfectly molded.
