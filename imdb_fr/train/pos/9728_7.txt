I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg and I've watched a lot of his movies so far and none of them has made me laugh. How to lose friends and alienate people. <br /> <br /> This film is about a man who can upset people. However, he has an innate ethic that prevents him from doing things that could make him famous. But in the end, he ends up showing them the culture of life. <br /> <br /> The film is full of humor, romance, good acting and also a little lap dance. This is one of those movies where you could be happy when it ends.
