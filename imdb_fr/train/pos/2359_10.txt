I think if you asked most JWs if they are waiting for a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find that they do not do it. I know not. What you will find instead is that they believe in the promises made by Christ of a resurrection. So, even if the worst should happen and we die while maintaining our integrity, Jehovah can, and correct that. <br /> <br /> It really comes down to a simple question: Is God real to you? does all this just make you believe? If he is real and you trust him, you will follow his instructions, regardless of the short-term result. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. A family member was horrified when she saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in big letters on my card. I told him that if I were in a position where only a blood transfusion would save my life, would it be a good time to anger the only one that could bring me back to life when the time came? She did not understand - God is just not real enough for her. Pity. I wish she could have the comfort that a strong faith gives.
