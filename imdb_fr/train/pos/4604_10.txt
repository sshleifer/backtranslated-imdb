This film is undoubtedly a perfect 10/10 .. for all those who evaluate this film with low notes because it has no "good plot" or anything like that, it's ridiculous to to say that a film by Jackie Chan is bad because of his plot is like saying that a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you're watching Jackie Chan FOR THE BATTLE SCENES, for the action, he's not so focused on a good story or something, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other American movies. that time and even later, you'll realize that Jackie Chan's movies had incredible fight scenes and not good conspiracies, while American movies had good plotlines but crappy action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing in the time. Porn is watched for porn, Jackie Chan for ACTION, I think you evaluate it badly because there's no plot because you think that's how a smart movie critic would give a note to a good movie The film is a movie that can entertain me. Of course, the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but express it that way, the rest, which includes all the action scenes and stunts, pays a lot for all that. That changed the way American action movies were created, they even have stunning scenes from this movie. If you want a real man, a real artist, then watch this film and many more of Jackie Chan, always pure. It literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in today's movies. American films are based on special effects, security cables and acrobatics liners, and more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan movies are the works of a true artist who does everything in his power and has a lot of talent. a masterpiece
