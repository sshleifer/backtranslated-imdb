This film was excellent. I did not expect him to be up to all the hype, but he did it. Like all Bourne movies, the action is fast, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two films in the trilogy, you'll also like this one. The plot of the film is simple and there are no twists too unrealistic. OK, Julia Stiles's character in the Italian hut was rather far-fetched, especially after what happened in Supremacy, but it makes sense that this is the only character of "Treadstone" that Bourne knows, who does not want him could possibly trust and the only person to guide him in the right direction. The action is animated by the characters and their reactions to what is going on around them. What I've always liked in Bourne movies is that Bourne can fight, but when he's paired with people as good as he is, the fights are tough and he suffers a lot of damage. They never treat the public as idiots. <br /> <br /> All the actors were solid in their performances. I think Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and get great support from Joan Allen who takes over Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and the trilogy. Franka Potente misses me however.
