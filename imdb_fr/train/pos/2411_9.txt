This film seems to me to be one of the most successful attempts ever to bring plausible answers to some of the nagging questions that have arisen in recent work concerning the stories of "Passion" (suffering and death of Christ) in the New Testament. (What motivated Judas if the money was not involved, what could lead the Sanhedrin to meet on a holy day, and why did Pilate get embossed?) is a film for the serious and thinking Christian: fans of "The Passion of Christ" will undoubtedly be disappointed by the absence of bloody spectacle and characterization of the vault. As far as I'm concerned, I find the portrait presented here - of the will of ordinary people to sacrifice so bluntly common decency when their own interest is at stake - much more realistic and deeply troubling. (The selfless look "I just do my job" on the face of the man who sinks the first nail on Christ's wrist is as scary as any moment in the film.) The film does not claim to "the authenticity ", but the sets and costumes invariably feel more" just "than many of the more acclaimed efforts. It is a slow film, but if you accept the limits it imposes on you (it is after all "the death" - and not the life - "of the Christ"), it is finally very enriching.
