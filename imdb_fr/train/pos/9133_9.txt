I was too young to know more about Prince, but in recent years I've seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty T-shirts and I thought they were cool but I did not want to buy a shirt I did not know anything about . So, on a Saturday, it went into fusion and I decided to watch it. I did not know what the movie was going to be before watching it but it was great once I discovered it. In the film, Prince was not called prince but "the kid". All the performances were great for me but my favorites were Purple Rain, Darling Nicki and I would die for you. All the songs related to what was going on in the film when his father and mother were still fighting when the dancers cried were describing how he felt. I also like how smart the prince was with his way of flirting with Apallonia. I liked when Prince and Appallonia met for the first time in the club and he was standing behind her standing, and once she turned around, he disappeared! excellent movie and now I can not even find one of these t-shirts :(
