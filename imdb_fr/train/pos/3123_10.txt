This is the first time I gave a film on 10. What made this film so good for me? Constant action - there are no slow parts, excellent interpretation, intelligent writing. I also liked the style of filming where the earthquake and the different angles gave the impression of being part of the scene. Finally, I see a movie action that does not try to please all audiences (that is, there is no forced romance). <br /> <br /> I liked Bourne's first two movies, but I loved this one. . <br /> <br /> Be careful, after watching this film, you will be filled with adrenaline and may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!
