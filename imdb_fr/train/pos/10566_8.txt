Never seen this film and enjoyed the songs and dances of Cagney and other members of the cast, namely: Dick Powell (Scott Blair) who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays Chester Kent. He wrote musicals and began producing Prologues, which was broadcast among the feature films presented in theaters in the 1930s. Chester has problems with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows. It's a very entertaining film, filled with good and very funny humor. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) played a leading role, as well as being very young and pretty. Dick Powell was a good singer and dancer and was just starting out with his long and successful film career. Enjoy.
