Adieu L'Ami / Adieu L'Ami / Honor Among Thieves is not perfect, but it's a neat and entertaining thriller that sees Franco-Algerian war veterans demobilized, Alain Delon and Charles Bronson, trapped in the same safe, to make stolen links, other to clean the two million wages accumulated during the Christmas weekend. Naturally, things are not so simple, even after opening the safe, which leads to some twists. On the flow side, there is a very bizarre striptease scene in a parking lot. Bronson has a very irritating slogan, similar to Fonzie, which he uses at the most inopportune moments, Brigitte Fossey, perhaps wearing the most hideously ill-conceived hairstyle of the '60s, resembling a bald woman whose wig has been swept away by a violent wind), is it a responsibility ?? "I'm going to cook spaghetti, I'll learn how to make love, I'm going to read Shakespeare!" speech is hysterical in every way ?? and it's unfortunate for the horrible last line / shot, but otherwise it's a surprisingly fun and unpretentious figure that deserves to be checked if you can find a decent copy. <br /> <br /> The British DVD Cinema Club only offers English The soundtrack, but as Delon has voices and the rest of the cast is pretty well nicknamed, this is not a big deal, especially since the widescreen transfer is of good quality.
