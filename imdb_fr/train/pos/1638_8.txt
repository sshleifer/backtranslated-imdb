Heartland was in production around the same time as Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate - Heartland costs a fraction of the production but is ten times longer than the film. <br /> <br /> Heaven's Gate was "the biggest and most expensive ($ 40 million 1980!) Hollywood fails all the time, its failure leads to the sale of the United Artists studio at MGM" -imdb entry <br /> <br /> Heartland costs a few hundred thousand dollars and enjoys excellent writing, directing, photography and acting. It easily brings you into the beauty, the joys, the difficulties and the sorrow of the pioneer life. <br /> <br /> It's sad that Hollywood sometimes pays millions of turkeys (based on the director's success) and neglects such a wonderful story. .
