These two stars are the only iconic heroes / villains I know who have had a good TV series. Compare them. <br /> <br /> Freddy - 7 films Robocop - 3 films <br /> Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes <br /> <br /> Freddy - 2 more movies (Freddy Vs Jason, Freddy vs. Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 extra movies (Robocop: First Instructions: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crash & Burn, Resurrection) <br /> <br /> Freddy - 1 next film Robocop - 1 next film <br /> <br /> Who has had more time on the screen? Well, they both had 7 movies, a TV show and an upcoming movie. But Freddy wins with his 2 additional films (including a fan film) and 17-18 TV episodes. <br /> <br /> As this is a commentary for the series between Freddy's Nightmares - ANOES: The Series & Robocop: The series, I would personally choose Robocop ...
