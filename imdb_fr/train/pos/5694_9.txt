Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are great. I saw Kilmer on The Doors, but his rendition of John Holmes is superb. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights which was rather slow. Wonderland is a movie that is able to show you a horrible crime story from the point of view of a guy who has just indulged in his vice of drugs and who is indolent about everything going on around him. At the same time, the character of John Holmes shows a very clever scammer, able to get through the most ugly and ugliest situations almost unscathed. The film deserves to be watched more than once. The seventy sensual and full of drugs atmosphere is amazing.
