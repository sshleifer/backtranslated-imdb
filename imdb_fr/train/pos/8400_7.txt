I picked up this movie in my local library. Having met the director at a film festival at the end of last year, I was curious to "watch" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film takes a fresh look at familiar topics, love, infidelity, friendships, jealousy. It can be a bit "talkative" sometimes but never enough to sink the film completely. I had the pleasure of watching a love story with characters that CLEARLY unite with each other and watch them make informed decisions rather than "falling" at random into something as important as 'love. The contrast between this film and the average budget shoot-em 'up black film is quite distinct. Check it out. If you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack, like mine. Good product!
