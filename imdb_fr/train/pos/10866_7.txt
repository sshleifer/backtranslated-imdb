Johnnie To's ELECTION has nice music in the opening credits, as well as a nice drawing of opening credits, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and these Asian mobs solemnly taking an oath or pronouncing sacred words; In fact, the whole movie is well noted. I found about To with bishop Seraphim Sigrist and I was quite impatient to see a To movie. The one I started with, ELECTION, is exciting and interesting, and still moderately violent today. - standard - moderately and also essentially violent; The story of a plot of an Asian godfather, she uses a set of elements, violent facts drawn from the life of gangsters, the race to the scepter, real details and, as with Coppola, we expect what some morally glorious gangsters are titled and nice and friendly. The performances are quite amusing and colorful. <br /> <br /> The ELECTION is well done in the pleasant and somewhat careless style of the Hong Kong tariff; the end is bitter, true, straight and scares children.
