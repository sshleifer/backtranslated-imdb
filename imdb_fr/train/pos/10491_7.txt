A jewel of sweet and delicious comedy, until the last five minutes, which degenerates into a farce of the farce of British television. The last five minutes cost 2 points in my rating. Despite this major intrigue and lack of style, it is important to watch the character game and the unique Cornwall setting. A lot of little things to savor, like the eternity under which we all live while waiting for the approval of the bank after the clerk has passed the credit card ... made more piquant when we are not - quite - sure that the card is not saturated.
