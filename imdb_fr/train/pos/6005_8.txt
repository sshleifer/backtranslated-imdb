Although this film is a bit cleansed (because it was shot in a time when people just did not talk about sex), it's an extremely useful short film to show prepubescent girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. Unsurprisingly, it was funded by the Kotex company, although what may surprise many is that Disney produced this film - as they made many educational films in the 1940s and 1960s. The film is however well done, but I think the filmmaker has missed a real opportunity. Instead of the nice narrator's voice and relatively bland visuals, it would have been great if they had used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney gang !! I know it would have given old Walt a heart attack, but wow, that would have been a good movie! By the way, although the notion of sex is barely mentioned in the film, she correctly explains menstruation in general. However, some details (especially about sex) are missing, which I suppose were included in the accompanying booklet. <br /> <br /> Now, if only I can understand why I watched a cartoon about menstruation.
