Page 3 is a good movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once in the film, I found myself staring into space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the film, although I think a more glamorous or enthusiastic person would have been better, but she did a great job. All the supporting actors were also very good and helped the film. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this movie THE STORY is awesome, and very realistic, it does not beat around the bush, it is very simple to send his message. I think more movies like this should be done, I'm sick of watching the same candy floss films again and again, they're hard to digest now. Everyone should look at page 3, it's a good movie. -Just my 2 cents :)
