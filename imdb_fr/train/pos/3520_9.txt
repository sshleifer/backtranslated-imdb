This is a black film of the "B series" and my vote reflects his belonging to this genre. I saw this film last night in a cinema on the left bank of Paris, where he opened a two-week film noir tour. The film has some flaws, of course, but too many delicious elements to ignore. <br /> <br /> As noted by the previous commentator, the percussion scene is amazing! (The B movies could walk where it was forbidden to get into the A movies!) And the plot is intriguing. With regard to Franchot Tone, I beg you not to agree: for me, he is properly mysterious; just the right shade of goose bumps. Keep in mind that there is here a kind of German Expressionism (the director, Robert Siodmark, was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), so that an air of exaggeration permeates the whole film . At least that's the case for me. <br /> <br /> However, it is the magnificent Ella Raines who, in her third performance only, held this spectator in suspense throughout the film. A "Girl Friday" type much like Gene Tierney, it's amazing that she did not become a household name. But she's so good here that I just ordered another movie from her movie ('Impact') on the internet, and I can not wait to see it too.
