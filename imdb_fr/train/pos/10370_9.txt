Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them. Watching this film, made in 1988, in 1999, I thought I would watch the movie O.J. Simpson's debacle (although I have very different opinions on the innocence of individuals in each situation). <br /> <br /> If we believe this film, the Australian media has devoured the case of a possible infanticide and the truth. was left behind. It was frightening to see the scenes of hordes of invading and teeming media, silly stories of half-truths and lies and debates about the supposed merits of the case by people at all levels of society. <br /> the description of the media as indifferent and incomprehensible technical information contained in the case. I hope that the issue of religious prejudice in this matter will be more fully taken into account (the accused are Seventh-day Adventists). <br /> <br /> Today, these circuses have become common but this makes the lesson even more important. <BR/> <br /> Streep is excellent, as usual, and it's the best I've ever seen with Sam Neill. Australian accents are sometimes a little thick, but not incomprehensible.
