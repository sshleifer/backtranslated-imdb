Shakespeare Behind Bars is the most surprising and charming film I've seen all year. This is a prison program, somewhere in California, if I remember correctly, where the inmates have been rehearsing and playing a different Shakespeare play every year for 14 years. The film follows their production of "The Tempest", from casting to performance, and teaches us rather amazing things about these men, who are all involved in the most serious crimes. The truth is indeed stranger than the fiction - if someone tried to adapt this story to a fiction film, the public would never buy it, but the fact that it is real makes the reading to be cut the breath - literally; I gasped when I learned about the crime of a particularly talented criminal. It's like a crazy episode of Oz and all the more entertaining as the characters and their strange stories are real.
