Excellent view of a mature woman who will lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). The way she gets involved in this special "enterprise", her innocence and the true love that exists between the inhabitants of a small town, is a perfect combination to give us a fresh, light and fun comedy. I could not help laughing with a very amusing scene featuring two old ladies in a pharmacy. <br /> <br /> I like European films and, with films like this one, my opinion gets stronger. Waking Ned Devine is a film that I also recommend with eyes closed, in the same genre. <br /> <br /> Save Grace, a comedy that many friends have loved as much as me. You will love it.
