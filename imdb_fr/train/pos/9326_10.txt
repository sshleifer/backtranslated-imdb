I must be honest and say that I bought this film, not because of its content, but because of David Cubitt; I know ... shallow, or what? - But, come on, Mr. Cubitt is a fantastic actor, it's an understatement. <br /> <br /> I really did not know what to expect when watching this movie, I read others, and those on other sites, but I must say that I was trained in the world of brothers almost from the start. David Cubitt as Theo and Colm Feore as Ryan are so credible as the two brothers, the movie evolves in their relationship as they begin to try to get to know each other again after their father's death. The scene where Theo discovers that Ryan is gay has been brilliantly performed. He literally enters a scene and tries to leave without Ryan noticing it - which of course he has. <br /> <br /> The film has been very well documented and is therefore incredibly sad, moving, uplifting and a celebration of life in part. I came out of that sad feeling of what Ryan went through, but also knowing that he had received hope and unconditional love from his former drug addict brother, Theo. I agree with the other critic who finds the scene where Theo says he's going to be a touching father, and I'll go a step further and say that I really vocalized my thoughts to Ryan when he says cruelly to Theo 'What makes you think you can be a father' and Theo just says 'you'. Theo then walks away, but this little exchange of dialogue says a lot about Ryan's almost self-pitying appearance, which the simple retort raises. <br /> <br /> A brilliantly designed film on all levels, acting, directing, writing, etc. are all very well done. I can not find anything else to say about this film, except that it is very difficult to cope with the death of a loved one, but it is done superbly, to infinity. Respect for matter and the outpouring of love (without being contrite or accursed) speak volumes about this rather selfish world in which we live today. Congratulations to all concerned. <br /> <br /> Few movies make me cry and allow me to think about life in general, but also to be happy for everything I have and not to be sad for that. Me no, but this movie did it, it was incredibly edifying considering the subject.
