I got into this great season 4 program and since then I've watched all the DVD episodes and I'm getting better and better with the 9 and 10 seasons. It may be that Richard Dean Anderson is not now, but the addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black has still given the show more strength and originality even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, now, the science fiction channel has gotten rid of this incredible show without relay, for an 11-year season. Two movies directly on DVD and, hopefully, more. Atlantis is still strong in his 4th season. And there is a third spin-off in the works: the Stargate franchise is far from dead. This TV show is a must for all science fiction fans and people of all genres because it offers a wide range of things that will appeal to all ages and all types of people. Watch it !!!!! 10/10
