It's a meeting, a team and a big episode of Justice. From one hesitation to a resolution, Clark jumped from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny to a Superman who, like Green Arrow, leaves his emotions aside for his few loved ones, ready to save the planet. It's not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; It's also about deciding what's most important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope the following episodes will remain strictly true to what Justice shows without any backtracking pushes and ends here in Smallville --- and a wonderful start for Superman. <br /> In this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between Lex and the Team. Nine stars should give him enough credit.
