I saw Enchanted April for the first time about five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following Christmas. It is about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, leaving their ordinary life behind them. These are very sad women at the beginning of the movie and you can not stop you encourage them when they are planning this trip with two other women to invite to share expenses. This is perhaps the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen. It's pure and simple, without car chases, without animosities and without deaths. It was done with care and very good taste. You can not help but smile all the time - except when you cry tears of joy!
