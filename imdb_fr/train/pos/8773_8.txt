Errol Flynn is "Gentleman Jim" in this 1942 film about boxer Jim Corbett, nicknamed the man who beat John L. Sullivan. Directed with a light hand by Flynn's good friend, Raoul Walsh, the film also stars Alexis Smith, Jack Carson, Alan Hale Sr., William Frawley and Ward Bond. Flynn plays an ambitious and egotistical young man, who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive San Francisco Olympic club in the late nineteenth century. Although in a good mood, the fact that he is a "sneaky Irish" and a social climber arouses the resentment of members of the Olympic club; most of them can not wait to see him lose a fight and they bet against him. Despite this, he makes himself known and even works as an actor. Finally, he is lucky that he was waiting for a match with world champion John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan is asking for a $ 10,000 deposit to ensure that Corbett will appear to be fighting for a $ 25,000 scholarship. Corbett and his manager (Frawley) are desperate to get this money. However, the help takes the form of a very improbable person. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining film and Jim Corbett plays an excellent role for Flynn, who himself has been a professional fighter. He has the charm, the beauty and the athleticism required for the role. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, her romantic interest that insists she hates him. In real life, she does not seem to have existed; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895. <br /> <br /> The interest of the film is to focus on Corbett and his career rather than on the history of boxing. Corbett has used scientific techniques and innovation and is considered the man who has made the fight against rewards an art form. In the film, Corbett is a football fleet and avoids being hit by his opponents; He is thought to have used John L. Sullivan this way. <br /> <br /> Good film to capture Flynn at the time of his short stint as a superstar.
