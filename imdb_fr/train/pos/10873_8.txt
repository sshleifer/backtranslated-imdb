This film really deserves more recognition than getting it. It is truly an amazing and rich portrait of bloody ties, favors and allegiances in the world of crime. The film is beautifully shot and plunges into all your classic themes such as betrayal and power. This film is a film of spectators, it requires attention, understanding and rewards in the end. It is Hong Kong's godfather and a welcome change rather than another epic fight, the epic of martial arts that seems to be the major contribution to the world of Hong Kong and China's cinema. It has a great mix of characters, actors and developers, although it's fair to say that I had to watch it twice to understand what was happening with certain characters because of their many interactions in the movie. ALl in all 8/10 Great characters of the plot, but there are characters that do not stand out enough and the music did not really motivate me and sometimes I felt that it did not synchronize well with the action (there is action so he loses some points for that.
