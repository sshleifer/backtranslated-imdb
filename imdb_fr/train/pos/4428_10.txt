I totally disagree with the other comment about this movie. The visual effects complete the supernatural themes of the film and do not detract from the plot. In addition, I loved the fact that this approach differs from that of Crouching Tiger because this time the action of the sword had no condition and most of the time, you can see it up close. <br /> <br /> I think the Western audience will be very confused with two scenes, one involving a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other about villagers chanting that this is the end of the world. The scenes mentioned are derived from certain interpretations of the text of Mahayana Buddhism (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar ... at the time , people really thought that the world would come to an end ... Gojoe has the action, the story and the visual effects that hypnotize all the spectators. I firmly believe that with clever editing, it can be sold in the United States. My only complaint concerns the last fight scene (I can not give anything, sorry).
