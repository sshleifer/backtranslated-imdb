I love this movie since I saw it for the first time in 1979. I'm always amazed at the precision with which Kurt Russell describes Elvis, the way he moves and the expressions on his face. Sometimes he scares how he looks, acts and speaks like the real Elvis. Fortunately, the DVD is out. All those who are waiting finally have an excellent quality version of the complete movie. I heard critics say that there were inaccuracies or things left out, but I think keeping in mind that John Carpenter had only two and a half hours to work, and that was broadcast on television (only two years after Elvis's death!) that he did a good job with that. In fact, I have never seen another Elvis film that approaches this one. Highly recommended.
