it's not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise' but it's a good road movie. he installs his two main characters slowly and easily. viewers quickly discover the underlying tensions, which is a tribute to the director. there is the young francophone son (and anglophone) who wants to succeed in France, has a French girlfriend and who drinks alcohol, to party like young men. And there is his Arabic-speaking (and French) Moroccan father who devoutly follows his Muslim faith with generosity and wisdom and rejects the new culture that surrounds him (like mobile phones). the film could explore a very powerful politics - the strange couple led through the former Yugoslavia, through Turkey and then across the Middle East to get to Mecca. these are areas where Muslim populations have been involved in wars, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators have resorted to torture and summary executions to maintain power and where religious communities are constantly fighting mortally. Yet, the film moves through these places and possibilities with only allusions to such agendas. the relationship between the two is the key to this film, and faith, politics are the backdrop. he seems to say that we are all human and that we must understand each other and care for each other to manage this world well. it's certainly not a "Natural Born Killers" and that's good.
