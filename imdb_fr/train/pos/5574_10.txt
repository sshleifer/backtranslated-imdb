Peter M. Cohen has a winning satire on the mating game, twisted and returned. Critical criticism of the film in mainstream media, described as "offensive" and "torrid", only highlights its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It's in line with what I call "reality" satire as a result of "In the Company of Men", "Chasing Amy", "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Two Girls and One Guy". Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I have always been intrigued by his ability to perfectly capture the pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three obsessed, sex-obsessed predators who, with the leaf of their recently married friend (superbly portrayed by Judah Domke), are reversed in their own way by a predator (Amanda Peet). Beneath the satirical surface hides a much more satisfying romantic comedy than most studio products coated with sugar.
