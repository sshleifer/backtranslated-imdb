For my life, why did this film receive the grade R ?! Believe it or not, these are flesh-eating zombies, it's actually a pretty good movie for families - at least if your children are 10 years old or older. Unlike traditional zombie movies, this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as traditional values, even if it's a bit crooked! Language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and the style of film is resolutely aimed at children (a bit like the old television series "Eerie, Indiana"). Believe me, most children have witnessed even more serious violence and it seems ridiculous to make the public believe that it is an adult film. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in a parallel world. While fashion, cars and manners appeared around 1953, in this strange world, a recent zombie plague caused a "zombie war" and considerable upheaval in everyday life. At school, children are trained in armed combat and there is a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack "just in case "! When it comes to life outside of school, it's pretty strange too, because people have now learned that zombies are NOT such a bad thing! Heck, using shock collars and training, they can be turned into slaves who can do your housework, clean the streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick guy, be your 'special friend ". <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family who finally buys their first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). Mom is delighted and her son slowly becomes the friend of the zombie. On the other hand, Dad is not convinced - he has been forced to kill his own zombie father for years and he has not recovered yet !! Funny, irreverent and unique - this movie must be seen by a much larger audience.
