Creature Comforts in America should have been broadcast on a different network or at least have the ability to broadcast all of its episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Since the American public has (apparently) the attention of a gnat when it comes to a humor that does not consist of profane diatribes, or which is concerned with scatological functions (sound and smell), it will be little and far between. One of the main problems was that, however brilliant it was, it was aimed at a rare audience who knew what to expect, but was watched by an audience and meeting rooms that had no idea of what they were looking at Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to see at least three other seasons in this series, even if it had been produced for a direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich in sub-context and there were other conversations that were just waiting to take place below the surface. But thanks to political correctness, such conversations only take place in my mind.
