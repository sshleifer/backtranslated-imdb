Class Lamp, National Lampoon's Class Reunion, is a classic 80s comedy film that combines unique characters, lots of laughs and good Chuck Berry music. When Walter Bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at the end of high school, he takes the opportunity to take his revenge at the meeting of his class. One by one, he harasses classmates including an innocent blind man, a fat horny guy, the beautiful high school girl, the king of the preparations and even the ugly old diner who has served children to all the children in high school. This film contains scary elements and contains some scenes of sexuality. I would not recommend it to young children, but it's a great movie for teenagers. If you're looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters, or stunning special effects, you may not like Class Reunion. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have good laughs and a lot of fun (and who does not), then this movie should feature on your movies to see the list. ++
