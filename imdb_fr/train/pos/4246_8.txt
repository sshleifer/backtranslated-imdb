In this film, made just as the production code was applied, Jean Harlow is Eadie and Patsy Kelly is the "Kitty" buddy. A Missouri girl starts with girls getting on a train, Eadie making a promise to make money while looking for a millionaire husband, while remaining whole. She does not take long to meet Frank Cousins ​​(Lewis Stone was the nice doctor of Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the movies "Andy Hardy".), But all is not what seems to be .. The censors must HAVE adored Harlow's phrase "A girl could not accept such an expensive gift from a gentleman without being engaged." Later, someone said, "You know we've never been alone together," and Eadie said, "Yeah, and we're not going to be alone!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another rich and rich person who comes to his rescue when problems arise to search for Eadie. At one point, Paige says "You should be wiping off my list - I'm not a women's man" ... I wonder what this line would have been a few years before the Hayes code came to town . What was he really saying? Carol Tevis seems to be the "Baby Talker" acute, as shown in the credits on IMDb. It looks like she was in showbiz only from 1931 to 1939, with "Munchkin" in Wizard of Oz being her last role. Have fun, the girls are hunting men across the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard, who was an Olympic wrestler from 1920 (silver medalist) to movie star (he was part of most of Dr. Kildares and would appear in four of Harlow's films.) Young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in a swimsuit at "Palm Beach", though the downtown outdoor scenes seem to be a set.
