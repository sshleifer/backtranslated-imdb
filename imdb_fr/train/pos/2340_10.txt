I immediately fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show manages to make me smile with his fantastic story, his spiritual dialogue and his exceptional acting. But that's not all: he also manages to keep you to the end. The basic idea of ​​the series - bringing people back to life with a twist, putting an end to the undead status with a second - is interesting and could be interesting in subsequent seasons. But suspenseful murder cases, the unique look of the series and the highly competent narrator add to the experience. But "Pushing Daisies" is more than its parts. It's a charm that I really enjoy and look forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season.
