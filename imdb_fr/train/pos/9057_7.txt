Let's keep it simple: my two children were stuck to this film. It has its defects from the point of view of adults, but buy deworming and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> And Pepsi's daughter was excellent! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was pretty damn hot, although she's not very involved in the movie, so do not get upset. <br /> <br /> It's not really a bad thing, but it's the kind of movie you watch once. Do not buy the DVD. <br /> <br /> Have fun! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (It was for dads.)
