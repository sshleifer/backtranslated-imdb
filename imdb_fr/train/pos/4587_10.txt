Although hard-boiled John Woo is my favorite movie number 1. But I must say that the police story is my favorite movie number 2. I say that because the stunts, the fights and the action I prefer in the film are those where Jackie Chan jumps from the rail to the top of the mall's esculator and clings to a pole surrounded by Christmas lights and slides down through a skylight and finally land on her back on the floor in hard marble. OUCH! Buy it on amazon.com for 14h98. (Or something in 14 bucks.) VHS home video new line. Any questions or comments please feel free to answer. (I'm only 14, but I know where you can find any movie.) If you're looking for a movie anywhere and you can not find it, answer me. Thanks and good night!
