A very well done and spooky horror film from the very poor PRC film company, which usually produces really tacky movies like DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT. The German expatriate director Wisbar is doing wonders on a small budget and his set of swamps linked to a studio. Charles Middleton, glove and macabre, is effective as a strangler.
