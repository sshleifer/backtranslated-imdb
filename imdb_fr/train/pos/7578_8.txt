Shintaro Katsu, who played the blind swordsman "Zatoichi" in 27 films in total, ends the Hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he makes love with a ghost, Mako Midori (The Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> The big stick, often used in the pursuit of justice, is removed forever. <br /> <br /> Katsu was his usual impudent as he pursued those who stole from the treasure to lend large sums to those who could not afford to pay. <br /> <br /> The usual sword and talent of the big guy were present, along with the blood. <br /> <br /> I will miss him.
