Steven Spielberg (24) had already directed two great episodes of a 1971 series entitled "The Psychiatrist", starring Roy Thinnes. One episode involved a 12-year-old boy with emotional problems and the other, a young man living (Clu Gulager in his best performance) dying of cancer. Both episodes were amazing, visually unique on television, complex and emotionally mature. The creators of "The Psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created "Columbo" and also produced his first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk insisted that experienced television directors ranked first "Columbo", as Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk accepted Spielberg after watching part of Clu Gulagher's episode "The Psychiatrist". <br /> <br /> Spielberg explains on the DVD of "Duel" that he liked the script "Murder by the Book" by Steven Bochco (based on a story of Levinson / Link), and he tried to make so that production looks like a $ 1 million feature film, even though he thought he had a lot less money to work with. <br /> <br /> This episode of "Columbo" is far off It is visually more stylish and uses the soundtrack and background music better than almost every other episode of "Columbo", even though the series has always appealed to the best directors. Spielberg succeeds in preventing the great Falk and Cassidy from harassing him too much, but the two actors are always very amusing. Spielberg also receives excellent support from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All performances have a freshness and vitality. The only episode of "Columbo" that was nearly as successful is Patrick McGoohan's episode "By Dawn's Early Light" (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> I think the two episodes of "The Psychiatrist" and this episode of "Columbo" suggest that Spielberg did not evolve so much technically as a director, he was great from the beginning. a "fight!" Commenting on a DVD of a 1962 guest with Albert Salmi, Robert Altman said that this episode was about as good as it ever was as a director. maybe the same for Spielberg.
