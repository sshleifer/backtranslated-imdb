... Heads, Hands, and Feet - a band from the past, like Strange Fruit. A triple blow hard there. Those who claim to dislike this film are either heartless or under 40, and have no experience of reality. Sad for them. This is a small, remarkably well-observed image that is a great way to spend an hour or two, and will probably not fade a lot in the second performance. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as a big drummer (in many ways, the most charming figure of all), and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as a neurotic singer and singer every super performer, and Juliet Aubrey A doe eyes to accompany Karen, who tries to keep the band welded in its spectacular self-destruction. <br /> <br /> The echoes of Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson are clear and clear, Mott the Hoople rises above all in their inflated ridicule, and the script is never cursed for more than a minute. Do not compare this with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty - it's unfair to all. The closest comparison is The Commitments, and it's not a bad thing. And any film that can bring back memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I do not remember ever seeing, but the name stays alive - well, there's someone on the team who knew what they were talking about <br /> <br /> A little pleasure, and thank you for the memory. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and I have another one - Stiff Little Fingers; And what about SteelEYE Span ... TOOTH Spooky ... Ten Inch NAILS anyone? (You must see the film or have been on the road)
