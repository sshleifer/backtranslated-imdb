Anyone who is interested in pop music and does not know the trends of British music in the late seventies should be sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once. The film, about the quest of a young woman to impose itself in the world of music, sums up perfectly the time: declared sexism, difficult economic times, social upheaval, passage of pop culture from brutal punk to ferocious ferocity and pretentious futurism / new romanticism. The music and fashion styles created daily in Britain in the late 1970s are still rediscovered and recycled (there is nothing new since 1980). It was a dazzling time, and Breaking Glass tells a very personal story and examines the cultural landscape.
