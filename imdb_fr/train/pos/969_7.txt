Miike is making a children's adventure film, much like The Neverending Story. It's actually one of my favorite film directors. Even the worst Miike is better than many movies, and the Yokai Great War has many things to recommend. It's at least as loud and obnoxious as most American children's movies. I think maybe the children themselves would find their happiness there (the DVD includes an English dubbing), but, like all Miike's movies, it can tend to move very slowly. This means that you have some sort of strange inequality, where sometimes there is a noisy action sequence and the next scene drags on as the characters converse. The story itself is not very good either, and Miike's inconsistent perpetual defect raises the ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the technical side. This film must be the most expensive of Miike, and it looks fantastic. The "Yokai" are Japanese spirits. They come in different fantastic forms. The costume designers, the special effects team and everyone else involved in the design did a great job. I saw the 1968 film on which this one is supposed to be based (Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare), and the monsters in rubber suits that you can find have been transformed into more credible entities thanks to a state-of-the-art makeup and effects. I especially liked the look of one of the villains (or girls, in this case), Agi, who wears a dark eyeshadow, a tight white outfit, a white hive headdress and a whip. She is played by Chiaki Kuriyama, who you may remember as Lucy Liu's teenager in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The hero of the film is performed by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who provided votes for Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle films.
