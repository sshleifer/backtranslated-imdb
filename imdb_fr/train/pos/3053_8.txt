William H. Macy is here the friendliest and most attractive of his history. He is a loving father and a loving father who wants to retire from the family business without angering his overbearing parents. He travels a large part of the same territory as "The Sopranos" on television regarding the crisis of the criminal theme in the middle of life (here also he visits a psychiatrist) this guy then directs), an excellent script, and all around great performances. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since "Fargo". Donald Sutherland is at his best scary as a domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly fascinating dramatic twist to Macy's wife. The young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines have an ad-libbed sound and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (whom I usually find odious) is convincing as a troubled young woman who captures Macy's gaze. All this is punctuated by a moving score and a quick pace that lead to a predictable but still powerful climax and significant and touching consequences. This film deserved a much wider release, because I suspect it would have been in contact with the public.
