That's what a family movie should be! There are few films in recent years for families or children that really deserve to be watched. but it's one of them. My whole family came out of the movie, amazed, entertained, dazzled and happy. We still quote small anecdotes here and there. The kids LOVED and so did we (hubbie and myself, at 36 and 32 years old respectively)! <br /> <br /> Apart from its beautiful and striking animation, the characters (as small as they are and imaginary as they are) are very well developed. You can not understand one of them. The personalities that bring these little creatures to life are well-melted vocal talents, allied to the skills and artistry of some of Disney's best animators. It's a movie worthy of Walt Disney himself. I think Mr. Disney would warmly endorse this new movie ... Flick, Dot and their band of tiny heroes could become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our day. <br /> <br /> It's a family film. let the theater want to see again ... and buy own video or DVD. I can not wait to see him again ... to recover what I may have missed the first time. (I had never seen my children so quickly and distinctly identify with characters and kiss them ... my daughter is still talking about the little "Dot".) <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, comforting , smart and awesome. Fun for the whole family!
