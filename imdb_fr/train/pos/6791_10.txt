I support the motion to make a film, it would be great! I was also amazed by the script and character build in this game. I played it over and over again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more and more interesting. Final Fantasy devours your heart !! THIS SHOULD BE MANUFACTURED IN FILM !!!!! If anyone wants help to start a petition so that it becomes a movie, contact me. I would like to help with this project every day. The graphics are perfect for the PS1 and you even forget that it's mostly a PS1. The multitude of side quests make it different each time you play.
