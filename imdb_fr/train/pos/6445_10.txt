Beyond the excellent direction, production, play and predictable drama are a key message in the scenario: <br /> <br /> "Listening Leads All the Way" For the voice to flourish , listen. To harmonize voice, listen. To approach you, listen. To discover the needs of any situation or others, listen. It seems that screenwriters transmit a "secret of life". Listening leads to self-awareness. He awakens the other senses, especially the vision, and widens the horizon. The soul of one can also be discovered. The art of this film "As in Heaven" beautifully shows the unfolding of life, not only his joy and sadness, but also the hope of life. All this during the first instruction of the main character to the choir; <br /> <br /> "Listen to me, it leads all the way"
