Spoilers! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw a local movie critic break this movie in a 10:00 am newspaper review, I wanted to see it. I do not remember who it was or what local Omaha newspaper appeared to be criticism, but the critic was very insistent that this movie was too sordid for the average Nebraskan of the church. They showed an excerpt from the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Ann-Margret while swimming in the pool. The character of Glover congratulates her for the beauty of her body and so on, using many words that the local station has found it necessary to suppress. I became addicted. There was a problem, though. I was only 13 at the time and I had to wait a year until the cable went away. Let's just say it was worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If ever a guilty pleasure was given to me, this film is. To say that this film is suspicious would be a huge understatement. The film is centered on a successful businessman who is subjected to the blackmail of three little fools after an affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider, who is as efficient as ever, plays the poor guy who just wanted a little adventure and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrible bad guys. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time. He is sordid, funny sometimes and always on the verge of doing something crazy. Then there is the character of Robert Trebor (Leo, by the way!) Who is clearly in the head with this ploy of blackmail. It is a coward who moans and sweats, who directs a place of spectacle with models naked live. Then you have Clarence Williams III in the role of Bobby Shy, a threatening sociopath that everyone is rightly afraid of. Who could forget the alarm bells he gives to Vanity with the giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After the initial shock of realizing what he is facing, Scheider reverses the situation and takes control of the situation, until Glover attacks his wife! The conflict is brutal: almost all actors are injured, raped or exploded. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I like this film so much. That should really help me out, but it is not. It may be because these characters are all interesting and history takes a lot of risks that most movies today would never try. It is scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters, like Glover, looking for trouble. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me laugh. "Hi sport, have a good day!" <br /> <br /> This film contains many shootings, awesome cars, a good dialogue (as in my opening statement) and a decent acting game. Many cameos by real life porn stars. Search Ron Jeremy frolicking in a hot tub with two girls in a party scene at Glover. <br /> <br /> Something else that I must add: what is the temperature of women in this film ??? Wow! Travolta was right to marry Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see Vanity becoming nude in an era prior to her birth. And Ann-Margret. What else could you say about her except that she is the quintessence of American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> So says the hunting dog. <br /> <br /> Added on Feb. 14 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
