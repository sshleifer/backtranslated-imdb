I did not expect to be so touched by this film describing a family like the one you hope to live next door. They are ordinary people of flesh and blood, not like typical Hollywood dishes. They face a problem all too common: a debilitating disease. But the plot grabs the heart with a powerful lesson. The cast, the scenario, the staging and the actor's game go hand in hand with a wave that takes the viewer to the heart of the story. Give this film all your attention and its message will really inspire.
