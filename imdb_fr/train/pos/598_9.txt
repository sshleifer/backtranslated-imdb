Heres a fun fact, I was the baby in the movie, the one in the cradle. :) I'm 19 years old now. my parents took me to try for the role, we were living in Texas at the time. I think I only made $ 80, but I did not stay very long. My parents said that I would cry when I had to be happy and that I would be happy when I had to cry. I was all mixed up. Strange and funny, I suppose ... and no, I'm not a child actress. I live in San Antonio, I work at a walgreens. I graduated here in Texas, but I lived in Maryland most of my life. This film is an excellent film, good concept. I have seen it many times in my last 19 years.
