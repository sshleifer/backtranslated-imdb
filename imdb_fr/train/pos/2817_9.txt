This criticism is for the prolonged break of this film. <br /> <br /> I saw Dragon Lord for the first time when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I have always loved this movie and you can read some of the most positive reviews to get a general idea. <br /> <br /> That being said. I always found the scenario a little confusing. The film is, after all, a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that a love story ends with a 20-minute fight scene. <br /> <br /> In the extended version, this is no longer the case. The old "original" version starts with a huge barrel / rugby sequence which is the new end sequence in the extended version. The opening sequence is that of Dragon (Jackie Chan) hanging around his house and pretending to train and recite whenever his father is present. <br /> <br /> Other sequences have also been shifted or extended in the long version and the story makes a lot more sense when you look at it. The pace is also better and overall it works better. It's more like a love affair, and do not let you wonder why it ends so dramatically and dramatically as the normal version. <br /> <br /> I suggest to anyone who is movie in Hong Kong or just simply fanatical Jackie Chan to get the long version and watch the movie as it was originally intended (or at least, c I thought, why else would they do it and reorganize certain scenes? I felt like I was watching a completely new film by Jackie Chan, although most of the sequences are identical.
