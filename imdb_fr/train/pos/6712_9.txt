I love Sabrina! This is one of my favorite shows !! My favorite episodes are; the one where she turns Libby into a geek, the first episode, the real episode of love and the rest of the rest of the first series. I think the college episodes were not as good as those in high school but they were better than the last series which was horrible. Valerie was a good character because she was more complete than Jenny, but Jenny was in brilliant episodes. Hilda and Zelda were amazing and there seemed to be no explanation as to where they had gone! Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they just were not as good as his other friends.
