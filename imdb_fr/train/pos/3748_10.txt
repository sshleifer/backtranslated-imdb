I've watched it many times and plan to buy the full feature. I like Jason Steele's comedy. It's very different and unique and it's very nice. I love independent movies and this one is just great. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a talking Spoonbill named Edward. The order of events is a bit confusing, which makes this movie very interesting to watch. At first we see Edward fighting the spoons, but the attention changes then earlier in his life. It's a silly movie, but of course it's still great. I highly recommend watching this movie on www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. This is very fun. The humor may not match everyone's tastes but watch anyway. It will only take you 16 minutes of your time, and it's free. GO WATCH SPATULA MADNESS!
