I think you should be from the United States to have a lot of jokes. But if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would like this movie. Of course, you can not compare the quality of the shoot to that of the shootings, but the cameraman's trip was done on purpose. Killer tomatoes are a hundred times better than Nepalese dynamite. Just my opinion. I am sure that the French would not appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this movie is not meant for a global audience. And even if I'm not a qualified film critic, I know what I like. I could not help but laugh during the whole movie. My sides and jaw ached at the end of the film.
