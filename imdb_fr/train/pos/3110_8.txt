The third and final part of the Bourne trilogy (duh) lacks a bit in the history department, but covers it with intense action scenes! Twi in particular takes a little of his time and improves this film. <br /> <br /> The director and the star (Damon) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part because the second movie was quite ... advanced story-wise. How did they get to that? The action scenes, for once, but they also did something else, which I can not reveal because it would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, you'll notice! I find it quite funny that this adaptation of Bourne's books is the least accurate of the three films ... if it tells you something: o)
