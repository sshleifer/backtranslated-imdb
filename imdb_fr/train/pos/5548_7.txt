The visions of the wind and the waves, the silhouettes of lovers leaning against the sun do not only complete the story, they are also the story of the struggle against hardships. <br /> <br /> The actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and Pickford is brilliant his character struggles with his duties as a leader of the clan, oscillating between comedy and delicacy, here with the whip of his father imperceptibly lashing the islanders astray at church, sitting there with the cane of his guest in hand as a scepter, discussing his lover, played by Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> See if you can choose future star Leatrice Joy as a whole. I tried but I failed.
