Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a Wisguy comedy. The result is uneven, but generally fun. Keaton balances the three aspects of his main character well enough. Wantabedde is even better. A warning: George Wendt is very poor in his role of support. Otherwise, it's a nice time capsule.
