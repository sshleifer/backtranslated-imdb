Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs did it again! <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years, waiting for Kabal, an evil wizard, to kill him. Mordrid and Kabal were training together when they were kids, so Mordrid knew all of Kabal's stuff. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit confusing at first, but you quickly feel it's part of the action. I will not give the end, so go see Dr. Mordrid! <br /> <br /> I found the film very nice, because there is not much violence in the scene or sexual scenes. The film focused on the plot and that's what I like! I think the best films are those where times seem to fly. It's because you are so engrossed in the film. Dr. Mordrid is a fantastic and captivating film! I give him a 20 out of 10. To see! <br /> <br />
