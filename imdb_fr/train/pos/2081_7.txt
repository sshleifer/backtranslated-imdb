First seen on 29/08/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): A well told story about farmers in China and their rise and fight against what Mother Nature throws at them. This film is based on an award-winning novel and tells the story of a family beginning with the arranged marriage of the son with a slave. The film keeps your interest despite a somewhat hammered performance of the lead role played by Paul Muni. He chronicles Wong Long (the character played by Muni) and explains how he works the land, buys more land, ends up getting very rich, then returns to the land where he started. The relationship between him and his wife, portrayed by Luise Rainer, is the main thread of the story (apart from the country itself) and despite the obvious non-Chinese actors, it does a very good job of showing the country and its inhabitants. It is obvious that MGM used its money to create a very good epic with it at a time when they could probably afford it. The grasshopper scene is extremely well done and the rest of the film is really good, which justifies the prize for the best photography at the Oscars that year. The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it went pretty well.
