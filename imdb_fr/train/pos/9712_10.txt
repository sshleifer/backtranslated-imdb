Another criticism compared this troupe to a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also with good reason. Yet another criticism exposed the differences between comedy we like and comedy black, which also deserves to be examined. <br /> <br /> Look at all three series. In the end, all the characters are tied up and the pieces of the puzzle fall just as well as a Douglas Adams novel. The details and the subtleties are stunning. Completely post-modern. Wickedly funny and surprisingly tragic. Not for children. Not for those with thin skin or lack of objectivity. Thinking. At once literal, figurative and surreal in a troubling way. The darkest comedy I can remember. <br /> <br /> And most likely the most beautiful thing I know.
