Neil Simon has a lot of work, but it was the Odd Couple who made him famous. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw have excellent chemistry. The distribution of this film is also excellent. <br /> <br /> These are two men living together who belong to opposite planets. The scenario is bristling with humor in this situation. This had been done in some forms before. It is the one that combines everything in a very good package. <br /> <br /> Simon did another decent job, but this one is really his best job that made the rest of his work possible. It's hard to imagine that Simon ever succeeds.
