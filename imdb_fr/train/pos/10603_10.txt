I'm tired of my girls ages 4 and 5 being constantly watching Nickelodeon, Disney and others. It seems to be the same old tired cartoons that have been reinterpreted over and over again. When my daughters could not come to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted them to relax and rest for a while. I turned on the TV and looking for something different, I reversed the channels. My finger stopped surfing the channel when I heard Harvey's voice. I love all the lonely things this guy did and when I saw he was doing dubbing for a duck ... well, I could not change channels! My girls were instantly hypnotized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show TOGETHER, the more I loved it with the message that was being portrayed. It is not necessarily a defender of "gay rights", but rather of all those who have already been ostracized in their childhood for nothing. I had friends who were chosen for one thing or another ... too fat, too skinny, too feminine, being a tough guy, not being smart enough, having only one parent ... like you name it! As a rule, children can be very cruel to each other, so I was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that was actually transmitting a MESSAGE TO LIFE to its audience. My daughters already accept others as they are and do not blame them for being different. My eldest daughter actually gets up to defend her friends if they are chosen (one of them has a single mother and this little girl is often harassed - it warms my heart when Kassie defends her!). <BR /> <br /> Those of you who condemn this show because you feel it is a defender of "gay rights" or who are forced to "accept certain points of view", you have clearly and completely missed the purpose of this poignant little caricature. <br /> <br /> And if you need that to be explained to you ... well, you need more help than any TV show could ever offer.
