Peter Falk is a diverse and accomplished actor. The film is well written and the acting is like real life. For all lovers of Columbo, it is a work of superior quality. Because it shows the talent of Peter Falk. He does not play a detective, he plays a retired carpet salesman. By the time the credits start playing, you already want to see it again. The interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person watching it; the depth of its relevance will be the only thing that varies. It is unfortunate that the Hollywood liberals are only promoting coal and skin, because that is the kind of film that people in the company should be proud of. It would be a good movie to turn into a live play.
