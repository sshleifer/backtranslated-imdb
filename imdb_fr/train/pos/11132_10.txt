Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is shaken by a haunting childhood. He has a strong fear and a strong hatred of religion because of his traumatic baptism. He leaves his dishwasher job and becomes a hunter of rich people. He meets an unsuitable named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and the two for a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other. They become thieves. The two are getting closer remarkably and will soon be able to do without each other. However, there is something very important that Ratso did not tell Joe and that could destroy any hope of surviving together in the city. It's one of the greatest movies ever made. It is a heartbreaking and overwhelming portrait of men who are too lonely and who have nothing to lose from each other. Their story is devastating to watch, but ultimately it is important to see. This is one of those films where the characters are very similar to the seemingly crazy people that are sometimes found in the street. The difference is that this film is from their point of view. Their lives are shown to us and it is devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like mud, especially if we were one of those people at one time. However, the film does not try to make you feel guilty. Instead, it shows you the raw side of the hustle and bustle lifestyle. It's not a fun and easygoing lifestyle, as many Hollywood movies like MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN describe. The lifestyle of a hustler is a dirty, sandy and ugly life and it's sad that people have been degraded like Joe's character in this movie. What surprises me most in this film is that it came out in 1969 and has stood the test of time. Today's audience will always find great meaning in this film and will love and cherish it as much as the critics and the public did it everywhere in 1969. The film was rated X, but what I have noticed is that sexuality is described in a lot more honest, realistic and effective. Anyone who has ever had sex will know how funny, clumsy and scary it can be, and this film is not afraid of it. The sex in this movie may not be as graphic as we thought. X-rated movies such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, ORANGE CLOCKWORK, GREAT TUTORIES, LAST TANGO IN PARIS and FRITZ THE CAT all seem remarkably mastered over the shocking things people can get with a R rating today. The sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will look pretty strong but they are definitely not sexy. They are not graphic, but realistic, and that's what people should keep in mind when watching this movie. The course language used in the film, especially the word "queer", is used effectively and is not free. The violence is very shocking to watch even today, but again it is necessary to plot to portray the world of a hustler. I'm really happy to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and is still as touching as it was in 1969, if not more. I can not recommend this classic enough and I hope that it will continue to find an audience because it is really a very special and unforgettable experience that will not be forgotten anytime soon. <br /> <br /> THE BENEFITS: <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both heartbreaking and amazing to watch. They have never played such roles before or since, and they are completely different from the habit. You will forget who plays them in a few minutes! <br /> <br /> -Beautiful score <br /> <br /> -Not at all dated or campy as many of this decade's films end like today <br /> <br /> -Work fantastic and fast edition <br /> <br /> CONS: <br /> <br /> - For an adult audience only <br /> <br /> - The opening scenes are well prepared, but they could to be a little stronger.
