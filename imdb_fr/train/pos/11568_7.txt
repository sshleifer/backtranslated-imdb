One of the many Merrie Melodies cartoons that entertained American film buffs during the Second World War, Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time" describes a flea that settled on Elmer Fudd's dog. The little boy turns into a real sadist by settling on the dog's back, but Elmer warns him: "Another scwatch and I'll give you a bath!" Meanwhile, the chip installs dynamite on the dog! * And it's not the end! I noticed that in one scene, Elmer was reading a cartoon with Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Of course, Elmer and Bugs often shared the same star, but Elmer never shared Porky's (unless you count the short Any Bonds Today?). But for me, the idea that Elmer is reading about these famous characters of the same genre emphasizes the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew their existence in his universe even though they do not appear in this caricature. <Br/> <br /> Of course, I'm probably going too far in my analysis. I'm sure the drawing was meant to be pure entertainment and certainly entertaining. As for the line "I could end up loving this", it would seem that it was something the censors would not have allowed but that could have been missed; For my part, I do not really know what it was supposed to look like. Was it something sexual? As for the end, if I thought I had seen everything, I would have been tempted to look for more, rather than doing what the cat did (although it is a neat trick). <br /> <br /> * The guys behind these cartoons surely had a soft spot for TNT, did not they?
