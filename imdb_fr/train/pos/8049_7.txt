Overall, I would say that I liked the movie. Some fight scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One thing that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor laughing. Otherwise, Sammo perfectly copies Bruce Lee's battle movements. 5 out of 10 stars.
