"Holly" is a theme film, but he is neither manipulative nor sentimental. At its heart, it's a character-centric film that would not be as successful without the well-rounded portraits of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with gradually waking consciousness, and Holly ( Thuy Nguyen), the Vietnamese girl who is voluntary but ultimately too paired. Lively places and effective editing photography, everything is straightforward and well done. The classical contemporary score may be discouraged at first, but it is a prominent composition that underlines the admirable restraint that manifests itself everywhere. This film, which raises many issues but provides few clear answers, ultimately raises awareness and compassion for Holly and all who share her fate. Congratulations to those who managed to do it.
