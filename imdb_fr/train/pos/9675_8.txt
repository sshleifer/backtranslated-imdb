Most people may say that if you spend a Saturday night watching a movie, you really need to be bored. In fact, I had just returned home from being outside and turned on the television and that was "Paulie". <br /> <br /> I had missed the opening credits, so I did not know his name, but I saw that there was Cheech Marin in it. So I naturally thought I had listened to "Born In East L.A." When I saw him talking to a talking parrot, I was ready to consider this film as a flop that they broadcast late into the night. <br /> <br /> Happy to say it was better than that. As you know, if it's not already done, Paulie is lost and tries to find her original owner. Looks like it took years to find it. What should be Paulie's advantage is actually a disadvantage. People meet a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or profit from it. <br /> <br /> While Cheech Marin's character "earns" money, he is not mean to him. The dance sequences with parrots are something that kids will find cute, I found them fun. <br /> <br /> Paulie, who is naive, quickly learns that not all humans are nice. Especially the owner of an animal research laboratory. The man lies to him saying that he will help him find his owner as long as he helps him in his research on animal communications. Paulie is now blocked but decides to ridicule this man during a demonstration to the vocal capacities of Paulie. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paulie tells her story to the janitor of the installations, who finally releases him several times. other animals and find the location of Paulie's owner. It's a touching meeting. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the wing cutting scene should have been assumed and not shown. This part could disturb the youngest children. Otherwise, it's an excellent movie for older children and adults who care about it. (END)
