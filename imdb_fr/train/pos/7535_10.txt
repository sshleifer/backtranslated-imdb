The 700 Club offers an excellent perspective on world events. Some have described him as hypocritical or nerdy. I find the program informative and inspiring. It is natural that many are embarking on a program that has been so successful. Very few shows can report 40 years of success in the world of television media, including The 700 Club. Even though Mr. Robertson may have been wrong in saying that someone should be murdered, I find it odd that so many people literally rush in to follow the movement of criticism. I have certainly said nonsense in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson because he has an excellent show.
