Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a culture lover whose previous films have exposed the artistic excesses of the '60s and the' 80s and the '80s. With "The Notorious Bettie Page", she points her unshakeable eye on Fifties America, an era hidden in the moral justice of Joe McCarthy, while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would lead to the free love of the next decade. Harron and his co-author Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of sex-symbols. It is a film about the underground icon of an era and how its pure and unashamed sexuality has revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture unaffected by the beauty of a body bare. If the film was only about the details of Bettie's life, why finish it before his most tragic time is about to begin. Clearly, Harron is more interested in the attitudes of the United States towards sexual imagery at the time. Combined with a bold performance by Gretchen Mol and the superb atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III, it fulfills this purpose beautifully, holding a mirror of the past while making the public reflect on its own "enlightened" attitudes of the 21st century to be called pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism, it's a film more than ever necessary.
