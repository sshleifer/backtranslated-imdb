I'm a fan of animal movies. If you can take a piece of land and put the animals as main actors, you will usually win me. Homeward Bound did just that. They took a plot that was as old as time and gave it a new twist. It was a complete success. It's really an archetypal movie. You have the obi-wan of the group (the shadow) who is wise and logical, you have the adorable but impetuous and unsuspecting luck, and the Princess Prissy who thinks she should be pampered and praised. These three personalities come together very well. I also like the way they created Lucky and Sassy characters as dynamic, without delaying it. Most people say it can not be good because it's too much of a children's movie. What they forget, however, is that it would be a children's movie, which still does not detract from the actual movie. It's a good movie to watch when you're bored and you just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie without cartoons, an air bubble movie with a better plot. I would definitely advise you to watch it.
