Robert Bloch has written four stories about various people living in an old and beautiful manor and what is happening to them. The first to Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the murderer on which he writes was born. Some phantasmagorical moments and the twist in the end was good. Peter Cushing became obsessed with a wax figure that looks like his dead wife. The third has Christopher Lee who has a child (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of her. All of this leads to a pretty scary end (although the end of the story was MUCH worse). The last is a comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both juggling the landscape) and a cloak that turns people into vampires! Christopher Lee also plays in Dracula. <br /> This is a good anthology of horror - nothing terrifying except the first and the end of the third gave me only a few nice thrills. Plus, the fourth is really funny and Pitt makes a VERY sexy vampire! Also the house itself is beautiful ... and very scary. It is well directed with some nice touches of atmosphere. A very good and unusual movie score too. All in all, it's a good little anthology of horror that deserves to be explored. Try to see it on DVD - the Lions Gate one is fantastic with bright colors and superb sound.
