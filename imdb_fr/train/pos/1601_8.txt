It's a pretty simple film, not very active but very charming. There were times when I understood why Cher had won the Academy Award for Best Actress, but at other times I wondered why Glenn Close did not win for Fatal Attraction. Be that as it may, Cher and Oscar won at the Golden Globes, and Cher named to BAFTA, plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low-paying job at the request of Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). He promises that he will be back in a month, because his mother is sick. She means that her family should attend the wedding as much as possible. The only problem is that when she finds Johnny's brother without hands, Ronny (Nicolas Cage, named in the Golden Globe), they start to have a love relationship and the love continues on this lunar scene (hence the title derives its origin). In addition, Vincent Gardenia was nominated for Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe won Olympia Dukakis in the role of Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. He won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay, Script Written Directly on Screen, and was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Movie, as well as BAFTA for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and he was nominated Golden Globes for Best Movie - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay. It was the number 96 on 100 years, 100 quotes ("Snap out of it!"), The number 17 on 100 years, 100 Passions and the number 41 on 100 years, 100 laughs. Very well!
