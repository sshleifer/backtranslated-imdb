We tend to forget that the master / slave context of past centuries has led to well-maintained areas, fed by large slave groups and a lot of money for white homeowners. This led to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from the interference of slave owners with their female slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these children simply became more and more slaves, and others free ... but free and colorful, which at the time meant something other than, compared to the fate of their children. bulls. <br /> <br /> A class formed around this offspring - people of free color or free people of color - and this class could, to a certain extent, possess property, rise from the oppressed to the educated and to achieve a comparative dignity. That is, they were not slaves, but they were still exploited to a certain extent. <br /> <br /> Often women lived as masters of the white plantation masters and men of fortune own houses, with allowances, paid schooling for their children and a kind of kindness, dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their family. Essentially, they prostituted themselves for their own prosperity and relative independence from work. An arrangement called plating. <br /> <br /> All Saints Day is a wonderfully written story about the children of such a woman, the result of such an arrangement with a local gentleman and the people who touched their lives, in a negative way and positive. The tale opened my eyes as New Zealanders, with no real black / white line design, not to mention the gray area in the middle where the free-colored people walked cautiously. <br /> <br /> The characters are very three-dimensional and have been well rendered in this adaptation of the novel by Anne Rice. The roles are well done, the costumes are beautiful and the brutal way of drawing the lines, with the fuzzy areas made even more distinct by the conflicts that the protagonists go through. Free-color people could not marry whites, slaves could not help themselves, and whites, even the most compassionate, could not stand the economic reality of entitling people which they depended on. <br /> <br /> I recommend this story, the novel and miniseries, to everyone, without reservation. If you can not handle the truth, you will crack through some parts, because one injustice after another is inflicted on the color, both by their white oppressors and by their own people. Remember, however, that this is nothing more than reality and that this story is an exciting way to learn it. <br /> <br /> I know it may sound hard, but this miniseries entertained me and fascinated me, despite the sour taste that I found in my mouth to what happened, and I really appreciated. Look at this. If not read on the period, because there is a lesson to be learned from all this.
