Unique film about a confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) involved in crooks. Joe Mantegna gives a performance of Oscar caliber as the most slippery of the group. Absolutely enchanting from the beginning, while Mantegna shows Crouse "the tricks" of his scammers. The story unfolds a little later, but remains a unique representation of an innocent man caught in a dark world. It's really worth it.
