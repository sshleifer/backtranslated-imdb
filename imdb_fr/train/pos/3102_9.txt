I saw The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend and, wow! I had already seen the first two films and I liked them, but Ultimatum, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a CIA agent suffering from amnesia who is on the run, trying to find out who he is. As I said before, I loved this movie from beginning to end, no plot holes, slow scenes, everything went as planned and it worked well with the other films, but in all the senses of the term, it was much better. <br /> <br /> The best stunts, car chases, actors and effects I've seen in an action movie all summer, (surprisingly because of Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.). ). Not just action in this movie, Jason does not just kill and run. He has a soul and the public feels for him, the drama is included. But that does not slow him down. <br /> <br /> Of all the "three queens" of last summer, it was the best.
