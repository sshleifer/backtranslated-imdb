I have never seen a film provoke such a debate in my life. Believe me, I will say that this film will be remembered as a classic of all time. I was looking forward to this movie because I already loved Lock, Stock ... and Snatch, but after some negative reviews, I thought I was very disappointed. I absolutely loved this movie and can not wait to see it again. This film is totally different from the two aforementioned Ritchie films, and also much better. I have the choice of my favorite filmmakers, but none of them have made as successful a turn as Guy Ritchie has done with this film. I think he pushed filmmaking to another level (I know most people will laugh at this comment and they will guess the reaction of this film, but I think time will prove me right). This film is very confusing and lasted much longer than about 2 hours, because I could not help thinking about it or trying to put things together. I now have a fairly good view of everything that's going on in this movie (responses to long hours of reflection, responses from reading other people's views on the film) and I can not wait until Sunday when I see him again. I just hope people go to the movies with an open mind and they will be rewarded like me and many others.
