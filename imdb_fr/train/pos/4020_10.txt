Pinjar by Mr Dwivedi is a great movie. This is without a doubt the biggest and most beautiful of 2003. There is very good performance. Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila. she's like you've never seen before. a real great performance. with her, a good actor, Manoj Bajpai, who showed Bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) living in Pakistan before the score. she comes from a Punjabi family living in a small town. She was kidnapped by a Muslim in a fight that has been going on for years with the Punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and the arranged marriage of urmila is due in a few days. this film is really a very good movie. the scenario is solid with an astonishing scenario. all the performances like lillete dubey, isha koppikar (you can not believe but it can as well act as the dancin juice on khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many others. these sets with pre-partition pakistan, costumes, cinematography, sound, background score add to the positives. From beginning to end, you sat down to the next question. this movie is not just to watch but deserves to be part of your movie collection. the ultimate scene is the end of the movie. I would suggest to all these No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai spectators to watch this incredible movie. my rating: 10/10.
