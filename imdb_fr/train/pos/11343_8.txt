I remember seeing it on TV in the late 70's - and it stayed with me! It's charming, noisy, colorful - a great children's movie. I put it on a party recently for friends - and of course, they thought I was crazy and was expecting something sick for the puppets at "Meeting with the weak", but no, that's it. is a pure and pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is in great shape, just like Mama Cass, and the attractive wizard poop. <br /> <br /> If you like the banana that splits and you're in your thirties, it will recreate this surreal childhood on Saturday morning. atmosphere! <br /> <br /> Even though I now realize that Puf himself is a bit lame - all he does is get caught and run away! A quality TV movie - if, like me, you like death metal, you'll love it!
