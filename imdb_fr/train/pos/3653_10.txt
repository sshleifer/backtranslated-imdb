Why a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley in this banal movie ??? !!! The cast is performing well (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a motherless daughter, and Justin Whalin, a guy who is eternally diminished by her boredom), but the management is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original. I can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (the producer): are you crazy ??? !!!
