CINEMA GUIDE (2007) **** <br /> <br /> If loving cinema makes me perverted, so be it <br /> <br /> If you're a real movie buff like me then I I'm sure you can not get tired of enough movies about making a movie and I'm not necessarily talking about dry documentary. I'm talking about a total talk about the movie viewing experience. Well, if that's the case, I have a cinematic experience for you. <br /> <br /> In Sophie Fiennes (Ralph & Joseph's sister if you asked for it), the film philosopher and film buff, Slavoj Zizek, presented his analysis of cinema with an impressive (and often scandalous) approach, from the silent era of Chaplin to the modern era of the Wachowski Brothers, analyzing, probing and pontificating the psychosexual fundamentals, the socio-economic, political and of course indefinable magic of cinematographic experience with his unfailing dissertations, determined and almost frantic. Explain how The Bates House in PSYCHO is actually the mirrored psyche of the Norman Bates conflict with each level as its Ego, Superego & Id is one thing, but suggest the same thing for every Brother Marx in one beat a test of remarkable faith that seduces the skeptical layman. <br /> <br /> Even though I did not know who Zizek was? it looks like a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese ?? with his sibilant tongue and passion, the host presents himself as a mad prophet. <br /> <br /> Fiennes cleverly inserts Zizek in several of the backgrounds of film clips sprinkled with a humorous tone, while letting havoc and deliriums continue unabated to give pause in three acts covering all the range of Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock films and films as diverse as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES and FIGHT CLUB. <br /> <br /> There is something for all tastes and if only one man can cause a debate or at least a reason to discuss the themes of a film ?? even if they are Freudian / Jungian to a fault ?? so I say that this collection of movie theories is worth a look. Look for it now if you can before switching to home video; it's the only way to appreciate it.
