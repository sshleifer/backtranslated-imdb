This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie and in an interview, Jackie said it was his favorite too. It contains incredible stunts and breathtaking combat sequences, as well as some very fun scenes. This film was a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used plays in Rapid Fire and was also filmed in Tango and Cash, which used some of the opening scenes. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays the role of a policeman in Hong Kong. The story begins immediately in a fantastic pursuit through a slum and continues as Jackie slips on a hill and gets on a bus in motion to catch the evil Ku (who is one of the biggest villains of all movies of Jackie Chan.) very entertaining scenes as Jackie tries to balance his duty as a policeman with his girlfriend, played by Maggie Chung. His job is to protect Ku's secretary, who has enough information to shoot him, but even that poses many problems. Jackie is at his best here. The last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone - quite simply. It was the most intense fight I have ever seen Jackie doing and peaking on a pole in the middle of explosions of light. All in all, one of his biggest stunts he made and left him with a scarlet skin. He was lucky not to be electrocuted because the person in charge of the cascade was using high voltage instead of a lower voltage. <br /> <br /> In total, another classic of Chan and certainly one of his greatest films. At the end of this film, you can say that he does not care about anything, nor do his stuntmen. So many stuntmen were injured during this movie that no one assured them anymore - Jackie had to take responsibility herself. There are no gadgets, wires or substitutes - it's all a real action that's a treat to watch. It is this type of action that makes it the phenomenon that it is and it is a film that will amaze people in 100 years. If you have not seen this movie and are a fan of Jackie Chan or action in general, treat yourself and watch this movie. It's really sensational.
