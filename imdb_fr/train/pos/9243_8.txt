Do not listen to the many sharp and derisory comments that this film has generated ..... simply, as far as ninja movies are concerned, this is my best friend! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, yes, the acting and the scenario are certainly absolutely atrocious, but by eraser, it's so much fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Movies, the appalling "game" (which in the case of the movie in question is really among the worst I've ever had the joy of seeing!) And a "plot "ridiculous only serves to raise the level of pleasure by 10 times. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the fight scenes are the main attraction of this film and, for the most part, I have the pleasure to say, they are very well choreographed, especially the final showdown (during which we find that ninja are not ostensibly limited by the normal laws of gravity ....) <br /> <br /> Trust me, if you're a fan of ninja movies and you have not seen Sakura Killers yet, so you really miss what I think is one of the crown jewels of the genre.
