That's what the musical genre was made of. Humor, talent, romance and action are one. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. Nothing else needs to be said. Marlon Brando, although not a singer, did a great job and won the hearts of many with his interpretation of Sky Masterson. The fact that he can not sing added to his character. The ladies of the movie were fine, but the men of the film had definitely stolen the show. <br /> <br /> It's a real classic that can be enjoyed at any age. It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Decidedly, a movie to watch and enjoy!
