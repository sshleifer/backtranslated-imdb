FUTZ is the only preserved show of New York's experimental theatrical movement in the 1960s (originally Off Off Broadway). Although it's not for everyone, it's a truly brilliant, dark and funny story, even more disturbing about love, sex, personal freedom and revenge, a serious moral narrative even more at a time when Congress wants to ban gay marriage by sacking our Constitution. History is not a story of homosexuality, it is a story of love and sex that does not conform to social norms and must be eliminated by violence and hatred. On the surface, he tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, but about something bigger: a stifling conformity in America . <br /> <br /> The theatrical version has gained international renown in its original production. She toured the United States and Europe and, along with others, influenced almost all the theaters that followed. Fortunately, we have kept the show here pretty much as it was originally designed, with cast and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway) . <br /> <br /> This is not an easy-to-take mainstream studio film - it's an aggressive, disturbing, glorious, deeply emotional, extremely imaginative story you'll never forget. And that could change the way you see the world ...
