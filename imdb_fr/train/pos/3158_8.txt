There are too many new styles of the sitcom, but the one that works best is the traditional method with an audience and an interior decor. This show of the 70s is a great example. When the show aired, no one really heard about Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp, let alone teenagers played beautifully by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both leave the series this year to pursue other interests). I would like Topher to stay because the series started about his character, Eric, and his circle of friends. Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time. Remember, when John was in love with Diana Hyland of Eight Is Enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. The actors have never been known to us, which is a good thing because a famous actor can spoil them. Mo Gaffney, who plays girlfriend Joanne, misses me. Lisa Robin Kelly misses me as an original Laurie, the alternate could not match her and I'm sorry for that. I liked Tommy Chong's cast as a figure of Steven Hyde's lost but beloved father. I loved watching Tanya Roberts alongside Charlie's Angels. I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mother. She really showed off her acting talent before heading to Broadway. This show was a delight with many surprises. I hope this show will last longer even though 2 cast members are leaving, but I hope they will not stay too far away. I wish that the creators of the series, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite series, Third Rock from The Sun, have more success on Fox than on NBC who sabotaged their series. The Turners are not draws and I hope they will create other series like this in the future.
