Time is the future and for many people who are not aware, this day is now. In this latest film for the legendary actor, Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a historical classic. Many film buffs and ecologists think this is our final story. The film is based on the novel "Make room, make room", but the title has been changed to "Solent Green". History is about Earth as it moves towards the future, with the planet's environmental problems becoming a disaster. The planet's natural resources have been depleted and staple foods have been reduced to mere staple foods. They come in a variety of colors, such as Yellow Solent, Red Solent, and now "Solent Green". However, there are those who know the "real" ingredient of Solent Green and struggle for their own guilt and fear divine retaliation. The first is a director of nutrition named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). Upon his death, a dedicated police detective, Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston), searches for the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although the corruption is at the highest level, it begins with Simonsons' bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Chief Security Officer Donnovan (Roy Jenson), who are targeting Thorn for a garbage disposal plant. Thorn's Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes his suspicions, but warns him against the "hottest and hottest" who want the case to be filed, but Thorn does not risk his "Job" for an easy exit. What Thorn discovers the mark of death, but waits, like the film, a last warning. ****
