The first time I saw this film at the theater in a foreign film festival, I found it intriguing, fascinating, the bi-sexual sensitive artist. So very European, so very Dutch! I recently rented it for a second viewing, and I could not help but laugh at the overwrought theme of the mad writer at the persecution complex based on religious and sexual orientation. Have a hold! This guy is an independent, living society. I suspect that the real reason he's having these fantasy nightmares about the "spider woman" is that his guilt complex is at stake after ignoring for years his mother's advice about getting into a car (and in bed) with strangers! Not only does he make outrageous amounts of loot (probably tax-free) to invent stories (trip of guilt liar), but it is too cheap to pay for a haircut, where he jostles the owner of the beauty salon . Then he has the nerve to complain about the bill! But I also suspect that the world has changed a lot since this film was shot. On a serious note, it was amusing to see some of Jan de Bont's camera work and one of Paul Verhoeven's previous films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed so much after all?
