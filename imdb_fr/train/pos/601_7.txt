I was surprised by the low rating given to this film by viewers. I saw him late one night on TV and it was instead - I actually think it was in 1989 when he first appeared. Still, I remember it pretty well, with a twist or two and an interesting atmosphere in a wind farm. Michael Pollard seems aptly bewildered for his role, which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled promise of his career, and everyone plays it bluntly. I really recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which seemed a bit upset in 1989, may now seem tame, which is a shame, since contemporary "nervousness" is often simply used as an indispensable marketing tool, a bit like claiming just to get noticed.
