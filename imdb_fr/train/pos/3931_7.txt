A somewhat fictitious biographical portrait of the early years of Abraham Lincoln, directed by director John Ford, focusing mainly on a trial in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder. <br /> <br /> The film offers an interesting portrait of this important American citizen figure and the film is well done, but seems somewhat incomplete without any of the highlights of his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intention was to portray Lincoln as a young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become. But the result for me is that even though I admired the performance, it was just not as satisfying as I thought, but with greater reach. <br /> <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln, we have Henry Fonda who effectively displays a quiet force. Fonda's performance includes gangrenous mannerisms and other assignments that portray Lincoln's performance quite well, particularly when combined with effective makeup and costumes that are sometimes a little too revealing. <br /> <br /> is solid and, surprisingly, does not include as many members of Ford's secondary distribution (sometimes called its stock company), but we do have Ward Bond, one of the actors the most prolific in Hollywood. Bond has appeared in more than one of AFI's top 100 films than any other actor, both in the original list and in the revised list. He also appeared in 11 nominees for Best Picture. <br /> <br /> The film presents a scene that seems to have inspired a similar scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird", where it would unfold even better. is here, even if this scene is one of the most effective of this film.
