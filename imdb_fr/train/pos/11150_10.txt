I sat down to watch "Midnight Cowboy" thinking it would be another old film from the 60s and 70s. Some of my favorite movies come from the 70s, in the same vein as "Midnight Cowboy" ("Taxi Driver", "Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park", etc.), but there are many overestimates. well who have gained a strong reputation among critics for their innovation - unfortunately, a vast majority of them do not stand up as well today. I feel a bit like that about "Easy Rider". (Although it's also one of my favorites.) <br /> <br /> So I did not expect a lot of "Midnight Cowboy", but I recovered a lot. It's a touching story, well done and well told with some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, in the role of Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives one of his best assets - it's sometimes a little funny (he looks like a cartoon character - maybe because of the connection between Lenny and "Simpsons"), but Hoffman is quite convincing. Half of the film's budget was spent on his salary, as he was becoming a major star in Hollywood. In front of him, Jon Voight, who is in second place, is Joe Buck, the "cowboy" who goes from North to Big Apple in the hope of becoming a prostitute. Soon, his naive manners are causing him trouble and he is associated with a crippled scammer named "Ratso" - who proposes to become Joe's "manager" for a certain percentage of the profits. <br /> <br /> The film is quite long. at two o'clock but never really seems very long. Some movies may tend to hang around, especially some of the movies made in the 70s, because (as it was said in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"), filmmakers were movie stars in the 1970s and sometimes a not too keen on their material, spending too much time looking at characters / scenes / etc. it does not matter. The drug festival seemed a little too long and useless. It gives the impression that the film is extremely outdated (similar to the drug odyssey in "Easy Rider") and really hurts its course because it is not necessary. <Br/> <br /> Other than that, "Midnight Cowboy" is a nearly flawless movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It has its flaws (the flashbacks are a bit sticky and are never used as well as they could have been, for example) and some scenes are a bit annoying (like the gay movie sequence), but if you can managing its "Midnight Cowboy" content is an excellent film, an uncompromising review of street life in the late '60s and early' 70s. It's a depressing movie, yes, and by today's standards, it may seem a little outdated and weigh heavily in the liberal perspective of "life is horrible, etc." ... but I still love it and especially the extremely touching end will stay with me for a very long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best movies of the 70s. (It was technically released at the end of 1969, but I still classed it as a 1970s movie. He also won the Oscar for Best Picture, being the first - and only - X-rated cinematographic film to do so, then re-evaluated on appeal.) <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5
