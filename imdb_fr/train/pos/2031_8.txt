Such a masterpiece was the first of these two Snowy River movies, the sequel to The Man from Snowy River is all that should be tracked. He does not walk on the feet of his predecessor, preferring to leave the legend that was the first living film in a unique immortality. <br /> <br /> Snowy River II's Man is based on Jim Craig's return to Snowy River after a three-year absence. The film subtly tells a story of change in the nineteenth century, Australian history, legend and horses. The plot shows a hint of Hollywood in lighter tones, an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film, but it merges with the unique sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is much more dynamic than the first film, and much more spectacular, with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film, but The Man From Snowy River II has all the essential features of the first film; sensational cinematography, an amazing home from the highlands of Australia, the second most impressive sequence of horses ever filmed, and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack from Bruce Rowland, who is first in all respects. Geoff Burrowes has done a remarkable job with this film, which deserves our thanks, especially for the quality of the Australian film industry. The lead actors, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton, and Brian Dennehy, well replaced, take their roles with as much passion and distinction as the first film. As far as possible, The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; a deeply moving and inspiring experience again.
