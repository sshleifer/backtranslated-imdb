I read most of the reviews here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that September 11 is a shocking piece of history. There are few who think that the added story is weak and I agree that the story is weak and useless. About two brothers who ended up after the disaster and cliff support about Tony. But I do not think that narration is useless. Like many theorists, I think our own lives are narrations. We live and make our own autobiography. So, if we talk about our lives, it's always in the form of narration. We do not summarize facts such as: birth, childhood, high school, etc. We create a story about our life. <br /> <br /> Because we know stories, we also want to put history in a story. . Because in the form of a story, we can identify ourselves. We can better understand what happened in the story when it is told in the form of a story. It is therefore the goal to add a story in a documentary. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand what is happening. If it were me outside, I would be worried about my brother. <br /> <br /> And the second point, make a hit movie about it. It is true that it is too recent to propose a great film on September 11th. However, there have been some on the subject, but none of them like this documentary. But what will happen if there will be a movie in about 5 years? I agree that it is wrong to try to make a lot of money with 9/11. But I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell the story. How many films about the Second World War have we seen? If I had not seen these films, my vision of the world war would be totally different. I remember seeing Schindlers List and I cried for an hour in class. The films give you a good picture of what has happened in history and, although it is a fiction, it contributes to the memory of disasters and victims. <br /> <br /> My point is this: telling stories is not always bad, it allows us to identify with the story and never forget what happened.
