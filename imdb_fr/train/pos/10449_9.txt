I had never heard of this film a few weeks ago, but its concept interested me when I heard it: an American met a European woman on her last night in Europe and they spent the night together to discuss. This aroused my interest, but I did not expect it to be so good. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and it's also one of the most romantic movies ever recorded. To my surprise, the cynicism of the 1990s was completely missing. It's impossible to really talk about it much, because there's no real plot, so to speak (although there are a lot of very interesting things you could talk about, it's a bit like My dinner with Andr√©, where there is a conversation, but it's not just the conversation that counts), but let me just say, see it. TO HAVE!
