A regular film well done with a tragic end. Strengths: The way the story evolves begins with Soorya who has a hard time living, followed by a long look back at the reason for her presence. The music. Selfless look at the life of the police. Weaknesses: Violence and composure, but I imagine they add to the realistic effects. It would have been possible, however, to have the head sliced ​​and shipped in boxes and bags. <br /> <br /> Nothing to complain about - 7/10
