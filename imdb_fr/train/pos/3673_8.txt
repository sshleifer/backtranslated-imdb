In 2004, I saw "True", the contribution of Tom Tykwer in Paris I love you. When I saw it, I loved it and I was moved. It became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format. Of course, I wanted to watch the whole movie and even check who was attached, etc. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I finally saw it, courtesy of the internet. <br /> <br /> First of all I have to say is that it looks awesome. The photography is BEAUTIFUL in every short and shot, the worst being nothing special - but always bright and clear. Later, I read the anecdotes here, and maybe that's how the 6K scan makes more justice for all the work of the DP. My favorites are the first scene "The banks of the Seine" (the sunlight!), The Sin City-esquire (but it's better for me) "Quartier Madeleine" and "14th Arrondissement" - but you know what the hell! like all: "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" always makes me nervous with these bright colors (my eyes are shaking!) and "Latin Quarter" is gold imprisoned in money. Magnificent. <br /> <br /> Yes, they are beautiful shorts. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the content. I appreciate very much (and I hear VERY MUCH) this eclecticism so well felt. You've never had the same themes or the same treatment between two short films, and I think the formula is restrictive enough to allow all of these artists to explore beautiful and in-depth things inside the shorts. I loved going from a simple love story to a crazy Chinese musical in Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder, and then to a social commentary in a terrorist comedy in the form of a humble monologue. I love surprises! And this film has them! It's great that they have given all these directors the chance to shape things that are not usual in traditional cinema (which I'm despising heavily). It's not very experimental, but I can breathe the breathing space that these people had. <br /> <br /> I like the time spent and I like the acting. I like simplicity and I love love. I like simple feelings, beauty and eclecticism and, in general, it's a very very nice film to see, alone or with someone. Just feel. I felt very good. <br /> <br /> There is something serious about it ... it's so straightforward ... <br /> <br /> What I did not like? Well, for me, there are two short films that are not exactly the best - "Quays of the Seine" (which is good-natured, of course, and maybe even necessary, but too much of an advertisement?) And "PÃ¨re-Lachaise" who Even though I like to play, I felt that his themes were forced. But of course, it's just me. "Eiffel Tower" I also did not like, but I think it's probably because of my sensitivity very different from that of Sylvain Chomet? I do not know if this movie has a particular interest for people who already know the actor and directors, and so they can feast in their interaction, in surprises (look for Alexander Payne in a fun role) and basically in this director will do with that? "Great question, I appreciate it a lot in this way. <br /> <br /> I repeat: most of the shorts I've loved are a beautiful and energetic mix, so I really recommend it. So, look at it if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!
