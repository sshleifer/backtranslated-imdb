In Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy discuss who was stronger, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often discuss who would win a fight too. Sometimes we become absurd and compare types like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now, it seems like we're talking about guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a useless comparison to see Lee's dead, but it's fun. And if you trust what we saw from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you must at least say that it would be a good match against Chan. In this film, he presents himself as a god of martial arts. <br /> <br /> Black Mask tells the story of a man who was created with many other men to be a supreme fighting machine. Their only goal is to win wars that other people lose. They are invincible in some ways. This is the principle of the film, but it allows you to create all the incredibly choreographed combat scenes. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a marvel. He can do things with and for his body that no human being should be able to do. And that's what makes it so much fun. <br /> <br /> Besides the martial arts in the film, Black Mask is very humorous, because of the chemistry that Jet has with his co-star, police officer. They are good together. But to be honest. if anyone reads this review, he wants to know if the movie is child's play in the action department. And the answer to this question is a resounding YES! Heaps and tons of stupid and bloody action. You will love this movie.
