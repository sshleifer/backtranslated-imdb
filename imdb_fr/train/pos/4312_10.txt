If you have not seen this great movie about life in the 90s (in Latin America), you missed a special treat. It's one of the most amazing and powerful movies ever made about the lives of Americans in the 90s and it even has an impact on the world today. It covers everything from raising children to preventing love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, egoism, etc., etc. This story has reached its peak and when nothing else matters, it always comes back to love with friends and family and the love of life. It helps us dig deeper into ourselves and make us search for what we want from life. Forcing us to ask questions to ourselves. Have we done enough for others, do we like that, etc.? Sit back and enjoy a wonderful and emotional movie that I'm sure others will enjoy all their lives. <br /> <br /> Take note of the wonderful performance of Mary Mcdonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover through this film. These actors are incredible and really show the true glow and meaning of the message sent to us. These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after watching this movie more than 10 years ago now. I always appreciate it again and again. Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack and do not forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly and try to understand that this is the symbolism of the movie? Hmmm ... I almost forgot that this is probably Steve Martin's very first acting role in any movie he's ever done. He too does a great job in this movie. This can be a surprise for most of you. Sit back, relax and enjoy a real good movie .....
