As a person who has rated Night of the Living Dead at number three in his top five favorite movies of all time, while loving this parody of student film, I feel I have to defend this film against critics previously published scathing. This short but sweet opus has always been a show for horror and sci-fi film marathons where those attending like the genre, but know how not to take zombie movies too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. He wants to be funny, and many others who I heard singing and applauding agree with me that it's a success. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD more than 50 times. Watch for the director's poet Jeff Drexel, and if you have the opportunity to catch his parody Alien, Loaf.
