I love Malle's documentaries. They are so simple and effortless but still fascinating. I do not know why this documentary works. This is Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing really happens. But Malle still manages to make it fascinating and interesting. His love for humanity, even racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you can not help but fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Malle shot almost everything in 1979. He returned six years later to see what had changed. It would have been a good movie without the material 6 years later, but this small addition makes it great. It may seem as though Malle was doing just what was done in the Up series but in fact it is not. The Up series is about people. Malle does not focus so much on what happened to each person as on what happened to that community. And the change is great. 1985 is the Reagan era and farmers are suffering. Once a proud community, no one now sees much future and parents hope their children will educate themselves and do something else than agriculture. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very relevant today. Our financial crises started today because of what was happening at the time. Take a look at these last words of the film, pronounced by a former lawyer of the city (in 1985): <br /> <br /> "I have high hopes for this country, because things are happening Now, I can only characterize in my mind an obsession with greed, and a nation does not live long with this obsession, and especially a democracy that ... There is - there is - a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they are not going - they are not going to subscribe to this philosophy of greed going on now.That's horrible. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it took more of 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happens.
