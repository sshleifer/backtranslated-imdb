The life of Man In The Moon is a breathtaking experience. The acting was fabulous, the script was fantastic, and it was a perfect start to Reese Witherspoon's career. I do not do it. is not the best movie of all time, even if it was close, but it was very fun to watch, and I even had a big laugh at one of the jokes, and many other little ones laughter. Of course, there have been moments that make your heart cry, but this film has been rewarding and illuminates your day, even if you have to be a little depressed by the story from time to time. I do not think this film has won at least one prize, nor can I believe it has been seen by so few people on this site. See this film if you have not seen it, it's really touching.
