I think people underestimate this incredible movie. People see it as a typical horror movie designed to scare us and stop us from getting a little sleep. Which, if he tried to do it, would deserve a 1/10 but I watched this movie with some friends and we found it very entertaining and even if it was a good movie after all, Stephanie beaton. That's why I think it deserves 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film. <br /> <br /> The general opinion about this movie is that it has a bad acting cast, a simple storyline that lasts 10 years old could produce and that it can not be taken seriously and people note it down for this reason. But I see this as a completely entertaining masterpiece ... that has a funny hilarious scenario made even more fun by the actors and although not serious, it's very entertaining.
