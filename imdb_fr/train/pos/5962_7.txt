Over the years, I've seen a lot of 80s rocker horrors, ranging from trash like "Terror on Tour" to ridiculously fun jewels like "Slumber Party Massacre 2". In one way or another, I managed to keep it at bay, which is strange because it is probably the most popular and best received. Well, I finally caught up with it and it's easily the best of this sub-genre especially horrible (but almost always endearing!). The plot (which was almost lifted in the movie "Black Roses") is about Eddie, a fool with checks, all students of his high school mock for his taste for music. He loves the metal of the 80s, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by Tony Fields). After the murder of Sammi, the DJ of Eddie's favorite radio gives him the last recording of Sammi. Once Eddie plays the disc upside down, he discovers that he is a little harder and that bad things start to happen to those who taunt him. Is Sammi's music possessed? "Trick or Treat" is well done and totally fun. The special effects are great, even if they have the typical laser beams of the 80s. I grew up in the 80s and, although I'm not a fan of heavy metal, I remember the urban legend of play a disc upside down hearing the sounds of Satan worshiping. Haha! I also remember that my older brothers and sisters and neighbors told me that KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan. So it's very funny to see them make cameos as a harmless radio DJ and anti-rock priest. If only I had seen this movie as a kid! While the film seems to mock the popular connection in the 1980s between the alleged cult of the devil and heavy metal, the viewer never really understands why Sammi Curr is back from death, causing havoc and killing anyone who across his path. This is the weakest point of the film, but if you can forget it, it's very funny.
