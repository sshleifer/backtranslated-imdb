The freedom to have your own Sea Going motorboat, the excitement of underwater adventures like a tough man, an adventurous man and adorable (and so well-endowed!) Assistants In beautiful bikinis were all undeniable assets for "SEA HUNT" (1958-1961). <br /> <br /> This is precisely what motivated the creation of a kind of series of "firearms". Let's look carefully now. There must be some clues. <br /> <br /> If we look back, we see the production of RKO Radio Pictures by UNDERWATER! (1955). She starred Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive scuba diving adventurers working on rescue in the Caribbean, including a pre-Fidel Cuba. The film had a moderate success and was memorable, not necessarily for its history, nor for the appearance of directors in swimsuits. Fine and elegant women wearing swimwear 2 pieces (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Really exciting are always an advantage for guys; and the presence of sturdy sportsmen and sportsmen displaying their best "poses" of beef is also a pleasure for the Gals. <br /> <br /> And there is one element that is a true legacy of this ancient RKO trait. It's on the soundtrack contained between the queues and the musical themes. This is the recording of "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White", written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and performed by Damaso Perez Prado and his orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone hearing this Insturmental or this song (with words) will not forget it anytime soon. Its Caribbean rhythm is very lively and its rich use of the brass section of the orchestra is powerful and instantly makes an instant impression and memory. This song's 45-rpm record was rated among the top 10 most popular songs of the week several Saturday nights on NBC TV's "YOUR HIT PARADE". We can not remember the number of weeks or the height. (Maybe someone could tell us about this article, please!) So we went back to "SEA HUNT" and his own odyssey to get "The Tube". The audience had taken to UNDERWATER! Very good, but would they choose a TV show? <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions was famous for producing a type of product that, for the most part, had not been signed by the networks. for multi-station connection processing. But they had great success with TV syndication. ** By this we mean to offer a series of stations for broadcast on a television channel, for each market area. (A bit like the various newspaper unions "sell" comics to various newspapers in the country and even the world. <br /> <br /> So we had Mike Nelson, himself, in Lloyd Bridges' physical presence. Mr. Bridges had been around for about fifteen years and had performed memorable performances in essentially diverse roles in two Boston Blackie films (with Chester Morris) with THEY STOOGE TO CONGA (3 Stooges, 1943). SAHARA (also in 1943), HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949) and THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). <br /> <br /> Lloyd brought a very convincing way to his characterization, as well as a beautiful athletic physique and convincing, looking like a guy who earns a living with his physical abilities. He took the role of a diver very well, whether he's doing a ship or diving the sea. <br /> <br /> And Lloyd did it ... take the role quickly, but contra he was not familiar with SCUBA *** before he won this Mike Nelson concert. But Mr. Athletic, Mr. Bridges, was quick, as so many underwater shots revealed there was no doubt about it, it was Lloyd with the mask, the bubbler and the palms. . <br /> <br /> Stories almost always involved helping a client pay, much like a private investigator would do. And if the customer was a lovely lady who looked good in a swimsuit, so much the better. <br /> <br /> Like so many other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV productions, "SEA HUNT" had a fine, haunted opening and closing theme, with music and queues. <br /> <br /> At one time, I thought that "SEA HUNT" was the best television series ever signed, a success that the ZIV series had previously known as "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". Regarding the location of this underwater saga, here in Chicago, it aired late at night (after 10:30 pm) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our subsidiary NBC, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I just remember who was the original sponsor on this particular market. And there were even commercials on stage made by the Star! We can remember and imagine Lloyd as Mike Nelson aboard his motorboat. And as we were invited back next week to watch "..... another" SEA HUNT "adventure, sponsored by G. Heileman Brewing of LaCrosse, Wisconsin, the makers of the Old Style Lager Beer ! ", While Mike was grilling us, raising an old style bottle. (Shame on you, Mike! Drink beer on your moving boat! We tell the Coast Guard!) Then the boat would leave the dock, accompanied by the Sea Hunt theme and the credit rollover. <br /> <br /> NOTE: * More figuratively than literally, Mike was renting and things were unfolding as a discriminating story. <br /> <br /> NOTE: ** ZIV's successes in the Syndicate include "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER", "WEST POINT" (and his clone "MEN OF ANNAPOLIS"), "SEA HUNT" and "HIGHWAY PATROL" . <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And of course, SCUBA is an acronym for "Autonomous Underwater Breathing Apparatus".
