All I can say is that if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, you are not human! Even after watching it for the first time, I was addicted. It's a fascinating experience and hard to describe, as other fans will certainly attest. After looking at it, you will cry thinking that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have Gray Gardens to remember! I think we all aspire to the ferocious independence with which these two ladies were honored. Although I've always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she does not stay in your heart like Big and Little Edie do. What a rare pleasure to know such people! I only wish to have!
