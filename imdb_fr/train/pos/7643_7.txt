Spoiler!!! This film is based on the concept of What If? Of course, Mr. Destiny will be able to answer that question. The main character, like many of us, goes through a bad day and asks this question. According to the theory of chaos, a butterfly in China could have an effect on a person here as a result of a chain reaction. The objective of this film is based on an event during a baseball game. This event sets in motion his destiny; Like Ashton in The Butterfly Effect, Destiny uses comedy rather than drama. The results make a cool, somewhat original film. If your philosophies are in agreement with "The Butterfly Effect", you will probably appreciate Mr. Destiny. I give it a 7 out of 10. Incredible, I saw the first half of this movie 3 times and I finally watched the end on TBS.
