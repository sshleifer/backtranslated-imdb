I bought it some time ago, but I neglected to watch it until last night. I like Juliette Lewis although I am indifferent to Brad Pitt. After watching this, I have to admit he's a very good actor - his character was quite believable and I did not think about "Brad Pitt" at all. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can not say the same for David. Duchovny. I'm a fan of X-Files and I had to watch twice to confirm the date of this movie because I thought it was done a few years later. I like Duchovny, but his character is a bit two-dimensional here, except in cases where he does voiceovers. This part was strong, seemed of character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise, I always thought of "Agent Mulder", which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a treat. Why did not I notice it before? (I'll look to see what other roles she's played and see those as soon as possible) I'm slightly concerned about the stereotypes about Lewis, this movie and "Natural Born Killers" (a company favorite). What's interesting to see is a contrast of characters - at NBK, she's a willing accomplice, whereas she hates violence and tries not to recognize the dark side of Early until her face be projected. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie almost without reservation. Aside from Duchovny's character that did not seem completely formed (and which was perhaps "washed out" by Pitt), it was perfect. I was also happy with the end - glad that the innocent heroes did not die, but they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, you may like this movie, and vice versa.
