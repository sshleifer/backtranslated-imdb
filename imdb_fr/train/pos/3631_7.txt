The film actually has a pretty good story, but gets bogged down in several key places. It's almost as if the director had thrown the film together without taking the time to make essential cuts in the film. Dennis Quaid does a pretty decent job in his role ... but he's clearly missing something at several key scenes. <br /> <br /> This 2.5 hour film could have been reduced to about 2 hours. And the film would probably have been better if he did not feel like throwing it together. <br /> <br />
