A bus filled with passengers is stuck during a snowstorm. The police closed the bridge saying it was dangerous and they were stuck in a small cafe until the road cleared. However, after a while, their boredom became a cause for concern, as it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and could well be a stranger !! This leads to an ironic conclusion but also quite amusing in the way of low eyebrows. <br /> <br /> This is another fun episode of The Twilight Zone. Instead of twists or typical social comments, it has no lasting message. However, he is also very attractive, so who cares ?! This is exactly what you will have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, this one is played by John Hoyt - a face that most of you will recognize from countless TV series and movies. In almost every case, he played with real grief (like Charles Lane at the same time), but I really liked seeing him - because he perfected the grumpy character and was pretty funny at the same time.
