This movie is by far the cutest I've seen in a long time! A wonderful animation and lovely characters (even the bad guys were cute!) Made him a total winner in my book, as well as those with whom I saw him. I still want to see him again, but I have not had time. Better than Toy Story, which was good too, but it's not good.
