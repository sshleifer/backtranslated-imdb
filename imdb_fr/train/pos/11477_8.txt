In my opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once. It really puts things in perspective when I look at them. Although it's a fiction, this movie is about something that could happen to your kids. <br /> <br /> It shows how easy it is for two children to hide their hatred for their school and their plan to murder innocent students. This movie would not have worked in another format. They shot the camera tightly in their hands. <br /> <br /> It reminds us of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of the media storm that followed. Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and the cassettes in the basement. <br /> <br /> This film is a fictional version of our dreams come true. We see the kid behind the monster. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of this film is that it has not worked well in the market and few people know it. If there had been a single glimpse of a single hit movie, everyone would have gone to see why the big problem was, Zero Day. <br /> <br /> I think it's the best film adaptation of a shoot in a school of the few who have really tried. The filming itself only takes about ten minutes to an hour and a half, because it focuses mainly on Cal and Andre and what they have done so far. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, go rent it, and look at it. I guarantee you that when it's over, you'll be speechless.
