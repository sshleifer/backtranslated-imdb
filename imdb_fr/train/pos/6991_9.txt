It's an excellent movie. The cast is a good mix of characters and the story is decent. The film is essentially about an accomplished doctor who steals the bodies of dead wives and takes them home. Once the corpses are at home, he removes objects (I hate to use a term as general, but I forget what was removed) and puts them in his wife to keep his youth. Then a journalist, Patricia Hunter, examines the situation and begins to search for answers as to why the wives died. She goes to the doctor and the interesting things begin to unfold. Look certainly this old, but goodie if you can.
