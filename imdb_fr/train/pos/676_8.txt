"The last wave" is more than the sum of its parts. It's not just a film about a disaster, not just an exploration of Australian aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than just a legal drama. Screenwriter / director Peter Weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and stimulating film with the same strange atmosphere he had given to "Picnic At Hanging Rock" two years earlier, which you will remember again years later. . <br /> <br /> When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) against the death of an Aboriginal person he may or may not be directly responsible for, he does not just fight for get Lee's truth, but make sense of what he hears when it comes. Like the indigenous belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the dream time - the truth exists on two totally different levels, with more disastrous ramifications than Burton could have imagined. <br /> <br /> No doubt that's why Picnic At Hanging Rock is best remembered for its enduring mystery. We are led on the same path, but obliged to find answers ourselves. In "The Last Wave", we can bring everything together by the end of the film. However, even with all the information, we have to choose how many times we want to believe it because the film takes us beyond the boundaries of our normal realities. <br /> <br /> On the production side, Weir uses his budget wisely, gradually creating a sense of unhappiness in everything, from subdued lighting, to heavy rains, to the proper use of sound. Casual music is unobtrusive and never tries to be grandiose. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey the perplexity that the public would probably feel as he tried to unravel the mystery. David Gulpilil brilliantly portrays a man trapped between two worlds, wanting to do what is right, but afraid because he already knows the end. <br /> <br /> Gather all these things and you'll have a perfect example of why David Weir is a household name thirty years later. Strongly recommended.
