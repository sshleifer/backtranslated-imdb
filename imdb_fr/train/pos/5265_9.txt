I remember seeing him for the first time when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". This film is always great. An original aspect was that the fight scenes were very short. This would imply that the "barbarian brothers" were so good that they quickly finished the enemy! Plus, you have chases, a cage fight, a dragon and yes, even a fight in a bar! <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is bad, that's why it's not a ten, the scenario has also been the subject of much criticism. I think it's pretty original. Few films of this genre have the same original stories or colorful dialogues. <br /> <br /> I really recommend this movie.
