Embarrassing, I just watched this film for the first time, 13 years after its release. This is a story that any father or brother can tell ... a brother is a little "wild", the other brother is the typical grandchild. Craig Sheffer is a bit too emotional as an older brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is perfectly chosen to play the role of the father. The fishing scenes filmed in Montana are breathtaking ... I did not know that fly fishing could be so appealing. The film closely follows the book, with only a few changes to make it more suitable for a movie format. Unlike most book to film stories, this one is up to par. It is a perfect film for anyone who wants to spend a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional film.
