Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. When he survives the electrocution, government officials give him the choice to electrocute more or accept certain experiences. He chooses experimentation and is placed in a large metal cell with a hard-ass criminal who has also survived the electrocution. They can have everything they need in the room (within reasonable limits), but they can not leave. after a few days, meals are reduced to one meal a day and the room temperature is also set to 100. After a few extra alarms are triggered at regular intervals to prevent people from sleeping. One day, a "witch" enters their cell (although a glazed portion). What will happen next, I will let you know. I may be in the minority here, but I liked the accumulation, it intrigued me. Now, if the gain was half as good as the set up, I would have awarded a much higher score. <br /> <br /> My note: C + <br /> <br /> Media Blaster Extras 2 DVD set: Disc 1) director's cut; Trailers for "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack the Gas Station" and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" (Disc 2): Theatrical cut; Commentary with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Taku and Tsutomu Takahashi; Interview with the actors and the Making of; Original trailer and promotional teasers
