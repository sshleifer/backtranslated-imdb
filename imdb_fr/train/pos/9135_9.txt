I do not care how many bad purple critics Rain gets, this movie is awesome! Excellent film, has everything to please, good music (Prince of coarse!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> It's really a very sad film, very touching. I do not want to say much more, I do not want to reveal the plot, but I will say this: the film is VERY realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that cross these problems, so many families similar to the one represented in the movie. I find this very realistic and so real, makes the movie a lot more moving. My generation loved this movie as it grew up, many of us loved Prince and there is a lot to tell for any teenager who has experienced similar problems. <br /> <br /> That said, it's definitely not a teen movie. , I recommend it to all age groups. And it's not so dark, the film contains good music, group performance scenes and sexy entertainment scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
