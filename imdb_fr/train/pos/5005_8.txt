With films like "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run" to their credit, the good people on the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, are now presenting us with some of their twisted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts" " <br /> <br /> Derived from a short film made at the beginning of their career, "Creature Comforts" is a slice of life in which excerpts of conversation are removed from their context and given to any animal . Aardman Animation has traveled the country to interview people with innocuous questions such as "Are you a liar?" and then, speed things up a bit by asking them questions about their sex life. <br /> <br /> The answers, even if they seem boring and mundane, are quite funny, when you understand that dialogues come first and animals are added later. <br /> <br /> How many of these animals look like the ones who make the statements? One of the characters discusses what he is looking for in a woman: "I like them, skinny." is an insect, the walking stick. <br /> <br /> Two dogs discuss smells and smells while sniffing the bottom of a poodle as they talk about the different smells of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. While the "woman" tells the litany that it is her health, her husband, who has been suffering for a long time, remains at his side without saying anything. <br /> <br /> It may take some time for "Creature Comforts" to find his "legs", he should find a place on TV for those who are tired of the ordinary. Although there is more reality TV than Carter has liver pills, "Creature Comforts" is one of a kind and really deserves to be watched. <br /> <br /> Part of the humor may seem a little racy, it's the clay that captures the attention of children (like the old Batman series of the 60s, the jokes are quite subtle, children will not understand them) and it's the jokes that are there for adults.
