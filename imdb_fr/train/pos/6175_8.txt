I saw this pilot when he was shown for the first time and I'm sure countless fans of "Spirit" hate him, because, like Batman, the Green Hornet, etc., he brought the character into the direction of "camp". But obviously, I never had enough Batman, because I thought it was entertaining, just like this show. There are two parties that stay with me. First, when Denny's partner was fatally injured, he makes a dramatic speech about how he always defended the law and obeyed the exact letter. Then he says something like, "Boy, was I stupid!" It's his way of telling Denny to become a vigilante, which he does (though it's Batman). Then there is the scene where he tries to convince the wicked to let him go by kissing her, but she is not fooled, because he is too honest to embrace convincingly! It was an excellent example of "camp", which was also "downplayed" by both the actor and the actress.
