Afterwards, I watched the movies ... I thought, "Why was this movie so successful in the Korean Box Office?" Even though the film had a clever / unusual scenario, the acting was not so good and the characters were not very interesting. For a Korean movie ... I liked the fight scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking about it, this is the movie you need. But I must admit that the film was rather childish. 6/10
