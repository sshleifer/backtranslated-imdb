I read the other reviews and found some comparisons between the real life of a movie (for example, what it takes to get into a music school), Britney Bashing, etc., etc., so let's focus on the film and the message. <Br/> <br /> I rated this movie 7 out of 10 for 8 to 14 years old and for a family film. For an average adult man .... 2 of 10. <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock music, I'm 45 years old. I know Britney Spears, but I never realized that she had sung Stronger before reading the credits and the critics. I did not recognize his poster on the wall, so I did not fear any "personal promotion". <br /> <br /> I watch movies for entertainment. I do not care about distribution, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the film and it amuses me? <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the message. The biggest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (which is a different story), so looked with the message in mind, as this is an area of ​​interest. The film is light, shiny and fresh, ideal for children. I found that the Texan twang was starting to fade throughout the movie and of course, there were only a lot of ways to convey the abandonment / surrender message, so it was a bit predictable. Great message though ... should be more numerous. <br /> <br /> This film is a great family film, but for a guy who looks at it alone, get Hannibal.
