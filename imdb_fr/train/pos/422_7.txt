"The Plainsman" represents the prowess of Cecil B. DeMille in his most inaccurate and unfounded realization. Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (John Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln intervene, while in reality, Lincoln was already dead by the time the story unfolded. place. From time to time, DeMille floats dangerously close to the truth, but moves away just as easily from it in a show and a flawless staging. The film is an attempt to reinforce Custer's latest stance with a heap of fiction that is only vaguely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of legends and manufactured goods. Really, it's the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty camping relic by today's standards. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER: Given the vintage of the film, it is a rather attractive transfer, with often clean whites and extremely strong blacks. There is a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence at other times. Overall, the quality of the image is somewhat inconsistent, but it is never bad or quite good ?? just a little better than the middle of the road. Age-related artifacts are kept to a minimum and numerical anomalies do not interfere. The sound is mono but well balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRAS: Forget it. It's universal! LOWER RESULT: As a pseudo-story painted on celluloid, this western is convincing and fun. Just take his characters and his story with a grain of salt ?? in some cases ?? a whole box seems more appropriate!
