When I read a review of another user saying that the game is awful, I could not sit idle and do nothing! Well, this game is great, among the news clips (with two real people, full sense of humor and credibility!), To the story, I find it very good! I only complain that enemies begin to blink when they die, until they disappear; and frustrating situations in LEILA VR missions, when you ride a bike, here and there ... <br /> <br /> Except, it's a great game, with a great story, good graphics, great 'excellent characters, excellent soundtrack ... I recommend it! Surely! It can be a little old, but still nice! At least on Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
