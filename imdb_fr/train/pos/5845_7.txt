I enjoyed this movie more than anything I could have anticipated; While reading other reviews here, I suspect that it is extremely beneficial to be seen on a large screen in the cinema, along with a cheerful and enthusiastic audience. I was fortunate to live this experience, carried by laughter from all over the world, and I had a great time with this uncomplicated comedy. <br /> <br /> Because it's like a comedy that shines, if shines anywhere. The music is nothing special - in fact, I did not realize it was * a * musical, and I was very surprised when the assembled ancestors burst into lyrical lyrics - but I must admit that half-threat, A half-promise of "Oh, what am I going to do ..." was much more catchy than it seemed at the time, because it still turns in my head! <br /> <br /> The plot, as it stands, is largely based on the past history of Francesca, a 16th-century portrait with a distinctively anachronistic hairstyle and fur coat. Her idea of ​​the sanctity of marriage does not quite match that of her distant descendant, Countess Angelina, and one can almost hear the story cracking under the constraints of the Production Code to ensure that the heroine arrives spotless in his marriage bed late with the good man ... <br /> <br /> The romance does not break the earth, and in fact, the first scenes are rather straight, at the limit of tedious . But where scenario and film really come to life, it's the battle of the sexes that follows. Douglas Fairbanks Jr's impudence in Angelina's parade, married to Betty Grable, is matched only by the pursuit of Betty-Grable-as-Francesca, resulting in a complete reversal of the role in the whimsical sequence hilarious where she literally takes it away. his feet. This is probably the comic apotheosis of the plot, although the consequences of the Colonel's understandable confusion are solved with a skilful touch in the two remaining "acts" of the operetta structure, and the spectacle of the smug awakening and Confused Fairbanks is more or less worth the price of admission alone. <br /> <br /> Grable is quite convincing to establish his two contrasting characters, judiciously gets almost all (limited) singing opportunities, and shares the honors where the quotable sides dialogue in the different verbal duels are concerned. But in the area of ​​tacit reaction, she is really outclassed by her masculine support tracks; Fairbanks in particular is an absolute delight in a number of wordless sequences whose staging and humor are worthy of a silent screen. <br /> <br /> This film is too uneven in terms of style to be a classic, ranging from sparkling film. to tired boredom. Honestly, he is quite funny and has caused spontaneous shouts of applause and laughter to the listeners at the end, when the lights went out. At odds with his time, he may have failed to attract a contemporary audience - but, during this performance, he really did not deserve to be disowned by Grable and Preminger, the director (uncredited). This is not a masterpiece, but a very entertaining minor work, and I found myself smiling as a souvenir back home.
