I watched it subtitled as in Russian, but I really enjoyed it. The main character Sasha was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived all his life unhappy because he was different and anger made him do mortal things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to get him away from him, ending in a deadly battle. There was a lot of gore, but not too much for people who have a stomach ache. <br /> <br /> Not for those who love the old Hollywood movie, but for those who like independent movies. Kinda had the feeling of a fantastic Asian movie.
