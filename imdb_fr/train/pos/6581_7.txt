In search of Quo Vadis in my local video store, I found this 1985 version that seemed interesting. Wow! It was amazing! It's really a kind of Ken Russell film - strange, stylized, very artistic and of course "different". Nero was presented not as evil incarnate, but as a wacky and unsatisfied emperor who would have rather had a career in the circus. He was probably wondering why he had been put in the position of "running" an empire - it was not very fun, and the fun was what he longed for. Klause Maria Bandaur had a great time with this role and played it thoroughly. Yes, Nero persecuted Christians with vengeance. one of the many who did it. At one point, one of his henchmen whispers: "Nobody will ever understand that we were just protecting ourselves." He understood correctly.
