I recently watched the '54 version of this movie with Judy, and although I enjoy the story and the music, I found that the film did not catch my attention. I was expecting the remake of '76 to be the same story except with a Barbra touch. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at the fame, the money, the love and the price of it all. This version is so much more real than '54, with better music, better acting, a more captivating plot and, of course, a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film is on the list of the 100 best of the American Film Institute, while this striking remake leaves no trace on the list of critics.
