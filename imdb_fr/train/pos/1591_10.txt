My mother and I have just become addicted to this series by laughing! I only saw 10 episodes, and I'm disappointed not to have paid attention to this hilarious series before their cancellation! The story is very funny, the characters really have beautiful personalities (or, not so great, but they are always so funny!). I tell you every episode of what I like about you. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, and all the actors, do not let me bother looking! There is inappropriate language for children and sexual content, but with a close parental guide, you should not have too many problems. There is a kind of 'Friends' relationship that attracts me on this show. I really like that.
