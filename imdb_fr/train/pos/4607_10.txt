My favorite film of Jackie Chan will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this 1985 film, "Police Story". Chan plays a Hong Kong super-policeman who kills a notorious crime lord and his gang and is then responsible for protecting the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so that she can turn the state's evidence. As the story continues, the gangster sends his henchmen to send Lin, but Chan takes things in his hands and feet, while keeping the girlfriend Maggie Cheung away. Like "Drunken Master", "Police Story" contains many of the outstanding stunts and choreographies of Chan's martial arts / action that culminated in a royal battle in a crowded mall. As a director, Chan excels in excellence, giving a performance that is both charismatic and fun that accentuates the action. While the awesome humor of the "Drunken Master" is at the center of attention, "History of the Police" is just that, a police story, a bitter police thriller that would often be copied in the years to come. <br /> <br /> 10/10
