I saw this film for the first time when it was broadcast around 1988 by the BBC while I was working on the British film 2000AD. My boyfriend Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. Until then, I had only seen Shaw Bros's kung fu films, with their dim lighting (so that the audience could see the movements clearly), so it was a revelation for me to see something that looked like this. that he had been enlightened by Ridley Scott coming out of Hong Kong. It was also my first exposure to Tsui Hark's films (pronounced, apparently, "Choy Huk"). <br /> <br /> Yet for all smoky and backlit exteriors and ambitious special effects (Stop-motion? In a Hong Kong movie?) At the heart of GHOST STORY in China is a simple love story and touching, made even more real by the exceptional talent of Leslie Cheung (what a tragic and tragic mess of a lifetime!) And the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Admittedly, Joey is beautiful, but it is his ballet hand gestures that give his character an inaccessible eroticism difficult to analyze. And although Joey is now almost 20 years older (we are speechless, this is not the case?), It will always remain the image of this actress. <br /> <br /> Some critics have said that the film was simplistic and it does not lack surprises, but it misses the fact that this movie was based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! It's a bit like complaining that Romeo and Juliet has a predictable end and is just copying WEST SIDE STORY. (I just wanted to say it!) <br /> <br /> For me, the Chinese GHOST STORY is the romantic story par excellence. There is a great tragedy because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together. It's about becoming mature, because none of us can mature until we have suffered a great loss. It is a question of sacrifice, because sacrifice is an essential component of True Love. And the comical style of Wu Ma does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> Enjoy GHOST STORY in Chinese trying not to see it through a filter of Western culture and you will do very well.
