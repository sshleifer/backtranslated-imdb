I had never seen a silent movie until July 24, 2005. I had never seen a movie with Mary Pickford. I saw thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic with me. I found Last of the Mohicans and Unforgettable (Ray Liotta) hypnotic, so consider the source as you read this. I started looking at Tess from the storm country on TCM, just to see who this Mary Pickford was, to whom many credit the credit for launching Hollywood. I had no idea what I was doing. Two hours later, I came out and realized that I had seen one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen, playing a role that suited her perfectly. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, having never seen anyone so beautiful and so expressive before. It should be seen again and again. The setting was perfect for such an expressive girl. She was a poor squatter, she did not speak the King's English, but it had to be admired. What a movie ... it's time to start my Mary Pickford film collection!
