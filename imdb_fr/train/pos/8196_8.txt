I do not know why people think it's such a bad movie. There is a good storyline, action, and the change of location for Harry does not hurt either. True, some of his offensives and free, but it's not the only movie like that. Eastwood is in great shape as Dirty Harry and I loved Pat Hingle in this film as a policeman from the little town. If you like DIRTY HARRY, you should see this one, it's way better than THE DEAD POOL. 4/5
