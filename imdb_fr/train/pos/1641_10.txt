I saw it 25 years ago on PBS. It was very difficult to watch. So true. Watching this little family fight in the winter was heartbreaking. No time to court: fate threw us together and we put our shoulders to the grind for it to work. This was based on the woman's diary, which I read several years later. She said in her diary that her parents died when she was a child and that their brothers and sisters had to work on the farm to feed themselves. She learned to mow, which was not feminine. She feared that no prince charming would want a woman with calloused hands, sunburnt, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow and she was happy to do it. Both were widowed and worked together to build a new house. It was so, so sad when the baby died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would have been good. It only makes the tragedy even sadder. I cried so hard. But then they went out and managed to get a new calf. Spring is coming and life goes on. In her diary, she had two other boys and they lived.
