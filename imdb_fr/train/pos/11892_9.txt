Pialat films people in extreme emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes. In The Open Mouth, he discusses the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son as she dies of cancer. In Our Loves, the adolescent's sexual experiences lead to violent clashes with her family. Here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to a sexy ex-prisoner. His motivation is a bit cloudy, as Loulou is unable to read or discuss such difficult topics as TV shows. On the other hand, he has a fabulous body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports film to show his physique - he would have been great as a rugby player). <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive. Isabelle Huppert does not have the right to give a bland and inexpressive performance (she has given a lot); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could wish for - see the scene in the bar, where he is stabbed in the stomach, runs away and gets treatment, then begins again with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with his eyes black with coal and his look in distress, plays Nelly's husband magnificently; it is a beautiful repetition of the match of Coup de foudre.
