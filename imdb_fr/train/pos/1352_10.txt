I have never seen this film and I consider it a classic with great veteran actors. At the time this film was shot, the Americans were different, there was no television or anything we have today, with the exception of radio and the launching of great films made in Canada. Hollywood. Sweet innocent stories of young novels between a girl or a young man have been seen from a different angle than today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet", 44, played the role of an orphan girl named Carrot Top because of her red hair. She was then taken to a home of two elderly people, who looked like two wise owls and watched Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened, the whole city would discover it in a few minutes. It's a realistic film with honest people trying to help each other in a very simple way of life. Today it sounds very stupid and stupid, but believe me, people were like that in America in the 1920s. & 30's and they were a great generation who loved good family movies.
