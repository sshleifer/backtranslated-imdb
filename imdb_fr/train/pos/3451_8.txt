First of all, this film was not distributed in theaters (TESTED NOW, SAY IT), I say that they were the story of cops, politicians and devoted journalists who had been killed, but send -the DVD and cable TV> and take the money & run. <br /> <br /> That said, I usually like this type of movie, especially with this name cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard and the side of the distaff, Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> The plot and the story were made to death, BUT the cast above gives life to this violent film and it is actually visible to watch. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake Is good as the young journalist dedicated to a disposable newspaper published by Morgan Freeman, The other two are either cops, politicians, or rather honest men. The two ladies are the friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and do what is necessary. It's pretty violent, there are a lot of murders, not for the kids. In any case, it's a good movie, BUT for what it is and the cast. It's really good, <br /> <br /> Notes *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
