I loved this series from its first broadcast and I was always looking forward to watching every episode every week. The plot, the characters, the writing, the special effects were exceptional! Then the science fiction channel still messed up and canceled a very entertaining and well written show. I say bring it back, I know that all the actors would come back. I suggest buying DVDs, I am. I hope that science fiction channel executives hear about these comments and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. I only watch a show on this channel (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure it'll be canceled soon too.
