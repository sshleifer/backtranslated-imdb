After his return from military service, JAMES STEWART marked the advent of this complicated western because he wanted to change his image by making a western, which is largely considered as the reason for the influx of westerns in the years 50 because it is very impressive. Too bad he was not photographed in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart wins the first prize for "the gun that won the West", but then has to spend the rest of the movie trying to get it back after his flight. SHELLEY WINTERS is a shady girl with an unsavory reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is the villainous shooter in the city of Dodge City. WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad boyfriend. And do not you know that, being a Universal-International film, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both quite unknown at the time) have cute roles. <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence depicts the first Indian attack, in which CHARLES DRAKE turns out to be a coward who leaves, leaving Shelley alone in the horse-drawn chariot. It will be redeemed later, but it is only one of the meanders that makes the weapon passes from one unsavory hand to another - but ultimately ends up with the rightful owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have a final shootout almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as the flamboyant finale of DUEL IN THE SUN. McNally is the perfect villain and DAN DURYEA is also treacherous in the kind of nasty role he played throughout the 40s as a sniper. <br /> <br /> The well-constructed story is extremely well directed by Anthony Mann, and it's fun to see ROCK HUDSON (nicknamed Young Bull) wearing Indian war paintings and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who throws a look of desire on Shelley Winters, so slim and attractive. <br /> <br /> history above the average.
