I thought this movie was very well done. Taking place in the mid-50s, everything seemed accurate. It was well planted and credible. I do not usually care much about this type of movie because they just do not have depth, but I felt that this movie was deepened for the characters and that you could feel how they felt, you have to really know them and worry about you. their. It took me back to my youth and let me remember a more innocent time. This film could be enjoyed by men and women and by all age groups. Once the film finished, I wanted a second part. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and his family. This film is necessarily a classic. If you have not seen it, you should try to catch it when it is on TV or rent it.
