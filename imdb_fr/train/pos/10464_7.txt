For all those who do not speak Swedish: The Swedish title [original] of this film; "Rånarna" translates into something in the lineage of "The Robbers". That's the main problem I have with the movie, because it's not about thieves at all. This is a young woman working for the Swedish police in search of robbery. You might think it's a regular office job, but this girl is soon on the ground, taking things in hand, as the story goes, even shooting at one of the robbers ... Exactly: We have already seen. The fact that the mid-term plot has a rather interesting twist really does not help, because the end is as clichéd as the first two-thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> What stops him from being another mainstream film is the fact that he is masterfully executed in every way, that the actors are as great as they are not surpassing him and that the director really manages to keep it as exciting as possible for most of the story. <br /> <br /> One of the things I really liked in this film is the fact that his music creates a good mood when it needs to be, but that it is missing for the rest of the time, which gives a beautiful impression of reality at Car chases have spread throughout the film. A nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the rare Swedish actors to tend to be typified wounds the film sadly, knowing that he will not only play the boyfriend of the heroine and will be a secondary character in the background but it is necessary to neglect. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an entertaining movie that steals more money in its plot than in time. 7/10
