The autobiography on which this film is based remains one of the most heartbreaking books I have ever read. It tells the incredible stories of two sisters, both dedicated and respected who worked during their 70 years as a teacher and dentist, then lived another 30 years in dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as a rebel "blacker" Bessie, the dentist. She expresses not only well her anger, her anguish and her wisdom; it lets you know exactly where they come from using a word economy. Diahnn Carroll has the feeling of the older sister, the teacher, perfectly, but I am afraid she will never make me believe that she is over 100 years old. It does not matter - the stories are worth telling. As a reporter for the Caucasian NY Times, Amy Madigan is a little too extreme and intrusive in her role as an actress and insecure in the first half of the film. This too is only a minor distraction. The stories, all true, are the attraction and although two or three are slightly damaged in the translation, most of them resist perfectly. <br /> <br /> I recommend this book as an indispensable reading to all the people I recommend. all the books to. I can not quite say that this TV movie is in this rarified air, but it captures enough for its flavor is really worthy of interest.
