I thought "The River of Souls" was a very good Babylon 5 movie, with exceptional performances by Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If it was an episode of the series (without humor), it would probably be one of my favorite independent stories in the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I always preferred Scoggins to Christian, although JMS did not write it either during most of the series and she had to endure the Byron / Telepath plot. If you remove the naughty humor of the brothel and the "poorest" actors of these scenes, then this film is really solid. Probably my third favorite of the four movies, but by no means bad.
