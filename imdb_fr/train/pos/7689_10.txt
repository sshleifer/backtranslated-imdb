That was what black society looked like before the crack epidemics, gangsta rap, and AIDS that plagued the ghettos of the eighties. Decent and hardworking families who have struggled to cope and all the trauma and tribulation they have been facing. Black America was a different group of people in the seventies. Still hopeful and high in the civil rights movements of the sixties, the times were tough, but they were still worth fighting. Keeping your head out of the water, making a wave when you can, this show showed how black society was struggling to work together, as individuals and families, before starting to take each other and everyone else to sheltered from the horrors of the ghettos. It is heartbreaking to see what the black ghettos of the day looked like and what they became.
