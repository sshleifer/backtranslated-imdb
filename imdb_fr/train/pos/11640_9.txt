My favorite thing about this movie is that like Hitchcock's movies, it's a thriller that does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock realized that people go to the movies to have fun. Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. It's a thriller, but there are a lot of laughs and one eye always turned towards the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is beautiful, as always. Cillian Murphy is more scary than he was in Batman Begins. In the old days, there were guys who always played the bad guy. We do not see him much these days, because I suspect Hollywood agents consider this a bad career, but Cillian Murphy is really good at it. <br /> <br /> The staging is surprisingly elegant. The story is good, but the dialogue could have improved. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a really fun movie and people were clapping when the end credits started running. If you fancy a nice escape thriller, "Red Eye" could be your ticket.
