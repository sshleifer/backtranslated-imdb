While I do not know anything about baseball, I'm not even a fan of this sport, but that did not stop me from enjoying the Farrelly brothers' latest film, Fever Pitch, a charming and irreverent romantic comedy. The film is not really about baseball; it's more about relationships and the emotional disconnect that can often take place. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallen ?? give his best performance so far? stars like Ben, a dorky teacher, slightly nerdy. Ben is a kind of man-boy who, unfortunately, has never really grown up, and he has an almost fanatical addiction to the Red Sox baseball team. Ben devoted his life to the Sox and did everything from the Florida pilgrimage for spring training to decorating every inch of his apartment with team gear. <br /> <br /> One day, while taking his geometry course in the spotlight On a field trip to his office, Ben meets Lindsey (a wonderful Drew Barrymore). Lindsey is a business-oriented, career-oriented girl, but she has a kind of kindness that Ben finds totally endearing. At first, he hesitates to ask her out, thinking she's out of her "class" and Lindsey does not immediately see a potential partner at Ben. <br /> <br /> Their first date is a disastrous start. when Lindsey is hit with a serious case of food poisoning? and his resonant gaiety provides the first clue that we are actually watching a Farrelly Brothers movie. Rather than accept Lindsey's - rather urgent - request to postpone the appointment, Ben stays to play nurse, caretaker and janitor. So Ben rubs the dog's toilet and teeth, while his love is spent with a bucket beside his bed. <br /> <br /> When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds her asleep on her couch, she begins the long agitated process of dismantling the canvas of anxiety and ambition of status that she ended up considering as its standards. Soon, they fall in love and Lindsey cheerfully accepts Ben's fanatical dedication to his sport. <br /> <br /> Having inherited his beloved uncle's choice tickets, Ben has organized his life around the season ?? he never missed a match. But their relationship, which has progressed unhindered throughout the winter, is problematic at the beginning of the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsey wants Ben to do something else, like a holiday with her parents and a party with her friends. but Ben begins to struggle to modulate his interest in meeting Lindsey halfway. Can Lindsey agree to her irrational dedication to summer boys to make their relationship work? Can she really welcome Ben's infatuation with sports? Can a fierce and nervous Red Sox fan find true love after all? Of course, Lindsey and Ben come with a colorful assortment of friends who bridged the opinion. Lindsey's toughest buddy, skinny, rich and blond Robin (KaDee Strickland), insists that there must be a problem with the guy if he's still single at 30. However, Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) and Molly (Ione) Skye give a more optimistic and positive view of Ben. <br /> <br /> Ben's eccentricity could apply to almost any obsessional sports enthusiast, while Lindsay's frustrations could be representative of any woman with a mobile and ascending career. Fallon is great as Ben, displaying real potential on the big screen, overcoming the significant challenge of keeping Ben as unfriendly. Barrymore, meanwhile, is as charming as the bourgeois Lindsey, especially because it is difficult to accept Ben as he is without losing sight of his own needs. <br /> <br /> Fever Pitch really works, and even if there are many This film also addresses the serious problem of sports addiction and the difficulty for couples to negotiate this fragile territory. <br /> <br /> Much of the film was shot at Boston's Fenway Park, which added a touch of authenticity to the process and the atmosphere of the games, while fully appreciating what happened with the team will probably be limited to baseball fans. Nevertheless, Fever Pitch has a script so finely worked and so cleverly fun that even novice baseball fans will find many ways to connect. Mike Leonard on September 5th.
