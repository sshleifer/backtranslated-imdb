Eugene Levy, one of John's funniest, is also excellent in this movie. I wish the studio to know that this one should be on DVD, I have it on videotape, but I think this movie deserves a DVD (and super supplements) the Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) sketch is very funny, just like the whole movie, as well as the scenes he has with his girlfriend and his family are great, this movie never seems to be on TV, but it loses the most If you can find the video, I would suggest buying it (eBay is a good place to find a copy). I will keep my VHS until we can see it on DVD. There are so many great movies that have not been released on DVD yet, and that's one of them.
