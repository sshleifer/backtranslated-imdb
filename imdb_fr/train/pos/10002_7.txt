This is easily the most underrated inn movie Brooks Cannon. Of course, its imperfect. This does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, for example, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or Titanic gave a realistic view of Italian YOU IDIOTS). Many jokes fall flat. But, despite everything, this film is very nice, unlike many comedies, and it is really impressive to highlight this story about some of the most traditionally vilified members of society. It's not King Fisher, but it's not shit, either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have launched someone else in the lead (I like Mel as a director and screenwriter, not so much in mind).
