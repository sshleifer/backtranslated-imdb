Ghost Story, (The new house) is a terrible horror story. This is from the Circle of Fear and Ghost Story series of the early '70s. The beginning and end of each story are told by Sebastian Cabot. Do you remember him in the family-run Early Family Affair in the 1960s? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as key players and as main characters in the story. I saw this recently and I was so scared! If you are alone, I would not recommend that you look at it. This story is terrible, no words gore or curse, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the bride. David Birney played her husband. Both actors were very good in their roles. If you like the scary, fun and terrifying stories of ghosts, then you'll love this little gem. I strongly recommended this story.
