Pandro S. Berman was "responsible for production", which made him the online producer. But who produced this epic, filmed not in Arizona, but in the California desert of Mohave where scavengers have removed all the remains of the "temple of gold" huts Thuggee, the British outpost of Muri, the village of Tantrapur, etc. minor technical defects can and should be forgiven. What is unforgivable is the absence of an Oscar for the best music, although the Academy may not have proposed it at the time. Only one theme was played in different tempos, including waltz, march and sweet, mood setting. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production was the request of the widow Kipling. An actor playing Kipling briefly appears before and after the battle scenes. In the initial version, her scenes were cut, according to Ms. Kipling's requests. Later, they were included and lent a "connection" of Kipling's immortal poem to Ben Hecht's screenplay. Interestingly, this very typical and pro-British story was written by a great screenwriter who himself hated the British.
