Tigerland is one of the best films I've seen and, in my opinion, it even surpasses a metal jacket, a film of the same nature. Bozz is played exceptionally well by Farrell and is a character who stays in your mind long after the end of the film. Schumacher brilliantly cuts the end - with the song of melodic harmony and the slow rhythm of the troops preparing to leave. What movie.
