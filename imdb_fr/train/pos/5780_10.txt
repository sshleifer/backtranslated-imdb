The Maxx is a deep psychological introspective slightly camouflaged as a strange superhero story. Julie Winters is a "freelance social worker" in a nameless, crime-ridden city, and she has problems to solve, along with everyone around her. The Maxx is his friend and his client, a tramp who thinks he's a costumed superhero - or is it the other way around? <br /> <br /> Do not miss out on the artwork, the story itself or the great work of the voice, especially that of the late Barry Stigler, a delightfully urban and disgusting voice of the villain Principal, Mr Gone. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it, do not miss it.
