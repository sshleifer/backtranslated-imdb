I liked this film. I remember that there was a very well done scene in this movie where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) was lying in bed smoking, then she started to visualize that the Ramones were in the room with her singing the song. "I want you around you" ... really cool stuff. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, quirky and cool. Yes, I'll admit that the end is very exciting and crazy ... but it does not matter, because it's fun, it's a very funny movie. It's Sex, Pot and Rock n Rocll forever <br /> <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was the band that was originally supposed to play in this movie .. But I do not know if this is true or not
