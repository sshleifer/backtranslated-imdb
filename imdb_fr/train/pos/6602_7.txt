In the same way that Frank Miller and his comics from Sin City used black and white to express themselves (and his film noir influences), so does Christian Volckman in the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> We are in 2054 in Paris. . In the tradition of science fiction, the future is a bright jewel, sparkling with multiple rips. It is a jewel in a setting of misery, iniquity and darkness; bright and beautiful on the top with a dark belly underneath. One of these "brilliant" leaders, a researcher from a very large and influential global company (Avalon), is kidnapped. The well known and effective, Captain Karas (voiced by the new James Bond, Daniel Craig), is responsible for finding her. <br /> <br /> The plot and the presentation are not very original. He is heavily influenced by Black Film, Gibson's Neuromancer and other detective novels, as well as films such as Fritz Lang's Blade Runner, Sin City, Metropolis, and Minority Report. There is the main plot, surrounded by other possible subplots that all connect at the end. It is not difficult to understand everything. <br /> <br /> The strength and originality of the film lies in its intense visual presentation. Paris is a complex set of levels and sub-levels. At its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure. The architectural complexity and luminescence of the city increase as the city rises. Yet, in this structure, the summit does not correspond to the elevation of human ideals and behavior. Paris was meticulously animated and arranged in brilliant black and white. The film is closer to mind with Sin City (comics) then Sin City the film was with his source material. This is all the more easily done since it is still in the same medium; animation. It looks a lot like a scanner. Darkly evolved the visual aspects of storytelling. Light and darkness, black and white create an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as a visual ambiguity. Rightly and wrongly, the black and white can lose all meaning at the same time as it is before us. The film proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious. <br /> <br /> In keeping with the spirit of the film, I can be both critical and fanatic. I can love and hate the same way. This is definitely an experience that I recommend to visual art lovers. Then pour another Black and Tan, enter the void and enjoy the ride.
