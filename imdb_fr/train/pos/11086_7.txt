I saw this movie when I was little - it was called "Fox Glacier". I was totally traumatized by that! It follows a pretty family of little foxes. The beginnings were great and I remember becoming very fond of little foxes. I also remember that my mother took me out of the theater when I was in a state of nervous breakdown. I will not tell you what happened, but let's just say that it does not end well for all foxes. I was used to Disney-type nature movies where animals do not REALLY die. Oh man. This film made me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was really small and to tell the truth - all I can remember is being happy for the foxes and seeing one of them die . Rent it if you can, but do not show your children!
