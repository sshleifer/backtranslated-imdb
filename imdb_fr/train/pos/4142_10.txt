FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the funniest, most original and most entertaining work I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> This film is by no means up to Hollywood standards, nor even a film-to-video fluff comedy suite with terry "hulk" hogan, in terms of the work of the camera, editing, actor, budget or anything else. <br /> <br /> What this movie has, is very original and A nice story, which is obviously made by people who like to do it, and the enthusiasm of all actors and crew really exceeds its budget and its disadvantages. <br /> <br /> This film proves that you are not. You do not need a huge budget or decent actors to make a good movie. You only need original ideas and a passion for what you do. <br /> <br /> simply the best movie of all time. I do not care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, just watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Now, I just hope they will make a DVD version.
