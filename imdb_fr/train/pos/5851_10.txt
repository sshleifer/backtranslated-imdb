* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is only the second pay-per-view I gave a perfect 10, the first being the Royal Rumble of 1991. It was full of exciting matches that did not were not memorable, just disposable fun. And that's why I like it. <br /> <br /> The opening match between Razor and DiBiase, as well as Ludvig Borga against Marty Jannetty were the only low points. These were good matches, but DiBiase deserved better in his last match. These days, a match like this would have clashes and a bigger climax for Razor's first major push. And Jannetty, fresh out of an Intercontinental title, could have better deal with Borga. But I do not think anyone really cared. They just needed a boost from Borga on pay-per-view. <br /> <br /> IRS and The Kid were great, just like Michaels and Perfect. I hope Perfect could have won, but Michaels does not go to bed for anyone. Notice how, just after that, he left the WWF for not having to work for Razor. Bret Hart had two big fights with Doink (note that everyone's best match is against Hit-man) and then Lawler. Their rivalry was a classic; that's why the feud of the year this year was obvious. How many times do you see two legends winning the Feud title of the year so late in their career? <br /> <br /> The Steiners-Heavenly Bodies match was one of the best of the year. Who knew that the corps could stand against one of the best teams of all time? <br /> <br /> Many say that the match between Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez was a waste of time. But I loved it. Do not forget that what made WWF (as before the WWE) great is the mix of athletics and monsters. Is there a soul that did not like Akeem? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, although its match status of the year is not close. They served Lex Luger well, but made the right choice by keeping Yokozuna on the belt. He is the first heel since superstar Graham to hold the belt for more than two months. Nowadays, heels are champions all the time. But from the beginning of the WWWF to the WWF of the 90s, if you blinked, you missed the reign of the title of the heel. <br /> <br /> As a fan of old-school wrestling, this one and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
