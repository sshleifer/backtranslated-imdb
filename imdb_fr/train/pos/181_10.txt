UC 0079, the one year war is almost over. Cyclops, a Zeon task force, targeted a neutral colony on side 6. Their target, a new Gundam built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga). When little boy Al Izuruha, fan of Zeon MS, meets a Zaku after the start of the battle in the colony, he befriends the novice pilot Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. Both become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. During the show, Bernie plays the role of Al's father (whose real father is still at work) and seems to have been taken by the Federation's pilot, Christina McKenzie, but they must finally meet ... in combat. Al soon learns that war is not child's play and Bernie must make the ultimate sacrifice to carry out his mission. <br /> <br /> For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a well done show. The mobile suits are extremely well designed and the animation may seem old fashioned, but really shows the emotion of the characters. If you liked 0083, check this one or, if you're new to the Gundam world, it's a good show to start. If you are looking for a show for theater and character development, this one is for you, it focuses more on the battle of the mobile costume. I would say it's more of a drama than an action. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, The war in the pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
