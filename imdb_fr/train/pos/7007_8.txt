From the first scene, you are given clues about what can happen here. This becomes more and more evident as the story continues. The acting is excellent and these actors touch your soul. Although I knew what was coming, I was extremely puzzled. I still do not understand why Ben did what he did. His "second thoughts" could be seen on his face, but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feelings. It was a very interesting and touching story but it left me confused. Maybe that was the purpose of the movie. I liked the movie and Wil Smith can choose another good movie. This guy knows how to entertain an audience!
