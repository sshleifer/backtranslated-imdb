Like wine, "Johnny Dangerously" is improving day by day. This intelligent, witty and well-played movie could very well be self-contained - but as a parody of the gangster genre, it is truly exceptional. In fact, it's obviously the best movie of its kind ... the funniest parody of mass movies and even the respective period - although, certainly, this position is probably easier to get when its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar and monotonous pseudocomedies as "Jane Austen's Mafia".
