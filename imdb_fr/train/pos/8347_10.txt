Maybe I'm too generous with the note ... but I love this movie! I have seen it so many times, but every time I see it, I fall in love again. It's just a simple romantic comedy, without anything huge or monumental. But I'm a big romantic and this movie * is * romantic. I like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so funny. Scientists make me laugh so much ... I recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. It's such a good movie - and those are so rare now! My 20-year-old brother also loves this film, so it's not just a female film. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you're just lonely and you have to * watch * a romance, if you yourself can not participate. It's a good one!
