for me, the middle of the film, especially the love scene is a little too long, but all the time, you can imagine this feeling of desert. But the best thing that made this movie memorable is the images of the big explosion, their color, their slowmotion and the music of Pink Floyd are unique in the history of the film! <br /> <br /> Destruction in its most popular form.
