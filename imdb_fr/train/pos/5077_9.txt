Indian cinema is typical of cops of two major categories: honest or bad. Honest guys always scream loudly and fight the system while bad cops mostly enjoy it, but suffer in the end. <br /> <br /> This film breaks at least this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of the cops and their lives. The management takes a look from inside on the life of an ambitious young policeman who. Music is interesting and editing is a trend in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is sometimes slow and the dilemma that Anbu faces when it comes to Maya is sometimes exaggerated. But I would still give it to 9/10 just because he has many firsts to his credit.
