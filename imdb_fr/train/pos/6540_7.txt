To be honest, I had to go see this film in reverse, I did not expect too much, but hey, I'm not mistaken, I had fun. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is really a cool breeze, despite some attempts to modernize Nancy Drew, but I remember those youth films of the 60s and 70s of Europe and Quebec, where they manage to make their children talk to adults. In this case, a 16-year-old girl tries to do justice by trying to solve a mystery about the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. In any case, as his father had business in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a mystery behind the doors? At least Emma Roberts does a great job here. A bit like the chubby kid, who at first was naively brought to bear the pranks of his sister in Nancy, but in the end, found Nancy cool enough to stay with her, even with her stuff ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is awesome and was happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook play a different role this time: a single mom (she did it in Family Rescue, but this time she plays a mature woman ...). do not throw it away, it's fun!
