While the glittering chemistry between Ryan and Robbins is reason enough to see this film, the secondary cast (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and the hilarious trio of Jacobi, Saks and Maher) is an added bonus. Matthau shines like Einstein, Fry is perfect as Ryan's fianc√© and Einstein's gonad Shalub's sentence is, as noted, one of the highlights of the film. The speech that Robbins utters during his first appearance in public is pure poetry. Congratulations to the editors for treating this mousse with spirit and lightness. I also thought Keene Curtis was wonderful as Eisenhower. It could be considered a kind of chick movie, but I think everyone will take a hit. Eight very solid points.
