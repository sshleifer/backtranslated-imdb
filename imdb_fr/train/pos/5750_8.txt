But the rest of us, who love a good emotional and emotional story that is a lock for you to cry .. enjoy! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is gorgeous as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling, and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, a doctor who works very long hours. <br /> <br /> Because of Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is often alone and tends to use his judgment. He just wants to be a good boy, do what is right and make his brother proud of him. He stops at the church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly that the character makes you cry even before the movie really begins. <br /> <br /> I do not intend to give anything here, but the film is extremely engaging, sad and heartbreaking. Those who are not afraid of these things will spend a fantastic day with this beautiful story, its adorable characters and a great song that I can not quote here, it has nothing to do with the film but is strangely appropriate. .. but you hear it in a bar. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie because it was for "Amadeus", I thought it could give him the path to victory. No chance. Liotta is just as good but has less emotional impact, but he will do it later. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does not have much of a part here, but it was nice of her to give her name to a little drama shot in Pittsburgh on two brothers that you will never forget.
