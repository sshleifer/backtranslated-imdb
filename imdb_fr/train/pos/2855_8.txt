An entertaining and substantial film, Non-Stop has made deserving comparisons with "Run Lola Run". The film quickly develops into a chase sequence in which viewers discover the three main characters through flashbacks and reverie sequences. The pursuit serves not as a fast-paced climax, but as a trip that constitutes the majority of the film. During the "run", we see the characters grow up and momentarily forget their monotonous life, the "macho" roles in which they engaged, and finally forget why they started running. As if the fight provided a "clarity" to the characters of "Fight Club", the race provides the characters in this film a way to move away from the false values ​​that we allow society to create for us. Their race is a way to really enjoy life in a clear perspective, and all three find a little clarity and joy in the process. <br /> <br /> My appreciation and pleasure only weakened at the end of the film, where, instead of drawing lessons from their experience, the characters seem to come back to play these false macho roles that I thought have escaped from their course. <br /> <br /> Yet the only real problem with this movie is that it was not distributed outside of Japan earlier.
