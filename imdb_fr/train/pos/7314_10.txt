The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention above all else. I was expecting a gore fest, but instead, I had the chance to watch an extremely intelligent killer with a scary soundtrack (it's actually my ringtone for now: P). The fact that I can not predict when he would kill and when he would disappear was a major asset in my book. Predictable horror movies annoy me. Now I know there are inconsistencies in the script, but if you're like me, you will not even notice them long after the movie ends and you'll be in bed saying you've seen a masterpiece movement. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. This is one of my favorite theatrical scores of all time, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie leaves it intact in his remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very complete article on the subject and, now that I know that Mr. Zombie worships John Carpenter, I hope a lot of his interpretation of this classic. This film is ideal if you crave tingling, but it's the perfect addition, the opening, the finale, that you call it a All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)
