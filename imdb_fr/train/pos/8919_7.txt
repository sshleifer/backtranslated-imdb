Who would think that Andy Griffith's Helen Crump (Aneta Corsaut) already had a Steve McQueen movie? But this is just one of the many weird and wonderful aspects of the ultimate film about teenagers and creatures in the 1950s, which could best be described as Rebellious without a Cause God knows what extra space -atmospheric. The rebel is Steven McQueen (who would soon decide that "Steve" sounded less pretentious), a good boy with just enough craziness to be interesting; the very healthy but understanding girlfriend is the aforesaid Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their appointment was turned upside down by teenagers, but they are much less confused when they find themselves facing a gelatinous "What Is It" that eats, which rides on its own meteor - and begins to engulf the townspeople right and left. But will adults believe it? Of course not, what do they know, they are only children! <br /> <br /> The movie is really bad. The actors take the rather pretentious scenario, with many wondering looks, very seriously, and the distribution of "the adult" probably says "Children!" very third sentence or so. But the true pleasure of the film is its creature, which is well imagined, well executed and often manages to generate a surprising suspense. And while it's noticeably cheaper (look at these miniature sets, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a pretty good movie - and there's that catchy little catchy song for good measure. The crowd of more than 40 years (me included) will enjoy the film with nostalgia, but that will not prevent them from going to dress with the young scene with its sensibility of the 1950s with the milk and the white bread, and the film would be a great choice for a family movie night or a more sophisticated "adults only" meeting. Make a lot of Jello cubes for nibbling at the movies! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
