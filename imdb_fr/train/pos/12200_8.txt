By the time The Lady of Shanghai was in the making, the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth was disintegrating. The film was as much an effort by Welles to revive the old flames as to make a classic black. Not very well received at the time, The Lady of Shanghai has more and more rave reviews over the years. Improved with age, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Welles is Irish sailor Michael O'Hara, who on a fatal night saves beautiful Rita Hayworth from three attackers in Central Park. The sparks fly, but the thrill ensues, it turns out that the lady is married to Everett Sloane, a crippled but brilliant criminal prosecutor. Nevertheless, Sloane apparently takes a liking to Welles and hires him to run his yacht. <br /> <br /> So far, this movie is starting to look a lot like Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and was not thinking about his male member at the time, he would have returned to the sailor's hiring hall in Lower Manhattan. Instead, he finds himself involved in a pretty canvas or intrigue and is facing two murders, Sloane being his eminent counsel. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Welles decided that his wife would be a blonde in this movie. Supposedly Harry Cohn landed on the roof, because Rita was known worldwide for her coppery red hair. It may have spoiled the picture as he joined the legion of studio directors who saw the vision of Welles' independent film threaten their power. <br /> <br /> Actor Glenn Anders plays Sloane's partner, Grisby dude, he wraps a corpse. The other corpse here is Ted DeCorsia, a private investigator who is trying to start his own business. It's a good black thriller, showing Rita at her best glamor, even if she was blonde. right here. The final shooting in the mirror room is beautifully staged, but I would not recommend seeing it if we use a controlled substance.
