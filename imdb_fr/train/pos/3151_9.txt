I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was funny! When I first saw it, it was ETV (Estonian TV) and I started to like it. Too bad this show is in bad weather for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes on stupid ideas. He had those glasses that are brown. I love it . And there is FeZ. The perverse group. We all know what he does when he is alone ..... He wants to be fucked. He even had it with his boss in an episode. He comes from India. And there's Michael, the dumbest guy in the group, probably the dumbest guy in town and his cop! He's so stupid that I remember the following: Hyde said: Did you call cops? - No, Michael comes in and says. Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? He is a playboy of the city. Then comes Jackie, Michael's former girlfriend, and then Hyde's girlfriend. Next is Eric Who, son of a grumpy war veteran and son of Kitty, the housewife. Her a big pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend with whom they plan their wedding. Donna is a hot girl. Hmm what am I forgetting? ah Hyde lives in a basement.
