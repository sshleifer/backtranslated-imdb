I loved watching this movie. He has a great direction, by the already known Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it is precisely in Spain that the film unfolds, to be more precise, in Catalonia. <br /> <br /> Luna explores again the theme of an obcession, in this case the obcession of a young boy for women Milk. There are certain psychological concepts in this story, such as the rejection complex that the eldest son feels with the birth of his brother. In the film, this leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees that all the milk of his mother goes to the son who has just been born. He begins to look for a breast that can feed him. He finds it in a recently arrived woman and the film revolves around that. <br /> <br /> This film lives many images, more than the story itself, the viewer captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the film deserves a thorough analysis of almost everything that happens because it usually means something ...). The surroundings, the typical landscapes of the region as well as the surrealistic behaviors of the characters, also symbolic, and the excellent soundtrack sound of Nicola Piovani transport us in another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but that cuts it back in time in time. at times ... It's worth living in this world, it's worth watching this movie, even if we are eventually tired and a little sick by this excessive obcession, which may be taken beyond limits ... <br /> <I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist ... 8/10
