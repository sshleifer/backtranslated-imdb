Just to mention one last thing about the gentleman Jim. I agree with all the reviews that make it one of Errol Flynn's best rides in a career of great outings. I think the role of boxer Jim Corbett looks more like his true personality than the swashbucklers he was the main character. Flynn seemed like a party animal and was a guy whose real life was more exciting than his life on screen. The extra thing I wanted to point out is the big montages, transitions and insets that mark the film. Although the director is Raoul Walsh, a frequent contributor to Flynn and director of photography Sid Hickox, the editing was done by a promising editor by the name of Don Siegel. I never knew that Siegel had gone so far back, but he is registered in the credits. He would pursue a career as a director himself.
