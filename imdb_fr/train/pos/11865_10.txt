One day, I heard some friends say that "Scarface feared ... an idiot tried to create another Godfather in the early 80s". Now, I usually listen to the idiots / look CNN, so I decided to stay away. Then my companion handed me the DVD and said: "It's number 1 with the pelicangs", confused, I tried it. THIS IS THE BEST FILM EVER DONE. It's more realistic than all this bullshit about stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in this area could afford (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) There is still a bit of humor ... ie the Pelicangs and the light music of the 80s. What's better, what's better than Al Pacino brandishing a m203? I give this ***** a **** on, perfect for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
