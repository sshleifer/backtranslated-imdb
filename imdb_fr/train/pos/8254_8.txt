Located in a middle class neighborhood of Willard's imaginary city in the 1950s, this light-touch black comedy plays with American obsessions such as gun mania and violence, materialism and following the Jones , fear of others, slavery, golf, and the elimination of the dead. Yes, it seems a little heavy, but believe me, it's almost as light as a feather. <br /> <br /> Zombies occupy an important place among the characters. Critical questions are: who will become a zombie (90% of Willard residents choose this final route, while only 10% prefer a traditional burial)? Who owns how many zombies do their jobs like robots (they have become a mark of social status)? And what is the range of possible relationships that can be established between the living and the kinds of reincarnated dead? <br /> <br /> In a way, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the animated screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), makes sure that this unlikely material continues to circulate for one hour and half without fearing once. good laugh Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the main actors, helped by the young K'Sun Ray in the role of Timmy, the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as a fair witness to all the madness of adults. (After seeing her only in "Memento" and "The Matrix", I did not know that Mrs. Moss had such beautiful actress chops.) <br /> <br /> The design of the production and the music are a beauty of the 1950s. Maybe this one is not for everyone. It will surely be a difficult film to beat for my annual Bizarro Prize. But smart comedies that stay entertained from start to finish are among the most difficult achievements in filmmaking. For me anyway, "Fido" is a pleasure! My notes: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (Seen on 30/01/07)
