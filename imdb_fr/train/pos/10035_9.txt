I think James Cameron may be becoming my favorite director because it's my second review of his films. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. It was one of all the news and one of the biggest tragedies of all time. Well, James Cameron has decided to make a film but features two fictional characters so that they are in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, let's go back to the main criticism, but let me remind you that all this is an opinion and that there is no fact and that the only fact that will be present is an event of the film. <br /> <br /> Our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not too annoying, but watch this and you will discover why they could become boring (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain, I suppose, is bad luck, fate, the hand of God (no blasphemy is intended), or just Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all the above and what do you get ?! Oh yes! We have a love story on a boat in distress. The secondary characters are: Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber), my favorite, Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill) Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and many others. We also had the current treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is great, especially in the second half, the drama as well. In the end, you can let your eyes fall on rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter searches for the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her story about the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship. Everything about history works and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic, an amazing 86%
