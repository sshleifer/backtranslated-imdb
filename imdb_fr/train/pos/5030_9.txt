Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It's not the same old recycled shit coming out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on video because I did not even know it until I saw it in my local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it. The suspense is built and the final twist is excellent. <br /> <br />
