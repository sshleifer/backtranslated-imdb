The critics of this film are the ones who do not understand the movie to begin with. These are people who love blockbusters and who are opposed to any film that is not interpreted by Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a pretty little movie that may seem strange and maybe even stupid at first, but what it lacks in the plot, it largely offsets in substance. <br /> <br /> One thing in particular in the film impressed me was its use of music, which plays a big role. Students in film music will notice the importance of music in the film, in the life of Vida and Wilder, as well as in the background. The Wilder, Vida and Wallace themes are all heard in the opening sequence and it's fun to see how certain lyrics are played out. For example, in the scene where the men sing "Duke of Earl", Vida is with Wilder when the men are singing something like "She's my daughter", then she goes to Wallace to give her something when the men are singing the song. lyrical "She'll be my girl" cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers There are all sorts of small complexities like this in the film, and although it may look like a flop on the outside, the real student of the film will notice how good this movie really is.
