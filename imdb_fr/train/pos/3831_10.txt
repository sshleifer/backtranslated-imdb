This is a free adaptation of Clarence Mulford's novels; Fans of Willaim Boyd's films will probably feel a bit at sea here (and critics have reflected it so far). But I knew Hopalong first in novels and I had never been much interested in Boyd's movies once I contacted them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a wise choice: he did not make a nostalgic "western". ; instead, he approached Cassidy's story as a slice of what we once called "Americana"; or what older critics used to call homepun. As the film unfolded, I remembered more and more the excellent version of Mark Twain's "Roughing It" "Hallmark Theater", starring James Garner. <br /> <br /> These two films remind us that about the "old west" are probably always mythical for Americans, they do not necessarily have to be "westerns"; they may very well be just movies about what it means to be American at this time, at this place. <br /> <br /> I never let myself go to watch this movie; we make no effort to leave the Boyd-Cassidy legacy to ourselves, no irony, no camp. As a result, I have the impression that these characters have walked - or mounted on horseback - in a true Western America that I could have walked a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Given the clarity of the film, it positively avoids all that we have learned to call "style" - is to his advantage; and the simple play of the artists fits perfectly with that; My God, it really looks like a story told around a campfire on a cattle ride - no visual dressings, just the quirks and good mood - and the sudden violence - that we expect from a good narration of a adventure thread. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and if the spectator puts aside his unfulfilled expectations, he will find a considerable pleasure. <br /> <br /> I would have given this film 9 stars, but I give it a ten just because most critics here have completely missed the point; and I urge them to leave their memories of Boyd aside and give the film another chance. <br /> <br /> Note 1: A critic complained that Hopalong killed dead people in this movie, rather than shooting guns at their hands (Boyd's Cassidy); first, Cassidy slays people in novels; secondly, if Cassidy was a real cowboy, he would have shot people - the problem with firing guns from people's hands is that they can still get another weapon - which is part of subtext of this movie itself. <br /> <br /> Note 2: I recognize that I am jealous of the Coppola family, that they have among them the director of the movie "The Godfather" who can give them every opportunity to make films that I do not can not; but a good movie is a good movie; and it's a good movie. If it's called "Coppola", well, it's like that. America is the country of opportunities (or was, until Bush took office) - that's what great American novels are.
