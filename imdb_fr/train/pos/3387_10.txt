A truly amazing film, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening. An extremely overpopulated world, unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer and all our natural resources spent. In this nightmarish degenerate society, the great Charlton Heston appears as a sympathetic black-film detective who seeks to uncover the truth behind a murder, as opposed to the legendary film noir Edward G Robinson who performs a final performance. <br /> <br /> One of the images that will always stay with me in this film is the mass of people who populate the stairwells and the way Thorne (Heston) has to go through them every time he uses them. <br /> <br /> The use of music by the film is also worthwhile, although it does not contain any score in the usual sense. The opening theme is good, and the later music clips that we have here in Simonson's apartment, and in particular Beethoven's works in the euthanasia clinic, are remarkable. atmospheric.
