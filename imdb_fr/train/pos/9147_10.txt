As a big fan of Prince for three or four years, I really can not believe I just went to watch "Purple Rain". The brand new 2-disc anniversary edition led me to buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to watching the video, but I was not prepared to see how electric it was. Prince's musical performances throughout the movie are simply amazing - he REALLY has the moves in this one. I know very well (from repeated plays) the classic album "Purple Rain" and all his songs, but seeing them in the context of the film completely changes your perception of tunes and lyrics - like COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES WHEN CAN CRY AND PURPLE RAIN himself? There is something mesmerizing indescribably in the scenes where Prince and The Revolution play. The end songs, BABY I'm A STAR and I WILL DIE MIEU, show how much the Prince's talent and energy spilled over at the age of 20 (he was overflowing!), It blew me away. It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even at the height of his years. <br /> <br /> Prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams - drive her to the lake, make her jump, then get away - absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very 1980s and are unintentionally hilarious, but that adds to the movie's overall appeal. Morris Day is the neighborhood's hottest cat (and hilarious), and when his band The Time performs THE BIRD, you can see Morris Day and Jerome Benton light up the funk-like scene in Minneapolis - I love their dance in this Benton provides Morris with a mid-performance mirror. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to watch it again, I really can not! The extras are great - especially when you see a young Eddie Murphy, a Beverly Hills policeman, admitting he's a "groupie Prince".
