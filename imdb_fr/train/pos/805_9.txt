We often remember the "Return of the Jedi" for what he did wrong rather than good, and it's a shame, because the last chronological article of the Star Wars saga is a shining example of an epic story. He manages to summarize all the stories of the previous films in a grand finale and does so very convincingly. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that have undoubtedly served to expand the Star Wars demographic. - and in the middle the film tends to slow down a bit. But the last hour is probably the best piece of the saga, where Luke finally meets Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The Return of the Jedi has done so many things that people tend to neglect: it has presented an incredible conclusion to the scenario of Darth Vader (which went from slightly improbable in "Empire Strikes Back" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterful performance by Ian McDiarmid Emperor, Luke finally tackling his, Solo and Leia's romance resolution, and the last extremely powerful moments on Endor's moon. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is light trouble. But it is the troubles of a generation of moviegoers who have had time to nibble each scene. It is always a magical and moving piece of cinema that is also an excellent final chapter. It's not a "good" movie - it's fantastic!
