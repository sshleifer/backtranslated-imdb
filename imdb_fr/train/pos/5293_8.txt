It's a very light comedy about a wonderful family who has a son named Pecker because he uses Peck for his food. Pecker enjoys taking pictures of people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, and manages to catch the eye of a group of art lovers in New York. Pecker has a cute sister who just craves for SUGAR and is in fact an ADDICT, taking spoonfuls of sugar in a bag. There are scenes of men showing their jockey's bumps with grinding movements and girls doing pretty much the same thing. It is rather difficult not to lose the head with this film, but it does not matter, it is only a movie to make you laugh a simple photo taken in 1998.
