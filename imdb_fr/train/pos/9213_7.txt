Gómez Pereira is responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of the last Spanish cinema (just take a look at his curriculum vitae). So I did not expect a lot of "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... I do not know why, in the world, I decided to watch it. In any case, I just did it ... And what a surprise. It seems that Gómez Pereira is finally mature and that he is now able to make a good movie. His latest work deals with the midlife crisis, the disappointment and the search for a second chance after ruining everything. The last part of the film (the most dramatic) is the best part, and it's worth watching the movie. We also have Eduard Fernandez who plays the main role and I still think he is the best actor of his generation (by far). <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
