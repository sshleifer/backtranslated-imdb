Yes, it's a very small budget film. Thus, the acting is not an award-winning film and sometimes the action is slow because the filmmakers shoot longer sequences and not a million moments that are then mounted in a film. This film catches up with an exceptional scenario that takes vampirism seriously, explains it and develops all the intrigue. In addition to the vampire story, we have detailed information on genetics, laws and laws, martial arts actions, philosophical reflections and good metal music. Congratulations to Dylan O'Leary, director / writer / lead actor. I do not see how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well. I think that to appreciate this film, you have to be versed in all kinds of themes to see that the author has done a lot of research and is aware of all these things. There's also great camera work, interesting camera angles and an underwater vampire attack - something I've never seen before, but that pays tribute to the underwater zombie attack of Zombie of Fulci. The cast is good, as far as the sexy woman is really sexy. The main vampire also seems perfect for the role. The female victim looks vulnerable. My only complaint is that for a low-budget horror film, there should have been more nudity. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a beautiful story, this movie is for you. I look forward to seeing Mr. O'Leary's future plans.
