This show is beautiful. It contains some of the best writings I have ever seen. He was brilliantly staged by Dvid Trainer, who also directed another smart television series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This show is without the slightest wonder. Like THREE'S COMPANY, ROSEANNE and the famous COSBY SHOW, television will remain so for a long time. <br /> <br /> Perfectly designed jokes for the beautiful shows you dream of, there is no doubt that this show is wonderful for people who lived in the seventies and the others. This show appeals to young and old. A perfect show.
