I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival, where it was applauded! This film tells a story that, to my knowledge, has never been told before, namely the uprising of the German fairer, married to a Jew at the end of the Second World War, in Rosenstrasse. As such, this is a unique story, and what's more, is the only movie on the Holocaust I've ever seen that shows that there were GOOD Germans (the helping family in " Anne Frank ", for example, was Dutch) who did NOT support the Nazis, and in fact, had the courage to stand up against the immorality and brutality of their country during the Nazi regime, risking their lives . The acting is awesome at every level, the storyline in New York is interesting and complex, the direction of Von Trotta masterful in every scene and the production values, including the superb cinematography, are exceptional. Of course, the family in New York could speak German. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their mother tongue with their family - a common phenomenon. So this criticism is unjustified. To say more would spoil the experience. The film is long, but I did not watch my watch once. I hope this film will be distributed in North America, as this film is not only a masterpiece, but it can also help heal any animosity that people have towards the Germans because of their support for Hitler. If this movie is playing in your area, PLEASE SEE IT! You will be glad to have done it!
