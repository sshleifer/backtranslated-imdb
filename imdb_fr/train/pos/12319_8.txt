First of all, the female lead role is too good to miss. Now, actress Wang Zu Xian, the one who played Xiao Qian in the film, is 42 years old and is well old. It is always good to review these glorious times when looking at such old-fashioned Hong Kong productions. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential titles of the 1980s. The decoration of artistic decorations and other aesthetic facets are fascinating. More fantastically, the film had a totally humorous black undertone. It's like being in a horror movie, but in the end it's not scary, just fun. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of translating the second script of "A Chinese Ghotst Story" and I thought this script was a decent script. However, when I saw the film, I was initially disappointed to see it different from the screenplay, as on a smaller scale and involving more comic roles. However, it has been better executed in terms of entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Lord of the Rings, you'll notice the similarities between this movie and LOTR. The climax is like Miranda Otto's mirror fighting the Ring Witch. It's really a loud laugh. Bravo!
