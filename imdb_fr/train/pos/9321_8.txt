As romantic comedies go, it was a cute and winner. I thought the writing could have been stronger to make the final connection a bit better, but it's not a huge starting point. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf offer great performances and are always so charming. These are two of my favorite actors and I'm glad to see them interpreted as romantics. I hope to see them soon in more projects. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will not change your life, but it is sweet, warm and winning. Not a bad thing to be at all.
