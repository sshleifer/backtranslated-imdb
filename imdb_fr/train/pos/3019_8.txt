For starters, I really liked the göta kanal 1, it contained a lot of classic jokes, including the unlucky canoe that always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, it still plays the same guy in the göta kanal 2 movie, but to in my opinion, his performance is not as funny as in the first movie, in fact, you do not notice it at all. One thing that made me think about this movie is the choice of boats. In this film, there are only racing boats, they are fast, but these do not make waves like the big floating mansions used in the first film, I liked the old ones the best and these new boats make one of the last ridiculous scenes when the canoe man suddenly jumps to escape the "big waves" of these small fast boats. Really a minus. You must accept the fact that we do not live in the same Sweden as in 1974. This film also contains a little more violence than the first. Although the movie was great overall. I just focused on some disadvantages that disappointed me, but the rest of the film was up to my expectations, so go see it! It's worth the money.
