When Sabrina first appeared on our screens, I was about 12 years old so I spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch enter into all kinds of strange situations. <br /> <br /> It was always one of my favorite programs, the seedy sixties sitcom 'Bewitched' but this time the character was cooler. I always loved Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and laid back, which made her nice to watch. The characters at first were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, the playmaker, Salem and Mr. Poole (my favorite, pity he's gone so early) Hilda and Zelda, her aunts have started well, but have become irritating. <br /> <br /> I liked it. Mr. Kraft too, for he was always a little closer to discovering Sabrina's secret. What I liked about the first three series was the original ideas, the discovery of the family secret and the learning of new spells, but as time went on, it became more predictable. Too many characters came in and out, such as Valerie, Dreama and Brad, and then they decided to do Sabrina in college, which ruined her for me. no spell book, no aunts living with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were boring. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring and I was just watching what was happening at the end. Not having Hilda and Zelda seemed to be wrong one way or another and Miles was gone like that. The last episode made me feel better (SPOILER) seeing Sabrina meet with Harvey on her wedding day. Dardard, Aaron, it was great! Overall, a good program if you forget the last poor series of two or three series, which reminded me of so many teen shows. Magical.
