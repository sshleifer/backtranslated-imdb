This one tends to be criticized by many critics and fans of Kurosawa, but I thought it was wonderful. This is an episodic, multi-character study of Tokyo's poorest, living in a city literally made of garbage. Although it sounds like an atomic bomb, the film has a kind of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound of the crazy young man driving an imaginary chariot through the slum. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories captivating, but the most tragic is perhaps the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car. When they are not looking for food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build the house of their dreams. A beautiful emotionally moving film.
