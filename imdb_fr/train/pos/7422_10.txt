As a longtime fan of Barbra, any ad like this will be biased. That aside, this movie is considered a classic. It has its flaws (underlined in other messages), but gives a glimpse of an era (late 70s) that will never be there again, and it is fascinating to see unfold on the screen. <br /> <br /> Streisand fought hard to make this film his own. I do not think she was ever satisfied. But this gives his fans a new Barbra (for the time) with LIVE singing, a whole new look and very heavy roles. <br /> <br /> The story is tough, but exciting and interesting. all along. It's hard for most non-Barbra fans to attend this extended finale, but it says a lot for those who admire her talent. <br /> <br />
