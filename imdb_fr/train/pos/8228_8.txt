difficult to tell you more about this film without spoiling it. I enjoyed it because I was not expecting what I saw, but at an ordinary sexual drama, so ... It's a pscyho sexual thriller, in which nothing seems to be what it seems. It features Emmanuelle Seigner, a stranger (and nudity) in which her husband, Polanski, had directed. And a frightening performance (I told scary / yes CREEPY) of Toreton (actor Bernard Tavernier). Looks like a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), a misplaced Chabrol or a Clouzot thriller (I saw someone mention The Diabolics), but closer to The Frownless Eyes of Georges Franju godfather of Dr. Phibes and more). A gem! I'm just afraid they'll blow this into a Hollywood remake like they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
