This film was not much promoted here in Greece, even if it had good actors, a good scenario and a good photo was not a film called "blockbuster" in my country. The film itself is very powerful, that's about all that a newcomer had to live on when he returned to his home village after being released from his 5-year prison sentence (drug). The end is rather sad ... Mourikis tries to take his role and he manages it pretty well ... Lambropoulou is awesome and very sexy in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas is for once closer to excellence. .. 7 out of 10 because very few Greek films can make such an impression!
