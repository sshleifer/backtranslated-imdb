Superman and mole-men are probably the most difficult adventures of Superman to date. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, home to the deepest oil well in the world. There, radioactive mole-men cross the oil well and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other townspeople are trying to get rid of the mole invaders. Can Superman change people's habits in time to save men-moles? Can Superman warn people in time of the radioactive danger that moles bring? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and the mole-men is a very intelligent film, well written and well played. Even though we only see Superman fly once, it's still a big adventure for Superman. A must for everyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars
