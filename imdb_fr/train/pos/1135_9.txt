I saw it for the first time at the cinema when it came out, and the crowd was really in the film, which made the experience even more fun. It's an excellent cast of characters, with many big names, some of which were not as well-known as they are now. I think it's a good idea to add it to your watchlist if you follow one of these actors or if you liked it in other movies. Some scenes remind me of the kind of well done comedy like in The Birdcage or even The Clue, a kind of funny comedy with spontaneous appearance, with a really professional performance of these beloved actors. The film did a great job in giving you an insight, maybe even very realistic, about the culture of a daytime soap opera.
