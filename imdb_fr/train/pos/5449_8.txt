Did you know that the father of Anthony Kiedis (singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) is in this film? Blackie Dammit, is the father of Anthony. I noticed this after reading Anthony's autobiography of "Scar Tissue" and saw a picture of his father. I thought, "Well, this guy looks a bit like the movie I saw in the '80s. Then I read more and it was said that his father was an actor who had some small roles After looking at this site and compared to a searching on the net, I realized that it was really his father in the movie.It's funny, because nowhere in the book is it mentioned that He was in this movie, maybe his son was ashamed of his father's acting role in this movie, but I think his father, Blackie, did a great job in the show.
