I recently bought this DVD, one of my favorite movies of all time. As usual, during the viewing, everything really blew me away. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack of this movie makes me cry, especially the title "Will You". It's a pure journey of nostalgia for me in my youth. This is the second best place for Quadrophenia (who also played with Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> An excellent soundtrack and a wonderful view of Britain during the Thatcher years of the 80s in which I grew up. The end is so sad that for hours after the end of the movie, I'm like a baby who is chipping. <br /> <br /> I intend to use this DVD after several views. I can watch it again and again and never. be bored, just for the soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, sorry to hear about your darling dad. God bless you all. xx
