I have to hand it to the creative team behind these "American Pie" movies. "Direct To DVD" is usually synonymous with making inexpensive and incompetent movies. Yet last year, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I took full advantage of the sequel to the DVD "The Naked Mile". Filmmakers took the opportunity to present a captivating but amusing film. This year, they propose the follow-up "Beta House". This is the honest truth: "Beta House" gives the impression that the first films of "American Pie" look like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> It's an essential game, tasteless and without laughing. Of course, the story is a bit thin, but that's the beauty of it. In the first 10 minutes, we discovered all the main characters, the new supporting characters, a handful of hot gags, an encounter with the bad guys and the establishment of the general plot. With all this away, the film becomes a boundless tour. The gags are an abundance and they have not abstained in this one. I am talking about male sperm, urine, dildos, chicks with cocks, sex with sheep, female orgazim sprays and so much more. Not to mention the fact that not a minute goes without breasts or sex scene. <br /> <br /> John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (similarly) are coming back from "The Naked Mile". supportive role as the latest movies). The whole cast does a good job. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has great energy and a remarkable presence on the screen. I predict good things to him. The film is also full of excellent references for those who keep their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh of the movie for me was the parody "The Deerhunter". Classic. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you're a fan of the show, you'll feel right at home with "Beta House". It really pushes the boundaries of good taste, but in the end it's really funny.
