Documentary net and well done on the pearls of Mardi Gras. I've always liked this approach to filmmaking - communicating ideas about a larger, more complex and often impenetrable phenomenon by breaking down the problem into something familiar and close to home. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the fundamental motives of profit and capitalism, as well as the effects of globalism on the poorest countries (few it matters how people think about it). Rather than expose on these subjects and mount on a platform (not that there is something wrong with it, except that such documentaries typically preach to converts), this documentary simply shows the pearls Mardi Gras, how they are made, by what people and under what conditions, and then how they are used by consumers at the end of the process. He is openly and radically investigating the motives of everyone involved in the process, including the workers, the factory management, the US importers, and finally the consumer at the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> I felt a little nauseated by that. ; both by the Mardi Gras revelers and by the way in which the workers in China have accepted their situation as normal and normal (even if they have some objections as to how they are managed). The pictures of the street sweepers cleaning up the street pearls at the end made a special impression. But it was only my reaction. I can see how someone else could read this documentary a little differently. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentaries on this subject, I do not think you need a specific political opinion to be affected by this. This is ultimately a story about human beings and our relationship to the goods we produce and consume. If you have already bought a product made in the Far East, this should give you food for thought. <br /> <br /> Exceptional and highly recommended. Need to see more documentaries like this. Congratulations to all who participated in the making of this film.
