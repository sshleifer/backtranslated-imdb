I find this film very pleasant. The plot is simple and easy to digest, the humor is light and clean, and because the story involving a mistaken identity is quite common, I find myself eager to see how this film gives substance to this story. Turns out to be very nice. The performance of the first female role is admirable; his portrait of an innocent and naive girl trying to fabricate white lies for David's sophisticated role was very charming. I also find that Vera dances very very well. I find myself tugged on her feet as she took the first steps on the stage, effortlessly and flawlessly. <br /> <br /> For those who are tired of today's desecrated films, you will enjoy this film thoroughly.
