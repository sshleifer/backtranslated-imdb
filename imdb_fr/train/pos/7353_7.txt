This film could be one of the most underrated films in Bollywood history. This blockbuster of 1994 had good performances, music and direction. I remember that I was in Allahabad when this movie was in progress. the people there were playing his song "Ooe Amma" to their loudspeakers at the highest volume. If someone who likes to watch Some Like It Hot and drool over Marilyn Monroe, he should see this movie.Thumbs Up to Govinda.As you are many to know that this movie was shot in South India and after Sholay he block movies like Silver Screen. With movies like these, Indian comedy could never be dead.
