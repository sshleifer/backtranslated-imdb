I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival. Hard to believe that this is Ms. Blom's first film as a director, it is beautifully punctuated and interpreted. A wide range of characters could be inspired by a novel by Anne Tyler, that is to say that they are superimposed on a history and possible futures, that there are no false notes, astonishing bursts of humor amid self-inflicted anxieties and real, even terrible dilemmas. If you have seen "The Best of Youth", you will recognize how well characters are drawn over small moments, even if the story is moving fast. I really hope it will be distributed in the United States. I live in a rather sophisticated movie market, but we rarely get Swedish movies.
