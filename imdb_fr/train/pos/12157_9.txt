The 1930s Adele elegant and elegant (beautifully interpreted by Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (the beautiful Shelley Winters, who plays with his usual histrionic panache) are the mothers of two killers. They abandon their disturbing past in the Midwest and move to Hollywood to create their own dance school for young starlets. Adele starts dating billionaire Lincoln Palmer (Dennis Weaver). For her part, Helen, a fanatic of religions, will soon sink into despair and madness. <br /> <br /> Director Curtis ("Night Tide", "Ruby") Harrington, inspired by Henry Farrell's astute scenario (author of the book "What Happened to Baby Jane?") is based on and co-wrote the screenplay for "Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte"), concocts with talent a complex and captivating psychological horror thriller about guilt, fear, repression and amok religious fervor. The lead actors have a ball with their colorful roles: Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous speech teacher, Agnes Moorehead as a radio evangelist of fire and severe sulfur, Yvette Vickers as a distraught and dominant mother of a raw star child, Logan Ramsey a snoopy detective, and Timothy Carey as a scary tramp. A talent recital developed with Pamelyn Ferdin (Lucy's voice on "Peanuts" television cartoons) acting as the host and the original of the "Friday 13" victim, Robbi Morgan making a ruthless impression on Mae West highlight. The fantastical score of David Raskin, a fantastic scene with Reynolds performing an incredible tango in a chic restaurant, the delightful atmosphere of the period of the Depression, the superb cinematography of Lucien Ballard, and especially the surprising end macabre, are also valid for his money excellent and efficient. The MGM presents this great gem on a great double DVD movie with "Whoever Slew Tuntie Roo?" Both images are presented in net widescreen transfers with their theatrical trailers.
