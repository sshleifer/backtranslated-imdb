I've been watching it many times since I thought it was a stupid, ugly and dated romantic comedy. It's a romantic comedy, maybe a bit dated. However, he is not too sentimental, touching as on the themes of office politics, adultery and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that holds your interest, and everything does not go as planned. But there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who does not like this movie, think seriously about how you want to know him.
