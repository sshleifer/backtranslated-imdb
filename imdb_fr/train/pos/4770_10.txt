The only show I've watched since 90210! Why did they interrupt it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like part of it! The least they should do is publish it on DVD! <br /> <br /> I checked similar shows, but nothing came close. The cast had an amazing chemistry and I waited impatiently for each episode. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake in shooting this show. If anyone has information on where I can get a DVD of North Shore, post a few lines here. Thank you! Aloha!
