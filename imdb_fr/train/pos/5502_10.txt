Whether this film is propaganda or not (I firmly believe that is not the case), it really shows the power of Media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how Chavez is a man. It's really to show how the Bolivarians have seen how it happened, how Chavez sees it. Although it may seem false and biased to support a film, I think the point of view presented in the film is completely legitimate. The Venezuelan people, through Venezuela's private press company, saw only one perspective of the coup d'etat, that of neoliberals. This film shows us the vision of Bolivarians. Call it propaganda, I say it's a call for judgment on your part.
