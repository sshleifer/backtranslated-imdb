As a pagan, I must say that this film has little or no magicke meaning. This is a "fun" film of witchcraft that is not meant to teach us anything, except that love is the most powerful of Magick and you should never use it in a controlling manner or revenge. This is a lesson that everyone must learn, not just the Gentiles. <br /> <br /> That said, this film is wonderfully written and executed with kindness by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold delivers a remarkable performance as Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many movie credits to mention except as Mrs. Jane Marbles of "Murder By Death") is wonderful as a neighbor on the Queenie floor, distracted but nevertheless capable of Mrs. Novak. Also starring Jack Lemmon (superb performance) and Jim Kovacs (brilliantly spiritual). <br /> <br /> "Witches can not cry, why, they can not shed a single tear, because their heart is full of Magick, they do not have time for stupid things like love. "Queenie. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are wizards in Manhattan. Deeply concealed in the secret underground world of Craft, they live among New Yorkers as one of them, without even causing a raised eyebrow. <br /> <br /> But then, comes Shepherd "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), an unshakable, flawless and dedicated businessman, who is engaged to Gillian's old academic rival. <br /> <br /> By a strange coincidence, he finds himself in the building of Gillian and is instantly "bewitched" by its charm and grace. Using the Magick, with a little help from Pyewacket (Robert E. Blair's familiar Gillian) and Queenie, Gillian starts working on this beautiful dream man to recover from his old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magick should never be used to control or hurt, and Gillian learns it the hard way, in the most bittersweet way. Not only does she have to deal with what she has done, but she must also face Shep in her guilt. <br /> <br /> From a critical point of view; However, the film takes a serious turn: the effects are very dated to the point of being a pure camp. Part of the landscape was apparently shot in the basement of someone's little house, but at least the characters were weird and funny. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, Pyewacket steals the show. Big cat! Excellent training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As trivia note, this is the root of the beloved television sitcom Bewitched. This introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All characters in the note are present and counted. You only have to watch, to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites and I watch it often. <br /> <br /> This film gets a 9.1 / 10 of. .. <br /> <br /> the demon :.
