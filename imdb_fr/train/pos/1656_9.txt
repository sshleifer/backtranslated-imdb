"Thieves and Liars" presents a very naturalistic description of the levels of corruption that affect many Puerto Ricans and forces them to make difficult or impossible choices about the lives of their loved ones. The cast is excellent, considering that some are non-professional actors; an excellent choice that increases the level of reality in the film. Photography propels history without intrusion, as it should be in this type of film. The script captures the particularities and attitudes of "Boricuas" in a very deep way. Sometimes it feels like watching a documentary! Looking at this film, you have the impression to have secretly entered the real Puerto Rican society and to watch it invisibly implode. I liked it!
