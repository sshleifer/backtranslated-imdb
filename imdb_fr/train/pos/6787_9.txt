I stumbled upon this last night of the TCM. <br /> <br /> I had not seen it since it was released, but I had never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> I had completely forgotten how talented Signe Hasso was when she was still young, ditto for Shelly Winters before she disappeared. <br /> <br /> But Ronald Coleman was the state actor par excellence of his time - I had read Othello in English High School - and hated him. After seeing "A double life", I read it again and finally understood what the piece was about. <br /> <br /> The Gordon / Kanin editorial team was at its peak when this script was finished - <br /> <br /> A film that is worth remembering and revisiting,
