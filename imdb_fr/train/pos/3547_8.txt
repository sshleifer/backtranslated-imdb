An entertaining musical where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000 to mount a floating shit game. He invites Sky Masterson to try to bring the army to salvation, played by Jean Simmons, with Masterson in Havana. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, Simmons would be back at the missionary's home in the fabulous "Elmer Gantry". She was there sister Sharon and here she is Sister Sarah. Same temperament, different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is this evil Nathan Detroit. He has been engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and hates his gambling habits. <br /> <br /> Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando, who really sang here! > <br /> The film is saved by a superlative choreography. These dance and singing routines are fabulous. They are specially made by Stubby Kaye and Nicely Nicely (Johnson). <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a very beautiful production.
