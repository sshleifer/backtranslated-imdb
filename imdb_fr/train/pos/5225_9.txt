I think this film is a very funny movie and one of the best movies of "National Lampoon", it also has a very catchy title, which basically summarizes what the whole movie is about .... Men In White !! !! The story is a parody of many movies, including a Will Smith movie, as you may have guessed, "Men In Black". I will not give the end, but it's a very good ending, it's very funny (humor like Leslie Nielsen) from beginning to end, especially the beginning of the beginning when you're in the street by train to collect garbage cans (garbage cans). In addition, they also have a trash truck (garbage collection truck) rather cool. The acting is not great, in fact, it's not very good, but it's what makes the film funny, it's a comedy, relax! I love the script, partly because it's so hard to get and partly because it's interesting how subtle they are (or should it be subtle), they rip all the other movies . I'm a big fan of parodic movies, but I'm also a fan of reality, and with this film, it's hard to decide which one is better, the movie is mostly ripped out (mentioned earlier in this review) or the film itself, but also when you make a parody of comic films, it makes it even more difficult, but this film succeeds. The two scavengers are so funny, it reminds me of a TV show in the UK called "Little Britain". This film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, funniest, funniest, best screenplay of the National Lampoon movie to date !!
