I do not know whether to recommend this movie to fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily identify some things about this movie as a very obvious scam "Tetsuo". The concept is similar, the editing is just as frenetic and fast - which is good, because in addition to making the film more dynamic, it masks some imperfections caused by a low budget and other factors. <br /> <br /> There is much more gore, less eroticism and, in the case of "Meatball machine", the transformation of the human being into a creature that is partly a machine (that you say something?) called "Necroborg" (very original) is caused by little gooey aliens. <br /> <br /> These small, slimey, space-scoops use human beings as ships for their gladiatorial games that they play with each other. They infest the body, somehow manage to insert a senseless amount of mechanical parts apparently pulling them out of nowhere and make it a killing machine that targets other Necroborgs. Their goal is to defeat another alien who is in another Necroborg, tearing him from the corpse and eating it. <br /> <br /> The plot seems all ridiculous and I did not expect much, but in the end, I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said before, it's a low-budget film, but it's still relatively decent. Do not expect a lot of actors, they are not usually very good, but that can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and the gore, some odd situations and the way the film is made and edited. Although the story is not too original, it has a certain charm, at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
