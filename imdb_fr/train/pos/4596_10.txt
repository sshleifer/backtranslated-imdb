This is the best film of Jackie Chan and my favorite. After the film "The Protector" directed by James Glickenhaus, disappointing in the United States, Jackie took over the concept and placed it in Hong Kong. It's also probably Jackies' most violent film, the public fearing the stunts. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his team really put all their effort into the design of the fight. Bones were broken and blood flowed during the making of this film, as you will see in the credits. <br /> <br /> The scenario is a case of simple cops and thieves, nothing special, after all, it was written around the action. I must say that the English version has crazy dubbing, but that should not delay you too much. <br /> <br /> So get the guys together, open the beers and enjoy them. By the way, the movie was nicknamed "Glass Story" by the stunt team. Why? I let you discover by yourself !!
