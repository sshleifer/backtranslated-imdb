There are at least two great movies with characters with an alcohol problem: "The Lost Weekend" (1945) with Ray Milland's superb performance and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with Jack's superb performance Lemmon. Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and his character's motives for drinking are shallow and cliche. In the end, the unforgettable "Written on the Wind" is only entertaining and is never a feature to be named in the Oscar. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words in the wind")
