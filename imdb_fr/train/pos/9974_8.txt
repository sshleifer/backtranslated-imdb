Of course, it was a remake of a movie from the '70s, but it had the suspense and action of a current movie, Breakdown says. He runs, desperate to be with his hospitalized wife, the police is the least concern. The lawsuits were very good, his part <br /> <br /> stuck in a rest stop was well done, the end of the film was a big cliffhanger. It's better than Bullitt, a boring movie with what, a muscle car chase that was badly filmed? The character of Vigo knew what he had to do to escape Johnny Law, few films had the effects of a night vision, CB radio-ok, I forgot the name of the film, the guy is 76 years old. The end is good, you can not say whether he's simulating suicide or not, a very good fact-he-the-fact-the-or-not.
