Of course, this movie was not like. 16 blocks, inside the man, an American obsession. etc ... <br /> <br /> But it's a big mystery that can happen to anyone of us .. I found this movie really awesome and scary. <br /> <br /> I live exactly where they filmed this movie "san pedro, California" and we heard real stories based on incidents from this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you've heard of the famous boat at Long Beach "Queen Mary". is haunted. I believe in spirits, illusions and parallels or if you spell that. is right. Everyone is in his own universe. <br /> <br /> and the mind is a powerful thing. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie. it's great, and not bad at all to lead. <br /> <br /> for those who rate it a 1. they do not understand the movie. its meaning. his plot, his view. and how life in the ocean can be bad for all of us. <br /> <br /> Ty. <br /> <br /> Victor
