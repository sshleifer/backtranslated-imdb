I watched the show 10 years ago and I loved it !!! I am now in possession of the DVD and I was watching the series. I was waiting for scenes that I knew were in the series (when Lucas confronts Gail in his house) and realized he was missing. Suddenly, I looked at the seduction without the lead. up. Then, I went to check all the BIOSes of the stars and I came across the comments that the emissions were down. Thank you!!!!! But there seems to be a conflict. Some comments say: "Strangler number 19, then Triangle 20, when another had placed them in the other direction, and also Potato Boy 5, and Dead to the World 6, were also reversed. ?????
