Classic example of an underrated film. <br /> <br /> Although we can watch this movie again and again, laugh every time and always see something new, it is still considered another funny image. And although the film has inspired many people and added its quotes and images to the pyche of all its audience, Moon Over Parador has still not received the praise it should receive. Even the brilliant cast with Richard Dreyfuss, an Oscar winner, and Raul Julia, to name but a few, is not able to change this perception. <br /> <br /> But after seeing Raul Julia and Roberto Strausmann make an offer to Richard Dreyfus, he can not refuse in a roadmender by reading him a good review of a role he once played, we do not can only come to a conclusion: it's timeless! In fifty years we will have the proof.
