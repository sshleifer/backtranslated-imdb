Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs I watch regularly on TV. The way all the main characters have something to do in each episode makes it so different from today's shows where they focus on one or two people per episode and where everyone else is sidelined. The way Mark's brain works is so obscure that you never really know what he's thinking, and if you think you know it, you're wrong. <br /> <br /> Diagnosis Murder has focused on a wide range of topics, not just in cases, but in each of the personal lives characters. From racism to adoption, to terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> With regard to the elderly? I'm 24 years old!! I do not think I can be classified as old again. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when they will release the 8 seasons on DVD (and not in NTSC) so I can watch them all in order. They seem to do it with many other programs from the same era, so can they hurry a bit!
