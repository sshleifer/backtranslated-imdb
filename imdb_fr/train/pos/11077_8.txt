First, do not go into Revolver hoping for another Snatch or Lock Stock, it's another kind of gangster movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the gala the other night and this film definitely divided the audience. This is the kind of movie where half of the audience will leave thinking WHAT? It was awful, and the other half will leave thinking WHAT? It was cool. Personally, I like movies that I do not understand, namely Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, so I enjoyed Revolver. <br /> <br /> But it certainly was not perfect. I've seen the big twist come up to a kilometer, at least a part of it, and although sometimes some unexplained details left unexplained are good, Revolver leaves MANY unexplained questions for no apparent reason. Some scenes, like the animation and the scene where Sorter launches into a killing (actually one of my favorites), though, great scenes to watch, just seemed to be there because they were great to watch, not because they fit well with the film. <br /> <br /> However, there were a lot of good things too. I thought the acting was superb from all the main actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (a pleasant surprise). This film definitely kept my interest, with an enchanting and action-packed scene. When Ray Liotta was under the table, wow ... well, you must see him. The scenario was extremely well done and the soundtrack, like most of Guy Ritchie's films, was excellent. <br /> <br /> A little below the movies like Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, it was still an impressive fast-paced action-packed psychological movie, with many twists and tons of scenes of which you will remember long after the end of the film.
