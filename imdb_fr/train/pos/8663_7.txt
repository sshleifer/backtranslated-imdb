"Rich in Love" is a film of life that plunges the viewer into the animation of a somewhat offbeat family from Charleston, South Carolina. Highly romanticized, beautifully shot, well written and performed, "RIL" cleans you like a summer breeze while its meanders without history give life to the characters so that at the end of the film, you will feel like an old friend of the family. <Br /> <br /> Beautifully designed film, directed by the director of "Driving Miss Daisy", "RIL" is a little "sleeper" somewhat obscure that will appeal most to a mature audience.
