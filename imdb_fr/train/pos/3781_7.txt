I would not dare say that this movie is better than the original, but it is very good in itself. The comedy in this film is just as good as the original, there are so many scenes that make me laugh, just think about it. <br /> <br /> The story of this film is even more bizarre than the original, but that's what makes it so great. Peter Hewitt does a great job in making this film with excellent distribution. The main actors of the original film find their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles. I do not care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is an excellent actor! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both films, as did Alex Winter's Bill. I was very happy to see George Carlin return to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr, who plays Ted Logan's father, does a great job. The scene where Ted has his father's body and Hal London Jr starts behaving as if Ted was a big scene and he's doing very well. I can not forget to mention William Sadler in Death, he completely directed the film for me. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first part of the Bill and Ted series, I hope you will like this movie too. But do not expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for your reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
