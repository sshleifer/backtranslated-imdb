Bette Davis turns into a coldly entertaining performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film looks rather dated in 2003. It certainly deserves to be watched by Bette Davis film buffs and fans, but it does not may not be as appealing to the average viewer. I was surprised how Ms. Davis looks young with this move. The actors perform sound performances and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is a good interpreter for Philip Carey, the club's medical student. It's a movie with a strong message about who we choose to love and why. However, "Of Human Bondage" did not seem to have a significant impact on me mentally or emotionally. I felt slightly indifferent and detached from the movie after watching it. I have the intuition that this may be the reaction the director was looking for. You are the judge! <br /> <br />
