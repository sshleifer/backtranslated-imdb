I do not know at all why this movie is so frowned upon by so many IMDb users (some say it's its "worst film ever") What did not you see Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid, and just an excuse to hang all the action sequences. Duh! What did you expect from the shit of a Jet Li movie? Did you really believe that someone had invented the story, then simply had it in charge? Of course not! Black Mask is a great action that lasts almost all the time of its execution. It's also deliciously horrible, and we have a lot of chopped limbs, beheadings and creative ways to watch the bad guys (and some innocent people too!) Get slaughtered. Most of Li's other martial arts films are a kindergarten compared to Black Mask; there is no restraint on gratuitous violence, bloodshed or action sequences whatsoever! And that made me a happy camper. Once again: if you go to a Jet Li movie hoping for a wonderful dialogue and intriguing plot, you're wrong. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his films (but beware of dreadful dubbing).
