I'm watching TV right now, watching Casomai. It is changing, it evolves or better ... d√©concentre. It begins with a courtly marriage of the two protagonists where their love story is told. After everything has changed, a child is born and everything else happens in pairs. This is not a special film because it speaks of a normal couple, and normality is at the center of this film. He does not want to show us anything special, there's nothing new, it's just a normal love story, the story of a couple and, being normal, it becomes different from the rest. It's also a blinking film, everything is short, each scene is only a few seconds long. It's a story, many things are known because friends and relatives talk about it, and their opinion is central, opinions create history and destroy it. It's a simple story of a couple, as I said, but it's not boring, it only shows a couple, should know everything, that's right, but I'm sure that every one of them you want to know what's going on, so do not forget to watch the end!
