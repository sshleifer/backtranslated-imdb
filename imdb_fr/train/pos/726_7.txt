Vince Lombardi High School has a new director - the devilish Mrs. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban all rock and roll music together. She takes the lead with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who LOVES the Ramones. In addition, the head of the school's football team (Vincent Van Patten) does not seem to be able to communicate with any girl - not realizing that the pretty Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him. <br /> <br /> An instant midnight movie. This was published in general and almost immediately bombed - but as a midnight movie, it was a huge success and continued to play throughout the 1980s. I remember attending more than one part of it when I was at university - it was like a party! People sang with the songs, laughed at each joke and enjoyed themselves in general. <br /> <br /> Seeing him now as an adult, I can not imagine why I loved that much. The scenario is juvenile and full of moans that I could not believe I was hearing. The characters change at random and the movie jumps everywhere. What saves that are some really fun lines and great performances from Soles and Woronov (who REALLY enjoy themselves). Moreover, everyone is full of energy and plays their role in an extraordinary way (as it should be). As for the Ramones, I have never been a fan. I like the title melody but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you are a fan of Ramones, you could give it a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is mainly for children (it has a PG rating) who will find it probably ridiculous but fun. I especially think that they will love the end when the high school will be burst! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood for a silly 80s midnight movie, you may like this. Otherwise stay away. I give him a 7.
