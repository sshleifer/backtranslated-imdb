After about seven rocky years on NBC, it was decided to make only one last installment. The series had been several times in the bubble because of the lack of numbers allowing it to qualify for one hour of television. He had always had a large and hard core of followers body. <br /> <br /> It was almost as if the series with the full title of "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET" (1993-1999) was a kind of "Mr. In-Between" series. It was too big to simply cancel, but too small to have a "Rabid Ratings Ravings" case. <br /> <br /> During the precarious period on Friday night, they had featured some of the most daring and audacious artists in hourly dramas. There, I said Artistic, Artistic !! But please, remember, we mean an artistic preaching, but not only false, pretentious, pedantic, politically correct. <br /> <br /> When finally, he was sure it was the end of the line for "HOMICIDE"; This great episode was prepared like these 2 hours made for TV Movie. <br /> <br /> Looking at the events of previous seasons and the parade of the usual characters, the production team came out and gave us what turned out to be a great start. <br /> <br /> OUR HISTORY? ?????. Joining the story, we find that Lieutenant Al Giardello, commander of the Baltimore homicide group, "pulled the pin," that is, he retired. But "G" is not ready to retire yet. Thus, instead of a rocking chair or a fishing rod, we discover that Al is a candidate for the mayor of "Charm City". <br /> <br /> While he was in town, making campaign stops and speeches, the former detective lieutenant took the bullet from an assassin. Living, but in a comatose state, he is taken to the hospital. <br /> <br /> The news spreads rapidly and, as if it were officially called, all detectives from the Baltimore unit we saw on the show come forward to offer their services and assistance. There is a great meeting of all these gumshoes, old and current, who follow and follow each track and each possibility of a track. <br /> <br /> The producer has found a way to care for those who died earlier by bringing their memory into the story. They have been able to answer long-standing questions and have even presented undisclosed questions here. The whole story sums up the series in a very satisfying and original way. But at least for now, we'll leave that as "classified". <br /> <br /> By packing everything in a pretty little package, this TV movie surely gets our approval. As for noting "THE HOMICIDE FILM", you must give it an A or a +, even. But, no matter the note here, he did not get a score as high as a typical weekly episode.
