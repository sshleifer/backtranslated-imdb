Pinjar is really a good movie, with good acting, good narration, good presentation, touching emotions, etc. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the quality of the films produced by Bollywood is improving considerably nowadays, and this film is one of the proofs. <br /> <br /> No Bollywood film that I remember had such an impact on me - I literally thought about the movie for hours - I marveled at the various emotional situations that put the man in the limelight. test a human. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the great role of Urmilla Matondkar and Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl from northern India in the background of the score. All problems seem sweet compared to the problems she faces. <br /> <br /> A must-see movie A technically superior Bollywood product, which, in my opinion, is comparable to the best films from other countries in the world.
