A strangely erotic gothic horror that will be appreciated by fans of Hammer House of Horror around the world. Seems to be an interesting interpretation of "Beauty and the Beast". This is definitely worth the look and surprisingly well played when taking into account the genre and the time. <br /> <br /> Corsets, castles, rutting horses, fake fur monsters raging in the woods, proof that no one had a Brazilian in the 70s, and more bodily fluids than you can shake , what more could you ask for ?! <br /> <br /> This certainly lit up my Sunday afternoon!
