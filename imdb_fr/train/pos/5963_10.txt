This movie is horrible, but you have to see it for that reason. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, just the biggest hunting scene of all time. When Eddie milked Tim, he was chased down the hall. Eddie puts obstacles on the agenda with hilarious consequences (like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player, buy the DVD and watch it in slow motion). The best obstacle is a spilled bucket of mop on which a jock jumps over but slips on the floor through a door. But when it slips, it picks up speed, defying physics (mainly friction); yet what is hidden behind the door is supreme. The steepest staircase of all schools of all time, this jock clearing in the air. In reality, he would probably die from a broken neck. Not only does it challenge all the concepts of reality, it makes the funniest sound ever made in this situation. Go buy this one. Believe me, this scene is worth your 6 dollars.
