A nice Batman animation movie. Not tied with "Return of the Joker" or "Mask of the Phantasm", but still strong. I liked how the movie let you guess who was Batwoman. There was a nice twist. Beautiful action sequences. I've always been of the opinion that Batman cartoons are better than Batman's pitiful sequences of real action movies. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
