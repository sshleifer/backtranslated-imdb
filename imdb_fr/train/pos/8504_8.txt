You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a tough-guy, secret agent of the United States, who is sent to discover the Nazi secret and reverse the trend of the Second World War. It means everything: coming out of a Nazi dungeon, thwarting Hitler's war machine and even the FÃ¼hrer himself. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most influential game of his time. It's because it literally inspired the obsession. Many games existed at the time and much more today, but you get a real grabber from time to time. This is one of them. Just like Tetris before him and most recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost every respect, but the shots heard around the world that led to one of the biggest tidal waves of the game were drawn by BJ Blazkowicz. The Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and Legions of others owe their existence to the people at ID. Whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still are. <br /> <br /> Even with its old appearance, its very old graphics, its very simple gameplay (it's really a game, the games now border the level experience) and very rectangular levels, the scope of six episodes is a lot of fun, especially when you discover these secrets with treasures and a chaingun. <br /> <br /> Also: "Halt!" * hit! blow! bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" never gets old. --- 8/10 <br /> <br /> Voluntary evaluation of PC-13 for "deep carnage" However, it is exceptionally docile compared to what games have today.
