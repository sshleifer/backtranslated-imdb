It's almost typical of Lynch. However, what makes this film a little unusual for Lynch is the fact that he looks very raw, almost amateurish. But I think Lynch does it on purpose to give a greater realism, which serves to increase the intensity of the surreal moments. <br /> <br /> However, many typical Lynch patterns are present, such as: floating camera work; obsessing music; long breaks (atrocious); hanging curtains; dim lights darkening at a slow pace (almost indistinguishable); extreme close-ups; themes of women in difficulty; hurrying, unconditional, all knowing characters confronting helpless characters, temporarily unconscious, in the dark, etc. ... <br /> <br /> The performances are excellent and the short film is a source of reflection. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything to interpretation. Many questions remain unanswered and this ignites the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant effort from Lynch. I only hope he makes some short films, more inspired by the advertising of sony playstation 2. They were inspired.
