INVITATION TO HELL, better than the typical movie for television, has excellent casting roles (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, Pre-Murphy Brown, Joe Regalbuto, Sun Moon-Frye) and an update conceptual of the familiar Faustian plot. . Urich is friendly as always and Lucci is particularly seductive and overflows diabolically from the mother of all the roles of femme fatale. Kind of hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the film is very early in the apocalyptic vision of Miltonesque and horror fans probably will not have much to reproach to do before the sneaky ending maudlin. 7/10
