I read many negative reviews on this movie and finally had the chance to see it on DVD. To be honest, I really do not know what the problem is. <br /> <br /> This is a crime thriller worthy of murder, presented from different angles, an eccentric cast of potential murderers / suspects disguised as drugs. , including the late porn king John Holmes. Please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the plot - I want to contribute more to a review than a synopsis. <br /> <br /> Many critics have gone so far as to give this film its lowest rating because of violence, but I really do not see it. A LOT of modern movies were worse - Saving Private Ryan was finally more violent than this movie, which often relies on implied bloodstains on brutal murders (the murders described in this movie were made with lead pipes). <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the two halves of the film - the first showing John Holmes as a desperately hungry addict and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath. The film has an excellent acting, although Dylan McDemorant looks more than a little out of place in his biker character and bad boy personality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also great - a fantastic mix of 70s rock and obscure pop of the 70s scattered for two hours in all good places like Boogie Nights.
