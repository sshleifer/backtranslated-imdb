I always liked Johnny Concho and I wish this film was released in VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances of his career in this one. <br /> <br /> When we meet Frank for the first time in the main role of the film, he is the brother of a notorious gunman who is currently on the move. The brother is terrified in the heart of the city and Frank takes the opportunity to intimidate the inhabitants of the city safely in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has a feeling for him. She is the daughter of Merchant Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two more gunmen arrive, William Conrad and Christopher Dark, and it turns out that Conrad killed Sinatra's brother and comes to his city to take over. They humiliate Sinatra and drive him out of the city. Kirk follows him. <br /> <br /> Night, Sinatra goes from punk to loose and becomes a man looking for some kind of spine. It's a well-performed performance, almost as good as his Oscar-nominated role in The Man With a Golden Arm. Too bad for some reason, this has not been seen in years. <br /> <br /> Two other notable performances are Keenan Wynn as a former shooter converted to a preacher that helps Sinatra find what he needs to face Conrad and Dark. And then there is Conrad in what I believe was his career role on the screen. He is a villain of incredible malevolence, a pure badly incarnated, who walks and speaks on the screen. However, what I like about Johnny Concho is the climax of an unforgettable moment when Conrad and Dark are treated. Let's just say that I believe Johnny Concho was MGM's response to High Noon and an introduction to what you do when the evil causes a breach of public order.
