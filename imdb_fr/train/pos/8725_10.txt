I liked Antz, but I loved "A Bug's Life". The animation that was put in this paid. I will definitely get that on DVD. By the way, Disney should make a big screen version of this film on tape. (I heard about overwriting all the characters on the screen in standard video format). Most will have to accept that the end credits have been the funniest! I only saw one of the two sets, but I can not see each other!
