Recap: Business is going as usual at Louche Casino in Tangier. The casino is about to close and is preparing for a big transaction the next day. The owner Ladle and some of the staff leave for the night, leaving Modesty at the controls. Suddenly, a gang of armed gangsters storms the casino, shooting wildly. Unknown to Modesty, they have already killed Louche and now pursue the money hidden in the safe. But no one present, and still alive, at the casino knows the code to open the safe. The vault itself is heavily trapped by explosives so that the attackers can not blow the door as expected. Suddenly, Modesty finds himself face to face with gangster leader Miklos in a roulette game whose life is in danger. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a written review unrelated to other published media about Blaise Modesty, as I have neither seen nor read. The first point I would like to emphasize is that this is slightly misclassified. First and foremost, I thought it was a thriller with a battle of wits between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Of course, there are some bursts of action but they are not really part of the story. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the main plot and the main stage filled with suspense, is the game between Modesty and Miklos. It's an innovative and intriguing way to reveal the background of a character and the story unfolds largely outside the casino much earlier. Someone said it was almost like a pilot for a television series and the feeling is that it could actually be used as such. But I thought it was a much better way to introduce a character than many others. I was not disappointed with the lack of action, but I liked this game, the story is more than just a movie action. <br /> <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are doing very well. Staden embodies Modesty very well and carries this confident and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
