Andrew Lau was the co-director of Infernal Affairs' masterpiece trilogy, but he was fired from The Flock and replaced by an emergency director named Niels Mueller. I had the feeling that he had made a good movie but he had not satisfied the study, so they fired and hired another director.This does not usually work well (remember The Invasion) .But the Flock was better than what I expected. great movie but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller. The development of the character is very well done and I could very well know the characters.In addition, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible.Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances. Now, let's go to the negative points. One of the things that really bothered me (it was a moment when it irritated me) was the excess of editing tips to give the movie more "attitude" and style. These tips Their presence is arbitrary .More, I think the film should have been more ambitious.However, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. It's not at all memorable, but it's fun.
