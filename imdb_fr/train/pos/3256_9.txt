Chances Are uses this wonderful song of the same name throughout the film. Robert Downey, Jr. is excellent in this movie. His extra-large eyes and wonderfully varied facial expressions are part of his expertise as different people in different films. Compare Robert Downey, Jr. to Chaplin. You will appreciate Chances Are. I did.
