This is widely considered in Australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here ... and for my money, anywhere. It is brutal, hard, the characters are real, the situations are credible and we do not fear the dark side of life, confronted every day by cops and criminals, victims, lawyers and other people in their different orbits. <Br/> <br /> This show lasted two seasons and was stopped because it did not sell well abroad. We all regret his loss. However, like Fawlty Towers, we will be able to venerate this as a limited series of consistently high quality.
