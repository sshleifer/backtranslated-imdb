Pendragon Pictures' new film "The War of the Worlds" by G Wells, the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about five years. A theatrical release was planned earlier this year (March 2005), but this never happened. The DVD was released to coincide with the release of the version of Spielberg, which was released in cinemas on June 29. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, with some reservations. <br /> <br /> What is the fidelity of adaptation? It's not exactly faithful to Wells's book, but a loyalty of 90 to 95% is enough for me. At least several scenes were totally new, such as the confrontation between Ogilvy, the astronomer and a peasant, and the anonymous writer / narrator who, awkwardly, was having tea with his cousin. But overall, this film follows the book very closely - certainly much more than the classic version of George Pal dating back to 1953. <br /> <br /> His biggest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget. The majority seems to have been shot on the blue screen and composed with digitally rendered backgrounds. This is particularly annoying for most indoor shots and busy street scenes. The glimpses of 1898 in London resemble a video game. Many scenes in carriages were skewed - I guess they could not afford to rent a horse. The only scenes shot for "real" seem to be those of fields or forests. <br /> <br /> But within the limits of this budget, they managed to do a lot. Artistically, the film looks ok. The Martians and their tripods are quite well made and very faithful to Wells' descriptions. I was particularly impressed by the heat ray. Although the sequence Thunder Child, which should have been one of the highlights of the film, is very disappointing. It's a shame they can not afford more real scenery or better animation. <br /> <br /> Action and direction will not win any Oscar. For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not exceptional. The music is very good too, although it is not tied with any of the great Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> I'm really happy that it did not have a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it possible. look much worse on a big screen. In the current state of things, I would like to note it in the same way as an adaptation of classical literature to BBC-TV. <br /> <br /> Some nitpicks: most scenes are presented with various colored filters (mostly red). This may have been an artistic choice, but it is used in a very inconsistent way and is more like a botched DVD mastering job. And the fake mustache of the writer / narrator is obviously transformed from stage to stage. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - Is it worth it to be seen? If you can look beyond the technical and budgetary boundaries and go down in history, I think you'll like it, especially if you've read HG Wells' original novel. However, if you are easily put off by cheap production values, you'd better pass it on (unless you're a fan of MST3K). Be warned, however, that the film lasts 3 hours, so I advise you not to watch the movie at one time. <br /> <br /> BTW: An entirely different version of War of the Worlds (aka "INVASION") was released on DVD the same month Spielberg was released in theaters: http://imdb.com/title/ tt0449040 /. This has also been done on a budget, but is updated at the moment like the Spielberg movie - but it's much better! And to top it off, Jeff Wayne is shooting an animated film from his best-selling 1978 album, but he will not be released until 2007.
