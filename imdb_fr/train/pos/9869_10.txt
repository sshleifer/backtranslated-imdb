I must say it's one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. I loved it the first time, but I really enjoyed it during the second visit, just a few weeks ago. I can see why the sequel is doing so well at the box office. Apparently, many people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> A great color palette (man, that sounds good) and a lot of adult humor (but clean) make him a big winner. The opening scene of 3-4 minutes with "Scat" is excellent, as are the subsequent interludes with him. "Sid", laziness (voiced by John Leguizano), however provides the film's main humor. It usually has something funny to say throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, while Denis Leary is the fierce villain turned good saber-tooth tiger <br /> <br /> It's not only humor and pretty colors, but a beautiful sentimental story about how a little baby softens two difficult characters. This is not interrupted with many songs either: only one brief and nothing offensive in terms of language. <br /> <br /> If more animation films were so good, I would have more.
