I would like to start by saying how wonderful this is. It's stunning and sometimes shocking. And at the very least, I'm 11 years old and it's my favorite movie, I can certainly stand a boring movie, but it's anything but boring. It's like a journey through humanity. Its striking realism is reflected in this monumental masterpiece. It is a heartbreaking story that tells the story of two low and two different voices (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) that build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) a naive Texas stallion comes to New York to enrich himself by entertaining women. Soon, he meets Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), a poor man who is struggling to pay his rent. Ratso becomes Joe's "manager", but the two men soon find a job with Joe, resulting in the theft of food. As they try to survive on the streets of New York, we realize how difficult it is. They can not have a girl like Joe before meeting a lady at a party. Joe makes money and soon Joe takes Ratso to a dream location in Ratso, Florida. The last five minutes are heartbreaking but count among the greatest moments of the film. Starting at midnight, we get a dark and sometimes disturbing urban vision of life.
