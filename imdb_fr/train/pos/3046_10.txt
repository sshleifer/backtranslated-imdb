All good movies "inspire" some directly to the video copycat movie. I was afraid that "Gladiator" was not really a good movie, because I had not seen any film that had anything resembling anything from Roman on the set of new releases for months. Then I spotted the latest offer from Full Moon, Demonicus. I'm a fan of the Puppetmaster series of Full Moon and Blood Dolls, but I have never seen one of their non-killer puppet films. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus tells what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the Alps. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with ancient gladiator artifacts and feels compelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it. He becomes possessed and, as a demonic gladiator Tyrannus, is forced to kill his friends to revive the body, which is the real Tyrannus. <br /> <br /> Certainly, as in many movies of the Full Moon, budget. Sometimes the editing and making were so amateurish that I'd swear I'm looking at the Blair Witch project. Attempts to cut limbs and heads remind me of a sketch by Monty Python. Weapons, though seemingly real, really look plastic. It literally sounds like it was filmed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder for a weekend. Admittedly, there is nothing wrong with this kind of movie, but do not rent this while waiting for a technical masterpiece. It also seems that attempts to research the scenario have been attempted, because even if Tyrannus does not really behave like a gladiator until the end, he speaks at least Latin. <br /> <br /> actually enjoyed this movie. Not as much as a killer puppet movie, maybe, but Full Moon still stands! The only thing that disappointed me was that there was no Full Moon Videozone at the end!
