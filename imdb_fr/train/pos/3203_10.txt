I think this film was one of Kurt Russels's good films. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor and I think he's a good actor in every role he plays. But this movie has a lot of action and I know it should be more than 5.6 out of 10 on the counter but many people do not like this movie. Oh well I thought it was good so I think everyone should see this movie. If you see this movie and you like it, I think you should see Back Draft also with Kurt Russel. I give Soldier *** 1/2 on *****
