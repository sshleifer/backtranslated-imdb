I loved watching "Sea Hunt" during the day, I was in high school and came home. At 4:30 pm, I could watch "Sea Hunt" and Mike Nelson on his underwater adventures. I liked it ! He took you to a place not very accessible at that time, under the great blue sea. Before "Thunderball" or even before Cousteau became commonplace, Mike Nelson aroused the imagination of children. I would bet that more than a few children develop their passion for oceanography or biology, or one of the sciences This show. Underwater photography has also progressed, the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated through this show. Watch and enjoy !!!
