This is the beginning of a new and interesting Star Trek series. It has a "down-to-earth" feel with a darker and less "plaggy" scenography. <br /> <br /> Characters need a little more time to develop, but they have potential. What is rather disappointing (with all Star Trek series, in fact) is that they paint such a gloomy picture of gender equality in the future when they paint a very positive picture of everything. the rest. (The Earth has stopped the war, the famine, etc.) <br /> <br /> The female characters here are two, the subcommander T'Pol who is vulcan and the communication agent Hoshi who is human. Hoshi is rather wimpy and T'Pol is made to be a "vulcanic baby". <br /> <br /> Some of the crew attitudes feel a little too American (as opposed to the more international atmosphere of TNG crews) but creates an interesting dynamic. <br /> <br /> A very good driver but for a very good series.
