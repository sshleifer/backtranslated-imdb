In spite of George Lucas's patronage, this captivating and totally original fantasy of "Lumage" (a combination of animation through live scenes) is about as far from the usual kiddie fare as anything Ralph Bakshi has done on his own. apogee. Brightly designed characters such as Ralph (a duo of drunken and rejected heroes), Synonamess Botch (the mean hilarious mouth-mouth) and Rod Rescueman (the pompous novice superhero) breathe life into a unique concept: Frivoli vs. Murkwood or the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares. In this context, the songs of the soundtrack, impregnated with MOR, should not have worked but they work in one way or another. It's a shame that I had to watch this via a really ugly boot (taken from a TV projection) of the uncensored version ?? there is also a softer variant that has toned down the language for its VHS version? since the film is otherwise unavailable on DVD. Interestingly, Henry Selick and David Fincher both worked on this picture as subordinates.
