Chang Shah's "Shaolin Temple" could very well be the mark of the white waters of the Shaw Brothers martial arts film cycle. This catchy epic of kung fu has an incredible cast - a real who's who of the Shaw team. Although the plot is fairly classic and the choreography of combat is superb, as usual, it is the treatment of the subject by Cheh that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable. The sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is palpable in all settings. Just like William Keighley's pianist at the legendary Fighting 69 in this same self-titled film, or John Ford's salute at West Point in "The Long Gray Line", Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" is an ode conceived with love in this very style. <br /> <br /> The cultural correlation that I am tempted to do is to compare the Shaolin Temple to Alamo. As you watch this film, you will feel the same feelings of admiration and nostalgia as you did many years ago in elementary school when you learned the courage and sacrifice of those condemned heroes of the Alamo. At the end of the movie, you may also be tempted to call "Remember Shaolin Temple!"
