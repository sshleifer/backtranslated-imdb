Just after seeing this after my mom brought me back from America, dreaded seeing it after all the negative comments here, but I must say, yes, the acting is corny, some effects are laughable. <br /> <br /> But you must remember that it must have been 1898 and not 2005, and for such a small budget, I thought it was pretty good. I appreciated this version much more than the version of Spielberg I had seen last week. <br /> <br /> I read the book so many times and I found myself saying "oh yes it's in the book" almost all the time, with the other version of the book practically did not exist not. <br /> <br /> So much the better to at least try to create a faithful version.
