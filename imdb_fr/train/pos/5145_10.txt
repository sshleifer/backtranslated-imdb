<br /> <br /> An elderly man works as a janitor in a mental hospital to get closer to his wife who is patient and to try to get her out. <br /> <br /> This is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and a strangeness in the history of Japanese cinema. Thinking long lost, an impression was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack was added, which corresponds perfectly to the images. This could have been influenced by Dr. Caligary's office (director Kinugasa claimed he had never seen the German film). However, he surpasses him in style and in his more convincing (and colder) description of the inner mental state of the inmates of the asylum. To do this, the film uses all the film techniques available at once: multiple exposures and blurred subjective point of view, inclined camera angles, slow and fast movements, expressionist lighting and overlays, among others. It's also a very complicated movie to follow because it does not have a title. The film begins with a montage of shots of rain striking the windows of the hospital, shaking trees and thunder. The troubling weather metaphorises the mental state of patients and presents one: a former dancer. The combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder is the music that encourages the dancer to embark on a frantic, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenetic dance, she is monitored by other inmates. The dancer's multiple displays represent the patient's point of view and their confused "vision" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples of this amazing film that attempts to represent the subconscious of patients and their "healthy" world. <br /> <br /> In three words TO SEE ABSOLUTELY.
