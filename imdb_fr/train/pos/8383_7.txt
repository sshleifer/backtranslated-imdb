Robot Jox does his best, but basically consists of a series of chained combat scenes - robot versus robot, man versus man, man versus woman. The premise had potential, but it seems that the script did not really get the extra drafts it needed. It was still good enough for a sci-fi action movie. Part of that was because the script was from Joe Haldeman. For those who do not know this name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel "The Forever War". It is considered one of the best novels for motorized combat armor, with Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor". And this movie is really more like a giant-powered battle armor movie, rather than giant robots. It's closer to what the fans would have liked instead of the parody that was Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers", which sounded pretty much like the novel he was based on. <br /> <br /> Despite some assumptions, it's really not based on "Homer's Iliad". Some names are all they had in common. Achilles having the foot of his robot removed had no parallel in the Iliad, which did not include the death of Achilles. The old Achilles was not a noble warrior either. He was the most powerful, but also vengeful and petty. Even the robot jock killed in the first scene is not suitable. He was named Hercules, while the Greek Iliad would have had Herakles. <br /> <br /> The effects were good enough for time and budget. While it was not comparable to "Terminator 2" a year later, but this film was ten times more expensive. The stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers of "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi". Better, in fact, than a lot of animation of Ray Harryhausen, which enjoys great esteem, but is outdated. <br /> <br /> Do not bring high expectations in this area and you probably will not be disappointed. It's better than a lot of other low-budget movies and even some big-budget candidates who have better effects but much worse scripts.
