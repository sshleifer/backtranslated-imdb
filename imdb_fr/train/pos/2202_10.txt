I was only 11 when Mr. Peepers started. It was a must for the whole family, I believe on Sun. nights. Rob opened his locker repeatedly (he had to use a meter or indicator to find the right place on another locker and do other things, eventually kicking the place where his door would open) and out of the pins of a new sweater (at the beginning of an episode, he opened a package with a new shirt and, for the rest of the series, he discovered a pin after another that was missing when unpacking the The timing was paramount and the pins made a lot of laughs.) I remember an aunt who was driving a Rio like Jack Benny and who always wanted "Sonny" to say something scientific. He would think and propose a "semi-permeable membrane" or osmosis telling him how brilliant he was. (you had to be there) Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on the screen. Why they did not continue the show from his point of view when Wally left (he was afraid of being cast but it was way too late) I'll never know. I saw somewhere that the first TV wedding (the big one anyway) was Tiny Tim on the Carson show. Horsecocky. It was Rob and Nancy (I already had a crush on her) and I remember it was the TV Guide cover and the press reported it in every newspaper and major magazine. A trip to the Museum of Broadcasting in New York a few years back was disappointing in that they had very few episodes back then and these could be gone now. I still remember it as wonderful and would have liked to be a little older.
