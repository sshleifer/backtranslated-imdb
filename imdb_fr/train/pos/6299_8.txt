There are good ways to make a movie and bad manners, and that's a lot of the old way. This short caper requires nothing more than what he gives to the public. It presents a simple story, told very clearly with enough nonsense to allow you to continue, then better and better. Clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome, but lead actors such as Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman can easily do it on their own. Friendly and fun, hilarious for last, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre.
