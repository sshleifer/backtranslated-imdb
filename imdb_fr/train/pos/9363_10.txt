This movie was amazing, it's the kind of movie you watch and rather than watching other actor movies, you watch other director / writer films. Sandler did a good job working with a character outside his comfort zone and the always good Cheadle also did a great job. This film is ideal for a mature and intelligent audience. The acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by writing and directing the film. This film focuses on true Americans, the previous generation, no stereotypes or racism, but only about people who have come together and understood the true meaning of life. This film talks about loss and adaptation. Instead of attacking psychiatry, she defines her not as a person who heals you by magic, but rather by the need to express your feelings to a trusted impartial person, not to judge you, but you will guide you in your thoughts. This movie is great!
