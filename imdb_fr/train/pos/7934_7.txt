According to this forum, I guess you like it or hate it. Usually how it goes with all movies. However, there is no need to experiment with others. We only give opinions. I rented this movie last night and I want to come and throw my opinion into the mix. I was surprised by the number of people who are fighting yet. There is a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan. I am a fan of horror movies. Most fans of Ol√©'s simple movies do not like horror movies. So many low budget movies looking for ropes are coming out these days. It's hard to follow. And what makes it difficult to stay in these movies is how bad they are. I wanted to come and write a review on "Hood of the Living Dead" because it's damn good compared to the rest of the junk there. It's nothing special, but it's these horror filmmakers who are trying to be too serious who end up making a horrible horror movie. I really liked this one. You tell me that there is no effort in this one? And one more thing, I bet you have all those huge DVD collections that you're so proud of, just Major Motion Pictures, right? Nothing wrong with that, but you must know how to appreciate independent independents. I knew what I was getting by watching this movie. I will not get upset because I thought it would be a $ 100 million movie. Some of you might need to look at the matrix again and again and stop trying to compare everything to the matrix. And if most of you are under 24, that explains everything. Good movie, go see.
