"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by Italian composer Luciano Ligabue, who also directs the film and writes the score of course. <br /> <br /> The film is a portrait of the life of a province of northern Italy, in Emilia-Romagna Region. We are in 1975, at the time of the first free radios - one of the boys of the film creates "Radioraptus". The desires of youth, friendship, love, sex, individual dramas and unemployment are among the topics discussed, but the film also speaks of drugs. - Freccia, the main character, is a victim of heroin slavery. <br /> Without being boring and moralistic, the story flows very well; the spontaneity of the actors is strong and the way of directing too. Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is obviously neither Fellini nor a film buff, it is above all a musician. But he managed to make a good product. Unfortunately, he will not repeat the success of his second film "Da zero a dieci" - not good at all. <br /> <br /> In "Radiofreccia", the actors are generally not very famous, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular young Italian actors. See in a small role another Italian composer - Francesco Guccini, he is the friendly communist bartender and football coach!
