"Kolchak" was a television series that really does not fit any category. Part of the horror, some of the comedy, some social awareness, and what we have is something for which people were not ready. It's a shame because I started watching these shows on the Chiller network (I never saw the originals) and realized how interesting and different it was. <br /> <br /> With Darren Mcgavin in the role of Kolchak, reporter for International News Service, and Simon Oakland, in the role of his always-angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the series followed the exploits of a journalist from Chicago, which became part of the story itself, as he searched the windy city for modern-day creepies working at night. The underlying charm of Macgavin truly distinguishes the show. A rather clumsy guy, who always wears the same suit, you can not help but love him. His jokes are excellent, and the back and forth between him and the skeptical publisher Oakland is downright hilarious. <br /> <br /> The stories are mostly pretty good and the acting is very good. The '70s were not a' big 'period of special effects, and the series suffers, but if you suspend disbelief you get a fun series that was ahead of its time.
