I can not say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol accumulated by some critics. Yes, she is bogged down by too much running time, difficult editing, and excessive use of cheeseball special effects. And it lacks a lot of energy in a comedy to convince a member of the average audience to sit there without consulting his watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are also some fun lines, a talented and serious cast, and the classic principle of the underdog. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are brilliant in the "key" team. Garofalo and Studi do a remarkable job adding conflict and variety to the team. I can not say that Reubens or Mitchell contributed a lot to the film, although everyone had a chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as I said above, is your classic "oppressed". No surprises there, since you know they will triumph. What is worth it is not the absurd and screaming heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interaction between the characters. Underneath all this, these people are children at heart, who just want to do what is right. The best scenes of the film give this film its emotional foundation. Look at Azaria's relationship with her long-suffering mother. The endearing innocence of Macy in her reluctance to accept Cap. The secret identity of Amazing; Stiller's rage (a bit like that weird and weird kid you've ever known who was always letting go, raging helplessly on the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge his father. This childish conviction that the sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place, is the true attraction of comics of superheroes; and under its parodic exterior, "Mystery Men" shows us why these comic cartoon book tropics count for so many people. <br /> <br /> It never really freezes in a satisfactory set, because of the considerable number of secondary intrigues (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the plot main is so much fun that it makes up for that. The fact that it is supposed to be good and absurd fun seems to be forgotten by some critics here. I will warn you then: if you are the kind of spectator who finds his enjoyment of an irritating and irritating cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical ("Do I believe that it is a kind of .. * snort * .. .magic_ xylophone? "), so you are far too literal and humorless for this film. Go rent a Sandler movie instead. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
