I really liked this movie and went back to see it twice more in a week. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Detmers nailed the show - she was like a hungry cat on the lookout, playing with her prey. She is unleashed with anger and lust, takes a "too young" lover and crushes on the ground hundreds of pieces of fine porcelain of the mother of his terrorist fiance. <br /> <br /> The movie was full of beautiful touches. The Maserati, the beautiful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the roofs. I particularly enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the recitation of "Antigone". <br /> <br /> It gave the impression of "Story of O", that is to say where people of means indulged in a sexual adventure without restraint. While walking in the fantastic apartment of Buff, she is at ease - and why not, how to retain a "Devil in the flesh"? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a real treat!
