Hot Millions is a fantastic movie in every way. A fun and offbeat story with the outstanding performance of four of the best professionals of all time. Peter Ustinov is great, as usual, and Maggie Smith, one of the greatest actresses of all time, is a true delight. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart complete the cast and are also perfect. If you want a movie with a perfect cast, that's it. What is really impressive is the way these people work in a natural and effortless way, creating lots of laughs and moments of pleasure. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and one of his most memorable performances. The staging, photography and editing are also first rate and it is an excellent capsule of London in the 60s. This is certainly on my list of all favorite times.
