Wes Craven was created as one of the most successful killer thriller movies of all time. After watching his films, you will find your new fears. People do not know which Wes Craven thriller movie is the best because they are all different. <br /> <br /> In this film, Lisa is terrorized by a fellow traveler. He forces her to kill and if she does not, Jack will kill her father. Lisa is in trouble, because whatever she chooses, she will kill. <br /> <br /> Act was unreal. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy acted incredibly well. The emotions were well chosen. The idea and the scenario of this film are excellent too ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes it reminds a "Scream", but it is certainly better than the two "Screams" that follow each other. <br /> <br /> And what can I say - it's the best killer-thriller movie of the 21st century to date ...
