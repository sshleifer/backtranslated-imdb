I enjoyed this movie. It was a pleasure to see a version so close to Peter O'Donnell's vision. <br /> <br /> A number of people have hated the film, but it has to be seen in the context of the original story. is. The film uses flashback to show young Modesty and the events that transformed her into a woman she has become. Before the network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The pace is a little slow and, for my taste, the tensions are not developing enough in the current scenes. However, this is acceptable to obtain a version as faithful. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you'll even enjoy it with its faults, if you just want an action movie with car chases, forget it. He feels like the first in a franchise, but since I have never seen him promote anywhere, I guess there will be more to follow. Sadly.
