Put the "thing" UFO aside. It was the best documentary I saw. Neil and Buzz factual reports ... to see absolutely. The interviews and reports are a revelation as most of the information was confidentially stamped in 1969 and released in 2006. No documentary so far has the detail or accuracy for such a brief 47-minute period. The FACTS will amaze you, and We will marvel at the risks taken to be the first on the moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest hero of our time. Have you ever seen a man save his life? Bet not. Neil saved his life when he only separated for a few seconds. Amazing to watch. It's a travesty that people did not know all the details associated with landing on the moon and the courage that these men had to face certain death, from a failing computer ... 10 stars!
