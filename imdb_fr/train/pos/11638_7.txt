I had fun watching Red Eye. It is not a masterpiece, but it is well directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yes, it's the same story with a different set, but Wes Craven gave it a good rhythm. At least not another Scream with the usual college killer. It's nice to see a net thriller and coherent even when the originality is not his main character. Especially from a filmmaker like Craven, who has brought so many innovative ideas to thriller and horror in the past and now lends himself to bringing home what might have been a good TV movie if he had not been released in theaters. Good work!
