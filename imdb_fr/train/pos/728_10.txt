The Ramones, whom I consider the founders of modern punk rock, lend their unique sounds to a terribly distorted film about a flashy rock fan (PJ Soles) who faces a pitiless and joyless director (Mary Woronov) for the right to rock . <br /> <br /> Presenting a soundtrack bursting with incredible music, RRHS fascinates by its concept and its execution. It's jam-packed with wild visual gags (like the mouse experience), teenage spirit (probably my favorite movie opener of all time), and quirky and offbeat moments (straitjacket scenes). If you're looking for a film that seems to be pure fun at the molecular level, look no further. But if you are looking for a beautiful, dignified and dramatic epic, you may want to look a little further. <br /> <br /> "Hello everyone, my name is Riff Randell and here is Rock & Roll High School!"
