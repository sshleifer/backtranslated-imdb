I was captivated by the end of this movie channel, which is making waves on cable movie channels. I was looking for the next show. <br /> <br /> I really did not know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I came out of this movie with a sense of trouble and distress. It also gave me, as an adult who had attended high school in the 1980s, a better idea of ​​what our children have been facing lately. <br /> <br /> The fact that you do not see the shooting only adds to the cold of the plot. Seeing both children and adults struggling to understand and understand senseless shootings was sometimes overwhelming. And I will admit that I shed a lot of tears. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a movie I would look for, but I'm glad to see it.
