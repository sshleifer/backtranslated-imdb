Okay, I do not really think that Trailer Park Boys has a bad story, because they get fooled. For example, at the end of the film, Ricky and Julian tell "Patrick Lewis" to lower the dog and move away. Then in the end, Ricky and Julian are saying that they have been in prison for two years. In the pilot of the television series, the first clip broadcast is the same clip of Ricky and Julian screaming against "Patrick Lewis". But in the TV series, they are only supposed to have been in prison for 18 months. <br /> <br /> In addition, they give the impression that the plot of the film and that of the series are linked (because of the scene that screams between guys). But some actors describe totally different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the movie, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for an extermination, then he plays Sam Samco in the series. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), in In the movie, guys sniff coca instead of smoking hash. The fact is, they never really confirm that the two scenarios are related anyway, except for the shouting scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to keep chatting.
