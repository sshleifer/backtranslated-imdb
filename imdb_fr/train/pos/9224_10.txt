This film is visually beautiful. Who cares if she can act or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and captured by John Derek. Places, sets and costumes work perfectly to convey what is found in a love story of beauty, youth and wealth. In a way, I would like to see this film as a tribute to the story of John and Bo Derek. And ... this commentary would not be complete without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as a father, mentor, lover and his portrait of a man, of men, lost in favor of a bygone era when men were men. Some of us find strength in leadership and guidance in a trust that helps to create a sense of trust, restraint and security. Yes, they do not make men like that anymore! But how often do you find women do like Bo Derek.
