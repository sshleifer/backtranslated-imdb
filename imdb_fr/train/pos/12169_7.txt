The night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the beautiful dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) at the bar. They drink a lot together and the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed. Her future mother-in-law calls her and informs her that her fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair) could arrive in her apartment. He desperately asks Becky to leave his place in a hurry. Earlier, he discovers that she has crabs and, later, while preparing for his wedding dinner, he realizes that Becky is Karen's cousin. It's the beginning of a very funny comedy, with hilarious situations. The first attraction of this film is certainly the central trio of actresses and actors. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are excellent actresses and extremely beautiful, and Jason Lee, who is incredibly funny, have good performances. I have laughed a lot over history, but some scenes are really hilarious. For example, when Paul finds Becky in bed; when he finds it painted; his imagination in many situations; in the pharmacy, trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine; most scenes from his neighbor, the minister; when Karen calls the department store; or when the police find an aggression suspect against Paul. I could number many other scenes, but it is better for the reader to rent or buy this movie and have a lot of fun. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
