This film stayed on my Tivo for weeks before I watched it. I dreaded a yuppie self-indulgence film about relationships gone awry. I was wrong; It was an exciting excursion into the libido of New Yorkers. <br /> <br /> The format is the same as that of "The Round" of Max Ophuls, based on a play by Arthur Schnitzler, who "inspired by" credit. It starts with a person, a prostitute, standing at the corner of a Brooklyn street. She is recovered by an entrepreneur, who has sex with her on the hood of a car, but can not come. He refuses to pay her. When he is pissing, she answers his mobile phone and takes a message. She runs away with her keys. <br /> <br /> Then the story goes to the entrepreneur, who makes a professional call to a rich and bored New York woman, who plays with him until he's excited, then she away. . She tells him how desperate and unhappy she is; he tells her how beautiful and lucky she is. When leaving, she asks him if he would have sex with her. She sits on him, jumps up and down. This time he comes, he leaves. <br /> <br /> The wife and her husband are having dinner for their trendy friends. Hubby (Robert) speaks business, his wife (Ellen) gets bored, changes the subject and goes to sex, and how often men and women think about it. The husband passes the conversation in the desert. Later, after the guests leave, Ellen tries to lure Robert into sex. Robert does not want it and puts a jazz record. Ellen turns on the radio; Robert puts on the music; Ellen turns on the TV; Robert turns on another TV. The cacophony ensues. Ellen gets on the roof, Robert joins her. Ellen admits that she has to experience more men, men other than Robert. Robert says that he too needs to know men. <br /> <br /> We then follow Robert when he visits an artist, Martin, played by Steve Buscemi. I'd like Buscemi to have more roles like this, where he's a sexy, smart and totally desirable guy. Robert praises Martin's work, much more than he deserves, promises to make it appear in a show. Martin is excited, waiting for Robert to talk about his groin, it's a mating dance. Robert tries to kiss Martin on the lips and Martin backs up saying he is not gay. Robert says he's not gay either, makes fun of Martin. Both admit that works of art are bad. Robert is about to leave, when Martin will allow him to kiss him. They manage and Robert falls on Martin. <br /> <br /> We then follow Martin, who is preparing for an art exhibition in a Manhattan gallery. He is struck by the receptionist Anna, played by Rosario Dawson. (I had to cut a part of this magazine to keep it under 1000 words) ... and they make love to each other. <br /> <br /> We then follow Anna, sitting at the lunch table. Her boyfriend, Nick (Adrian Grenier), comes in, carries flowers. She's cold with him. he tries to understand why. He tells her that he had sex with someone while he was in San Francisco. She makes him understand that he stayed with his ex-friend during his stay in San Francisco and that he slept with her. This last revelation turns out to be a lie. They both go to lunch, but she decides they have to break up. Nick is heartbroken. <br /> <br /> And we follow Nick, who confesses his problems to an older woman he meets on a park bench, Joey (Carol Kane). Joey is a little weird and childish, but it's a good audience for Nick, who needs a listening ear. The two go to Coney Island at night and watch the stars. Nick falls in love with Joey, despite the age difference between them. They go back to Joey and Nick realizes that he is about to sleep with a crazy old woman. She is above him, does not want to let him go. But he manages to escape. <br /> <br /> (It's also Carol Kane's best role since she played Latke's wife in Taxi.) Joey's phone rings and he's a man who calls him Psychic Friends network. and Joey is one of the psychic friends. Although she is still suffering from Nick, she is gradually entering her psychic state. The man is at his office, late at night, and wants to have a sex on the phone with her. Even if it's not Joey's business, Joey accepts and brings the man to come. She wants to keep talking, even if the man wants to hang up, and discovers that he has diverted a lot of money from his business and will be found tomorrow. His life is ruined. Joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide and tries to make him believe that she is his friend, that she cares about him. And she cares about him. <br /> <br /> But the man puts a firearm in his briefcase and goes out looking for a prostitute on the Brooklyn waterfront, and we go back to the same prostitute at the beginning. started La Ronde. She wants to give her $ 75,000 in cash if she wants to kill him. He tried to kill himself, but could not do it. The prostitute does not want to do it, but he insists holding her hand, the gun in her mouth, telling him where to aim. Finally, the gun goes off and we see the prostitute go down the street and get to the corner where she normally does business. The entrepreneur who did not pay it earlier in the film arrives, rolls out the window. They look at each other. THE END.
