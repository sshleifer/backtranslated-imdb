John Carpenter's Halloween is frankly a horror masterpiece. It tells the immortal story of Michael Myers, an escaped mental patient, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to hunt down and kill a group of babysitters. <br /> <br /> This was the first and probably the best of the Halloween franchise. . Carpenter shows a lot of restraint by walking very slowly through history and building sympathetic characters; unusual for a horror image. <br /> <br /> The non-existence of blood and blood is even more unusual, yet it remains the scariest Halloween to date. Get that! <br /> <br /> Halloween marked the beginning of Jamie Lee Curtis' film and marked a turning point in the career of the late Donald Pleasance. A real classic.
