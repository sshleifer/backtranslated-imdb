I started watching this movie without hope, but another movie to watch, but since the first twenty minutes, the work of art and the main character, enigmatic, do not speak much, really took me into this film. <br /> <I really liked this movie, it was dark, beautifully played and really touching. It's a little slow but the immersion was complete. The staging was great in letting us know, piece by piece, the story that led to the conviction of Joey and his life behind bars. The music was really great and very well integrated with the scenes. The end was unexpected with a twist that I did not see coming. This is not the kind of film we often see.
