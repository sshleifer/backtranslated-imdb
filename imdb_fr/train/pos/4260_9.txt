After the first work of Fatih Akins, "Im Juli", who was good enough, he created a truly magnificent Italian family epic. This is a German film, which is unfortunately a bad prerequisite because we seldom produce more than moderate movies;). But this film then makes very good snapshots of the time. "Solino" tells the story of an Italian immigrant who arrived in the "Ruhr" in Germany in the 1960s. The immigrant and his family then opened the first Pizza restaurant in the area. The characters are excellent drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling he makes. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not very good. Well, you do not believe him the role. But the character is well balanced and fits perfectly in this scenario. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this film with the style of "The Godfather". Many people will probably hate this movie, let's say it's boring. Not a lot of tension? - yes, but a scandalous film. 9 out of 10
