Carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids. When she finds herself overworked, she can hire Paul to help. Paul has just been released from prison and his past is not entirely behind him. To say too much about history, which involves many twists, would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie is the way the sound is used to indicate when Carla can hear can not - some sort of "point of hearing" (like a point of view). The first scenes that created this scene, as well as the early character developments of Carla and Paul, interested me more than the subsequent twists, some of which were hard to follow and / or a little more credible. There is also an unpleasant violence. To return to the positive, the cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The film is worth the detour, but may not be looking for. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 28/04/2002.
