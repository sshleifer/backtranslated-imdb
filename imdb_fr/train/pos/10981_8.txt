Hi, TheaterX, found that by rummaging through videos at the almost new flea market, and reading the bottom of the box, I saw it was a "cult hit" So, of course, he went home. me. <br /> <br /> What a strange movie. The aunt and cousin of former First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis lives in this dilapidated house of 28 rooms on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and shares the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) And who know what else. The Suffolk Co. was everywhere at a time when they lived in filth and old Jackie came herself to fix things. Anyway, it's a strange pair, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (the girl) always wears something above her head and dances, sings and leaves little on the camera that seldom make sense. Big Edie (the 79-year-old mother) apparently enjoys running naked, and although we have clues as to what it might look like, luckily it was done with taste (?) To the point where we were spared. These women talk, discuss and discuss, mostly from the past, and that does not make much sense except for them. They live in absolute filth, cats do their business anywhere ("Look, this cat is going to the bathroom behind my portrait!"), And a room seems to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice, it reminds me a lot of my own deceased aunt, who was from that part of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. In a scene, Little Edie puts flea repellent, lovely, we can see all the cats scratching all the time, so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as "eccentric", and I must say that in this case, it's just a euphemism for "get out of their gourds," but this movie is not without moments where you feel really something to them. It's scary, sad and disgusting at the same time, but I could not stop looking once I started. It's not my type of movie "normal" but I found it somewhat fascinating. It will not be for everyone though, it's guaranteed.
