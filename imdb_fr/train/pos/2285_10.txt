I did not read this book, but throughout the movie, I was amazed by one thought: it's so Vonnegut. I have never seen an author, all the intelligence and life behind the workings of a novel, as well translated into film. This film had the same complexities as in Vonnegut's novels: jokes were often significant and symbolic, and dramatic events and symbols were often jokes as well. <br /> <br /> Campbell was also a very Vonnegut character, perfectly described by Nick Nolte. He had all the qualities of a "hero" of Vonnegut: indifference to political boundaries, dark and ironic humor giving way to a dull inactivity in the face of stress and reluctance to apply his version of reality to those around him. <Br/> <br /> Overall, I was constantly surprised and impressed watching this movie. It's the same feeling I had read "Cat's Cradle", my first Vonnegut novel, as if it was the most unusual thing that could happen, he thought about it and made it real and important. Yes, he only has "White Christmas" albums in surplus of the army. So, how are you!
