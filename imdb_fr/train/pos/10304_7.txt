"Bruce Almighty" looks and looks incredibly stupid, especially trailers. Nevertheless, I found a deeper message that made me love this movie more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and gives him the divine power to stay God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays here a man symbolized by God, and although this is not his usual type of film nor one of his best roles, he does his job very well. Although sometimes brutal, the movie has a lot of laughter, from Bruce splitting his soup in half like the Red Sea and customer feedback, as well as Freeman's seemingly relaxed and offbeat image of Freeman. It's sometimes exaggerated, and there's a bit of rude humor, but on the whole, it does get a little funny. There are decent actors, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, who always help. The end of the film turns out to be very romantic and jerky. The message is clear: we must do what God has called us to do and "be the miracle". The film is far from perfect, but still nice, and much better than many people would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film. <br /> <br /> *** on ** **
