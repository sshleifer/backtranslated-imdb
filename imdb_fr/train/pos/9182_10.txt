Those who love the book Jane Eyre like me (it's my favorite, and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a bit too good to be Mr. Rochester, but other than that, he does a wonderful job in describing Thornfield's grandmaster. Zelah Clarke may have been a little too old to play Jane, 18, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about the age of the characters. The dialogue of the film is taken almost entirely from the book, which was very intelligent. Of course, this movie may seem a bit long, but it's the only version I've seen that includes the third part of the story. <br /> <br /> I wish that the authors of this film participated in the new Zeferelli. version because it would have helped the mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> I also realized the last time I watched this video that Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reed"! She is so versatile that I did not recognize her. She plays Daisy in Keeping up Appearances and has also played the role of Mrs. Musgrove in Persuasion (another wonderful adaptation) in 1995. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: You have the DVD this week and it is wonderful to see the original unmodified version. There are many more at the beginning (Young Jane at Gateshead and Lowood) and at the end, they restored a lot of things (I always wondered why St. John had a piece of paper when he reveals that he knows who Jane is-- because the part where he tears it off his painting was edited from the US VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver is in ... she was completely cut off from the VHS. As far as I know, they had not edited any of Timothy Dalton's parts, so nothing new there, but it's great to see the complete miniseries in its entirety after all these years of appreciating VHS. Thank you, BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a DVD special edition ... with maybe some interviews with the stars ... or a making of)
