Admittedly, 65 years have passed since the shooting of the latest Thalberg production. But dear fellow members of the IMDB, come on, this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the 30s! This was a 10. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw at the Museum of Modern Art in New York around 1970 (I was a teenager). Dear but with scenes of such poverty, masterfully photographed, often exciting and always engaging, it was for me the filming of the film MGM at its best. What did the audience feel when they saw a grasshopper attack, the destruction of one hotel by another, the horror of poverty, then the splendor of wealth? <br /> <br /> Last week, Oscars spectators had a glimpse of Luise Rainer, a "senior" Oscar winner. What a pleasure to see an actress who has undoubtedly delivered one of the most remarkable and most haunting shows in history, choosing to come back for a celebration. <br /> <br /> Okay, so she should not have won the previous year (Great Ziegfeld), but do not blame Luise. The talkies were only 10 years old at the time of its publication and its dialogue was limited. But like Olan, his visual and vocal use is memorable. <br /> <br /> On a large scale and touching, what can a movie lover want more!
