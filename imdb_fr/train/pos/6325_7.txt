This film is not only entertaining, with an excellent theatrical play, but also interesting on the political level. This was done at the end of the Soviet Union, but makes fun of the Soviet mentality through. The story unfolds during the early days of the Soviet Union and challenges the raison d'Ãªtre of the revolution, both culturally and practically. Of course, in the late 80s and early 90s, the strange restrictions of Soviet society are already relaxed, but the ideology and mentality are still alive and well prepared for a well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all these deep philosophical comments are packed in a fun and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Jur
