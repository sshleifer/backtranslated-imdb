I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly an excellent screenwriter and I would love to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this movie, I can not wait to see what she can do with a major image. Congratulations to the cast for their great performances (this little girl was golden) and whoever composed the music. The distorted "Row Your Boat" blew me away. A very creative movie all around ... I really hope to see it out on video or DVD because I would buy it in a second. If you have the opportunity, you should definitely see this movie.
