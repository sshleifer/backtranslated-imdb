It must be one of the best, if not the best film I've seen for a very long time. Had enough action to satisfy a fan, and yet the plot was very good. I really enjoyed the movie and I hung from end to end. <br /> <br /> Blood added and bloody, but I brought the realistic nature of what's happening on the front of the film, and I even had a tear Jerker ending for a lot of people I should think . <br /> <br /> This is a watch not to be missed for anyone. Saw many critics, preparing the film, but to be honest, most of the movies that get bad reviews turn out to be among the best. it proves once again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
