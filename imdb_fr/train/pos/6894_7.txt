Men can slaver on Lollo, if they wish (or his lollos - she gave her name to a slang for breasts in French), but the ladies have an even tastier piece in the divine Gerard Philipe, which is no only beautiful but can act. Do not be discouraged if your version does not contain subtitles because in this simple and dazzling story of love and war, in which everything is right, they are not necessary. All you need to know is that at the beginning of the movie, Lollobrigida reads Philipe's palm and tells him that he will marry the king's daughter. Afterwards, the story is quite clear of Gallic gestures and running, jumps and sword. <br /> <br /> The inconvenience of history and the facetiousness of the tone become a bit tiresome, and it is annoying that the French consider themselves too superior to Hollywood to take the trouble to try to plausibility . And of course, the non-francophone misses a few words of oh-la-la, such as: Virtuous girl: I must tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: My dear, what made you think that this trifle interested me?
