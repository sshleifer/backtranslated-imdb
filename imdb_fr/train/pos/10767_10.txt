Of course, I should give this film 10 out of 10 because my uncle was the principal screenwriter of Once Upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego has written scripts for more than 50 years in Italy. He was an excellent storyteller and someone suggested that he write his stories. So Rodolfo Sonego did it. If you look at his biography, you can see the number of films that have been made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor who played in his stories. My uncle traveled to Australia and my city in 1968 to discover "A Girl in Australia" and create a film about a proxy wife after World War II. You can see his humor in all his films. I recently found a copy of this movie on DVD. AWESOME
