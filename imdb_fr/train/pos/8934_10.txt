The intruder is haunted by two things: who is the intruder and is it a movie or a dream that you are watching? The end is so shocking that for a moment you can not answer one or the other of these questions. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different circumstances who do not belong to the scene. They are expelled, gently or brutally, but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a despicable man. He has rough manners, a nasty job and no heart. He needs one and goes after. He has a transplanted heart and then decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed his quest for redemption? A guy like this could cut your throat in no time. You know it but Claire Denis does not encourage you to judge him. From time to time, there is a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who seems to live somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges him. She can even punish him. But not Denis. There is the character of Beatrice Dalle who does not want to know anything with him: do not touch me, she says. But Denis lets this man be himself, films him in his egocentric quest. I do not know if what she is filming is the heart or the mind, but these are not the basics of the traditional plot. Whatever she films, you get it at the end. You know who the "intruder" is, you know more or less why, and some scenes come back into your mind with all their meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
