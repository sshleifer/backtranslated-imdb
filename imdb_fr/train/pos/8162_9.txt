As Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen performs an incredibly disturbing performance in "The Dentist". <br /> <br /> With his compulsive tendencies already obsessing at top speed, the IRS harassing him and his wife very suspiciously; Dr. Alan Feinstone is losing more and more mental health every day. <br /> <br /> When Doc realizes that his wife has an affair with the pool boy, he triggers a series of events torturing, murdering, total ant! "The Dentist" is a solid film! Bernsen makes both Dr. Feinstone's character accessible to everyone. Even if he is completely out of his bottle, the public will always feel sympathy for him. That my friends ..... is damn good actor. <br /> <br /> A nice, solid group of supporting actors complete this jewel of a movie. Excellent leadership, good killing and self-control, and effective stimulation will keep you entertained throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
