after seeing this movie for the third time now, I think it's almost Adam's worst film, PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR, compared to that, I must say that in the end, when Dickie is screened from boat, it's so funny This movie should only be shown if you're a fan of Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> The characters are mediocre compared to his fun movies like Waterboy, who has the same people in the movie (Peter Dante) who is one of the assassins trying to kill the Australian bird. <br /> <br /> This film lacks depth and a decent story and deserves to be at the bottom of things. 100
