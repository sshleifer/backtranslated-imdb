I went to see this because my wife and I did not have much else to do on a Sunday afternoon. I like movies about goofy characters and losers. After a slow start, the cast presents good tricks, but it is the current "Bellini" that makes and drops the film. The 'Bellini' is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie for a long time, but it's too short and could have made it a global masterpiece 71/2 out of 10
