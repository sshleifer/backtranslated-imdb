I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle are cats so different from each other, and yet they collectively refer to themselves as "brothers". I often find myself trying to imitate the tired, sighing accent of their butler, Hovis, or even Gordon's Scottish borough. There should be more episodes on Human Kimberly. The episode about cats disguising themselves as pre-teen girls to go to Human Kimberly's pajama party to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a hilarious classic. We can not drink rootbeer at home now without the voice of Catscratch or the Hanson brothers of the movie 'Slap Shot'. Classical future. Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD?
