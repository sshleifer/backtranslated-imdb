This image was released in 1975 and it was the second in the three-part series of Sheriff Buford Pusser's life. Bo Svenson takes on the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser and Luke Askew plays Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last time we saw Sheriff Pusser, he was lying in a hospital bed after him and his wife, killed in an ambush Sunday morning. After Pusser has recovered, he pursues the men who killed his wife. Is Pusser able to complete the revenge he's looking for, or is the crowd trying to kill him before he succeeds? The only thing that bothers me about this picture is that it's a real story. How can you go to a city with this kind of crime and do nothing against it? Since there was no actress name in this picture, I can not give him 10 weasel stars but I can give 8
