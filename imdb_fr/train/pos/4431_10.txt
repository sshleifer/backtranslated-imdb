This film is considered one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. Many people who see it for the first time and who know few themes of the film will probably not understand why I find it so captivating so I will try to explain it ... <br /> <br /> The film is very rich in historical details and cultural knowledge, and although it presents some minor anachronisms, it is quite forgivable. The story tells the famous duel between the monk Benkei and the young prince Yoshitsune on the bridge of Gojo. According to legend, Yoshitsune defeats Benkei and the monk becomes the faithful guardian of the prince. This film, however, is a revision of this story and involves war, a dark prophecy and political maneuvering. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is "Mappo", which is the prophecy of the Buddha after 1000 years, his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos. It was believed in Heian, Japan, after the eruption of Mount Fuji and the civil war between Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji) that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. It's a time of demons. <br /> <br /> Then you will find how the film solves the problem of Yoshitsune's saber training by the Tenku (goblin ravines) of Karuma. Defeated clans often escaped to the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to frighten the inhabitants. This is said to be where ninja clans started historically. Yoshitsune's representation in Gojo adapts perfectly to all this. <br /> <br /> Next comes Benkei and the different Buddhist tendencies described, including many esoteric Buddhisms of the Shingon sect. These are all described in a rather precise way, and to add a little more, the film succeeds in transmitting the power of meditation and Ki energy so as to make it essential to the story, that is to say to say that it uses magical realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does so in a way that makes it tactical and threatening. <br /> <br /> In summary, it is filled with fascinating details and surprisingly true rings for the period. The sets and costumes are also absolutely essential and very authentic. The soundtrack is excellent, very dark and threatening. I also thought that the acting performances were surprisingly good. Benkei is a great anti-hero, Shanao (Yoshitsune) is portrayed as a young man who tests his limits and becomes more and more intoxicated on his own, and Tetsukichi, the fiery sword smith, is an interesting representation of ordinary man. his unflattering view of killers who have an idea of ​​his social best. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, to see why it's so good, I really suggest you unearth an old book about Japanese history and see how this story turns an almost trivial story of Robin Hood. Wood vs. Little John in a bloody story of intrigue, violence and hellish karma.
