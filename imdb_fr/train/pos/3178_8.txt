The film "Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones propels the viewer on a quest for redemption, the main character taking control of the wheel and putting his life in order. Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to strengthen his character and actualize what matters most. These truths become obvious to both characters and viewers when you laugh and gag at the credits with them. The simple and attractive \ costumes settings make you guess what you will see next. You can not help but smile and laugh at the antics that unfold in this movie. I can not wait for his second year effort. It's only a matter of time before Jones hits again. Bravo!
