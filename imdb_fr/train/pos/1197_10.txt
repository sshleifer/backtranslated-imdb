I just watched this movie, by mistake. What a gem. This film made in 1956 looks and looks like a movie from the late 70's. And is actually better, more sober and correct than, say, Blue Soldier. The environmental and anthropological nuances are well ahead of its time. The sober cinematography is superb and terribly realistic. Much more than dances with wolves, The Last Hunt manages to give the image and feel of the "fields of death" of the buffaloes of the late nineteenth century. Probably because those in the film were real fields of death. The film was shot during the legal forestry law reform, so the animals you see are actually shot and the bones are real. In conclusion, a Western masterpiece very underestimated, superbly interpreted, directed and shot.
