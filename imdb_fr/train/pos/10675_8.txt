I have long wanted to see this film as a fan of Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines through in this role of juvie. Thanks to Turner Classic who aired the show last week. I imagine there were a lot of problems with the children after the war, especially with the situation in the fifties. Some of the boys are a little scary. I certainly would not want to meet them in a well lit street, even less dark. There were some good ideas about the feelings of an insect too, or as they call it, a firefly.
