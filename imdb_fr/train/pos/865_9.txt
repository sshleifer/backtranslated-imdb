Vincent Cassel plays the role of Paul, an ex-prisoner assigned to an office job where he meets Carla, a secretary "quite deaf", when she has her hearing aids to "very deaf". when not (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together, they help each other to develop as people. <br /> <br /> The particular interest of this film was the complexity of the characters ?? do not correspond to obvious stereotypes. Paul seems uncomfortable in the office environment. Is it not for work? This conviction is dispelled when he finds a job in a bar and shines. <br /> <br /> The film has a certain amorality that I find refreshing and shows how easy it is to act criminally, even if we think it is harmless or justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a film full of great moments, both touching and fun. We are when Carla is babysitting and trying to comfort a screaming baby. She continues to cuddle ?? but takes his hearing aids for his own comfort.
