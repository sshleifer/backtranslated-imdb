The industry has dropped the ball on this. The trailer does not do justice to the film and when it was opened, it was on a hand full of screens. If people had had the opportunity to see this, the work of the mouth would have done so with great success. The two main actresses each offer great emotional performances that really draw you into the story and especially into the characters. I checked this out on the recommendation of Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great movie that has never been completely released, except on a few screens. Which did not give him any chance of being seen. Some movies quickly go on video because they are not very good. It's worthy of an Oscar and it's a multi-level tragedy most of whom will never even hear about it. Maybe through word of mouth, he will get a suite on DVD or cable. If you have not seen this movie, you should. Great performances of the 2 main actresses make this film. It could have been just another teen movie after class, but instead it resists other noteworthy movies. Interrupted girl comes to mind. If you like that, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> The two girls find themselves in a moving scene of emotions one after the other, without becoming melodramatic. Although Alicia is angry and Deanna cries through most of the film, her realization is such that the characters are not stereotyped or melodramatic. The film will make you move in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor, use these real performances as your school. Erica is even better in this respect than in Traffic. I hope these two actors will get more roles that will also use their talents and let them shine. Watch this movie and, if you wish, recommend it to your friends so you do not lose it among all the blockbuster stories published each year. This movie was buried while Spiderman 2 topped the records. What kind of words do we live in? Aghhh. So, for the world to be right, review this and recommend it.
