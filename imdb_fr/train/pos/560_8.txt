Another very good Mann film thanks to Walter Brennan's father / son combination and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comic conscience of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He is there to see that the young man takes the fork or leans. "You are wrong Mr Dunston". Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he cares only about himself, but it is clear that he can not desert Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as a Skagway law and duly respects the pitfalls of justice in the face of reality. Another key theme is helping people and being helped by people. The solitary can neither do nor suffer from it. <br /> <br /> The legend above testifies to Tatum's claim that he can not live without his coffee. This addiction to nicotine proves fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now own the DVD.
