The movie was much better than the other reviewer said. It's a beautiful family movie. This has a whimsical fun aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way back in time in the old elevator of her building. Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. She finds and befriends a girl her age and can help her family in many ways. She is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run. It reminds me of a Hallmark movie, so give it a chance and decide for yourself. It seemed to be more for children aged 6 to 12 (maybe a bit older) and it's more PG or G. I'm an adult who can enjoy a good "family" movie - I guess the other one criticism is not.
