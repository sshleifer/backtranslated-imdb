The main reason I watched this movie is that it was directed by Trey Parker and Matt Stone from South Park. However, as soon as the movie started, the bursts of laughter started to spring from my belly. Subtle gestures to a joke, to the flagrant humor of the toilet, with constant confidence in very spiritual insinuations. This film could ruin the most severe event, let alone his poker underwear. Some of the funniest jokes and jokes ever told in Hollywood, as well as a constant criticism of themselves, have been scrapped. <br /> <br /> I'm just going to show that Trey Parker is a fan of writing. It's not too bad at old acting either. I was surprised by the amount I absorbed in this film. However, I'm afraid it's not possible to buy over the Internet here in the UK. Sort it boys! <br /> <br /> I am, and I will continue to show it to all my friends, annoyingly highlighting the nonsense, and sniffing from time to time in my lager. All in all, it's a great movie if you're a fan of useless comedy. However, if you have no sense of humor about stupid or rude things, go for it! However, I'm sure the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could make you shudder at these prejudices.
