Full House was and still is a big show. It's a good show for people of all ages and it's also a good family show. There are really no more shows like this. The children are very cute and even if it's a little tacky, it's still good, especially for those who watch it when they are small. I would like to see the actors interviewed now. Anyone wishing to see interviews with the cast, as if they were now composing the special features of the DVD, should go to the petition site website and sign a petition called DVD: Full House Reunion because there is a petition for that in the hope that the cast may want to do it. Yay for Full House!
