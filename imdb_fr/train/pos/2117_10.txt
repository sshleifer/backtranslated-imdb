Every time I watch this film, I am more impressed by the whole production. I have come to the conclusion that this is the best romantic comedy ever produced. Everyone involved is perfect; script, game, direction, sets and editing. While James Stewart can always count on a good performance and the cast is beautiful, Margaret Sullavan reveals how much she was an underrated actress. His tragic personal life gives him qualities of poet that are not easy to acquire. Lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously did his best. Watch for the number of scenes that were performed on a breathtaking take.
