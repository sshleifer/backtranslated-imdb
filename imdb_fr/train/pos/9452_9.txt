After watching Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction do not seem so extreme anymore. Maybe by the current standards of blood and bullets, it does not seem so upset, but if you think it's in 1972 and the film has a really sinister core, it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I started Watching this movie, nothing seemed really unusual before arriving at the "Dueling Banjos" scene. In this scene, the brutality and the limits of this film are really visible. As I watched Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) clash with a seemingly resumed boy, it really shows how upset this movie can be. When you think that the kid has a little banjo, which he probably would have made by hand, compared to Drew's beautiful, expensive guitar, you will understand how much the four men are out of their territory. <br /> <br /> The plot is very believable and never exceeds its limits. But what really distinguishes this film, about four businessmen who get more than they expected during a canoe trip, is that the director John Boorman (Excalibur) breaks all the characters against caricatures or stereotypes. So, while the film goes into horror and suspense, I really cared about the four men and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> The acting game is universally excellent. With Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease) leading the cast. Jon Voight is probably the most difficult thing of all in this film and it makes his transformation from father to warrior very credible. Unlike Reynolds whose character is a warrior since the beginning, the character of Voight is transformed during the film. Ned Beatty (Life) also plays very well in an extremely difficult role. Get violated by a hillbilly, while Ronny Cox plays a credible performance. <br /> <br /> One thing that really made this movie powerful for me was that villains were as terrifying as anyone I'd seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward were excellent and extremely scary like those of the hillbilly. <br /> <br /> Overall, the delivery has been excellent and I suggest it to everyone except people with a weak stomach and children. 10/10. See this film.
