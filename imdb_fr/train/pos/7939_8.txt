It's good to have a movie that the whole family can watch together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple getting married in Las Vegas on a whim and must not only announce the news to their children but must then try to merge their respective households (each has two boys and two girls) in a cohesive family unit. What happens when the group, which includes four teenagers, two tweens and two younger children, at first glance leaves one wondering if Carrie and Jim can be happy. The fights between the children (and a little love affair between two of them) make us wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along. More interesting than Brady Bunch, it's a totally enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
