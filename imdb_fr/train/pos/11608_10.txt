It's a very good film. After reading other reviews, I find that I'm not the only one to shed a tear. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such talent and conviction that she made the end sincere and memorable. In the hands of an actress of less importance, his last scene would have seemed banal and banal. We would never guess that this film was made with a tight and limited budget. The cinematography is beautiful and there are a number of big name actors. The script is so wonderful that I understand why they all wanted to participate. If you look at the very long list of credits at the end, you will see that half of Hawaii has contributed to the making of this film, and for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and gives the atmosphere throughout the film. My only "complaint" is that I almost did not want the film to end.
