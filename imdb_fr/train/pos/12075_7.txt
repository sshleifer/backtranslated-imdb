Nina Foch insists that "My name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 film noir also featuring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it's the case, the film suffers. It could have been 15 to 50 minutes longer. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up, Foch played the main role on television, playing a neurotic woman, the woman with the unfaithful husband, the nervous wreck. She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here is a young and pretty young engineer who plays the main role. Julia responds to a secretary's announcement and is immediately hired by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. She knows little - although we know right away - that the employment officer is a facade, prepared to find the right woman for this mission, a woman without a family or a boyfriend. <br /> It's a live-in situation; When Julia arrives home, she is drugged and when she wakes up, she is told that she is Mrs. Hughes and that she is not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> The acting game is very good. Small budget but still fun - some things, especially at the end, arrive too quickly, which is why I said the movie is too short. Nevertheless, I recommend it.
