"The Days" is a typical family drama with a little catch - you have to understand the emotions of the character in every possible way so that you can really enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> [Spoilers possible for those who are unfamiliar with the show] <br /> <br /> The story, obviously, for all who watched the show, is the world of Cooper Day, the child from the middle of the family. He records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day thanks to his observations. Her family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister and a great little brother. The first episode, which will sound a little stupid since John Scott Shepard created this situation - the sister and the mother both fall pregnant. This is the first situation that the author strikes. Then the father leaves his job at the law firm. The youngest son suffers a panic attack. The middle child is arguing with the sister's boyfriend. It's a day of work. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a bit crappy but I like it. I first thought that the camera work was a scam, then I got used to it and I started to appreciate it. I liked silent conversations in a dark light. I liked the intimate feeling of the show. I liked the low budget style. I liked the acting. I admire the story. Then I find myself wanting a second season of The Days. I slowly became a fan of this movie after the end of the episode of 6 episodes aired on ABC. It's a very good show and it's nothing like The OC. Both have nothing in common. So I hope fans stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can understand Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you'll love this show. A lot.
