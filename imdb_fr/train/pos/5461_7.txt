Escaped by the death of her father (.. and the taverneuse waitress) died in an explosion, Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck, simply charming) makes its way through the branches of a bank in the big city of Gotham. When a murderous possessive lover, who was supposed to be his next stepfather (and Lily's new lover), the sky is the limit for Lily because she wrote her various relationships in a diary and the subtlety tells her that the Newspapers will receive this if some pay does not come into his hands. Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), the newly appointed president of the bank, sends Lily to Paris instead of breaking a lot of dough, but quickly finds herself in love after several meetings with her in the City of Love. This puts water in the mouth of Lily since it has now reached the base of success, seducing a rich man and prestigious bringing him wealth. However, it follows circumstances that will lead him to make a decision that would put him in danger of succeeding in obtaining these riches .. Tr√©nholm, her husband now, is charged with a prison sentence and lost the bank. He needs money that Lily has now in his possession or he will have absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the whole film, despite the usual varnish of Warner Brothers. Being in the pre-code era gives filmmakers the opportunity to develop taboo topics such as a woman who uses sex to succeed and who can lead to a tragedy. The good direction of Alfred E Green shows through subtle allusions of different ways and discourse through a good interpretation of the seductive performance of Stanwyck, which stages something without showing the explicit act. Obviously, the film shows that money is not everything and that all jazz as love enters the heart of Lily's dead heart. That to finish letting Lily make the miraculous metamorphosis into a lover did not seem right to me. She spent all this time on this platform to crack only for a man who was nothing different from those she had used before him.
