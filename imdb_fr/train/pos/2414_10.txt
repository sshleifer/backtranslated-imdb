Monarch Cove was one of the best dramas on Friday night. I ask the writer to write a long series and broadcast it on Lifetime, SOON. Each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with his replicas for the plot becoming reality. However, the film must continue for a long time. I would like to see Bianca and Jake's child grow up and play a major role in the film, as well as the new grandparents who are planning their educational future. Bring Kathy with her niece and help her live longer. It was great to see the grandparents solve their problems, but the family business had to regain its activity status, and see how Jake and Bianca would survive through marriage. years.
