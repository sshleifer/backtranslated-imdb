I was looking forward to the opening of this film for several months. Being a big fan of Jim Carrey, I easily saw how he could turn into Grinch of Seuss and appropriate the character. I was not deceived. <br /> <br /> This film was pure magic. Carrey is a master in his job and no one could have played this role to perfection. There was plenty to do for adults and children and this film will surely become a timeless classic that everyone will enjoy in the years to come. I already have visions of my girl sitting year after year watching this video remake, and I will definitely watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw her. <br /> <br /> Clearly, this Jim Carrey wrote in the movie, and I do not think it would have been possible without him. However, the actors were charming and amusing, including the adorable Taylor Momsen, who perfectly rejected the antics of Carrey. The scenography, the musical score and the costumes all lent a helping hand to a magical and fabulous finished product and I think that all the participants can be proud of it. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to turn a 22-minute cartoon classic into a live action movie, but Howard did it brilliantly. For critics who do not agree, it may be your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.
