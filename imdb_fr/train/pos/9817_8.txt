I remember this movie. Quite intense for a child of 11 years old. Good editing, I felt very bad for the Saint Bernard. I would watch it again if it was rebroadcast, but the signal passes in front of Pluto as I write this. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I'm just glad I did not live in this neighborhood. Oh those 70's. What decade. If they do it again, I bet it would be very violent and bloody. So what are they waiting for? An excellent movie for sub-pubescent suburban boys. It was very intense. I think it was shot in Los Angeles. Certainly not made in Lodi NJ. The photo with St Bernard was the best and obviously the most obsessive image of the film ... and then they left the carcass on the porch. Rotten children.
