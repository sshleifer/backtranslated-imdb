The Torrent movie was a first and a last for Greta Garbo. It was her first American film at MGM, the only studio in the United States where she would work. It was also the last time anyone else appeared on top of her credits, her main character being her Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the film Entre Naranjos by the famous Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez. These are two incompatible lovers, Garbo and Cortez, who can not really get together, mainly because of the machinations of Cortez's mother, Marta Mattox. <br /> <br /> Mattox is a perverse woman who has strong ideas about who her son should marry. Remember that it is Spain and that such arranged marriages were still quite appropriate at that time. Mattox has Gertrude Olmstead in the lead as daughter-in-law, she is the offspring of Mack Swain, a man rich in pigs. Swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his concern for the piglets before they become fat old pigs to skin. <br /> <br /> Blasco Ibanez had previously novels Le Four Cavalier of the Apocalypse and Blood And Sand. filmed with Rudolph Valentino in the lead. It might have been interesting if Valentino had done this one with Garbo, but it might have been beyond the making of movies when that was done. In any case, one of Valentino's aspirants, Ricardo Cortez, plays the male lead. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons Valentino may not have wanted this film is clearly because the main character is Garbo, unlike the two other works mentioned above. . When Cortez, who does what Mattox and his banker adviser, Tully Marshall, tell him, cleans up, she leaves Spain and goes to France where she becomes a big star of the opera. And leads a pretty outrageous life there. <br /> <br /> When she returns to Spain and tries to revive things, Mattox is even more outraged. She has a political career in mind for her son. Cortez now introduces himself to the Spanish Parliament, which is curiously called the Cortes. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a flood and the breaking of a dam that has caused all kinds of devastation in the countryside. Cortez Brave actually Torrent in a rowboat trying to save Garbo from danger. When they meet, they have a brutal and frank discussion, the brutality coming from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The special effects here, although they seem primitive at the moment, are quite remarkable for their time. They look a lot like the clich√©s used in The Rains Came of 20th Century Fox, published in 1939 and won an Oscar for special effects. Unfortunately for Torrent, he came out a year before Oscar made his debut. <br /> <br /> I will not give any end, so you will have to watch the movie to see if Cortez and Garbo meet. at the end. Garbo was right to win rave reviews for her performance and at a time when exaggerated gestures were the norm in the silent video game, she was remarkably subtle in her role. So she would do the rest of her career, she had a remarkable face for close-ups. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo continues to do a much better job than Torrent, this movie is always a good start for her. the big American screen and holds very well for today's audience.
