About 50 years ago a film about romance and mysticism was filmed. The only two movies I can think of are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films used wonderful actors, not stars. In both films, all the actors presented their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" talks about four English women after the First World War who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy during their holidays. It is amazing that "Enchanted April" was manufactured in 1992. It stands out as a pleasant classic.
