I thought it was a wonderful movie. It touches every fiber of a human being. The love in the movie is very intense. I thought it was Will's best performance so far. Great staging. Loved the editing. The music was great. Good use of flashback. This is the kind of movie that everyone should go to see. I hope people will get something wonderful out of it. Overall, excellent movie. I think Hollywood should do more movies with substance. Even action movies can have a benevolent story. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in his acting. He had a goal and a dedication that is rare to see. I would suggest looking at this alone or with someone you care about. For me, I found that the world had stopped and that my only goal was the film. The outside world was suspended for a moment. It was a nice feeling with all the chaos going on in this world. And with this generation, it was great to see something (someone) who cared about others more than about himself.
