"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was all that the glimpses had announced. It's not often that you find that. Most of the time, previews only show the best parts and the rest of the movie is awful. Not so with this one. I was satisfied with the original plot, even though the subplots were not. The animation was not pierced like "Shrek" but it was still good. The plot and the story were well presented and had only a few slow points. This keeps you interested. I found myself enjoying this one. "Atlantis" attracts and holds your attention. You must also think a little, but not too much. Once you think about it a little, you can understand what needs to happen, but you really do not know how it will be. <br /> <br /> The cast was also good. Michael J. Fox, like Milo was an excellent choice. His personality is good. Commander Rourke, with his skinny skin, was also well chosen with James Garner. His character reminded me of his performance in "Maverick" which also pleased me. I really liked the cast of Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. His ability to play a no-nonsense personality makes the movie more interesting. Too bad, it's a nasty one. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's really worth it (8 out of 10).
