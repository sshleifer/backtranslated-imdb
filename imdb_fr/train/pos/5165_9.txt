This set piece about adults returning to their youth summer camp was a very quiet entrance and movie theatrical release in the fall of 1993. I would say it was a shame, but some of the best movies are ARE calm releases that do not elicit either hype or praise. <br /> <br /> Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (who are good here) are the group of actors who concretize these roles in as people who have aged with good, bad and fun memories of past summers. This film covers the range of emotions, most of the time pleasant, and never hurts the viewer to feel what the characters feel, preferring to let him enter into the memories by himself. Since I've been a brutally brash moviegoer, cheeky manipulation in movies, that's something I appreciate from screenwriter / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> a nice place in a movie theater. You could meet this on TV, and I would certainly suggest a look-see.
