The original animated film Dark Knight returns in this adventure movie that rivals Mask of Phantasm in its freshness. In Mystery of the Batwoman, there is a lot of style and intelligence, far more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> There is a new crime fighter on the streets of Gotham. She dresses like a bat, but she's not an adult Batgirl. And Batman denies any affiliation with her. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work. But the penguin, Bain and the local crowd make things a bit more complicated. <br /> <br /> I did not have high hopes for this "man since I was strongly dropped, but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn") I did not have much fun here !), but I was delighted by the imaginative and exciting staging, the clever plot and the cheeky sense of humor. It's really a movie that no Batman fan should be without. Keep your ears open for a catchy song called "Betcha Neva", which appears prominently throughout the film. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the DVD is not so great. Do not get me wrong, there are some nice features (the short movie 'Chase Me' is awesome) and a very cool soundtrack in Dolby 5.1 but ... the movie is featured in Pan and Scan. Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and shot in 1.85: 1 format, but this DVD is presented in 1.33: 1 format compared to the widescreen clips featured on the features. An image is truncated on both sides. I find this mask extremely boring since Mask of the Phantasm was presented on an anamorphic widescreen. Warner had to literally republish dozens of DVD movies because people complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles. The reason they chose to make the same mistake is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD at 5/5, but the lack of OAR memory brings the overall score to 4/5. It's a shame because the widescreen would have completed an excellent DVD package.
