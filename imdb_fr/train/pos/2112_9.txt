In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (under the name of Klara Novak) gets a job as a clerk in a gift shop; there, she bickers with her colleague James Stewart (under the name of Alfred Kralik). The two do not get on well because they have both fallen in love with an invisible correspondent. Watching Ernst Lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictable. <br /> <br /> Better yet, there is a sub-plot involving the store owner Frank Morgan (under the name of Hugo Matuschek), who suspects his wife to have an affair. Hiring a private investigator, Morgan confirmed that his 22-year-old wife was having sex with one of her youngest employees. Morgan, painfully realizing "She just did not want to grow old with me", and the characters that accompany her prevent this movie from getting old. <br /> <br /> ********* The Shop around the corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan and Joseph Schildkraut
