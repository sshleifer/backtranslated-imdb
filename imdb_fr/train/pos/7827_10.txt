This movie is just great. Cinematography is good, the actors play superb and the story is breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who considered himself liberal until he discovered the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on television a few years later, I recognized him from Kline's portrait. Denzel Washington also performs a masterful performance, as always. <br /> <br /> I urge you to look at this. It's a long time, but it's worth your patience because it tells a story so incredible. Remember, what really happened.
