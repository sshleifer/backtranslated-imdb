It is so much a joy to have watched this intriguing project. So refreshing and educating. Not only for a filmmaker, who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen, but also as an audience, who may not be ready for as much love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 short Movies about love in Paris are all unique, but some, as expected, stand out. I thought the Tom Tykwer segment (Natalie Portman) was the best, although the mimes made me smile all the same. <br /> <br /> I clicked on the option "spoilers" for this review because alas ... what you read is a sufficient spoiler. Just look. Do not read what I write, but look at the movie instead. <br /> <br /> And smile.
