Soldier is not a good movie and everyone who has hated it has good reasons. But I really liked Soldier, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me. <br /> <br /> First, the artistic direction is narrow and well executed. As far as science fiction is concerned, Soldier worked with more design than 90% of the genre. The sets, costumes and props were all coherent and executed with skill; I did not like all their future military style, but the efforts impressed me. For me, this earned the film the time it took to watch it. <br /> <br /> Second, I'm a fan of Kurt Russell. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable films of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his films by John Carpenter. Soldier is essentially an action movie and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. It's not an award-winning role, but Kurt arouses a compelling emotion with VERY little dialogue. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the battle scenes and the battles are well choreographed. This is not an iron monkey, nor even the matrix, but again, it far exceeds the average level of quality of the genre. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it and you like sci-fi action movies, pick it up if you go to the rental center of your choice. Do not expect the next Bladerunner.
