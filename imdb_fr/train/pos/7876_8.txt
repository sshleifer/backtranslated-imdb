I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director. <br /> <br /> I did not watch his other films. They came and went. <br /> <br /> But page 3 is well done. It seems real. As Satya from RGV did it. <br /> <br /> The mental illness of so-called high society is the summary of the film. In the midst of all these diseases, it is difficult to lead a normal life, as the protagonist Konkana Sen does. Serious movie not to watch with children or pregnant women. Page 3 of the newspapers is the usual place to report on the activities of the rich parties and the elite who indulge in much more filth than what is reported. The way this page-3 is also a business prospect is shown in the film. The event management companies are paid to organize parties and make overnight famous people rich but not famous by clicking on the photos with celebrities invited to the party. <br /> <br /> Western culture has interfered deeply in Mumabi's high society. The film shows it boldly, nothing is impossible. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.
