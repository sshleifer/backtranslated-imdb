I have not written a review on IMDb for a very long time, however, I felt compelled to write that! While watching this movie, I found a particular criticism that invited people to NOT see this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant person! NOTHING is a fantastic film, full of laughs and above all ... imagination! Are not you tired of being force-fed with the same old cycle of trash-bubble-gum movies? Sometimes a movie like NOTHING happens and gives you something you have never seen before. I do not even care not to like (not even hate) the movie, but no one has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a monumental impact on reputation and no negative reviews should discredit the movie in this way. Just say you hate it and why you hate it ... but do not try to tell people that they should not be watching it. We have our own ideas and we will decide to thank them. <br /> <br /> If my judgment is good, I would say that more people will appreciate this film as opposed to those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Give your mind a little candor! Do not see anything!
