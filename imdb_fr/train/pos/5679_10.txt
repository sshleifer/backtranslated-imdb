After the success of the second installment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should make a third appearance. This time, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA candidate Rowan Atkinson) lived at the time of the French Revolution instead of the Tudor or Elizabethan times. Accompanied by Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder, now stupid but adorable, is the "faithful" butler of George, the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series, Blackadder is trying everything to become rich and powerful. He tries to elect a lord for a rotten borough, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet on The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a trucker and pretends to be the Prince. It's a very good part of popular comedy. Includes appearances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. He won the BAFTA for best comedy series and was nominated for Best Design and Best Makeup. Rowan Atkinson was the number 18 of the 50 biggest British actors, the comedians actor number 24 and the number 8 of the British favorite comedian, Edmund Blackadder was the number 3 of the 100 greatest television characters and he was the third of the Blackadder (the four series) was the number 2 of the best British sitcom. Exceptional!
