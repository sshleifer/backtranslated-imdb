After the success of Die Hard and its aftermath, it's not really surprising that in the 1990s, an overabundance of "Die Hard on a ....." movies was put on the wrong guy, in the wrong place, at the wrong time. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to save the career of Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is a big dream that appeals especially to those who are experts in mountaineering, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All in all, it's a lot of excuses to call the movie a "pile of garbage". Stallone even managed to be fooled by a horse! However, if you forget all these nonsense, it is actually a very endearing adventure and undeniably entertaining that gives a lot of thrills and involuntarily a lot of laughs. <br /> <br /> You must love John Lithgows taunts wickedness, tick every group of villains, and best of all, the "returner" agent constantly harassed and unfortunate, Rex Linn through. <br /> <br /> He may be Henry in "Portrait of a serial killer" but Michael Rooker is remarkable for a crazy performance like Hal's, he insists on constantly screaming with painful disbelief at to his captors "that this man has never hurt anyone" And although he can not be, it really looks like Frank from Frank Waite the character smiles as the girl dies of sorrow We must also mention the former actor of London's Burning, Craig Fairbrass, who will play the British, who is a farmer who uses Hal as a human football, yes, you can not to prevent from enjoying this moment, Hal needed a good kick. <br /> <br /> So forget your best judgment, who cares if "it could never happen", lower your expectations, increase the volume and enjoy! And if you are looking for Qaulen, it is he who is carrying the helicopter.
