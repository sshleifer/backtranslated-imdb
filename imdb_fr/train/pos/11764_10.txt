I saw him at the theater in 1986 and I fell from my chair laughing more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... he's the best fucking baseball player ever." <br /> <br /> You know how it will end but there is a good time to get there. The training scenes are very entertaining, but the best scene is probably where Jack and Reno are trying to watch the Falcons v. Vikings Monday Night as they try to wear makeup with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it's a shame that he's being overlooked as a leading comedy.
