A film that I had little expectation of and that I only saw a quiet hour - but what time it turned out to be. Roll is an excellent little story, although not serious, of "peasant lost in the great city that makes good", he is always funny, the characters are endearing and the rhythm is just right. "Toby Malone is the real star of the film with his endearing rendition of Matt," said a peasant and Australian football hero Aussie Rules went to the big city to try their luck among the big teams. He is superbly supported by John Batchelor as a local Tiny gangster. Pay attention to these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
