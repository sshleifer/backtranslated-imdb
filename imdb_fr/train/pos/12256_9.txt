Kate Beckinsale is excellent as a manipulator and yet irresistibly charming Emma in this television adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read this novel, I sometimes wondered if the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story: because, honestly, she is so terribly selfish and intriguing that one is tempted to hate her seriously. The interpretation of Kate Beckinsale, however, saves Emma so to speak: she is represented with all the innocence and generosity of her character, and one can not help giving in and loving (not to say 'to love) despite his less lovable qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main, but not the only, reason why this TV series is so delicious. Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, fully expressing the personal magnetism of this character (which is all the more remarkable as this role was not very well managed by Ewan McGregor in Emma's adaptation to the 1996 screen), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams are all as they should be in their respective roles. In short, this production is a great success and deserves to be seen with more and more pleasure.
