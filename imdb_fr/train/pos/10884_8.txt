for a slasher movie, this movie is actually better than many in the genre. Yes, it is predictable, the job of whip continues to kill, people are dying, yada yada yada. However, there are some good things about this movie. I really liked the mask we had worn. It's really scary, it may be unique (although I have not watched all the slasher movies ever made). In addition, the genesis of the bad due is something that I did not see. I also liked the weapon of choice used by Mr. Sicko, for most murders. The murders themselves are not as graphic as most of the film does not take itself seriously, which slashers suffer a lot. Oddly enough, watching the movie, I remembered the film "Friday the 13th", which took itself. There are some concerns about this movie. In many scenes, the killer suddenly supports It looks a lot like one of our horror icons. By that, I want to talk about his movements and his reactions after being hurt, as well as the way he was walking. What is more disturbing though is a scene very close to the end, where Mr. Crazy as the striking resemblance (in fact a complete rip-off) of another famous horror titan. And in the very last scenes, we have our scumbag, again, looking exactly like the 1st horror icon I mentioned. In fact, this last scene is almost complete scam of another icon of the genre slasher. these scenes were weak and without originality (obviously). Anyway, the movie is happening in Australia, so if you're a sucker for a chick with an Australian accent (like me), you'll be in heaven. If you do not do it, there is another great thing about this movie: the beautiful Kylie Minogoue (do not get too attached to it) there is a non-Australian accent, courtesy of Molly Ringwald. In addition, there is more reason to watch than not.i took advantage and I had fun.so I must give "cut" 8/10, which may seem too high for some people.
