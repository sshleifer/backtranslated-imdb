These slasher images have passed their sell date, but this one is very funny. <br /> <br /> The cards for Valentine's Day are witty and well thought out. <br /> <br /> The film has a catch of a line ... "It is not Angel ..." when in fact, it is Angel !!! Watch Buffy's reruns will never be the same again! <br /> <br /> The cast is a sizzling show of young talent, but the story does not give them enough real depth. Denise Richards in the extras of the DVD seemed to think that the girls on the board were well connected and that would give the feeling that you were empathetic with their characters. Sorry but no! <br /> <br /> The direction is very good, she manages to show very little gore and relies on your imagination to threaten. We can also say a lot about the similar way that Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove their clothes ... :-( <br /> <br /> The main thing, the main asset of the management, lies in " 'borrowing' from various others The scene of the shower of Psycho is greeted, as is the "masking" of Halloween. <br /> <br /> Murder someone who hides in a body bag is quite original to me knowledge !!! <br /> <br /> Light look, not very scary but some good moments of jump.If you had the choice between The Hole and this, choose The Hole.The slasher movies have had their day, and it's another slasher, good slasher, but nothing innovative !!!
