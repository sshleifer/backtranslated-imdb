Purple Rain is a great movie if you're a music lover in your forties who partied in Prince's music in the 1980s. History is a popular formula: the rise of musical talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles to find your audience and respect for yourself. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially that of Purple Rain / I Would Die 4 U, is well worth the movie. He is himself and, as a showman, as powerful on stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, about Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, a former protege of Prince, is beautiful and shows some acting and chemistry skills with Prince, but her screenplay does not let her go very far. Morris Day and other supporting actors provide comic elements.
