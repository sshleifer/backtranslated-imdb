For a Danish movie, I must say it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a class apart, but it has international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a big budget, and features famous Danish actors, and some newcomers, who play very well. It can be watched by anyone who loves adventures and a little 'ghost' movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, be delighted!
