"Domino" has been widely condemned on this site for its frenzied editing style and "disgusting" photography. His detractors cite his superficiality and criticize his display of "style versus substance". I totally agree with that. I believe that "Domino" represents the pinnacle of Tony Scott's career in cinema. <br /> <br /> After creating the dominant style of the Hollywood action film in the late 80s and early 90s, Tony Scott gradually moved closer to the more subjective cinema style. From the beginning of "Crimson Tide", Scott used his stylistic talent to describe the inner worlds of his characters. The claustrophobia and drama inherent in the nuclear submarine conflict was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with closed-angle framing. This was then carried by "Enemy Of The State" and "Spy Game" which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage, respectively. <br /> <br /> "Man On Fire" was an extreme departure, a transition to a more expressive and expressionist aesthetic. Here, Scott used an obsolete crank camera and flash frames to express the explosive rage of his character. Although not quite successful, he introduced the techniques that had to find their full expression in "Domino" <br /> <br /> Couched in the framing device of an interrogation of the FBI "Domino" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrative disjointed memory fragments. She captures memories like all of us: fragments, flashes and brief seizures. While Domino tells his story verbally, Scott relays it, visually illustrating not only the events she describes, but also the perspective that guides them. She does have "traces of mescaline" in her system, but her individual vision is still unusual - that of a woman who has avoided the luxury lifestyle for premium hunting. <br /> <br /> It's at the moment when Domino begins to tell the events that led to his captivity that Scott really lets him down. In collaboration with the director of photography Dan Mindel and the composer Harry-Gregson Williams, Scott orchestrates a post-modern contemporary Americana painting. Little by little, we begin to understand that as unusual as it is, Domino is no more disjointed than the "90210" culture that she rejected. As she moves forward in this cultural mix, Scott makes the viewer more aware of the innocence that he destroys through disadvantaged children than the narrative introduces. In the end, Scott describes their salvation as the only way out of this surreal journey. <br /> <br /> To criticize this film for being too stylized is to criticize a Picasso or Pollock for not representing what is obviously human. As in any great painting, "Domino" has a meaning in the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I'm not associated with Scott Free, but I have always been and will continue to be a great admirer of Tony Scott's work.
