Drew Barrymore was excellent in this movie. This role is the kind of role that Drew does not play normally. Her typical role is that of a woman in search of love. The plot is also excellent. <br /> <br /> When Holly is involved in the murder of her mother, she moves to Australia. She moves in with a man who becomes her lover.
