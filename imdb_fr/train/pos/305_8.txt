Screwball's comedy about romantic inadequacies in New York. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture - he respects them - yet Audrey Hepburn is (naturally) a cut above the others because, after all, it is the Princess Bogdanovich who probably fell in love with the cinema. years ago. He shoots her in beautiful close-ups, slips between the sheets between her and a wonderfully cooked and soft Ben Gazzara, and lets her room shine brightly. The romantic relationships created during the film are fast and fun, even though I grew tired of John Ritter's televised brutality. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen, sensual and down to earth, are all exciting to watch. But it's really Valentine's Day from Hepburn and it shines absolutely. *** of ****
