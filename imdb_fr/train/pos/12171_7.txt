I was literally preparing to hate this movie, so believe me when I say that this movie is worth watching. Overall, the story and the gags are artificial, but the film has the charm and finesse to succeed. This gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his boss / future father-in-law and his colleagues see him scratch is not terribly intelligent, but it made me shudder with laughter. The gags of the movie are very rare, but they made me laugh. As I said, the film has charm and the charm can go very far. <br /> <br /> The characters are nice, too. I must say that I would like to have more details on the character of James Brolin, because he was funny in the very rare scenes in which he was. In addition, I admire any romantic comedy that has the courage not to serve as an obstacle in the plot) a total witch. The character of Selma Blair is hardly improbable, and there was never a scene in which I thought, "Why did he want to marry her in the first place?" The end is Hollywood-ish, but it could have been a lot more schmaltzy. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I did not have a favorable view of most of Jason Lee's public works. I loved him so much in Kevin Smith's films that I could not help but feel disappointed to see him play those dopey roles. And he never looks comfortable in those dopey roles. Even in this film, he does not seem perfectly comfortable, but he contributes for two cents and manages each scene effectively. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles proves once again why she is so friendly. Of course, she is a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint, but she also has a unique charm and seems to have a good personality. In other words, its beauty is shown inside and out. I do not know the names of the actresses, but the woman who plays the drunk grandmother is hilarious. Julie Hagerty also has a small role to play and she is always pleasant to watch, which makes me wish for better roles. I loved her so much in "Airplane" and "Lost in America" ​​that it's a shame that she does not have the same chances to flaunt her skills. <br /> <br /> Do not be put off by the awful trailers and even more horrible records at the box office. It's a funny and charming film. Romantic comedies become so predictable nowadays that the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet, so it's always interesting to see one of these bad ones. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
