This is a correct adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally good, but I found Jeremy Northam rather wet like Mr. Knightley, particularly compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine and her English accent is pretty good but again, I preferred Kate Beckinsale's Emma. Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson offer excellent performances. The script is often played too often to laugh, the book is a comedy, but there are too many gags set here, and Frank Churchill's subplot is almost completely absent. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is about the landscape. It's way too lush. England has never been like that. It looks like a box of chocolate. Only Americans would do it like that. <br /> <br /> Despite these criticisms, I liked this film but I would recommend more adaptation to television.
