All Kira Reed fans MUST see it. The film's premise is that romantic novelist Kira fails to come up with new ideas. She is also overcoming a divorce. However, she meets this guy in a restaurant and helps him out of his shell (and his clothes). They go to a corner room and they do it. Luckily, Kira comes out with a condom (now, do not ever tell me that these Playboy movies are worthless piles of soft fluff, remember kids, safe sex). Later, she marveled in front of her publishing house how great it was, but she did not call herself. Despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their naughty games. But finally, she gets tired of her stealth and wants to know more. When she does, hell breaks loose and I'll stop there. It's easily the best of those Playboys movies I've seen. Take a look at this and marvel at Kira's greatness.
