Basically, this movie is one of the few movies you hate and you think suicide is the best thing to do, instead of sitting for two hours watching it. Or, as in my case, you see it as a hit of Kult, one of those movies in which the humor, the plot, the acting is actually very hidden, but for those of us wishing to search for it , trusting the director, the reward is: U ris your A .. of !! The fact that you have to find the things mentioned above makes the film even more funny, because you have the impression that the director is not even aware of the funny film, which seems unlikely and where resides the intelligence at the helm of this magnificent project entitled: Spaced Invaders !!
