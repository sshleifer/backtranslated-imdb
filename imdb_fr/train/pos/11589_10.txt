Dude, I loved this movie! It really brings me back to my childhood. At that time, teachers were still showing class movies on real and if you had been good, they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it upside down. I still remember one of the first lines ... "Tutazema was his name and he was an orphan, he lived with his sister in the village." It's an excellent movie for kids and as durable as the red ball. In the end, the other Indian boys in the village tie the feathers to Tutazema and he himself becomes an eagle. He lives as he always wanted. He can climb the heavens.
