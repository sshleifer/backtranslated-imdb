It was great. When I saw the Japanese version for the first time, it was probably the scariest movie I had ever seen. It was not blood and guts, it was strange, atmospheric and terrifying. In the Japanese version, when the ghost mother paid attention to the bed, I almost had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be too diluted and that Buffy removes the scary nuances of the original version. I did not need to be worried. The directors of this film wisely kept the same Japanese as those involved in the original film, and gave the direction of the film to the same man. They also installed it in Japan at the same place, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director has tried to make the same film as in the original, the only difference being the cast of American actors. This has actually turned into an advantage because he added the element "Strangers in a strange country" to the general horror. Not only were they haunted by an absolutely terrifying and implacable ghost, but they were also stuck in a totally foreign country, having difficulty integrating into society. This added to the anxiety generated in the film and I thought it was an excellent touch. <br /> <br /> Buffy is doing a really good job. She looks vulnerable and is able to transmit her fear well. There are none of the astute remarks common to American horror films, nor the lineaments that hinder the darkness and horror of the character's situation. In fact, it was as easy as The Ring, which I also enjoyed. I hope that the future of American horror follows more closely the new wave of Japanese horror that began with the incredible success of Ringu. We finally get movies that can be classified in the category "Horror" !! 8/10
