Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most delicious movies I have ever seen. A superb set, a tight fitting and a wonderful direction. A film of capers that does not get bogged down in the classic towers. <br /> <br /> We can not say much about this film without spoiling it. The slogan says everything - 5 guys. 1 Safe. No brains. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell lead an incredible cast. Congratulations to George Clooney for producing this gem. <br /> <br />
