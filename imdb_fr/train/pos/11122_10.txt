When we started watching this series on cable, I did not know how addictive it would be. Even when you hate a character, you hold back because he is so beautifully developed, you can almost understand why he reacts as he does to frustration, fear, greed, or temptation. It's almost as if the viewer was following one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why Adriana would endure Christopher's abuse, verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read the paper to see how many women can and tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream house, an endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she'll leave her there for a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not. That's why I look. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you watch an episode, you may find something that you missed the first five times. We even watch episodes out of sequence (we watch season 1 late at night with commercials, but all languages, A & E with censored language, reruns on Movie Network) - as soon as they're aired, we'll be there are. We are totally spoiled now. <br /> <br /> I also like Malaprop. "Albacore around my neck" is my favorite of Johnny Boy. When these jewels have entered our family vocabulary, this is the sign that I should have a life. I will do it when the series ends and I have put together all the DVDs and put the collection in my will.
