If I had just seen the pilot of this series, I would have noticed 10. I immediately became addicted to this beautiful world. The following episodes are not yet up to the promise, but I will continue to watch and I hope this will improve. The production values ​​are incredible and the acting is first rate. It does not bother me that it does not seem to harmonize perfectly with BSG because I am so intrigued by the premise and, let's face it, these are two different series. I am delighted that Esai Morales and one of my favorites, Eric Stoltz, are back in my life (even once a week) because I missed both of them. It's a show that requires a bit of thought on the part of its audience and it's always a good thing. You have to somehow understand some aspects of the series; things are not always what they seem and there are certainly shades of gray, literally and figuratively, in the plot, the characters and, of course, in the different virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the journey is rather difficult.
