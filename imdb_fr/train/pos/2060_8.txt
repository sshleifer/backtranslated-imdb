This movie is not your typical horror movie. There is campy humor and death scenes that can be a little funny. Personally, I liked the film because of its offbeat humor. It's really not a very scary movie, which is good if you do not want to be scared and paranoid afterwards. I liked the performance of hillbilly guy and Lester ... very believable. I think I'm going to dye my hair red like this girl in Scarecrow - very cool! Anyway, it's worth praising for campy humor and the unspeakable horror experience.
