This film is as much about Japanese culture as about the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is poorly seen for those over 7 years old (especially in public), so they bow instead of kissing, even when you are close friends / relatives. Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and that in public too! Never the ballroom dance is (over) quite immensely popular. The people who do ballroom dancing in Japan are somewhat perceived as nudists in the West. Many more would like to do it but are inhibited by the culture. A charming family film that any amateur dancer would appreciate for the only dance sequences. I understand that it was more popular than Titanic in Japan. I guess the Japanese are like us, they also like to be kissed.
