The decision-makers chose the most qualified people for the job and did a wonderful job of preparing the stage. Every interior is full of details that tell you everything about the people who live there. Whether the period of the 20s (the first story), the present (ie 1950) for the middle story, or the 1910s (the last), the costumes and sets are respected and created with love. I love the picky outfits of the two old ladies of the sanatorium - exquisite lace superimposed by the most beautiful Shetland shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very attractive, but no matter the young soppy lovers, it's Raymond Huntley, the man who blames the health and independence of his wife and unleashes our emotions. He is used to playing comical and pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. The China seas (a great 1930s movie starring Gable and Harlow) stole the storyline from Mr. All Know (and also started a Kipling story). I wish we could see Naunton Wayne more as a jealous husband - though he's having a good time staring at the melancholy with a Mexican hat. I like this classy bird that plays his wife, too.
