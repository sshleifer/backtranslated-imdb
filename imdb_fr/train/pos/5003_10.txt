I was not going to watch this show. But I'm glad I did it. Critics of this simply do not understand! This is one of the funniest and funniest things about T.V right now! However, when the interviews were conducted with ordinary people, they seemed probably useless; but put them in the mouths of animals and insects, and it's a riot of laughter. I laughed so much that I had tears in my eyes. The pig with breastfeeding babies and his mother is priceless. The husband and wife birds discussing health problems and the male bird taking a shit after the woman said she was constipated completely broke me! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative show I've seen in a long time! Hopefully it will be back next summer when this race is over.
