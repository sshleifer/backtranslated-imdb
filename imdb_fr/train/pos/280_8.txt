Undying is a very good game that brings new elements on the tired kind of shoot up ups. It tells the story of Patrick Galloway, an expert on occultism and formidable fighter, summoned by a friend on his estate in Ireland to investigate strange phainomes. The game takes place in Ireland after the First World War. Do not expect to find weapons such as chainguns or rocket launchers. All the weapons in the game can be considered as antiques, but the real pleasure of the game lies in its spells and the system on which they work. Our hero is ambidextrous, so he can use both his hands at the same time: he casts spells with his right arm and uses his weapons with the left. So you can cast and cast spells at the same time, which is also very fun! The graphics are excellent and they can work very well on average power. The level design is also cool and atmospheric. The game revolves around the Covenants area and the mansion, but many other places are waiting to be discovered as you progress. Thanks to the talent of Clyve Barker, the game has an excellent storyline and plot (something very rare for a first-person shooter) and I've said it before, in a fantastic and very scary atmosphere, the game actors is as good but not excellent. But the game has two main flaws. First of all, it's pretty linear. So, when your mission says, for example, go into this room, all the doors of the house will be locked, except those that lead to the room of your mission, which can save time, but restricts your freedom of exploration. Secondly, the fact that all weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players accustomed to high tech weapons. As for the difficulty, the game is very well balanced. Most of the time is of medium difficulty, but sometimes it gets harder but not frustrating. Overall, imperfection is a big game. Certainly one of the best fps out there.
