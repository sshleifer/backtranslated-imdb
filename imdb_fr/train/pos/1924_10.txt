This show was great. It was not just for kids, I thought at first, it was for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season was mainly devoted to the father who looked after two girls and his son, he unfortunately died in season 2, I could believe it when I heard him. <br /> <br /> I'm dressed, they continued with the series, because what would really happen in life and I need to mention The Goodbye Episode it was so well done, it had to be so hard for them to film that, we could say that they were real tears in their eyes. I am a 24 year old man and this episode made me cry because I know how they felt when my father died at the age of 13, just like Roy. <br /> <br /> Season 2 and season 3 were a great comedy there also season 3 had some of my favorites such as Freaky Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I always think the show was strong enough to go on, I was disappointed it ended, it was one of the best It was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement and he could have been the next friends. <br /> <br /> he should never have finished, but adore watching rehearsals every day.
