"The Incredible Melting Man" is an incredibly disgusting, energetic and energetic Z-class production that any self-respecting camp-horror fan simply has to see for himself! The perfect way to describe this low-budget 1970s gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... a thousand times dirtier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission, but he reveals himself to be carrying a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... melts him! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve left the hospital, leaving behind a trail of sticky pus and fallen parts of the body. Dr. Ted Nelson must find it urgently, because the disease has also caused Steve an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may seem completely stupid, but this film is extremely entertaining and contains excellent makeup effects from Rick Baker's hand. The face of this molten guy looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him look like Darth Vader! Another great advantage is that William Sachs's screenplay does not waste time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repulsion begins immediately and lasts until the very last moment of the film. Simply enjoy this stupid gem of horror and try to disable your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start to contemplate the many stupidities of the script, you will miss all the pleasure of camping!
