I know that technically it's not the best TV show of all time, I mean it was shot in video and its limits are expressed both audio and visual. The acting game can sometimes be a little crumby too. I'm so screwed. It scared me when it first aired in 1988. Of course, I was 5 years old. But I recently bought the DVD of the first 3 episodes, which I hear unfortunately is now deleted. I also heard that Warner is not going out because of the bad sales of the first DVD. In addition, the television series did not have the same impression as the movies. In fact, I thought his tone was more sinister.Even if the color scheme is similar to the nightmare on elm street 4 (the film and the TV show were made the same year), it has a more serious tone while the fims were getting progressively more sardonic and jokey.not a bad thing, I like Freddy as the wise cracker clown. But I think that was the strength of this TV show, you did not have Freddy popping up every minute utes crack a joke before and after he kills someone. In fact, it has more of a dream feeling, reinforced by the lens's soft focus. I do not know if it's deliberate on the part of the creators of shows or just for the limitations of being filmed on video. I love this show and, taken by surprise at the cinema, can be very pleasant. Much better than anything on TV today.
