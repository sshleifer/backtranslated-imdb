It's my favorite movie, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very intelligent. Not to mention this movie contains some of the best songs recorded by both; as if I put all my eggs in one basket and face music and dance. If I remember correctly, it's the film that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I suppose that, for this reason, he will always have a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental but I am a woman, overcome the) in all this movie gets an 8/10 of me. The choreography was superb and the fact that Lucille Ball is in it makes it even more impressive.
