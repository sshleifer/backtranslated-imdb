These things have been in my head for almost 10 years now. Some parts of this work were really memorable. - I'd love to see another more up-to-date example of great things like CG. In fact, I would like to be part of it. <br /> <br /> If I had the chance to say what I wanted and that's it, I would not have to write all that in addition to be able to do "10 lines if the text" like this site need. I mean really? It almost discourages me, luckily for the guys who made the movie, I really liked Minds Eye - and it took me 3 times to get enough lines, I hope you're not mistaken. - yes you did.
