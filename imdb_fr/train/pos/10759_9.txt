It's true that you always remember what you were doing when a disaster or tragedy occurred. And even more so than September 11, 2001, a date that upset the global landscape of the fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> No, this documentary is not intended to dwell on the events that led to the 9/11. The filmmakers, the brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet, have set out to realize a documentary about the trials and tribulations of a New York firefighter. They had gone to the academy and had done some workouts, and had selected their "Proby" (Probation Fighter) to join them in a New York firehouse, housing Ladder 1 and Engine 7. But their production had to develop and restrain itself to this I thought I was the only shot of the first plane to hit the World Trace Center. <br /> <br /> I was coming back with a friend on the train after a night of local gaming and I received a call at about 850pm local time from my father, who informed me of the above. A few minutes later, he told me that there was another one and that the WTC was under attack. When I arrived home, the upper floors of the Twin Towers were on fire and in smoke and, to my horror, they collapsed in less than an hour. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers had two cameras on the road that day, one who had followed a team on a routine call and had gone to the WTC immediately after hearing and seeing the plane crash on it. As far as possible, we follow the only sequence of events filmed in the WTC1 hall where the first responders from the fire department, paramedics and the police had to understand what had happened and quickly develop a plan of action. . The other camera, held by the other brother, went to the WTC to search for his brother or sister and captured, throughout the trip, the many expressions of New Yorkers, as well as the feeling of chaos reigning in Manhatten and in its surroundings. <Br/> <br /> Over the course of the documentary are numerous interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7, who, miraculously, have not suffered any loss. But being survivors has also caused his own set of psychological disorders as they struggle to cope with the event. Through the events unfolding, we learn the strong fellowship between these men who risk their lives every day in order to save lives. <br /> <br /> We started with what the documentary was supposed to be, before The events of the day totally rocked and became the focus of concern, until the rescue phase where the hope of finding survivors under the rubble was kept alive by men who work tirelessly to make sense of the collapse of steel structures. It's not a film made, and what you see here can not be reproduced in any other documentary (and in the sky, not on soundtracks for Hollywood blockbusters). It's as close as possible to this day, watching the event closely, security. <br /> <br /> The DVD Code 1 contains an extra hour separated from 4 series of interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7..
