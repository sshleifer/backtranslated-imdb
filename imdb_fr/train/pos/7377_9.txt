This film is almost impossible to describe. the alternative title "Do not Look Up" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese cinemas, history is not as linear as that of Americans. The story revolves around a director who films the story of a deserter from the Second World War. The whole is haunted (?) By a deceased actress (?) When shooting a television show in the 60s. The director is the ONLY who saw this show. if you have seen Ringu (the director Hideo Nakata is the same) and you liked it, you will love the ghost actress. I loved the ghost actress much more than the ringu. a really scary and disturbing movie. a 10!
