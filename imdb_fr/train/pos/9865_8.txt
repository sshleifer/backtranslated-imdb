I saw the movie with two grown children. Although it's not as smart as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. In a movie theater surrounded by kids who were on spring break, there was no sound, so I know all the kids loved it. Here too the parents seemed engaged. Death and the apparent death of characters caused the gasps and the appropriate comments. Let's hope people realize that this movie was designed for kids. As such, he succeeded although I like it too. Personally I liked the Scrat !!
