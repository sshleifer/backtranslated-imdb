I think the reason for all the diarrhea expressed in this movie is that most people think that Sharon Stone is about 50 years old and undresses while playing sexy. Nobody was worried about when the Golden Girls were sitting around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm, but seeing someone after menopause digitally rejoice while driving is too difficult for some people to handle. Let's face it, she looks good, she is 5 light years older than my mother who is the same age! This is not an Oscar or a cult classic as the first, but since the beginning of the century, all moviegoers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. As such, he never claims to be either. It is an erotic thriller both erotic and thrilling, an extension of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It was the character of Catherine Trammell who helped to give way to this sequel. Fans of the first film want to know more about this queen of the icy ice. <br /> <br /> The artistic direction and the artistic direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to go to Great Britain. The score is incredible too. <br /> <br /> Certainly, some characters overactivate but David Morrissey did a brilliant job, he is virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> There is a flip-flop in the script almost the same as the first movie plugging a psychiatrist into the cop's place. In addition to the criminal decision of the MPAA to force the film to be cut even more, which removes the sense of guilt-pleasure for which the story is known. <br /> <br /> At least it's entertaining and fun to watch, and these are just the intentions of the film. So, if you have beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should actually see the film and draw your own conclusions before throwing up your projectile-shaped vomit?
