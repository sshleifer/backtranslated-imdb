Eddie Murphy really made me laugh about this HBO comedy show. I love his impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden from "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley, and Michael Jackson as well. The Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo, it's also funny.I saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984.I laughed so much laugh that I almost fell from my chair.I think always that it's very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he was on "Saturday Night Live", made me laugh so much that he is one of the best characters to come out of "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his best performance standing next to "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> <br /> I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 inches and 10/10 stars.
