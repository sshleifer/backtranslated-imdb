Japan 1918. The story of Ryu, 16, begins with the death of her father. As will be revealed later, both of his parents died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Aunt Ryus arranged a wedding with a Japanese in Hawaii, whom they only know by her photo. Upon arriving in Hawaii, Ryu discovers that his new husband is much older than pictured and lives in very modest conditions next to a sugar cane plain on which he works. Ryu not used to forced labor on the ground and desperate for his situation in his new home is thinking of fleeing. She soon discovers that she has nowhere to go. Friendship with Kana, one of his colleagues, gives him new hope and strength. This image is based on real events that occurred between 1907 and the 1920s, when thousands of Asian women were married to men in America, whom they knew only by their image. This little known image is well written and interpreted. The location is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his latest appearance on screen as Benshi (silent film narrator). This film gives a glimpse of Japanese culture from here and across the ocean. A must see!
