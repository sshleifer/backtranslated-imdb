The kids, ages 7 to 14, loved the movie so much that we gave a copy to all the other kids on our birthday list this year. They all loved it! Children from 2 to 7 years old look at it regularly and frequently, and we have a lot of fun watching it with them. <br /> <br /> It's rare for a movie to entertain children so long and offer laughter to adults. as well. Most benefit more than the first. <br /> <br /> Top quality production and excellent distribution, led by Christopher Showerman as George Superior - athletic, energetic and quite credible, with an adorable innocence and ability to take a tree in front - well supported by the inimitable Christina Pickles as an evil mother-in-law, Thomas Haden Church as a diabolical rival, and all the others. It's funny!
