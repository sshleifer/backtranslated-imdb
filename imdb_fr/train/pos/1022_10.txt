Stargate is the best show of all time. All actors are absolutely perfect for their roles. I love the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show, I highly recommend it. Although this program is often compared to Star Trek, it can not really, because it is completely different. I am a fan of Star Trek, but I would like to note this show well above the Star Treks. Unfortunately, I live in New Zealand and Stargate is not visible on our TV. Therefore, if I want to see it, I have to buy the DVDs and the season 10 is not available yet, so I can not see it for a while (which is very depressing). However, this program is really very good and should be seen, but be aware that it is highly addictive. So, in the summer, I love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
