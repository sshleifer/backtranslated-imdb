What a perfect example of "Less is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sergeant Todd) has only 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo, when your mind has to fill in the blanks, facial expressions, physical drama, emotional gesture, everything combines to create a stronger impact. It's one of the 5 best movies I can not live without, with classics like Road Warrior. If you liked, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart", both performed by Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was in Soldier as well. The "thirteenth warrior" with Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" with Harrison Ford.
