Really the story of two arrogant brothers and their respective falls of grace (via drug addiction) and subsequent redemption. A brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco is your sensitive but typical intelligent child-man. The other brother is a future doctor who works hard and is less judgmental when he is addicted himself while facing the stress of having to meet the expectations of his family for the two children. It is not too complicated to be fables of drugs, it is a pretty realistic overview of the family dynamics engendered by drug problems. I would recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and would congratulate James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a work of love.
