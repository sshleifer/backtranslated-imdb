When I heard about "Hammerhead" released on DVD and finally found it in my local DVD store, I thought "good, just another cheap Nu Image monster movie". These guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner have produced inexpensive but entertaining B - Pictures in recent months, but also very disappointing movies. So, I did not expect much, especially after watching a few days ago the "Shark Zone", rather disappointing. But "Hammerhead" turned out to be a great awakening of 1950s monster movies. We have a crazy scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and damsels in distress, devouring plants and of course we have the creature, a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. All you need for an entertaining monster movie. The only thing missing is the sex scenes and nudity you expect in movies like this, but as the movie is made for television, we understand why these scenes are missing. And anyway, no matter the cause, "Hammerhead" is the best action and horror entertainment. There are two reasons why I gave seven points out of ten, however: Firstly, the monster is not very often seen and the confrontation with the destruction of the creature is too fast and badly done, and second, William Forsythe is not the good guy for the "hero" part and to fall in love with the beautiful Hunter Tylo. Apart from that, I highly recommend this movie to all monster movie fans. Take a cool drink and popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
