One of Vance's best films succeeds in the interesting plot and art direction of none other than Michael Curtiz. This time, a generally hated financier is found dead with a bullet in his head, locked in his locked room on the upper floor. Philo Vance, heard about the situation as he was about to leave for Italy, decides to end his holidays and tries to solve what he considers a murder and what everyone is considering suicide. William Powell is a Philo Vance as affable as you will find him. He never seems to support and is still very smooth in what he says and does. Powell is aided by a host of very talented actors - leading actors and actresses such as Mary Astor, a niece hates her uncle, Ralph Morgan, the deceased's secretary, Paul Cavanaugh, a rival dog lover, Arthur Hohl , a mysterious butler, Helen Vinson as a neighbor remained blonde, and two very good performances of James Lee in Chinese cuisine and the corpulent Eugene Palette in detective detective. Etienne Girardot is a public coroner who is still missing his meal. It is this depth of suspicion and a story that has many twists that make The Kennel Murder Case a quick and fun mystery.
