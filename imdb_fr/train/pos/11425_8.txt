The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa, but it's so much more than that. <br /> <br /> Anyone growing up in the South would know the same things. A nostalgia for another, a different race, that can not be consumed. Even a look is forbidden. There are no words needed. Their facial expressions say everything. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a black servant, Protée (Isaach De Bankolé), and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they can not kill each other. <br /> <br /> The little girl, France (Cécile Ducasse) is alone and spends all her time with Protée. She really can not see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the most irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials. They can not even undress themselves. The world is about to finish. they do not know it yet. Their racist attitudes will be erased by their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I would like to visit this Africa. He seems so calm; especially at night when you only hear animals.
