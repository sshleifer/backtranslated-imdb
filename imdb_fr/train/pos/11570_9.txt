Elmer Fudd laughs sitting in his chair and reading his comic, his dog sleeping comfortably near the fireplace. Everything is peaceful until a flea bounces. (The chip wears a farmer's suit with a big sombrero and carries a satchel bearing the name "A. Flea".) He takes out his telescope and spots the dog. (We see a big shot of dog's butt and the fleas whistle with joy, shouting "T-Bone!" He sings then: "There is food at the corner, there is food at the corner!") < br /> <br /> This sets up the scenario of this pretty odious chip that torments the poor dog. The cabot is hilarious because it reacts to the chip. <br /> <br /> The drawings of his huge teeth nibbling right next to the flea fledged are clever and the dog's dialogue made me laugh a few times. This is perhaps the funniest dog I have ever seen in a cartoon! The poor dog, under the threat of taking a bath, does not react when the stupid chip hurts him. It is almost painful to watch the chip use picks, jackhammers and the like on the dog. He puts firecrackers in the dog behind. It's brutal!
