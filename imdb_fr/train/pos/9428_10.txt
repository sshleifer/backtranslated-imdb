One of my favorite movies to date begins with an adventure through the wild side of a four-man team from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living the Chulawasse River before it becomes a lake comes from Lewis of Burt Reynold, who unconsciously drowns his comrades in their worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film is more like an action movie, the second part takes the viewer into a totally different story, with our men forced to make a decision (they know) that they will change their lives forever. Very bad manners. At the end of the film, each person will be forced to deal with the scars of what should have been a quiet weekend on the river, but a battle for survival. The film (except some obvious blunders) is very well done and beautifully shot in a nature paradise that takes your breath away. The photography is excellent too. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all excellent for showing how the same event can ruin in four ways four different lives related to the same mistake.
