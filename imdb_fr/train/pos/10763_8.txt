I must admit that I was very skeptical about this documentary. I expected it to be the kind of widespread propaganda that we in Europe do not like so much. I was wrong. It's NOT propaganda, it's actually a barely political act. <br /> <br /> It describes the events of September 11 through the eyes of the firefighters called on the scene just after the plane crash. It's a coincidence that this documentary was shot! This film was first shot as a documentary about a New York firefighter who became a "man". We can only thank the filmmakers for continuing their work during the terrible ordeal that threatened them. <br /> <br /> A great job. Absolutely beautiful material. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Sincerely,
