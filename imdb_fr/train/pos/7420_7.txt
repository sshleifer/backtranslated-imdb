Although Kris Kristofferson is good at this role, who would not want to see Elvis Pressly instead? Addiction and the fall of the supreme glory may have frightened Elvis's agent to be part of the movie, it was a mistake. It would have been a perfect movie for Elvis. Even though the soundtrack is far from fantastic, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand are doing a decent job creating a soundtrack for this "vintage" piece / comedy. A bit of a love story is more of a drama about the fall of grace and the gift of redemption. As in most tragedies, the hero of the story was dead. In addition, Gary Busey is once again perfect in a less perfect role.
