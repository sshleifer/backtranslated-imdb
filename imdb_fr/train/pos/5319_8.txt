Forget it's a movie "B". Forget that it's in many ways outdated. Instead, give writer-director Ida Lupino a well-deserved credit for addressing a subject that at the time (1950) was taboo in Hollywood. To my knowledge, this was the first film to discuss the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects of this crime on its victims. <br /> <br /> Although most of the actors are pedestrians, Mala Powers, who was then 18 or 19, gives an excellent performance throughout the traumatized young woman, Ann, who is trying to escape her " shame". Based on her work in this film, I'm surprised she did not have a more successful acting career. Tod Andrews also has a good time as a minister who helped her. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lupino, obviously working on a limited budget, was always able to create memorable scenes such as pursuing the streets and alleys leading to rape and the police line that followed. And, she created a bittersweet ending that left me wondering if Ann could really have a normal life.
