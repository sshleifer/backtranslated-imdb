I'm stunned to see how this movie (and most others have 5 stars on average and less when there are bad movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on IMDb.) The fanboy mentality strikes again. everyone else criticized him, even my ex-girlfriend said the movie was dubious, and years later I sat down to watch this movie and found myself enjoying it I even laugh a lot, I do not see how, since most of Fuqua's films are smarter than anything Michael Bay has imagined ... Anyway ... <br /> <br /> History : Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is a former convict who, along with David Morse, a good-natured treasurer, catches a murderer named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson), all of Alvin's movements are followed by an insect implanted in his jaw after an accident.These agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks q ui were caught in a hold-up that goes wrong. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is as funny as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a talker who is much smarter than he suggests. Doug Hutchinson is doing well like Bristol. It can be exaggerated sometimes in his behavior of John Malkovich. He was better here than Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as a state-of-the-art treasurer. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother, Stevie. Jamie and he had fun moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the film is that he was the victim of some thriller attempts. The scenario on the race track is really exaggerated but I could not look away. The director did everything to earn points. In addition, the bomb scene with the treasure agent tied to a chair while the detonator was resting on the door was pretty neat. <br /> <br /> In the end, Bait is not a bad film by far. It's never boring, it's always funny and I did not check my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated films of the period 2000. <br /> <br /> PS: for the critic who claimed that this film was too violent .... How long have you lived under a rock? I'm sure you've seen Die Hard and EVERY film by Quentin Tarantino. But these movies are not violent, right? Weirdo.
