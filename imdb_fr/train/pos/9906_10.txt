YES, the plot is barely plausible and very thin. YES, the acting game goes from medium to laughable. Yes, this has already been done so many times. However, this is a film that does not fear these facts and claims to be more than that. There are indeed original scenes of death and the tension increases throughout the film. Moreover, you are never more than a few minutes away from a bloody murder. I urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it as it was. a scary and funny slasher movie with an incomparable theme melody.
