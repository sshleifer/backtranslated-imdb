The Master Blackmailer, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", is Sherlock Holmes' first feature film I've seen with Jeremy Brett. The story is interesting and dark. The film looks a little sad and sad, but it is quite entertaining (with particularly amusing scenes). <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are trying to reveal the identity of an illusory master singer who has ruined some of England's most prominent families by publishing private letters that in one way or another, will destroy their lives. They eventually discover that this is Charles Augustus Milverton, an "art dealer", after the few tragic consequences for the victims who could not pay. Our heroes must then help Lady Eva Blackwell, who has to pay an amount beyond her means, otherwise her next marriage will be permanently canceled. The scene in which Holmes and Watson are robbing Milverton's house is intense. Although the film has a happy ending, the tone is sad and regrettable. <br /> <br /> The exceptional performances of Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual) and Robert Hardy as a notorious villain (as many probably recognize) today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter ), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes involving her and Holmes are a riot). I give him a *** 1/2 on *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough Inspector Lestrade. (I would have liked them to add in the scene at the end of the short story, where he gives the description of the two burglars, one of whom corresponds to Watson.)
