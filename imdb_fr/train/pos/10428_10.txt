Amazing movie that, in theory, should be boring but comes with a subtlety and an incredible game that I long despaired to find. Instead of relying on clich√©s and excessively dramatic moments, the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The main characters are not perfect and so it's easy to approach them as people you might know. The film does not try to make people laugh, nor to push an ideal on the public, but simply to show us the possibility of true love in all circumstances. <br /> <br /> I am now impatient to wait for the weekend to be able to see more. A moving, provocative and funny look on love that, in my opinion, should be an absolute romantic classic at Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. Will soften even the hardest heart.
