Yesterday, I went to the cinema alone, because here in Mexico, most films from other countries are part of the "cam√°ra alternativa" (alternative camera). But after watching this film, I realized that not all foreign films are alternative. Fortunately, this is a good example. But I must say that I liked this film so much ... that in the end I was happy ... This film is a spoonful of hope in those days. And the main lesson for me ... is that in the end ... love is the main strength behind us. It's a good option to see a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention good music .. especially the main song of the movie .. A good song! Excellent song! !!
