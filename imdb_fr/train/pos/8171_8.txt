I realize that this criticism will make me blame the movie critics experts patrolling this site, but I will defend this film. <br /> <br /> The Dentist is actually a very good movie. The acting is not always on top, but the thrills are good and the story is good. Plus, you see the crazy Linda Hoffman. Not that I am an expert in this field, but the direction seems good and the plot is logical. Corbin is an excellent scary dentist. This makes dentists what Jaws does to sharks ... He obviously had a fairly limited budget, but they did what they could and developed the characters (the ones that matter). <br /> <br /> the end.
