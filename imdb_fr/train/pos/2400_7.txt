I see what my ancestors saw in the young Bette Davis. She is splendid in this almost crazy political comedy that puts Warren Williams as a political agent constantly behind his alimony. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant like her ex, and I found myself supporting her all the time. The character of Williams is not at all friendly and he is not even a good op. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee is one of the best in what he does. A candidate pulled out of his sleep at a political convention and appointed governor to prevent the appointment of a rival candidate, so that all this mess was born from the internal political war in a party called the "Progressive Party". If you are politically minded, you will probably see a party other than the one you are affiliated with in the fictitious "Progressive Party" of Williams and Kibbee. I could make exact parallels, but we are not here for that. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those who like these old comedies. If you've ever watched one of Wheeler & Woolsey's previous titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh, Williams' right-hand man, much like Bert Wheeler. He cheated on me. <br /> <br /> Yes, my wife and I recommend this one.
