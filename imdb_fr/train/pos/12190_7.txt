It is very difficult to say what was happening with "The Lady of Shanghai" and what the film could have been without the interference of the studio. At this point, Orson Welles' main interest in cinema was to raise funds for his theater. Indeed, funding his own projects is what drove him to look for temporary jobs. He did "Lady from Shanghai" for his ex-wife soon, Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohn feared for Rita's image and delayed the release of this film for a year. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns an Irish sailor, Michael O'Hara, who falls in love with Else (Hayworth, stunning short blond hair). Her husband is a well-known criminal prosecutor, Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), as infirm inside as he is absent. He hires O'Hara to work on his yacht. O'Hara is plunged deeper and deeper into a network of murders and deceptions. <br /> <br /> "The Lady of Shanghai" is moving at a brisk pace, but I agree with one of the posters that reproaches today's movies for taking the time to build a plot . Still, this film hangs. The scene in the entertainment house is fantastic - Welles wanted it without music, though, and I think the studio reduced it. Too bad. The photography is breathtaking, atmospheric, daring and very elegant. <br /> <br /> Welles was an excellent actor, handsome in his youth, charismatic and with a wonderful voice and technique, but in many films, if he does not trust himself or if he does not take the time to develop a character. Instead, it relies on external elements such as accents and false noses. One of the only times he did not do it was "Tomorrow is Forever", where the director gets an excellent performance from him. Compare that with "Compulsion" where he shows that he is a master of the purely acting technique since he calls in his performance. Here, Welles does a quad work: as a director, star, co-author and narrator. Wearing a totally useless accent and looking intense was a quick way to characterize. Nevertheless, he is still convincing. <br /> <br /> The support players are excellent, including Sloan and Glenn Anders. Hayworth, gorgeous and soft-spoken (her vocals were again dubbed by Anita Ellis) is as usual a complete goddess and one of the big presences on the screen. What a sad life for such a vibrant beauty. <br /> <br /> Any movie made by Orson Welles is worth the detour, and "The Woman of Shanghai" is no exception. But it leaves the viewer frustrated, as is "The Magnificent Ambersons" - like any work that Welles did in the studio system. He was a great artist who should have received a freer reign. he was not. It was a strange dichotomy - he needed more freedom, but, as some of his later work shows, he needed the structure of the workshop. Alas, he could not have both.
