This is a very amusing and sometimes scary anthology, which, while a little short in the script writing department, largely compensates for the gap in acting, location work and general exuberance. The best episodes of this film are the first with Denholm Elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works (a perfect example of acting from this pedestrian); the third, with Christopher Lee as a man terrified by his own daughter and the last episode with the late lamented great Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror movie star who gets more than a new role in his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspired, both wanting to take the opportunity to get drunk! Cushing is generally good in the weakest segment, which does not help the fact that the wax figure of the woman whom he is obsessed with the local wax museum is anything but "beautiful" as we are told of the believe! Someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead, we gave a woman with a turtle jaw. This film is minimal, but its gorgeous country house setting is to grab when you can.
