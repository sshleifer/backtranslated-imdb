I like the battle of good and bad. I liked Eddie in this movie better than any other movie he's ever done. He was not smart, insolent, he knows everything he usually plays. It shows the heart and a more humble humor. The fact that it shows that there are strange things in heaven and on earth that we can think of gives me hope.
