Of all the films I've seen, and most of them are, it's by far the best film made primarily on US naval dirigibles (Blimps) from the time of the Second World War. Yes, there are other good LTA-related movies, but most use special effects more than all real-time plans. This Man's Navy has significantly more real-time images of airships, etc. That's right, a lot of nerdy dialogues, but that's what makes Hollywood movies more interesting even today. P.S. I spent 10 years (out of 20) and spent more than 5,000 hours in naval airships of all types, from 1949 to 1959. Proud member of the Naval Airship Association, etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN retired]
