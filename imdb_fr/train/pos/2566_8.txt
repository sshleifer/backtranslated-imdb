Any film that deals positively with bigotry is a film that should always be seen by the current audience, because the message and the moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of sectarianism. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film is really an old-fashioned love story .. A boy meets a girl..a boy loses a girl ... the boy gets a girl .. .. <br /> <br /> The weaker role goes to the late Kent Smith as Lieutenant General Webster (Riccardo Montalban is nearby) ... my question is how did he get to be a general 3 stars ... the character is such a thing in the presence of his wife and military subordinates, it is a wonder that they show him the slightest respect. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a little exaggerated, and some scenes have some holes, but overall, I enjoy the movie every time I see it. <br /> <br /> The Red Buttons, it's great ... I always like to see actors in dramatic roles ... as in the case of Button, a comedian can often better describe the tragedy of a person that d actor ramatic.
