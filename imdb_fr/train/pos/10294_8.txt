Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman as well as Jennifer Aniston team up to make one of the funniest films of the 2003 season (late May) and a good improvement of Carrey's past and unfathomable roles in his past comedies. Carrey, with his slightly diminished antics and the zeal and creak of his old man, carries with power this film to the height of laughter and some dramatic and dark moments. Elements of Jim's true acting abilities continue to appear in this film. These summer entertainments are very appealing, with dramatic elements and zany moments that fit perfectly with this scenario. While still missing out on this superbly refined set of comedies and dramas, Bruce, Almightly deserves the credit of being an excellent date film with a strong message, gentle spiritual cynicism and a parody that preserves his good taste. Eight stars out of ten.
