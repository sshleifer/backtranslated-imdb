After reading the reviews of this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided to add my 10 cents. I think the film was excellent, not just for visual beauty, writing, score, play, and staging, but by telling the story of Joseph Smith and the journey he went through, he through a life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew how to be his way. I am very happy, indeed, to have had a small role to tell the story of this remarkable man. I recommend to everyone to see this when the opportunity arises, regardless of the religious path in which it is found, it only reinforces the determination to live the life that is appropriate to live with the true values ​​of life. love and forgiveness that the Savior taught us. make.
