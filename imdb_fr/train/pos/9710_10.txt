That's what makes me proud to be British. This is by far the funniest thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and the lovely blacksmith Reece. Totally underrated, this horror comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and the slogans weird, "Hello Dave". It's a comedy that everyone has to watch. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the men's league is that it's always cool and always pushes the boundaries. He does not need to use slogans (unlike little Brittany) to be funny. the fact that the league is willing to kill probably their most famous and emblematic characters shows us that they have steel balls.
