Something about "Paulie" touched my heart like few movies do. It's a spiritual film, funny and emotional. I am a latecomer to become a fan of this movie. I only saw "Paulie" in May 2004 and have since ordered the Widescreen DVD from a seller on eBay. <br /> <br /> The special effect of showing Paulie talking is superb. My son asked me how the bird knew so many sentences. Probably my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in the company of Gena Rowlands (Ivy), followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent role as a kind-hearted human. You are looking for it throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong by renting or buying this movie!
