Most of New Orleans or New Orleans movies are ridiculously bad and incredibly inaccurate (for example, remember "The Savage Bees"?) But I will make an exception for "Tightrope", which has almost quite well worked). <br /> <br /> Here is one that is not necessarily wrong. The accents are not too bad (yes, the "yat" accent here is much more Brooklynese than south), the city of 1950 is shown as is / was, without the obligatory "tourist" hits, and they include a good drama without try to make everyone an "original Southerner". <br /> <br /> One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good movie to start ..
