In fact, I did not start watching the show until it appeared on FX. I was bored and had nothing to watch and I saw that the reruns of the series were in preview, so I decided to watch it. I was so upset that I did not watch the show when it aired for the first time on television. I liked the show so much! Finally a show for the pleasure of all. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were acceptable shows but not entertaining enough. They made stupid jokes and laughed at things that were just stupid, but not That 70s Show. This show of the 70s was hilarious, intelligent and so real. I think it was the best show ever and I'm really sorry it's over. Although I love this show, I think it should have ended in the seventh season, when Eric and Kelso leave. The last season was just not right, Eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character left. I still love this show and I hope television will start producing others like this one.
