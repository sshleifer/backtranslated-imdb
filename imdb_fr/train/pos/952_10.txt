So this movie designed for television only has 7.6 on this site? Bah! Humbug! Without a doubt, this 1984 version of Dickens' classic tale is the best ever made. And yes, the dog saw the 1951 version that was also good, but not enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest flaw of this version, even if the acting was wonderful. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott is just amazing like Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this stingy businessman, haunted by the ghost of his deceased partner, then by three other spirits later in the evening. Scott is very gruff as Scrooge. Too gruff in fact for some critics who claim not to be able to project the newfound joy at which he wakes up on Christmas morning after the spirits have taught him a valuable lesson. But hey, it's George C. Scott. He is never going to dance in the street with joy. He has too much dignity and his Scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> The secondary representations are always excellent, as are the costumes, the music and the landscapes. The nineteenth century in London comes alive in the visionary style of Clive Donner. The film even borders the scary in several scenes involving the spirits. The important history of morality is apparent in all settings. <br /> <br /> You will not find this version more often on television, which is disappointing. The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol should be one of the essentials for every household's holiday celebration. When the decorations come out of the basement, this movie should be introduced into the DVD player at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
