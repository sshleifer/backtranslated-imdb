I did not know what to do with this movie. I guess that's what it really was. I have never seen a film like this and I doubt that I will ever see it again. Glover sets up something of its own. I think that to appreciate it, you have to read some of his poetry, maybe see one of his slideshows. I really like this guy, he's so weird that I can not help it. Note: I saw this film before its final editing, so maybe what I've seen and what others have seen are different. I'll know, I guess, if I choose to see the movie again. I think I will have to be properly influenced by drugs ...
