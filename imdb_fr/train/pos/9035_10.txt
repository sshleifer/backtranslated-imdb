The game in this movie was superb. As an amateur rocketeer, I found very few mistakes. As a human being, it touched my heart and my soul. To watch the actors, one might think that these are the real characters. Laura Dern, one of my favorite actresses, left nothing of her performance. The young actors who play the Rocket Boys have shown a talent beyond their years, especially the young Homer. Homer's father inspired this relationship of love / eternal hatred between a father and his son, so that it becomes real. If you do not feel a lump in your throat or shed a tear when the first successful rocket comes up or father and son get along, have your pulse checked (you may be dead).
