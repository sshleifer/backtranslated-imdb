It's a movie for entertainment; I did not think the world was making a social comment from a little movie. Personally, I find this film funny, daring and memorable. It's a fantasy not like an ashen girl becoming a princess. This film was very well done, I could add, in the 70s, one of the best cinematographic experiences to talk about the sexuality of a person. This film does not speak of a homosexual person or not, but it is about love, in all its strange forms. This film shows some of the realities of being gay in the 70s in Hollywood or California. Pretty boys cared for by older men, not so pretty. Women who must remain deeply locked in the emotional closet or may not have a career. Public baths were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> THEN the fantasy begins !! Let's mix a lesbian with a homosexual and add some alcohol and what do we have? Well, this film, which in any way was better than this dismal reflection "The Next Big Thing". Maybe someone should have asked the whole team to watch this film and then try to do better. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the 70s and it always makes me smile. I wholeheartedly advise anyone who wants a fun and funny film to snuggle into popcorn and have fun. Some people need to lighten up !!! And here is the movie with which you should do it! <br /> <br />
