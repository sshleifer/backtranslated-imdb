I can not say how much the film follows the novel, I never read the book, but since it's about six and a half hours, it's a safe bet that most of the base is covered or, at least, we can say with some certainty that this is not a condensed version of Reader's Digest. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are high and up to the standards of other classic series of the BBC such as Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We can believe that Dickens' London looked, sounded and thought a lot like that. There are some occasional minor breaches - some athletes fire a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or at any time. <br /> <br /> We must also welcome the game of actors. Suzanne Burden is the polite and honest heroine who will quietly do good. She is cute too, in a mature way, her beauty in her compassionate nature not in the slightest flirtation. Denholm Elliott is his guardian (and more than that, it turns out). Burden and Elliott are two of the few characters who are good in an unmixed way. Another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people. Another is a poor and helpless young boy. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone else could have written that. All of Dickens' characteristics are: poverty, tragic deaths, raw capitalism, generous wealth in his secure home, hidden filiation, dark motives and helplessness or flagrant malice in the justice system. Well, not the justice system as a whole, but the Chancery, which was obviously a court that dealt with matters relating to the distribution of property. (So ​​I understand from Wikipedia.) It became so rigid and dilatory that it was completely remodeled in England in 1973. On two occasions, the character Elliott described it as "a curse". The most impressive scene is that of a money-hungry creditor tracking down a retired soldier in his gym during a fencing class. The Sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense of the word than any other Dickens male character I remember. The apoplectic lender and tenant shout threats from his seat. The sergeant turns to him and does a delicate exercise, saber after saber. Each advancement brings him closer to his executioner, while the old creditor with a scarlet face falls back into his seat. . <br /> <br /> Some elements are missing. Dickens will often stick to at least one or two fun dialogue lines. ("Humbug!" Or "The law is a donkey.") Not here. "Bleak" house is the good title. Secondly, there are practically no Weberian "ideal types" - not Mr. Micawbers, Artful Dodgers or Scrooges. Third, the atmosphere, the whole of ethics, are tirelessly bleak. Tribulations succeed one another, usually with money or a shameful peccadillousness of the past. <br /> <br /> My God, it's depressing. It's as if the author was purging his spleen of all he hated in the world he knew. Poverty, okay. He knew that poverty. But one wonders what the Chancery did to Dickens to deserve this type of treatment. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should add that I just watched the first episode of the 2005 series - and that's better in two respects. There is more zip in the direction, so the pace is a little faster. And the business Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce are satisfactorily explained from the start, instead of hiding in the shadows as a mysterious "curse", the plot is therefore easier to follow.
