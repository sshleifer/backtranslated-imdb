"The tenant" is the biggest film of Roman Polanski, IMO. And I love Chinatown, but this one is so much more original, unconventional and downright terrifying. It's also a big black comedy. Some people I showed this movie were very disturbed afterwards, so be forewarned, it affects some people this way. Polanski does a great job playing the lead role in "The Tenant" and directing it.
