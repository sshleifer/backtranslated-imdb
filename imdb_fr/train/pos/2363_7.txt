This adaptation of Mr. James' short story "A View From A Hill" aired for the first time on British television in 2005, on the little-watched digital channel BBC 4. I saw that it was repeated at the BBC 4 and I decided to give it Go, remembering the successful adaptations of the BBC in the 1970s, other stories of MR James, including "Whistle And I Come To You My Lad" and "The Signalman" . Although not in the same class as these masterpieces, "A View From A Hill" is nevertheless a pleasant and sometimes very suspenseful drama. <br /> <br /> A historian arrives in a small rural village to examine the collection of a recently deceased collector of ancient artifacts. In the countryside, he sees a ruined abbey for centuries. But what does this have to do with an old pair of binoculars and a terrifying legend about the grim name of Gallows Hill? And what do the rough country governor and his servant know about the situation? Although I was not scared in any way, I enjoyed this small production and, if the duration had exceeded 40 minutes, it really became an excellent adaptation. In the current state of things, it feels a bit rushed and a little more exposure to create the mood would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> I give him 7 out of 10.
