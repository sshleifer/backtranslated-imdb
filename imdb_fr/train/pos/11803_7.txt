"Sasquatch Hunters" was actually not as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling in the Woods, in the Park Ranger Woods, Charles Landon, (Kevin O'Connor) Roger Gordon, (Matt Latimore), Brian Stratton (David Zelina), Spencer Combs, (Rick Holland) and his sister, Janet, (Stacey Branscombe), escort of Dr. Helen Gilbert, (Amy Shelton-White), his superior, Dr. Ethan Edwards, (Gary Sturm ) and assistant Louise Keaton (Juliana Dever) to find the site of some of the famous bones found in the area. When they camp, the team discovers a giant graveyard and strange bones that litter the area. When group members begin to disappear, they begin to roam the woods to safety. It was discovered that a Sasquatch was behind the killings and that the group was meeting to survive. <br /> <br /> The good news: it was not as bad as I thought. The movie really starts to pick up speed about half way when the creature attacks. This is a series of masterful scenes, as the whole group is attacked by the creature and the suspense is extremely high throughout the game. The wooded area is more properly exploited during these parts, which increases the tension and wonders when a single person wandering in the forest will be happy. The effective use of grunts and roars off the screen is also widespread in the film. They really add a lot to make this part so scary, as well as the other times that screaming scream is heard. It's quite efficient and works well. It's great that the last part of the movie is picking up speed, because it's going pretty well on a high action note. One scene in particular, in my opinion, should be flagged as a special stage during the first viewing. As a man crosses the forest from the creature, he spots the ongoing expedition. Raising his hands to cry for help, the second he announces his presence, he is attacked from nowhere and killed in a hurry. It took me by surprise and actually made me a jump at the first reading. <br /> <br /> The bad news: there were only two things to complain about here, and a usual complaint. The creature here is largely rendered by horrible computer graphics, which made it totally ridiculous and destroyed any credibility it could have benefited. The air of threat evoked by the opening of the film is almost launched through the window when the creature appears on the screen. It's so confusing that it's too bad a little more work has not been done. I have often complained about this, and it is something that really should be eliminated, because it does not seem so realistic and is absolutely wrong. Another big problem is the off-screen death here. Very often in the film, a person is seized, then withdrawn and then finds the body bleeding. It's quite aggravating when the victims are pretty and juicy afterwards. Otherwise, I do not really have a problem with this one, because anything that is usually criticized about it does not really bother me, but it is asked of others, beyond this kind of things. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: I liked this one a bit, but it's still not the best Sasquatch movie. It's not meant to be taken seriously, and if you see it that way, it's actually nice. Fans of these movies should take a look at this one, and those who love Sci-Fi creature features could also find beautiful things here. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence and Graphic Carcasses
