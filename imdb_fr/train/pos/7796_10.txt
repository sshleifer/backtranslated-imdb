It was the first film in which I saw Ashley Judd and Victor Nunez's first film I ever said, and I'm glad I did. Her calm tone, her relaxed pace, her realistic portrayal of a young woman who begins her life, her fine description of the difficulties she has to face to impose herself in life, the decisions she makes from things , the people she meets - there is nothing wrong with this movie. It's as close to movie magic as I've ever seen outside "Star Wars" movies, and given the nature of these movies, it means this movie deserves a high rating. Ashley Judds acting, Mr. Nunez's writing and his "great story simple and rewarding" make it a beautiful story of passage to adulthood and a wonderful film.
