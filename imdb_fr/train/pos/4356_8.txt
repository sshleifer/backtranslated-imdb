"The thing about my parents" is a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta and based on a piece of the screen of one of its stars, Paul Reiser, turned out to be a pleasant moment in the cinema. Although the film is predictable and we know what the outcome will be, it's a journey of discovery where Ben meets his father, perhaps for the first time in his life. Ben sees his father for what he really is, not a mythical figure he has in mind. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a vehicle for its star, Peter Falk, and he runs away with the film, as it was intended. Mr. Falk, one of the most endearing actors of cinema at this time and in recent years, is an actor of such stature, with whom one has to count. As Sam Kleinman, Ben's distant father, he is a man who is clearly misunderstood, not only by Ben, but also by the whole family and his wife, aged forty-seven. <br /> <br /> When Muriel, the matriarch of the Kleinman clan, runs away, everyone panics because this woman, who has been the strong figure of the family, is essential for everyone to stay together. Not knowing where she went, Sam arrives at confused Ben's, he suddenly feels abandoned by the woman with whom he married and has been faithful for all these years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the youngest son, takes his father on a trip in search of a house he wants to buy so he can bring his own family from Manhattan to the countryside. The trip provides Ben with an excuse to bond with his father in a way he did not know, as the old man had always projected a distant figure to his youngest son. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love each other and how much the old man has been misunderstood by his children. Sam's love for Muriel extends over the many years they knew each other; they seem inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is beautiful in the movie. He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes that his life is about to change for the worse. Mr. Falk shines like an old man and there is never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world collapses beneath him. <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of Paul Reiser, it must be admitted, Ben Kleinman, he is right. Ben and his father discover how much they have in common and their love for Muriel, the mother who sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is only seen at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as a fleeing mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with a lot of style. <br /> <br /> The film has a magnificent look thanks to Dan Gillham's cinematography and Steven Argila's excellent score. In the end, the film demonstrates the tremendous efforts of its director, Mr. DeFelitta, and Paul Reiser, who wrote it for the screen. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is clearly aimed at an older audience, it should please everyone.
