You would be forgiven for thinking that a Finnish filmmaker from Helsinki would not be good at making an American horror movie (especially a movie entirely in an American prison) - see this to prove you wrong! It was produced in the '80s after all and the film was made on a budget more suited to a TV ad of a modern DIY company (something I think everyone would really notice the industry today! ) being Mr. Harlin's first major production and - at least what would today be considered a dazzling cast -. I still think that most of the contribution of the Nordic countries to the film industry is more related to Stellan Stargaard's screen appearances (not to mention the well-done efforts of Mr. (s) Bergman, director) - at least for all viewers - but this film proves that there is a cinematographic talent outside of the United States and Hollywood to allow us to watch a film in suspense. Try to watch this movie even if you are not a breath of horror, IMO it's really worth it!
