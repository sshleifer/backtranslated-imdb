It is always satisfying when a detective finishes a case and the criminal is charged. In this case, the climax gives me even more pleasure. To see Suigail Mitchell's smothered smile clear when she realizes that her victim has left an "inhuman testimony" that leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Please, understand: while I admire Ruth Gordon the performance, her character really, * really * annoys me. She is selfish and demanding. She manages in turn by staging a small film embarrassing girl for a woman of his age. Worse, she has now become a judge, jury and executioner against the husband of her deceased niece. <br /> <br /> When Columbo gets too close, she tries to reassure him by manipulating him to make him lose his head. speech to an audience of high class ladies. He perfectly reverses the roles by delivering a very warm and human speech about the realities of police work. <br /> <br /> Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. Abby's last call to his good nature is dismissed because he has too much self-esteem for not doing his job well. Here's a situation you can not avoid with Mrs. Mitchell!
