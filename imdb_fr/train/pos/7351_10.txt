This is one of my favorite Govinda films of all time and the best film of 1994. David Dhawan does a great job in making this film, it makes it funny and adds a family drama. Govinda is excellent as Raja Babu and gives an excellent performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this film is a little less annoying, but annoying nevertheless in some scenes. Kader Khan is a maestro in acting and yet gives a superb performance. Aroona Irani is great as a mother and gives outstanding performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as Nandu the sidekick. This film has comedies, action scenes, family dramas and love stories.
