Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural gap that separates an indigenous population from the invading white man. Although filmed in a documentary style apparently with non-professionals, Eskimo is a talented production that contains a credible story that the public will want to see through. <br /> <br /> Native Eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than the whalers who darken its landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his companion, it is natural for other men to share their wives with their friend. It is also common for their wives to take the place of the missing spouse. All this seems natural in the arid and desolate context of the Arctic. The Eskimo, confident, are the prey of unscrupulous white whalers (with European accents) who do not consider these natives as their equals. Deceit, drunken orgies, rape and death occur after the Eskimos leave for work on the frozen seas. Finally, Eskimo (Mala) in the lead realizes that he has been fooled and takes his revenge. The audience would have been delighted in the movie theaters of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and discover the moral dilemma of whether to bring Mala to trial. RCMP officers play like police who know it's not an isolated case. Will the gendarmes have their man? Is it fair to compel Mala to adopt a code of conduct outside of his traditional society? Is there a way out that does not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the law of the white man should prevail? Is there no hope of innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but a film that will please the depth of the subject in a very different context. I suspect filming footage with animals was done before today's act of non-responsibility was hurt when making the film - so beware of raw nature footage. Highly recommended.
