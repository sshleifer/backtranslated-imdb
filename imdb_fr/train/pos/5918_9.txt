One of the most interesting films to be classified in the category "blaxploitation", "Coonskin" Bakshi is a rich text, rich in perspectives. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also appear in the film. Racist images can often be disturbing, but the film's message was so powerful that the NAACP gave its approval (but reluctantly). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in an examination of the pervasive atmosphere of racism that Bakshi is trying to deconstruct. Wonderful stuff.
