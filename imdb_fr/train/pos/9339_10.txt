For those of you who do not make this reference, clubberin had 4 fists hitting a body ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, on the exam. <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday Night. Some of my favorite wrestling moments took place on this stage. I remember watching Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Jack Cactus, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his day, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... I would be here while listing everybody. The point is that the WCW had an impressive list of before Hogan and produced an entertaining television. Dusty Rhodes' comments in his later years gave me a new reason to look when I started smoking potty in my teens ... I'd really like Vince to put him on a show or two, maybe at the next Great American Bash. ? They clubberin! This is DA PLUNDA! He was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
