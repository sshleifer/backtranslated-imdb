It's one of my favorites of all time. Good music and fun pieces. I laugh every time to Millie, the maid pretending to be a beginner, holding her delicate handkerchief while chatting and stupidly polishing furniture with it. I can never get past her French accent, that's never a problem, because they try to make her look like the boss's daughter. <br /> <br /> See teenager Mel Torme and Frank Sinatra's very young song is a real treat. My mother saw Frank Sinatra at the movies around the same time this movie was released. She said they could not erase the "bobby-soxers" between the movies (at the time, it was not necessary to leave between screenings). This film shows you how attractive and attractive young Frank is and how you can appreciate his first talent. And Victor Borge mixes a little of his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie with a sweet and simple story. Very pleasant.
