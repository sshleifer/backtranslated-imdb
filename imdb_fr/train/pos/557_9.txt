While driving from Skagway, Alaska, to Dawson City, Yukon, a few years ago, I was impressed by the scenery. I can not help but wish that this film, even if it is beautiful in colors and landscapes, was shot in the same place. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a beautiful place, but not the real place where the film takes place. When the story moves to Dawson City, that's when I feel that Anthony Mann, who used the outdoors so well, could have made the most of it if he was going to the place. . James Stewart is again a man who fights in himself, one side of himself does not want to get involved and help people who prevent him from making money, and the other side can not do anything simply not look away from the murdered people. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who makes fun of Corinne Calvet and the nice girl. Mann is excellent in filming, but the highlight of the film is its performance on the outside. He uses the outdoors as much as possible and is helped by the winter landscape, the predominant white, as with the greens in "The Naked Spur" and the browns in "The Man From Laramie". Like all Mann-Stewarts, it's a traditional western, with a difference in Stewart's character development that's more complex.
