I had the chance to see the movie "On Thin Ice" on TV in India .. I must say that the movie was really well done and that it made me cold in the back ... the story basic makes me think about what drives some addicts to move where others are still dependent ... <br /> <br /> However, I felt that Diane Keaton was at its best ... the scene where she has cravings, and starts to search her home for cocaine ... it was the best ... both boys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed what good actress she is ... The scenario is well done as well as the cinematography and the realization .. and the casting <br /> <br /> A must must watch the film ..... for everybody
