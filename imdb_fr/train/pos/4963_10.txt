Let Braik do a good show. Finally, he and Zorak live their own lives apart from Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I must say that I really like these two series. They are completely what started Adult Swim. Brak did a great job with an album released in 2000. It may not have been platinum, but his show was very popular among a lot of people adoring the Adult Swims shows. I must say that of all Adult Swim shows without intrigue, it must be the one with the most. That's why I love him so much, it's a classic in the history of adult swimming. I think it's such a spectacle, if you do not like it. Hey, there were tons of people who hated him and others who liked him
