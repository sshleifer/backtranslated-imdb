This is a classic 80s action movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Located in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including television networks. One of their most popular TV shows is "The Running Man", where convicted criminals are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions of people. It is organized as a game show, where the public votes for its favorite "stalkers", skilled killers who hunt down and kill the unlucky "candidates" of the series. Audience members also earn prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. And the host is interpreted by Richard Dawson, Family Feud, whose experience in gaming TV makes it quite fit to play this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This film is full of classic characters from the movie Arnold, as his famous movie is back "just before he enters the arena.And he mocks a stalker armed with a spear -flames with "How about a light?" I could go on and on, but I do not want to ruin the movie It's funny, either! <br /> <br /> Whether it's Wanted or not, this film is a superb parody of the craze for "reality TV." There are already many programs that show people endured pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even the trials are televised for their " Entertainment value. "Running Man shows what would happen if reality TV reached the bottom, and it's a scary picture - we can only hope the networks have the sense to not let it go that far. Overall, it's a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 10!
