It's a story that moves slowly. No action. No crazy suspense. No sudden surprises. If you can not stand to see a film about two people talking and walking, about a story that slowly develops to the end and romance, do not waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you like dialogue, magisterial narration, thought-provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life, this is your film. However, I recommend you watch this movie when you are the most alert, because the rhythm, the music and the overall tone of the film can put you in a spirited atmosphere. It's really fantastic. I really think so. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying by their mannerisms, but fortunately, the chemistry that exists between the two makes the game very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel from the beginning, making you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In their conversations, there are excellent comments on many topics that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and diverse for such young characters, but I may underestimate their intelligence. Nevertheless, it did not spoil the movie. <br /> <br /> The general story is very simple, which gives the film its charm and ultimate power. <br /> <br /> LOWER SUMMARY: The film is slow. The dialogue is fascinating. History is built slowly, systematically and substantively. The preparation of the final is satisfactory and, ultimately, rewarding.
