To a certain extent, I actually liked this movie better than the original VAMPIRES movie. I found this film pretty misogynistic. As a woman and a horror fan, I'm used to the fact that women at risk are a staple of the genre. But they slap Sheryl Lee a lot too much. In this movie, Natasha Wagner is a more complete character, and the main villain is a girl! Arly Jover (who played a sidekick vamp in BLADE) is very extraterrestrial and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... okay, yeah, not a great actor, but he's doing well. At least he does not start singing. Catch the cable if you can. It's on Encore Action this month.
