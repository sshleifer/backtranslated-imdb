Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I watched "C'eravamo tanto amati" together one summer evening: we liked it, but we did not like it, we loved "a special day". I think Eto Scola is quite underrated: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest films have been disappointing. Last night, my mother and I sat on our couch to enjoy this masterpiece. The writing, the production, the cinematography, the score and the conception of the production were sober and precise, but what I liked the most is the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They are both excellent actors and play the leading roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to a fanatic fascist, she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for huge families. Gabriele is simply an anti-fascist. They spend a special day together on this special day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome to visit Mussolini. I do not want to spoil the plot anymore: look for this movie!
