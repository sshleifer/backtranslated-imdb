It's one of the best movies I've seen in years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but she's great as Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is superb as Reverend Elton and Emma Thompson's sister Sophie is hysterical as Miss Bates. And look at the magnificent Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; What a gentleman! Anyone who said sex and violence in a movie to make it better has never seen Emma. I think that's what sets him apart from so many others: his elegance. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie that you can watch with the whole family, or if you're looking for a romance, look no further. Emma is this movie. With a beautiful setting, gorgeous costumes and an exceptional cast (did I mention the gorgeous Jeremy Northam?), Emma is a perfect ten!
