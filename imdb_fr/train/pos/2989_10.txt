First of all, I would just like to say how much I am a big fan of Bette Midler. Stella is a very good movie with a superb cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Alvarado Trini, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason). It's one of my favorite movies of all time. It is a mother who raises herself a child. She goes through a lot of things to raise her daughter. Jenny was wonderfully performed by Trini Alvarado. This film is very good and I suggest you take a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert gave 3 and a half stars! And it deserved 4! WONDERFUL! I give it 4 out of 4!
