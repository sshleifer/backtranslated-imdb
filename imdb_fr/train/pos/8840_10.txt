Watching before the devil counts as one of my best experiences of all time at the movies. I was intrigued by the mixed reactions to the film - and for me, extreme views indicate that the film touched something that was embraced or disavowed by the general public. It's one of those films that stayed with me, and I continue to think about it and think about it. <br /> <br /> The DVD would surely illuminate some of the themes and elements of the film's making? Among them: Sidney Lumet's return film, the offbeat technique used in the story, the superb combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well, the masterful direction, the relatively rare focus that Hollywood movies give to the characters male and their convicts struggle to become an open checkbook for their women, the under-represented but nevertheless resonant representation of Marisa Tomei's performance, and, of course, the superb Hoffman with this central monologue on the sum of her parts - for me the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Whew! Surely a masterful film. So, imagine my disappointment in the long-awaited DVD - but I can not find any comment, none behind the scenes, no interviews, no extras. <br /> <br /> Hi, distributors, solve the problem!
