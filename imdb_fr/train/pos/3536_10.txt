EA showed us that they can create a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's world. The graphics of the game are outstanding and the recording of the voice is very professional. I had this game in April 2007 (two years after its release) and I'm always impressed by the gameplay. Too bad EA does not make more 007 games. <br /> <br /> I give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, including the level "consulate". I would recommend this game to anyone from 13 years old. The only thing I did not like in the game was the level of Russian boats, it was too much pressure. Overall, I really like the game !!
