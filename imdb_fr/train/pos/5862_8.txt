There is not much in this story, there are only two men who use very different methods of managing memories of Vietnam. But what is lacking in premise is more than compensate in action and realism. It is a silent film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience. We even have a romance (not free - just another very real piece of this story). It is worth seeing.
