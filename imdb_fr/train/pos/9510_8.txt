In the winter of 1931, 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (Michael Sullivan Jr.) wondered what his father, gangster Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) was doing. The young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to "work" one evening and sees him exterminate rival gangsters. This leads - VERY diverted - to Paul Newman (John Rooney), a "Godfather", who hires independent hitman Jude Law (like Harlen Maguire) to find Hoechlin and Hanks, who are going to calm down in Chicago. Hanks thinks they will be safe with a family member, which is amazing considering the type of work the characters do. <br /> <br /> Aside from Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does a remarkable job. for director Sam Mendes; and, working with this cast makes him the youngest actor in 2002. But, the most striking element of "Road to Perdition" is the amazing cinematography of Conrad L. Hall, who has rightly won a "Academy Award" for his career. the late photographer. Mr. Hall's work is really superb. This helps to compensate for the general impression of a measured and unnatural shift both narratively and visually. The divergent end is suddenly exhilarating (the unrelated dog is an example of the above-mentioned stupefaction). <br /> <br /> ******** Road to Perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman and Jude Law
