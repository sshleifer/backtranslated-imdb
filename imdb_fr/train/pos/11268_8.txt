Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton), his former lover, and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh) travel to the hidden jungle of Tarzan Jungle in search of the ivory gold mine that is the "elephant graveyard" ", discovered for the first time in TARZAN, ... only we soon discover that the two men have hidden intentions ... to know Jane. Will Tarzan support this? Unlikely (in fact, Tarzan will not tolerate any disruption of the "Elephant Graveyard") and knowing this, Martin is trying to remove Tarzan from the photo. He will later find himself in a troubled world, he and his party (including Jane who leaves with them after she thinks Tarzan is dead) is captured by an aboriginal tribe who intends to feed the lions. Will Tarzan be able to reach him in time? <br /> <br /> This film is an adventure full of scenes featuring Tarzan and other wild animals and a climax that captivates the viewer's interest without letting go. Animal cruelty and native representation may upset some people today, but everyone must remember that this is fundamentally a fantastic adventure entertainment and should not be taken so seriously.
