I may be ahead of myself here, but although the film itself is a technical masterpiece for its time, I watched it piece by piece on the MCT last night, the question m is asked: why did they do that? putting their lives in danger, many of them died in the trekking, why would they undertake such a dangerous journey, just to find food for their animals (!) once arrived at the "land of milk and honey" Why do not they just stay there? Do you want to put your life and that of your entire community at risk simply to find food for a herd of cattle? As dangerous as it may be, doing so solely for this purpose shows the intrinsic simplicity of this type of person. Risk of death for a cow ?? Better than me!
