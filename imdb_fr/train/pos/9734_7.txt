Here's another romantic comedy ... but unlike all other movies of this kind, it's by far the best I've seen in a long time ... <br /> <br /> I'll admit that at first, I wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox and a bit because of Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> First of all, if you watched a decent number of movies, you'll know that Sidney and Alison would be together at the film and, in one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the film, you will not know how ... <br /> <br /> D okay, now this movie is just made for Simon Pegg. I do not see any other actor in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure it would be a very weak film if it was not for Pegg's superb performance. <br /> <br /> There are a number of gags and jokes in this movie that made me laugh, courtesy of Simon Pegg's character, Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is good.For example, Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this movie do not think of her as more than an average act it's Jeff Bridges, there is Gillian Anderson and of course Megan Fox who plays the damn star bitch Sophie Maes ... excellent role for her ... <br /> <br /> Overall, although I do not generally agree with her rating on IMDb, this time I'm totally 'deal with them ... <br /> <br /> Go see this movie, it is really light and positive, and I highly recommend it ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually. ..
