I went into this film thinking it would be a shitty film of poor quality. I came out surprised and very amused. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had incredible comic timing. The jokes of this movie were amazingly original and really fun with one or two flat jokes in between. The plot was enough to bind everything, a woman (Eva) dies on the day of her marriage and comes back to haunt the woman who goes out with her future husband, this seems exaggerated but it works rather well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - All in all, it's a good movie watch, if it's not on DVD.
