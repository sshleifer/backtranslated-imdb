The 60's is an excellent movie (I saw it completely in one night) on the hippy movement of the late 60's. Even if the title suggests, the first five years of the 60's are not really important in this movie . <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is Michael, a political activist who goes on tour in the United States against the Vietnam War. There he meets his girlfriend, Sarah. Michael's brother, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). He returns from the war and turns into a "Tom Cruise born on July 4th". His father is a guy of the pro-vietnamese war kind (what a surprise !!). Michael's sister, Kate, is pregnant with a rock & roll artist and runs away from home to go to San Francisco during the summer of love. The end is very poor (the father becomes liberal and everyone is happy), but I let that escape from my vote (the rest of the film is very good!). <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are rather good and the soundtrack of the film is absolutely brilliant. All the major events of the sixties are in the film, like the murders of JFK and Martin Luther King as well as the big hippie protests, the summer of love and Woodstock! Look closely for the corrugated "Woodstock Speaker" sauce (what we have in mind is a breakfast in bed for 400,000 people!) As a rescuer at the Woodstock Festival! <br /> <br /> In the end, the 60s are a beautiful film on a beautiful decade! 10/10
