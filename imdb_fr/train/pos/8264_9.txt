Based on a real mining disaster, this first German talkie (with English subtitles) remains one of the most effective docu-dramas ever filmed. "Kameradschaft", which brings together many non-professional actors, gives a frightening glimpse of the friendship that unites the miners, regardless of their side of the Franco-German border. A fatal accident brings out the best of everyone, canceling orders from superiors. A minor companion in need will receive the help of his classmates, even at the risk of suffering a significant loss, including life. <br /> <br /> This film is a reminder of heroism that showed itself after 9/11. Putting aside all formal rules and regulations, these men and women in uniform knew only one cause: to save lives and to find their fellow combatants. - More than 70 years later, "Kameradschaft" always has a strong and timeless message: a friend in need is a friend in fact.
