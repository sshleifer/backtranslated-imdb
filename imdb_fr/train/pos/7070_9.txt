One of the most appealing elements of a Gilliam film is that the well-crafted visuals, the disturbing backgrounds, and the frustrated human characters are proof of the creator's involvement. Instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is a paid rental director for a star or two), you can feel Terry Gilliam's presence through this experience. "12 Monkeys" is a testament to Gilliam's vision and style, as opposed to making quirky films for themselves. "12 Monkeys" is a variation on similar themes in Gilliam's repertoire: oppressive / recessive societies, loneliness of the protagonist, frustration associated with disbelief, and parallel domains. In this film, Gilliam does an excellent job of blurring the lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the public to believe rather than know. Gilliam's tendency to neglect filling some gaps leads to criticism of artists' claims. The difference between Gilliam and the artists is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and that all his images make sense. Cole's two almost identical bathing scenes at the beginning are intended to make comparisons that leave the audience disturbed. His bald head is a mark of uniformity in the future world devastated by the disease, but makes it recognizable in the world of 1996. The title itself is a mark of Gilliam's creativity, as it requires that the majority of the narrative be specified so that its meaning is perfectly understood. Overall, Gilliam's commitment to creating creative films that are interesting to watch but also require public reflection and interpretation. The film has an immense replay value, because there are subtle details and allusions that can be missed during the first viewing. definitely one of my favorites.
