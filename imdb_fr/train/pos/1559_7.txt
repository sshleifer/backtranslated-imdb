This episode of Smallville is probably the best episode to air since the meeting. This for several reasons. For example, he brings the series back to some of his roots. He greets Lionel after an alleged long absence with the office of the place Luthorcorp in Metropolis. This piece has not been in smallville for a very long time, and seeing it reminds us of many memories of its past. Not to mention that the conversations between Lionels and Lex are always admirable. <br /> <br /> Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (aka Cyborg) are another nice comeback. . Steven Deknight not only brings together the old leaguers of justice, but associates them with the Smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost feels like a feature film. <br /> <br /> Green Arrow trains the league, tries to blow 33.1, Bart is captured, Clark saves him, and the facility is evicted from the realm to com. Everything is good and graceful, with a good mix of stealth, action, rhythm and suspense. Oh, and Cyborg has some interesting new improvements, true to the character of the Justice League :). <br /> <br /> The music is probably what makes this episode work so well. If you remember, the first episode directed by Steven Deknight was Agless of season 4. It was a poor episode, but something did not seem out of place. maybe it was the music, or the acting, or the fact that Clark said at the end "we did not find you, you found us", somehow made people lose faith in it formula. But fortunately, Steve Deknight redeemed himself in this episode of Justice. <br /> <br /> I had some questions about Justice that had prevented him from being at least ten. the expolsion ridge installation. I mean it would have been so much cool if Green Arrow and Cyborg had taken off on Oliver's bike (let's remember the episode of the arrow). Clark and Impulse would obviously have had to run and aquaman would have had to swim by another path. <br /> <br /> Second, another nerdy moment, not so bad as the first, but when Green Arrow said "Save the world". It made me cringe. Overall, judging by actor performances, music, staging and production values, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, and it's still one of the best episodes of the story of Smallville, and perhaps the second best episode of season 6. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 ...
