Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel. I did not read the book, so I did not really know much about the plot, yet I predicted almost all the plot. There were also a lot of scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or staging. The movie is however very entertaining for some reason and I loved it. Of course, there were all the scenes I did not like but the majority was well played and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as a heroine in Emma. The film also features Toni Collette (who was good, but was much better) Ewan Mecgreger (who was also better but who is still very good here) Alan Cumming (who never really impressed me and who is at pretty much the same here) and Jeremy Northam (Who's performance is mostly wood at first but actually quite subtle, even if it was not what she needed) There have been much better adaptations of books from Jane Austen but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching.
