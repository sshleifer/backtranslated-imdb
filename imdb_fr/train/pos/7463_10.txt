It seems that this film polarizes us. Love it or hate it. I loved. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment (s) said, you just have to "feel" this one. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting by Monet - an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint with small touches so close that the painting looks like a mess, but from afar you can tell what's the subject. Cruise mentions that the painting has a "vanilla sky". I think this is a clue to the viewer. This film is like this impressionist painting. It's an impressionist film! And it's no coincidence that the title of the film refers to this painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical linear plot. It requires more thought. There is symbolism and scenes that jump and no, you will not always know what's going on. But in the end, everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You will have to focus on this movie, but I think people make the mistake of focusing too well. After that, it's when you have to think about it. If you try to understand what's going on during the process, you will be overwhelmed. Let him come ... go ahead ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> <br /> I found all the remarkable performances and I found them incredibly unique, extremely creative and mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> But I will not criticize the intelligence of those who have not benefited. It appeals to a certain taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, stimulating, stimulating spiritual movies, then see them. If you prefer something a little lighter, ignore it. <br /> <br /> But if you like what I described, you will surely appreciate it.
