Superb production Techicolor recounting the unusual story of the novel between a woman of strong religion and a trappist monk who left his monastery without respecting his wishes. The film begins in a convent in Europe, where a former student prays - a solitary beauty in black named Domini (Marlene Dietrich). The superior mother advises her to go to the desert, "to meet again" and to lose her sorrow for her father who has recently passed away. In the wagon of the train that goes to the Sahara, she is sitting in front of a very troubled man (Charles Boyer), our former monk. She is soon in a hotel near an oasis of palm trees where she sees our mysterious troubled man while he is perplexed about what to do with a very attractive dancer. Domini befriends him, but knows nothing of his past - a romance will follow soon. <br /> <br /> This film is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in a way, almost surreal and even a little campy) - I found it very entertaining and entertaining. The photography is really interesting - it is full of close-ups on the face and beautiful color shots of caravans of horses crossing the desert, silhouettes on a sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives a well done performance, although restricted, and a beautiful look. Charles Boyer - not usually one of my favorites - is actually pretty good in this area, I think the party suits him somehow and he also looks pretty young and handsome. Basil Rathbone is fine here except for very few things to do. Another excellent orchestral score by Max Steiner helps to keep the drama rolling - a very enjoyable film.
