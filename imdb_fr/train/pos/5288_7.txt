This funny cartoon from Bugs Bunny sees the return of Marvin the Martian, still unknown, and his companion, K-9, the green dog. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of trying to destroy the Earth, Marvin's mission is to land, capture an earthly creature and bring it back to Mars. Of course, the creature he chose is Bugs Bunny. At first, Bugs thought that Marvin and K-9 were cheats, but he realizes that this can not be true when Marvin radically enlarges Bug's rabbit hole with a ray gun. Bugs is trying to get out of the situation in several ways, including persuading Marvin that K-9 is planning a mutiny. Finally, he is captured using an Acme straitjacket ejecting a bazooka. Surprisingly, for an Acme product, it works as advertised and Bug's is forced to use its intelligence to release it by K-9, the tables are soon returned and the two discontented Martians are tied up and Bugs tries to return their saucer to Earth . <br /> <br /> I really appreciated that although the end is a little weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice has changed slightly here and he gets emotional when he's angry, but that did not make me less like him or the cartoon.
