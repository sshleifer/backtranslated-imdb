There are 21 comments when I add mine to this list and there is hardly a criticism. This is because this film is a great entertainment and it contains a bit of everything. <br /> <br /> It may be a little scary for young children, but my 15 year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from action, humor and even the beautiful score. <br /> <br /> I only buy DVDs when I know they will be watched regularly and now that this version is finally available in the UK, I will definitely add it to my collection.
