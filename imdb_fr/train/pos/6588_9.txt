After watching several episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. Here's an old sci-fi eve, ingeniously wrapped in a truly original concept - and yet, they can only do it best. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good! Male actors are reasonably competent in their professions. Most of the characters are well drawn, with special congratulations for the hero and his kicking more than friendly. And most episode plots seem acceptable. So what could go wrong? What about female characters and aesthetically perfect actresses who are chosen to represent them? <br /> <br /> The producers insist that the female characters of this almost good series are presented in such a way as to give the impression that the final product is a misplaced cheerleader. Why, I ask, why? <br /> <br /> Episodes collapse each time the star or recurring character appears on the screen. These actresses are all incredibly incredible in their roles, and you do not need to see them to know they can not play their roles. A blind person could say. Just listen to them. They engage in dialogue with the drama and effect of a 16-year-old at the high school graduation party. Who would believe that these women are scientists, senators, business leaders and doctors? <br /> <br /> In summary, if producers have the choice of a Stockard Channing or a Morgan Fairchild, guess who they will choose - every time? And of course, the series suffers. Pity!
