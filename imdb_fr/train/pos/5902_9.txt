As a westerner observing the point of view of another culture and the tradition of marriage, I found Just Married hypnotic and delightful. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially nowadays. Yet this is the case in this film in Hindi. Told with humor and a new perspective, we learn about Abhay and Ritika who have only met once and are now living their traditional five-day honeymoon. As has been said, it is hard to believe in this age of cell phone abundance that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage always takes place. We see the discomfort of this young couple when they meet on their first night and how they try to forge a bond, even if they do not know each other. We see different perspectives on marriage and engagement as presented by other couples also on vacation, from a married couple of forty to others still unsure of making a marital commitment. There are songs, spiritual dialogues, poignant moments, a mix and a comparison of new ways and traditions Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the truth of the story, but it's still a pleasure to watch. Admittedly, the plot is a little mundane and the bus incident a little stretched and artificial; However, the film in general was worth watching.
