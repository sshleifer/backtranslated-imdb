Actor Paxton made his debut as a director with this slippery, dark thriller about a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself) who forces his two sons to participate in wild ax murders, claiming that the victims are not at all human beings, but "demons". and that they were chosen by God to destroy these "demons". All this is said in flashback by one of the sons, now grown up (Matthew McConaughey), to the skeptical agent of the FBI (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> Difficult to automatically forget this film; Better than most of the characteristics of serial killers, it's a sinuous and disturbing tale that is told with ease with a minimum of cinematic gadgets. Paxton, commendable, shows almost no blood before the end. Well done by all, especially the two children actors (Jeremy Sumpter of the recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary of "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance"). The only reason I deducted points is because I can understand that some people can find all this hard to bear. Anyway, it's an atypical thriller with a decent storyline. <br /> <br /> 8/10
