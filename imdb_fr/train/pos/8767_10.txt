I saw this film by chance, simply because I was going through a phase where I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman and I wanted to see all his recent films and thank God for doing it! This film has stayed with me since and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey to a foreign country where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene were just trying to get together before going to college. but their journey ended in a much more complicated story. The struggle they face when they are arrested in Thailand and have become prisoners is very moving and intense. The acting is amazing, the extraordinary images, the soundtrack is fantastic and is therefore perfect for the film and the message transmitted. In fact, I do not even find the right words to describe how this film makes me feel every time I look at it. I know that some people have not appreciated as much as me by the score given to the film, but I swear that this one, it must be seen! I promise that it will stay with you!
