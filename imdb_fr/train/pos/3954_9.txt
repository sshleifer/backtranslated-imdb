Whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie I have ever seen, I invariably answer "Black Noon" and, to this day, no one has ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> I watched it alone 30 years ago at the age of 13 when my parents were out for the evening. As far as I know, it has been shown only once in the UK and is unfortunately not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If someone can find a copy, thank you to report it to me. <br /> <br /> If I watched it again now, it would probably be a big disappointment, but it always marked me as a particularly disturbing little movie!
