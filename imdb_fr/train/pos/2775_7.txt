Moviegoers will understand why I would call this one "the man with the gray flannel robe". Most Bible-based movies are basically schlock. What could generate smiles and laughter is how Peck tries to raise awareness of various psychological and social issues with the spear that carries the Neanderthals around him. As a great novel, it falls flat like unleavened bread. But there is something captivating in this film. Among all the great images of the Hollywood Bible, it most strikingly expresses the ambivalent attitude of the average American with regard to belief in the biblical God. Billy Sunday's thesis resonates with the antithesis of H.L. Mencken throughout the script. Who makes the most of the Heavenly Chorus-Backed synthesis depends on your point of view. Apart from that, D & B can boast of Peck's good performances (especially in the final repentance scene) and Jayne Meadows as his first bitter wife Michol, a living and moody atmosphere (good idea to place the most of the action at dawn or night), and the rousing revival of the twenty-third psalm at the end.
