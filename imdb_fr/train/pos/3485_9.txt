This Wrestlemania just did not do that to me. Although some things, such as the royal battle and celebrity involvement, were a throwback to the good old days, so to speak, it seemed more like a loudspeaker "In Your House" than anything else. Above average ... it's worth it for several matches such as the team title match, although the title change does not mean anything because it was reversed the following night.
