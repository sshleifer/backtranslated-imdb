An absorbing (though repetitive and rather didactical) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way to move forward or higher, where attempts to feel better by violating and lowering the one below you seems to be the only option. But even here, in this desolate country of lost dreams and no future, it does not work, and reaching out to something or someone with whom to comfort, a simple act of charity, gives some reward, even if it only makes the present bearable by reviving memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Although there is little violence on the screen, it is a hard and brutal film about the smallness of oppression (politically and personally) that does not facilitate entertainment. . Clearly based on a play with a small cast, a broader and wider relationship with the wider social and political environment would probably have helped the film reach a wider audience.
