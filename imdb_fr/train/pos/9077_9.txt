I really enjoyed the pilot, it was as amazing as I hoped, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, although at first I thought I could not stand his character. He and Megyn Price had little chemistry, but I hope the season will continue, they will be more comfortable with each other. It must have been odd for Megyn to star in her last show ["Grounded For Life"] and be a co-star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson seem really new in the whole Sitcom scene, but I think they will eventually improve. The character of David Spade, to my surprise, was not at the center of this pilot project. The way he broadcasts his lines is so different from the ones I've ever seen on television, but I think that's just his style. It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think that couples, even singles, will be able to tell all the doubts and fights and they are not sure of your decisions, the quality of this show. All situations in which the characters find themselves feel like in real life, not like in most series. <br /> <br /> I hope CBS gives them a chance. This show has the potential to be one of the best series, if given the chance and time.
