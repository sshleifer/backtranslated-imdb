This is one of the best episodes of the second season of MOH, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He kills them all, they are often the victims (solution Screwfly, Pro-life, Valerie in the stairs, I do not remember the episode of Argento in season 1, etc., of course). I think he likes to watch women burned, tortured, mutilated and I do not know. Never the slightest "right to die" is one of the best, with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense (especially with the photos of the cellular stage, wonderful). The acting game is like the whole series, I could be worse like "Pro-life" or "We cry for ice cream". Also, I think the plot could be made for a movie and not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is horrible: kill and put an end to women, mutilate animals, etc. The first season was better than the second with episodes like "Cigarrette burns" (Best of all), "Homecoming" (Funniest), "Imprint" (really shocking).
