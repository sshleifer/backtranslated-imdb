The real story (which occurred in Kansas in 1959) of a murder (Perry and Dick, two former convicts who broke into an isolated house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks directed Capote's troubling and troubling book on why these children committed this crime (Are they natural killers?). The crime scenes are very brutal and haunt because of the lack of meaning and reasons for what we have seen. Superb black and white cinematography by Conrand Hall, Quincy Jones' excellent country-road score, amazing performances in two main roles of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and first time in a movie, a sad commentary on capital punishment on the eve of their death. Jones, Hall, and Brooks (as director and screenwriter for an adapted screenplay) are nominated for the Oscars. Seizing, superbly directed and scary, one of the best movies of this decade
