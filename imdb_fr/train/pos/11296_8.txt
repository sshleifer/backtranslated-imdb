I was personally interested in this film. When I was 17 years old and had just finished high school, I got a job with 20th Century Fox as a member of the Workers 'and Workers' Union. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier), I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes, etc. for one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning, a bus was waiting for us and about 20 people headed south towards San Diego. A little further, we stopped at a military base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once settled, we headed north, a few miles from Camp Pendleton, the large marine base. There, on the beach, we started to build what was to be a base of Japanese Pacific Island. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, gun trenches, sandbagged trenches, and living quarters. All this was at a very high salary, sometimes "golden time", which was triple our normal hourly wage. Our food was also prime = beef ribs for lunch, etc. - which was amazing because it was war and it was very difficult to get good meat at home. <br /> <br /> Once the work was done, I waited impatiently for the upcoming film, which was about eight or ten months later. Then, I waited impatiently for the two hours of the film before my work was finally displayed on the screen. Then there were only three to four minutes left (perhaps less) of the film's heroes who were bombarding the base and shattering it. A little disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I enjoyed the film and I have not seen it since. I learned later that this film was underwritten by the government and that Fox was paid at cost, which may explain our extravagant compensation and lifestyle. Bob Weverka
