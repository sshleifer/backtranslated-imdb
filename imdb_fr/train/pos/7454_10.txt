** Warning, this message may contain Spoiler lyrics ** <br /> <br /> I only received a Gamecube in September 2005, and the first two games I bought were James Bond games , the decent Agent Under Fire Agent and the dull Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game I had planned was All or Nothing, because my friend told me it was better than the two games I already had. I must say he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought this for an HMV player, and when I got home, I slammed it into my Cube and played it for hours. It was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting scenario. The graphics were some of the best I've seen (but now that the XBOX 360 is out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to man). The scenario was smart. A crazy man (Willem Dafoe, named Nikolai Diavolo) and a beautiful henchman (Heidi Klum, named Katya Nadanova) are trying to destroy the world with tiny nanobots, who at the beginning of the game, you, James Bond, must destroy a train . The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya's breasts. You must then thwart their plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The advantage of this game is that it contains actors who express the characters, such as Cleese who expresses questions Q. There are 27 levels, some short and sometimes long and difficult. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Replay Value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a total General 90%
