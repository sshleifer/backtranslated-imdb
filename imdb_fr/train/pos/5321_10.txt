This movie really surprised me. I had doubts about this at first, but the movie got better and better every minute. <br /> <br /> It may not be for the public in search of action but for those who like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, a man, a lover and a husband. If you're not a fan of vulgar language or sexual content, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit difficult to follow sometimes, but in the end, I think everything has been improved. The end was unexpected since you were almost clogged to think that it would end otherwise. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, I think it was good. It will not be for an Oscar long, but it has at least caught my attention. Gil Bellows' portrait of a prison man is not always perfect, but he is very amusing. Shaun Parkes' portrait of the Bellows Clinic prison mate is excellent and extremely powerful. On the other hand, I think I will put the portrait of Markie by Esai Morales. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice and watch this movie, whether you like it or you do not like it!
