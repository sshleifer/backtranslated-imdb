Some films manage to survive almost solely by their originality - "Wonderland" is certainly one of those films. The script manages to throw everything into a state close to fever, but without making it incoherent. The speed of this thriller is not to choose to hide a weak scenario, but rather to accurately reflect the reality of the drug. <br /> <br /> As a director, James Cox is a very special way of working his actors. Most characters are always on the lookout and often because they have a rather ugly personality. Val Kilmer described John Holmes as a hustler, able to manipulate and control. No offense to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems only capable of controlling extremely weak minds. Nevertheless, it is an amazing performance. Comparing this to Kilmer's more "Hollywood" roles, such as in "The Saint", he seems to prove that he is far more comfortable in independent films. <br /> <br /> Actors are the main force that holds all together. There are various small performances that stand out - especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow all have little time on the screen next to their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. Outside of Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give a strange energy to their roles. <br /> <br /> I had deferred at first to watch "Wonderland" because I imagined it was a movie about a porn actor, in the strict sense of the word sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it literally has nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this film is a mystery of murder and, as such, it is excellent. <br /> <br /> NOTE: 7.5 out of 10
