I still wonder why I watched this movie. Of course, before watching this movie, I knew practically nothing about the Beatles. I did not even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, albums that some claim to be the best, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono and John was murdered. <br /> <br /> VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV. Yet, for one reason or another, I decided to look at it without waiting too long. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it! The dialogue was written and very well managed on the occasion of a slight disorder of the accent. This is very important because John and Paul talk about the whole movie, even if they went outside to explore more possibilities and allow you to keep watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn perform well overall. <br /> <br /> The end was also very smart. I appreciated the fact that the film is very enthusiastic about SNL's performance, then slaps you and understands that it would be better to give up and finish in style. My favorite moment is probably the touching scene on the roof. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. It's a great way to sort out what might have happened if, six years after the breakup, Paul had just arrived at John's door. Which is probably the main reason why I saw this film, settling my curiosity about who the Beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.
