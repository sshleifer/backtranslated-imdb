Indian filmmakers have a hard time: they have to compete with films like "Laggan", where eleven castrated men defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots. "Devdas", an unlucky and festooned stranger, returns to drink in oblivion, with characters running in endless corridors forgetting any feeling or feeling - they live alas in misery adorned with tapestries and red pageantry. But to make a good film, you have to walk a tightrope to appease deputies who are fascinated by the jealousies fascinated by the Split skirts and the Dishum-Dishum fights, preferably involving a main actor "Bollywood" who is marginally handsome. You can therefore contact a director who wants to tell a story to a leonine village chief who, in his words, "defends his village", is considered a violent film or too masculine for a male audience. There are very few actors capable of conveying anger and pathos like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar leaves you in her yard to look at the beret and make fun of the politician when his faithful admirers burst out laughing at every word of satire, while his daughter bathes her grandson.This is a scene as authentic as you can live In a rural area. India. Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting, an endangered race in Hindi Films. The violence portrayed is a complex part of the story with Song & Dances cast for the naive without whom the movies will not sell, a sad but real state of affairs. The faster it changes better for "Bollywood". Everything is said and done it's a good movie.
