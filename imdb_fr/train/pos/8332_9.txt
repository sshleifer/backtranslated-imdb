The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says, "Does the piston pull short?" (involving low sexual energy on the part of her fiancee) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very friendly and very intelligent too. Would her innocent, indignant expressions want her to be yours? The hero manages the transformation of the garage mechanic into a physicist. Einstein had a romantic side in his psyche? The puzzle in front of the press and the public went well. It is terribly underrated and deserves praise and attempts at renewal. He loses a voice for having included the very unlikely extravagant theory bought by the US government. I do not see why this is not in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. Great movie, he wears the seal of presidential approval!
