Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) With Hedy Lamarr (Hedy Kiesler) <br /> <br /> The first glimpse into the world of a 19-year-old man, Hedy Lamarr, occurs at the beginning of this treasure of the 1930s screen in an angelic wedding dress. It must have been the beginning of a legendary career. It was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman of all time who honored the big screen. <br /> <br /> It's the wedding night of Eva (Lamarr) and her older husband seems to be losing interest in his romantic advances. She retired to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring as she realizes her marital error. The husband seems more interested in cleanliness and order than in love. Gustav Machaty uses beautiful camera angles and a flawless shot to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. Without words spoken at the beginning of the film, she is able to grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. It was this combination that prepared the audience of the 1930s for what they were about to see when the movie unfolded. "Ecstasy" was considered shocking for its time ... Some thought it was scandalous. <br /> <br /> She goes home to her father's estate and demands a divorce. The next day, she wakes up with a complete feeling of freedom and happiness. She just has to go out and feel the freedom of the countryside and the fresh air. Eva takes a horse ride and crosses a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to appear naked in a big movie. His antics in the woods and his adventure in the lake were legendary outrageous. But the public could not stay away. As in many movies today, the controversy has made it a must-see movie. <br /> <br /> Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps him find his horse, who has fled with his clothes. After an uncomfortable meeting, they end up falling in love with each other. Their first romantic date was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant eroticism. However, Machaty does a magnificent job in these romantic moments. Machaty creates a pleasant moment, when Eva literally sinks into her new lover, using a superb early camera trick. <br /> <br /> You can not exaggerate how brave this performance was on Lamarr. Many could have presumed it was professional suicide. Instead, he gained worldwide fame and drew attention to Louis B Mayer, who signed it under a contract with MGM. There are some really erotic moments in this movie, even by the torrid standards of today. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the thirties. Again, Machaty was very intelligent with his images, leaving a lot to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is extremely well done. <br /> <br /> The meeting of Eva's former husband and his current lover may be inevitable. However, the consequences of this meeting are not. The film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and all this is a great story and a great debut on the big stage of cinematographic celebrity for Hedy Lamarr. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it, now tame the movie and invite you to search for it in its restored form on DVD. It's worth it, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is convincing too and the management is ahead of its time. "Ecstasy" is a memorable treasure in the beginning. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candler Movie Reviews !!!
