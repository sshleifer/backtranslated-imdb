Loosely conceived as a satire of D.W. Griffith's intolerance, The Three Ages, was Buster Keaton's first attempt for a comic feature. The only similarities with intolerance are the opening "book scene" and the fact that similar stories across the ages have come together in a complete movie. Keaton's reasoning for appropriating this style was that, if he did not succeed as a feature film, he could be reduced to three reels. Fortunately, The Three Ages is brilliantly successful as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I've ever seen in any of Keaton's movies. There is nothing unique or daring in the stories. These are simple boy-girl-boy-girl-loser, girl-boy intrigues, but the satires of the day are revolting and set the standard for Mel Brooks' future works and all such films. However, I do not think anyone has ever dominated this comedy. No one can play the adorable gaffe like Keaton and the stunts of this movie are among his best. In addition, the appearance of Wallace Beery as Keaton's rival adds to the appeal of this film. Anyone who thinks comedy from the 1920s can not be appreciated by the modern audience needs to see this movie.
