Turning a book into a movie by following the story page by page is NEVER a good idea. When people read the book, they automatically start creating their own "mental movie" about the characters' identities, the places they are in, the changing situations. The opus of each is different, and that's why, when the film "REAL" finally released, you will always have a shimmering segment of the public who goes to the cinema, disappointed that it simply does not measure. up. <br /> <br /> All that a screenwriter and director can hope to achieve is the same as their vision of the film and hopes that it will come as close as possible to what their audience expects to see. <br /> <br /> There is no better example for this situation than movies based on Stephen King's novels. When filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories, the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE) - or what fans consider a horrible mess (Kubrick's version of SHINING: the mini-series for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS). <br /> <br /> Although King's perfect adaptation is not close to King's, PET SEMATARY has so many moments of deep and shallow discomfort that seemed to have bled on the screen directly from the book, that you can almost forgive its shortcomings. For this, we thank Mary Lambert, director of music video (she also directed SIESTA, not really a horror movie, but another must-see thing that you should put on your list), working from a Scenario of "The Man" himself, and probably one of his best. <br /> <br /> Since most of you know the story, I will not go to sleep with too much detail. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has transferred his family to the ideal home of the country. Well, almost perfect, apart from two unpleasant little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway ahead, and the big pet cemetery in the woods at the back. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son ... well, even if you have not read the book, do the math. It's a king's story, after all, so there's no mystery. <br /> <br /> It's not so much the destination that counts here, but panic stops along the way. Some scenes that are so familiar in the book are presented in a shivering and screaming life: the horrible memory of Rachel Creed (Denise Crosby of STAR TREK) of her terminally ill, terminally ill sister; Louis' encounters with the deadly jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist), before and after his death; the trip to "the other" cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And this third act ... if it does not leave you with some nightmares, you may need to check your pulse. <br /> <br /> Good performances here, especially the late Fred Gwynne as a well-intentioned neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best scenario in the story that sums it all up: "Sometimes death is better . " <br /> <br /> The only problem with this version is the cast of Louis' son, Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be almost impossible to get the kind of performance a child of this age needed to seal the deal, Lambert and his team did their best. Unfortunately, at the time, Hughes was too damn good to "sell" his intended role as a demonic zombie possessed. This makes you come out of the film whenever it presents itself, even if the scenes where it is presented are always masterfully staged (especially the scene of the death of Gwynne.) <br /> <br /> To Apart from that, everything else is about as good as it gets. Carrie still holds the title of King's best adaptation for me; but SEMATARY is one of the top five. <br /> <br /> Anyway, will all that is adapted to the screen and based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story? No BLOODY likely ... for now.
