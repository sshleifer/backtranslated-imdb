"A thief in the night" is a film that has generally been ignored by moviegoers because of its low budget (which was obvious) and its subject - the removal of the true Christian church and the fate of those left behind for account. Nevertheless, it is a captivating story that holds the viewer and makes him definitely revise his relationship with Jesus Christ. It touched everyone - even showing a pastor who preached the Word, but did not believe it, knowing exactly why he had been left behind. This film and its sequel "Distant Thunder" are must-see movies. Even with the new series "Left Behind", which tells the same story with a much higher budget, the impact is still the same: "A thief in the night" has paved the way for this genre and we will always remember him.
