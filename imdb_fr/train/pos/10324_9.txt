Incredibly fun, this vintage piece from the 30's is a version of the classic cliffhanger series, as well as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", produced with a small budget and a lot of charm by the director Michael Anderson. The playful opening scenes amount of gothic art nuveau, beating Batman by two decades. Featuring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a cast-iron hero and the magnificent Pamela Hensley as local latina, Mona, associating our hero with a gold-hunt in the non-existent Latin American country of Hidalgo. The best replica, our hero to Mona, his fist clenched against his chin as you expect him to be tender with her and hug her: "Mona, you're a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler's Black Hat with ham and cheese, Captain Seas is an absolute delight. Expect a bit of "Raiders ..", a hint of "Batman", a bit of "The Lost World", a bit of "Lost Horizons" and a lot of campiness and you'll get it right. Beware of the famous cult Michael Berryman in a small part of the funeral business and enjoy the patriotic music of John Philip Sousa. First candidate for the release on DVD, he is certainly late. A treat not to be missed for the whole family. 9/10
