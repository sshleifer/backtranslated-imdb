We observed this in my women's health course to show how women were treated inferior to men in many societies and I really loved this film. I plan to try to get a copy myself to watch it. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone. I am a fan of different cultures and this movie was exactly what I needed. It's a movie for the whole family despite its rating. It's a movie that I will show to my children. The teacher in our class wanted the film to be primarily an education about women, but this film was more than that. It's one of those movies that will forever be etched in my memory and that will be my favorite.
