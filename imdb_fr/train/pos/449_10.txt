For all those who judged others at the first meeting, here is the perfect tutorial on the depth of character. The grumpy old lady has a sweet and thoughtful heart and needs new friends. The unstable, uncertain lady, "ditsy" who makes inappropriate and uncomfortable comments - sees deep in your soul and has a pure love for all. The cold, primitive, decent and neglected woman has a passion that can overflow at any moment - provided she chooses the right setting. The perfect beauty - rich, sweet, partying, pursued by crowds - wants peace, calm and love without possessiveness. <br /> <br /> Taking the time to look beyond the surface, you'll find treasures in everyday life, among the least expected sources. All you need is patience and a touch of enchantment.
