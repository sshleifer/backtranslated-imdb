I found The FBI Story extremely entertaining and optimistic for watching my New Year's holiday. His drama and episodes filled with action were thrilling. The Hardesty character was well drawn and admirable. Overall, the photography, the script and the direction were perfectly credible. Rather than viewing the film as disgusting propaganda, as some would have thought, I appreciated it as a well-represented representation of the need for ingenious spirit and courageous body in the fight against crime. Again, the representation of a family holding together even under the constraint of the husband's engagement in his (probably) important work, I did not find it to be an ideal representation, but ideal and exemplary.
