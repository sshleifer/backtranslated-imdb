I just saw the movie and the most frightening thing was that the people who were talking during the movie sounded like the actors. The film had its moments, but also lagged behind and was rather sick. It was a farce, but when we see the pathetic life of the people in the film, we say to ourselves: "People like that are around us" All attempts to gain public sympathy are disappointed as do the actors thing stupid after another. On the positive side, there are some good (and funny) insults. I think I would wait for the video, but it was funny. WARNING- Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie !! (not nice to see!)
