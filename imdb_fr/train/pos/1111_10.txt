It's not "so bad that it's good", it's just good! For those who do not understand why, you have the intelligence of a four year old (in response to some comment ...). Anyway, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of self, a parody of you and a parody of me. This is the most awesome text in the history of cinema. I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. He embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines everything you or me call standard. I write scripts and this film alone has opened up a kind of comedy I have never seen before. It can only be taken in portions ... it's a kind of exploitation ... Now, I'm just trying to take the minimum of ten lines. My comment ended a moment ago. Let's hope it works when I submit it now.
