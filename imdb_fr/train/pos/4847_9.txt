This movie is one of those nostalgic things with me and I NEVER REALLY wait for someone else to "understand", but I'm glad to recommend it and appreciate it. My late father, HATED Arthur Askey, but this film really liked him and his constant enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted Olmes" was transmitted to me as a child. Years later, I look at him from time to time, enjoying the familiarity. I always wonder if it will not be exactly the same but I'm never disappointed. There is a lot to appreciate. The sequence on the train is truly inspired when Askey and Murdoch annoy the arrogant client. Then the whole section of the resort is amazing with so many things to follow. Yes, it is dated and full of British wartime with accents and intrigue (based on Arnold Ridley's original piece of Daddy's glory!), But full of performances by exceptional characters, including Kathleen Harrison in the role of the crazy. The atmosphere is really as sinister as an Arthur Askey vehicle could be. It's available in the UK as cheap DVD tokens, so treat yourself. It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any afternoon a light piece of entertainment. Thank you .... <br /> <br /> OLD MOVIES CAN BE GOOD MOVIES!
