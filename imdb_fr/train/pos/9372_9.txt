Red Rock West is one of those rare films to let you guess all the time following the events. Nicolas Cage is confused with a contract killer as he enters a small town in search of work. Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better. Look for a brief appearance of Dwight Yoakam, country country singer. It's a serious drama most of the time but there are clearer moments. What matters is that you take advantage of this low-budget but high-quality effort!
