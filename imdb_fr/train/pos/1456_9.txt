Documentaries of this type are often very critical. This film seems to take all opinions and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. It's sad the conditions under which these poor people have to work, this film does a great job in showing the ugly side of the sweat lodges. The Mardi Gras film: Made in China was a good way to show the world how a little pearl for a celebration can affect the lives of many people in another country. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this movie for an English class where we spent our time talking about sweat lodges and how some people try to eliminate them and this film helped advance the subject . It was an excellent and very informative film and I would recommend to everyone to see it, it opens your eyes a little.
