Casting perfect for a drama of a few people. Simon is dead but resurrects from the outside. What he saw was presented in the form of white dots orchestrated on a magnificent score by avant-garde German composer Werner Henze. Simon is haunted by his death, comforted by the support of the dead he has seen on the other side. His girlfriend tries to keep him alive, but failing that, decides to follow him after his death. Very moving and moving, deeply psychological, but a little slow and somewhere even boring.
