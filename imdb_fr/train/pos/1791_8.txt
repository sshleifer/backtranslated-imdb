It's not a deep film. Most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and "proven", but the film was well played and brought out some interesting points about what we might regret (our "mistakes" as the movie calls them) when we watch In our lifes. I had not read the book, so I did not know much more than the story of a dying girl who has long cherished memorable memories that she never really shared with anyone. Fortunately, they had a first-rate cast .... Meryl <br /> <br /> Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays the young Lila, then Meryl shows up at the end of the film as an old Lila ... in addition to an amazing resemblance (duh!), the young actress did a great job (maybe not quite up to the caliber of her mother, but who is it?) and thought that Buddy's character was a little too dramatic. <br /> <br /> It's more a girls' movie than for guys, but good to do with your mom, or your daughter, and maybe start a dialogue. How difficult it is to really know a parent as a "person"!
