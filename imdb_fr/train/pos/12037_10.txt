The Woman In Black was a British TV movie that premiered on the BBC on December 14, 1989 and again in 1992. I think it did a tour on American TV on A & E. was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90's, but is out of print. An American company later published it on DVD, but this version was also sold. According to the author's website, the rights of the film are now owned by someone else and it will no longer be published, and there are unofficial bootlegs sold on ebay. <br /> <br /> I first heard about this movie recently on a bulletin board and I had to check it. I found a copy on eBay for around $ 28. It's certainly a counterfeit of a Far East seller, even though the DVD says "Made in Canada", ha ha. But it's a good copy, and you can not really blame the pirate labels for having published rare, exhausted and lost items in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. It is a period piece set in the 1920s, with all the very authentic and picturesque British decorations of that time. The woman in black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the film is very discreet, but effective and scary. There is no gore, violence or even more indulgence in special effects, but The Woman In Black is always able to create absolutely chilling moments. It's a scary classic style ghost movie. The film itself seems to have been made in the 1930s, with the exception of color. Without all the flash of all modern horror films, I fear that this film is still a lost jewel. For me, he is one of my favorites of all time.
