This film is an hour of entertainment and presents some really fun moments. I loved the character of Matt and also Tiny. They seemed to be the most attractive and fun characters, and certainly the most interesting ones. Matt is very good (not his good cousin), and the policewoman and the blond biker woman provide treats for the eyes. I must say that I saw striking similarities between Matt and another Australian actor, Eric Bana. My favorite part was the brothel scene, I loved it. Overall, I liked the movie and it will get a score of 8. The penalty however, I was disappointed. It was a side foot loop, rather than the proper lace. <br /> <br /> I'm kidding of course. :)
