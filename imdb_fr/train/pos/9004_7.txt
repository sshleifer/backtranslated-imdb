I had doubts about another love story in which people with disabilities find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh are exemplary, almost staggering, and prevent it from being a mere tearful. The representation of a victim of ALS by Carter is strong, sometimes even exaggerated (his dialogue sometimes dissolves in indistinguishable mumblings). But the overall effect is laudable and rewarding. Branagh can be the perfect complement to his performance. <br /> <br />
