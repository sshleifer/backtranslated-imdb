Taking a break from his escape race in the early '80s, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker's The Color Purple, about the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Watching Goldberg play Celie, it's amazing that this is the same woman who has played in movies like "Sister Act". This is the kind of movie that could easily be part of the Black and Women's curriculum. There is one scene that is perhaps the most beautiful editing job ever seen on screen (you'll know it when you see it). I can not believe that it did not win a single Oscar; it may be Spielberg's second best film behind "Schindler's List" (perhaps even on par with her). Also featuring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
