I bought this game on eBay after hearing that it was a game similar to Elite. The gameplay is indeed very similar and very addictive. After playing it a few times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for all my children so that they could participate in the party too ... I played this game from start to finish and the story gives me the impression if you are in a movie, it's great. If you do not feel comfortable because of the restrictive nature of the one-player game scenario, simply set up a Freelancer server on your own PC (easy to use and included software) and play your heart's content. There is still a large number of Freelancer servers on the Internet. The multiplayer mode is not a problem, it is not so threatening, because you do not often want to designate other players unless you want it. So go get a copy of this game, learn it by playing the single player campaign, then set up an online presence and have fun. The depth of this game is staggering, with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple on eBay. Get one with the full written manual if you can (blue box, not Xplosiv red box), it's much better!
