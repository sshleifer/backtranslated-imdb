Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and features James Stewart, Kim Novak and Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. In this film, James Stewart and Kim Novak were their second couple on screen (after the Alfred Hitchcock classic, Vertigo, released earlier that year). This film was Stewart's latest film as a romantic director, as he was considered too old at age 50 to play this kind of role. The film is about a witch interpreted by Kim Novak, attracted by a mortal played by James Stewart. She casts a spell on him and he falls madly in love with her. I enjoyed the film and its casting. This film at the time was a moderate success that was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Comedy Film. GimmeClassics
