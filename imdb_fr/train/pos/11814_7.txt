Usually, when we use the word "escape", we hear it negatively; The big-screen version of Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" proves that "escape" can be good. It's really an entertaining film. As an eponymous character, dressed in yellow and intrepid, Beatty creates a detective that we can all relate to: ready for action, but not without its weaknesses. <br /> <br /> From there, the rest of the characters are almost a world unto themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as one might think, the husband of any crime fighter; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is perhaps the most confusing person imaginable; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the mean way: ruthless but cool. Other characters include Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), who has speech problems, 88, musical comedy (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates are also on the bill. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait a minute. I did not even explain the plot! The plot implies that Tracy tries - and fails so far - to find a way to catch Big Boy. At the same time, very strange events took place in the city, whose answers may or may not be closer than everyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bottom line in this film is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty was struggling to play his age, he used it well here. "Dick Tracy" is a cool movie.
