Greetings again from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 vignettes apparently unrelated to love in the City of Light. A very unusual format that requires some segments to adjust as a viewer. We're so used to character development on a 2-hour film, it's a bit disarming that it happens in an 8-minute segment. <br /> <br /> The idea is 18 stories of love / relationship in 18 different neighborhoods of this beautiful city. Of course, some get up better than others and some opt for comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some well-known directors are involved, including: Coen Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuar√≥n, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. There are also many familiar faces: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best segments involves a mime, then another mime and the nervous but happy young son of both mimes. A red trench coat, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasies, the death of a child and many other subjects are also playing a key role. Do not miss Alexander Payne (director of "Sideways") as Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The diversity of segments makes it interesting to watch, but as a film, it can not be described as big. It's still very observable and a good change of pace for movie regulars.
