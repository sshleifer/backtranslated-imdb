I watched this film twice on DVD and I did not miss to impress with its impartial and unique attitude. It's more like a portrayal of reality than most other Hollywood dishes, especially on a topic that's hotly debated. Even if it stays true to the Southern point of view, it does not fail to question it and in the end, the only possible phrase is that war is lost, no matter what, and that cruelty is a common denominator. <br /> <What really makes this film remarkable is the refusal to over-dramatize. Nowadays, good movies (in short) are few and far between, traditional prices being nice (if you do not have high expectations), but terribly business-oriented. I think this film is really a good film (without being a masterpiece), because it sticks to itself and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it, instead of wanting to bomb it effect and emotion to erase his intelligence. This film is cool, attentive and generally light in its judgment, which is GOOD. <br /> <br /> The story has its flaws, especially the character of Jewel appears dubious, but again, the situation so chaotic that for a young widow, it might have been logical to return to a normal life, even taking each one his neighbor. Nevertheless, she is not weak, in fact I think she is one of the strongest characters, she always controls relationships, men just marking. And I suppose very grateful that she is not a crying widow. I think that in the 19th century, the death of a loved one was something much more normal than today. You can die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries, so that the prospect of someone's death, while surely causing grief, does not traumatize people as it does now. People did not seem to be building sanctuaries around their missing people as they do now, and I like that attitude. <br /> <br /> I recommend to smart people to watch this movie if they want something different from the usual Hollywood fare. Do not look if you want a non-stop action or a hilarious emotion.
