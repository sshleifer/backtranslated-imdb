Greetings again from the darkness. Overview of the spirit and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange it is for most of us to see someone who MUST work ... no matter what the conditions, otherwise their reason for life stops. Seeing Goldsworthy's sculptures come to life and see her reaction to each of them is extremely voyeuristic. This artist creates because he owes it - not for money or for glory. This is his life force. When one sees one's failures, the energy seems to be expelling from one's body like an exploded balloon. It is not the fear of starting again, it is that he draws his energy from his work. Watching him create just to take control of nature and remember that his work is somewhat painful, but nevertheless breathtaking. He discusses flow and time in minimal dialogue, and there seems to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one. When he says that he needs the land, but she does not need it ... I beg you to differ. The only complaint I would make is that the score seems to slow down further, at a relaxing pace at best.
