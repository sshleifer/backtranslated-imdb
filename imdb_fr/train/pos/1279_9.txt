This film is a funny and totally sarcastic vision of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed by the brightly colored photography and reworked settings, especially when you think this is Zukovic's first large-scale attempt. <br /> <br /> A warning, do not take the message of the film as seriously. It's not for mass consumption (and it's not a compliment). The message is a vision of the neophyte society somewhat stylized after the university. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the basic plot of a fictional zine editor who verbally whipped the 90's mobocracy.
