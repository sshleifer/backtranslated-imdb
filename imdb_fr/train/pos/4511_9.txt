I just took the DVD version of this movie while I was on vacation in Norway, where it was released with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and interpreted with power. The main character, who represents "Frits", has a surprisingly open face that reflects with painful precision the tragic events unfolding around him. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we see that the father that Frits loves so much has mental health problems, which is evoked when the brutal director denies having assaulted the boy and suggests that it was his own Father. <br /> <br /> The culminating scene where Frits refuses to show the slightest respect to the director; Just stand up and repeat "Liar" as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates, a scene you will not forget. <br /> <br /> The only weak point of the film is the "Flower Power" cliche teacher who uses every "friendly teacher" trick in the book. Other than that, I'm sure it's a movie you'll really enjoy.
