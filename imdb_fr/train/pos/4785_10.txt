[No Spoilers] <br /> <br /> Being a David Lynch film, one might think that he portrays his enigmatic mind as most of his feature films do. But it's a very simple story, as the title says. Do not expect to be caught in the usual lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing, for example, Lost Highway. It's a simple movie but it's really a good movie. It's both innovative and entertaining. It's innovative because it's not Lynch. But maybe it's Lynch. He likes to twist the spirits and so prepares a film that could look very traditional and far from Lynch himself. As a very avant-garde director, he could make a film like this to tease his usual audience, because he knows what they expect but he does not give them. It would be clever. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the film is slow. I would almost say that the speed of the lawn mower ... Do not expect an orgy of action, but the movie is really fun for those who follow the thread of the film. Look closely at these little details that Lynch has throughout the film to entertain us. Look for the great cinematography that brings this film to life. And listen to Badalamenti's score and the main theme that really animates the landscapes of Iowa and Wisconsin presented frequently. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth performs one of his best performances in this film, making him one of the most likeable men ever seen at the movies. He has nothing to say to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness is reflected right through him and his acting has earned him an Oscar nomination. Do I need to say that his fragile health in this movie was not played? He was diagnosed with cancer and killed himself right after the end of the movie. This knowledge only puts more emphasis on the film because it is more of a tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All of the above is a very beautiful film that suits all kinds of people who love a movie as it is supposed to be done. We could ask homilies that are not so obvious and a little naive, but it does not ruin the general image, it is a memorable film. 9/10.
