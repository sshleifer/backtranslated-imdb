**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Just <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> `Go ahead , make my day! <br /> <br /> The fourth image of the series is directed by Eastwood himself (who would have directed almost all Magnum Force) and he brings back the violent society of the first two films. However, the film still lacks impact and credibility. This film was released in the early 80s, at the time of Regan and young Republicans. The assumption that a raped woman taking revenge for her rapist does not appeal to this period. This plot would have been better for Enforcer, who would have made a good movie. Suddenly Impact needed a plot like Wall Street, but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> NOTE: 3 STARS
