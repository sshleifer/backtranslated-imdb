A featherweight plot and questionable characterizations make no difference when a movie is as much fun to watch as this one. A lively action and spectacular waterfalls - for their day - give this film a real finishing touch. And there is some comedy of heartbreaking chemistry between the two leaders. Quinn is also a good villain, even if his role is completely obscured. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by Maureen O'Hara's tough general role, it's as sexist as any Hollywood movie of that era. You might be able to forgive that because of the time that it was made, but it's still difficult to pass. Despite all the heroism and horribly off-screen adult situations, it's still a little more than a good time as a teenager.
