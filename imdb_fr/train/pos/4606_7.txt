Police Story is arguably one of the best works of the master of the action itself. Compared to other action movies, Police Story gives Schwarzenegger and Stallone beginner looks. The waterfall scenes are well Animated and action scenes are superb. If New Line Cinema has any meaning, they would release it in theaters.
