This is not a bad movie. Somehow, I was made to incite the Iranians to win the match even though I do not know anything about football and I am not a fan. The end in the bus was exhilarating. <br /> <br /> The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and explains how they are not allowed to visit men's sports arenas because their swear words are unacceptable to women. . Despite this law, some women are trying to sneak in, but many of them are caught and detained. It is truly surprising that any society can still have such outdated notions of gender. In an interview, Panahi explained that his films were documents about history and his injustices, and that someday in the future we could look at them and see how Iran lived. We hope the future will come sooner rather than later.
