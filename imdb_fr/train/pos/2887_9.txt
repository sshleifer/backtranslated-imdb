Cinderella is one of Disney's greatest movies, one of those movies that I think you appreciate more than you get older. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairy tale. I consider that the film was the biggest of his films at the time of its release. The characters have become more dimensional than previous movies, creating more depth to further appreciate the characters. Cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters ever created by Disney. With her kindness and dry humor, she is extremely friendly; However, it is the inspiration it provides that makes it memorable. Like many people, she is an endless dreamer and she keeps her dreams going, without ever letting go. Even in the most unfavorable situations, her dreams will continue and she will not let anyone take it away from her. His example should inspire everyone and encourage you never to let go of your dreams.
