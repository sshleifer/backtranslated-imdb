A very good movie and a true story. Dan Jansen the best skater of all time. A touching and beautiful film that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens fighting cancer and Dan Jansen's love for her sister. An important promise made by Jansen to win a gold medal to prove that his sister Jane was right to believe that her talent in speed skating was justified. This picture is well worth the time. I wish they would make more films of this quality. Thank you for a great movie with great actors and an excellent story. It's a very touching story about family support, the faith of their children, and a special dream for their youngest son and sister.
