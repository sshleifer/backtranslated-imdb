I'm a big fan of Woody Allen and when I saw it was at the movies, I could not help it. I wanted to see how Allen was going to follow up on his wonderful film Match Point, as it's another one of his films shot in GB (which is unique among Allen's works) with what seems to be his new muse, Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and humor is the most enjoyable aspect of Scoop. The plot revolves around the character of Johanson (a journalism student) who receives information about a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she has to decide if the truth is worth discovering. Oh, and all of this is done with the help of a delusional magician turned into Allen's detective. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I really enjoyed Johanson's performance but I'm a bit biased, I could watch three hours filming with Johanson in a frame and stay enchanted. She plays a bitchy girlfriend, scathing and disordered, which is a kind of variation in the sense of the character struck by the stereotypical neurosis of Allen. She adds appropriate body language for a comic effect. It goes without saying that almost everyone who sees it will find the character of Johanson incredibly cute, which is an advantage. <br /> <br /> Allen is Allen ... He always plays the same character, a bit like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that happens in this movie makes me wonder if I will see again the little hypochondriac neurotic. He is not in distribution of his next picture and has spent more time exclusively behind the camera ... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also delighted as a suspect of a suave and millionaire murder. I can not say that Jackman does something special to make the role his, but he's still good for his character. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, I can not help but think it's new ... In fact it stinks of the curse of the jade scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more like detectives than anything. However, I must congratulate Allen for his end, as he is a little smarter than your typical Hollywood version of this movie. Instead of everything in black and white, the objects are painted in shades of gray. To be completely innocent has nothing to do with it, any more than unequivocal guilt. Although the plot seems old, Woody still has the chic for a liner. I found his references to his latest film interesting ... Come for humor, laugh and rejoice. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you appreciate Allen's work, look at him. If it's not looking at something else ...
