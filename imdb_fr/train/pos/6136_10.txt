I love bedbugs and brooms so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time I have the wonderful pleasure to see him. I would also like to reiterate the simple fact that I love him so much. Too, some have said it. I have 27 copies on video and I love them all too. I also love someone else who loves him. I love you. My favorite scene is the dance scene at Portobello Road. I learned dance moves and practice it every day. I have some audio recordings of myself singing the song. if someone can play the drums or the guitar, I think to form a group of wrists bed and brooms. I hope to call it "the buttons". love me (liz)
