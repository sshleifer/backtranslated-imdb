Gosha's last great film of the 1960s. Gosha, a staunch, film-conscious stylist, teamed up with Shintaro Katsu (of Zatoichi's fame) to produce this stinging accusation of blind nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" (Heavenly Judgment) is the word Loyalist vis-Ã -vis the Emperor howl by killing enemies or "traitors" to the cause. Katsu interprets his character as an allegiance to a manipulative politician, in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who questions the politician is called a "traitor" and becomes a target of assassination. <br /> <br /> One of the best films photographed to date, many shots are incredible compositions of shapes, colors and lights. The fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal. Blood becomes part of the color palette that Gosha uses for his images. Beautiful and disturbing. Although the personal story is simple to follow, the historical context is complicated and although a basic history lesson for that time in Japan is very useful, you can struggle through the film without it. The few disadvantages of the film are the musical track, the length and the occasional masturbations of Katsu. He has an intoxicated scene for a movie, but in reality a very accurate depiction of a drunk man. <br /> <br /> Downbeat but one of the great chambara movies.
