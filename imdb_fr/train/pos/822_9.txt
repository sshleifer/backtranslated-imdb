The last film in the saga of Lucas is a sumptuous and spectacular production. He is often considered as the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it's a step up from episode IV (and just a step below episodes III and V). In fact, I think it's the third best film in the six-part saga. As far as I'm concerned, it's still a very entertaining film. It's not a film with a beginning, a climax and an end; The mechanism of the film has only one goal in mind: to close the world of Lucas. There is an air of finality on the whole, which makes the film a little too sentimental, but enriching emotionally. Besides, it's very entertaining. New characters are introduced and elders face new and unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) an excellent comic relief. Leia and Solo form a wonderful romantic duet and Luke is always a great character to identify with. Again, it is the inner conflict of Luke (and Vader) that gives the saga its backbone. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still very apparent and the film's themes of loyalty, hope and redemption resonate strongly. I'm glad Lucas finally abandoned the idea of ​​doing episodes VII, VIII and IX, because this movie is an excellent ending for a long, fascinating and captivating saga. A movie not perfect, but fun in the best morning style.
