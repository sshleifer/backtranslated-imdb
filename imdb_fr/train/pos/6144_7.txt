I saw this when I was a child in The Wonderful World of Disney, so I did not remember much. As I watched her recently, I sat down, thinking, "This is the weirdest thing I've seen." <br /> <br /> The "traveling" scenes look like an overdose of LSD. The animated characters are mostly oddly colored / expressed versions of characters from Jungle Book and Robin Hood. I noticed some things that were not so unique to Disney: stabbed children and prostitutes (during the Portobello Road song). <br /> <br /> It was a lot of fun, even though the music numbers were long and I could not see the kids getting bored with them. In addition, the subject was a little dark, as it had been defined during the Second World War.
