Not at the same level as Ring (or Ring 2), but it's still a good Japanese horror movie. I wish North American horror producers to take a page off the Japanese horror model and put more "phantasmagoria" and less cheap shocks into their films. Many good examples in this one, scenes where a whitened face is observed behind a young actress, pictures on a wall suddenly appear smiling, just for a second, and more. It's worth checking if you like the genre.
