From time to time, in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are made and one becomes completely stunned by its brilliance. It's not less than a diamond !! It's a film full of wonder, icy anticipation and dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favorite horror movies of all time! And of course, it probably contains the scariest sequence in the history of horror! Whenever I see the film and know how inevitably it will happen, I try to remember when I will be afraid, but it will never fail; I can not do it and I find myself as scared as the first time I saw it !! Now, it must be said, scare a jaded horror fan like that is pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtleties, they are proud of the art of playing, they need no special effect to convey an atmosphere, they trust the power of the powerful story and the flesh of hen (in this case) of suggestion and anticipation. Each element is impeccable, plays, acting, history with a threatening atmosphere. Pauline Moran could surely make the devil groan, that's for sure! In conclusion, if for some reason you do not like this madness, honestly, you do not know what horror is and, frankly, you do not deserve to know it. Thank you!
