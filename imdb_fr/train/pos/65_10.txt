This film is not limited to a shoot in a school, it has never even been seen. But that only reinforces the power of this film. It's about people and how they treat tragedy. I know that this has been shown to the students who survived the Columbine shootout and that many of them felt shut up. The acting is superb. The three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles ... I highly recommend this film to anyone. It's one of those movies that makes you talk about it after you've seen it. This provokes a discussion not only about shootings in schools, but also about human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It's a tearful but it's worth it and I'll watch it again and again
