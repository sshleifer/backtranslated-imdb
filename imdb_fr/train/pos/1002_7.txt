Just two comments ... SEVEN years apart? Little evidence of the film's endless pulling power! As mentioned, GANTRY ROW status 13 in the low budget film sector is a mitigating factor in its limited attractiveness. That said, the thing is not without merit - whether as entertainment or as a frightening outlet in itself. <br /> <br /> It is true that the plot is at the base, it's a reworking of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - only without much horror. More a case of intrigue! Gibney could have made a more interesting impression if she had played in Halifax, investigating two murders apparently unrelated to the "house" as the main suspect. The scenario is better than the average and the overall output is high. This simply fails to interest the viewer, especially at key moments. <br /> <br /> After getting the DVD for $ 3.95 last week in my regular video store, I can not blame you for the expense. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film. Do not expect fireworks!
