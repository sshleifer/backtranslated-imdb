I first watched Walking Tall movies around the age of 8 and thought that Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson had both done a great job, which they must have anyway because since I watch movies, I tried to learn as much about the real sheriff. Buford Pusser as I can. The three parts of the movie gave me chills and Buford Pusser was a real hero. I just wish he was alive today and there are more people like him. I would like to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and for being so brave. I am really sorry that his family has experienced such horror and pain. My heart is with them. So, from a 30-year-old fan of Sheriff Pusser and 3-episode films from Walking Tall and the actors who portrayed him, do not be negative about these movies and actors, they were trying just to let us know what a wonderful man the real Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had. And to all the kids who may not have heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch Walking Tall movies and learn more about him.
