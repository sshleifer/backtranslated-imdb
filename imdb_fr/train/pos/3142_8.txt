In what is really a very diverse cast, this show has the wind in its sails on FOX. This is the kind of sitcom that grows on you. If you only watch 1 show, you may not like it very much, but once you watch two or three, you'll get addicted. . As usual today, the themes are very mature. The humor is usually very mature too. The most fun parts are often those where mature themes collide with the innocent. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith) is a seasoned actor who produces a very good mood with no issue in this show. Debra Jo Rupp also plays well in this set. Danny Masterson, the oldest actor of "children" is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better in the previous series as a natural redhead (who had the idea to turn her into a blonde?). She often shows very good talent and comic timing. She is beautiful without makeup. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best entries on FOX in the sitcom department and is the most successful live action world since Married with Children
