This film is rather corny, but I credit him with having at least tried to describe his principles. There are great moments in the film and the dialogue has some too. <br /> <br /> The sequence of aerial assaults is perhaps the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> I guess I really like the idea of ​​how long a veteran will go for another veteran. Of course, it's not quite well done, but the premise is not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom
