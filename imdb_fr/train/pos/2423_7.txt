Once in life means that once a thug, always a thug, and no one enters or leaves "Life" for free. Neighborhood thugs in New York sell drugs and get scammed because they can not survive in the legitimate world, perhaps because they have a criminal record, a drug addiction or just because they are lazy. This simple story with some twists on mostly despicable characters manages to draw the audience's sympathy to its main actors because of their loyalty and compassion towards each other. The film is written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also stars as 20/20 Mike (all the hooligans have a nickname), and is based on his play, "Riff Raff". It's like being in a room from start to finish, especially at the longest stage where the top three players will compete to decide who to trust. Often, the dialogue is very fast, much faster than on stage, and I think it's the biggest flaw of the movie. Street poems, a sort of iambic pentameter rap, mixed like flashbacks throughout the film, are violent and evocative of the world revealed by the film. Poetry makes it difficult to reject these men, those thugs who murder, deceive and betray themselves, as unworthy of our attention or inferior to our contempt. What is disturbing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but also how they suffer for the same reasons as all of us. One is too stupid, the other is a drug addict and the last one suffers from conscience, while the public wonders, or even laughs, at the irony of the executioners who ask him to hang on the pole to tell jokes at beautiful middle of his disappearance.
