Jörg Buttgereit sometimes goes a little too far with his films and themes, even for my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are done in an artistic way, with an often deeper meaning for his themes. This film is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> It is also very difficult to label this film. It's not really a film with a story, in the sense of having a beginning, a middle and an end. He also has no main character but focuses on 7 different suicides and murders, on 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All stories are told with a lot of class, although some are of course more "interesting" and realistic than others. They are not necessarily connected, but they still tell a story together. The film does not feel at all disjointed. All the different stories have a different feel and Buttgereit tells the story without hardly using words (also typical of his style) but instead leaves the images and obvious emotions evident from the characters telling the whole story. It is helpful to make this movie an effective movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Again, the production values ​​are not too high and it could scare some people. However, it is useful for this film to provide the appropriate tone and atmosphere for the film as a whole and for its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. <br /> <br /> A Buttgereit movie that I "liked" to watch. <br /> 7/10
