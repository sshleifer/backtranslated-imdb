There are few really hilarious movies about science fiction, but this one will cut your head. The takeoff of Jack Nicholson, the Martian in the lead, is a division. The plot has a very smart twist that has been seen to be appreciated. This is a film with heart and excellent actor by all. Make some popcorn and have a good evening.
