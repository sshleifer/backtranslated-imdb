The horse is indeed a beautiful animal. The picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace would never have been so majestic in an animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation is simply beautiful. The beautiful animation is the backbone of the beauty that the horses embolden through the film. This is even more true when the stallion crosses a varied terrain, jumps through cliffs and braves the waters. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very impressive. The wonderful instrumental music makes you appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> "They say that the story of the west was written from the saddle of a horse." eh? The story of a good horse has certainly been written from the saddle of the west. <br /> <br /> In total, this film is clearly among the best. It's one of the best animated movies I've watched. Would be a very good choice on a lonely night. An easy 9/10.
