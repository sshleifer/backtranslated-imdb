ATTENTION, SPOILER! <br /> <br /> Many people have told me that "The Planet of the Apes" was Tim Burton's worst film, apart from that much weaker than the original movie. So I decided not to see him. Another friend of mine, who had not yet seen the film, advised me to watch it despite this, because "a Tim-Burton film is still a Tim-Burton film". I decided to do it and I found out he was right. <br /> <br /> It is clear that a remake of a film as famous as "Planet of the Apes" is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. Nevertheless, Tim Burton has managed to make his film represent his game as strange as Beetlejuice or Batman. If you already like Burton movies, it's hard not to like one of his films, even if it has some flaws: enigmatic monkey shouts, disguised monkeys and lead actor who could have easily replaced by someone another one. <br /> <br /> What the film gives us in the first place is an answer to the following question: what is the result when Tim Burton receives the order to create a remake? First, Burton would not be Burton if he did not refuse to call it a remake from the start; it's a "re-imagining". Burton knows, however, that almost everyone in his movie has seen the very first version of the film starring Charlton Heston (as a human being), and that he knows that a remake does not exist without his model. and that the two movies will not stop. to be compared. So, all he does is play with this comparison every moment of his movie, e. g. referring to quotes. Regarding the plot, Burton does a remarkable job in answering the original's initial questions, then in despairing the audience by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with ?? AND HERE IS THE SPOILER ?? Leo returning to earth and finding himself in a world that seems to have been ruled by monkeys forever. <br /> <br /> This is the brilliant response to the expectations of citizens because of the amazing and shocking end of the first 'Planet of the Apes'. An end, even more unexpected, more surprising and: completely confusing, because ?? and here I disagree with various home pages and platforms `Planet of the Apes ?? It does not mean anything. There can be no sense in this, or just a problem so complex that it becomes ineffective. Tim Burton plays his cruel games, he does it with a smile and he does it well. Burton fans will certainly be thrilled, others may feel betrayed and complain of a certain mannerism. Well, and I do not think the producers will ever ask Burton to remake a remake ??
