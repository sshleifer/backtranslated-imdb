Reading the various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known movie critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I love this movie, even if I only have a video version dubbed in Japanese. <br /> <br /> Apparently, many critics seem to consider that the principle of history has already been used, especially in the very big "It's a wonderful life". For me, a good premise is a good premise, no matter how many times it has been used, and I would be happy to see more movies using this particular premise - the unhappy man who is lucky enough to have a new story perspective of his own life. through a little "divine magic". <br /> <br /> I guess people and detractors of a more intellectual addiction are not part of the story, but I do not go to the movies to criticize them, notebook in hand - I go to the movies to throw me in and let them lead me wherever they go. <br /> <br /> If you're sentimental like me, you'll be well rewarded by seeing this picture. The performances are excellent, and the film was very well interpreted. Excellent choice of music too. Michael Caine is superb as the friendly bartender. Jim Belushi is doing a great job as a type of "average Joe" who wonders if his life has not gone right. Linda Hamilton, always excellent, is again at the rendezvous as a loving woman. Jon Lovitz entertains as usual, and even has surprisingly moving moments in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a wonderful life", but who has the duty to make it be? "Mr. Destiny" is a nice film, well done, funny and moving. I've seen my video dubbed in Japanese many times and I'm sure I'll see it again and again. If it makes me somehow a "lowbrow", so be it! I'm just glad I did not read any reviews of "Mr. Destiny" until I saw it. <br /> <br /> I guess I should have the courage of my convictions and give the film nine or ten stars, but I could not help but doubt myself after reading all the critical comments!
