I had mixed feelings for "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started to watch him, but I ended up enjoying it. I would not call it vulgar ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is both vulgar and pitilessly stupid); I would say that it is shocking and offensive. I can understand why a lot of viewers, especially women, would not like it or hate it. It is the quintessence of misogyny (or at least, it seems), and the way in which two anti-heroes treat every woman they meet seems untold. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it is in a way a delicious little jewel. I am fascinated by Blier's ability to cope. The film is very entertaining and very enjoyable: it is well written, the acting is first class and the music is sweet and melancholy. In fact, when I think about it, two friends have done good to the women they met: they prepared a woman on the train (the lovely docile blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her film career with one of the The most impressive debut of Rene Cl√©ment's "Forbidden Games" (1952) at the age of 6 for the meeting with her husband, whom she had not seen for two months, they found a man who finally succeeded to bring out a frosty and satisfied Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou), they enlightened and educated the young and very volunteer Isabelle Huppert (during one of her first appearances on the screen) Their meeting with Jeanne Moreau student this comedy at the tragic level In short, I'm not sure I want to meet Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere's Pierrot in real life and invite them to dinner, but I had a lot of fun watching the movie and almost two hours flew - it was not annoying bitter.
