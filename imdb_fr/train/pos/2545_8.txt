The Invisible Ray is an excellent demonstration of the acting talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff achieves a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who seems to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others, even with his wife. His already lonely personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays the role of an accomplished professional, passionate about his work but always finds time to stay on good terms with everyone, but still seems to have no real close friends. It was one of his rare roles as a good guy and he plays it very well. It is difficult, however, to hear his accent and to believe he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is that everything was based on the "science of junk food", but even the science of junk food makes everything work well. Since ideas and theories are completely silly, they are as "relevant" today as they were when the film was shot. And they are as ambitious and always will be. <br /> <br /> It's a very delicious movie to watch over and over again. I have seen maybe five times this weekend and I could easily go five more times. The acting is wonderful and science is fun. I highly recommend it.
