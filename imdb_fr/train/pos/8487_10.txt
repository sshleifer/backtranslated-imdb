I remember seeing "Gung Ho" as a child with my mother and wondering why she was still crying in the last few minutes. Of course, I found the whole movie hilarious, especially the ways to play characters. It was only when I was much older that I watched again that I realized how deep this series is. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shine in their roles as reluctant mediators. Keaton ceases to amaze me with his actual line delivery style and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix. I also thought that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was simply fabulous in her role of comic relief. <br /> <br /> I think this film is one of the most underrated films of the 80s. We can all learn from the fusion of American and Japanese workers in this film ... Sometimes, you * can * really "have the best of both worlds". And now, I understand why my mother felt the same thing in these last moments. I would also rather have one of these cars.
