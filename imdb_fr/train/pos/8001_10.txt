Certainly one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Exquisite direction and a flawless action game make it a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington is playing one of his most captivating and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast is performing well. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he does not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that turns against us is counterbalanced by the innocence and love of a child. It's also a movie for action movie buffs because it has its share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds an impression of glitches and corruption, which in itself is a revelation. All in all, a truly captivating film from start to finish. Highly recommended!
