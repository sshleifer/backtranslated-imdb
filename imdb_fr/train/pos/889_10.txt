This is one of Hong Kong's best (action) movies and has a tense and exciting storyline, as well as some great fighting scenes. This Sammo film has it all: romance, drama, enthusiasm and great heroes. This is the only martial arts film that interested me in the plot rather than waiting for the fights. Fans of Sammo - it's a must (see also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is Ace!), Forever Dragons and Enter the Fat Dragon.
