"Almost Nothing" is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Avoiding both stereotypes and preaching, it is a wonderfully natural film, superbly interpreted, shot with the feeling of the seaside town where the action unfolds, never melodramatic but often painfully real. On the contrary, it's almost too realistic, because there is not much conventional intrigue, just scenes of a lifetime. But the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts less than it could in a world so subtly drawn. "Almost Nothing" is perhaps not the most exciting film ever made. but his simple humanism serves him well compared to the preconceived views of celebration or sectarianism which often ruin the treatment of this theme. Well worth a look.
