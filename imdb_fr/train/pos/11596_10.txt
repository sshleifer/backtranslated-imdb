I saw this film when I was about 7 years old - 33 years ago - and I never forgot this movie! I was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle. And I just could not believe it when he became an eagle just when everyone at the theater thought he was going to die ... <br /> <br /> My sister was in the movie with me and I asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle, she said she remembered it as if we had seen it yesterday. So, it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This film is to see absolutely !!! <br /> <br /> You'll never forget it - just like my sister and myself ...
