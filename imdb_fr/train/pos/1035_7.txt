This film was nominated for Best Picture but lost to Casablanca, but Paul Lukas beat Humphrey Bogart for Best Actor. I do not see why Lucile Watson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, I just do not think she did a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and enter the United States in the first scene of the film. They are going to Davis's relatives. Davis and Lukas were in the subway to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and need rest. But when they go home, they are Nazis and can not do much either. It turns out that the Nazi only cares about money and is ready to make an agreement with Lukas. Their is more intrigue, but you can discover it for yourself.
