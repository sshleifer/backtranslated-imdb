It's an awesome classic film of 50s monsters! I love the look of the 50s in general, like cars and music. Anyway, I love the appearance of gout. I love when everyone is at the end of the night horror film at the theater and the drop in and blocks the party. Another thing that fascinates me is that everything happens in one night, like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane kiss, they see a meteor fall from space. Inside the meteor is the drop. Whenever the drop consumes a person, it grows more and more. They try to convince people in the city of the blobby monster, but no one believes them later. Something can stop this blobby creature? I highly recommend BLOB !!!
