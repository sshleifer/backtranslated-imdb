I was not only an extra in this film, I saw it in Boston in a sold-out cinema. More than a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans have been training in a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy ... about them ... .... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon's star are this pretty comedy about love and lust. Love is between the two young lovers. The desire is for the Red Sox to win the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. He is quite funny and gets the most laughs. Barrymore is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes I thought that actress Ione Skye would have been a better actor for the role. All in all, Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world, it's just a fun movie.
