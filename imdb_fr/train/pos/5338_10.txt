If I watch a porn movie, I prefer it to have a plot and a dialogue of descent. Behind Bedroom Doors is one of the few I've come across with these attributes. <br /> <br /> The new girl next door scams the human nature and the weaknesses of the neighbor in terms of seduction and sex. Chelsea Blue, (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the actress of choice to play the role of the seducer of blackmail, and she plays the role beautifully. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The film gets a total of 10 just because it is there. Her partner in the movie, Monique Alexander is a pretty darling. Both should do more work together. In this film, Monique, who plays Gigi, does not have much to do or say. Too bad. She seems to have more talent to share. I like the girl who was the wife of the (possible) prosecutor then. I forgot her name, but she is pretty and not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to understand what excites some people. It is obvious that there are parts of it bought and paid for. What's going well, but has she finished? Sorry, but go! I'm afraid his performance here has dropped by a few points, except that Chelsea's talent and beauty take precedence over all the negatives. Overall, this movie is good.
