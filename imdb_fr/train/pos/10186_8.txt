Okay, I know this does not put India in a good light. But the general theme of the film is not India, it's shakti. The power of a warlord and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son engulfs you in their heat. So things are terribly wrong. The interaction between Nandini and his stepfather - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the lives changed by it are the highlights of this film. The performance of Shah Rukh Khan seems to be a mere appearance compared to the credible despair of Karisma Kapoor. It's easy to get caught up in the love, the violence and the redemption of lives in this film, and find a sigh of relief and sadness at the top. Musical interludes are assets, credible and well done.
