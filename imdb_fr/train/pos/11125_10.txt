What can you say about a show of this magnitude? "The Sopranos" has literally redefined television as we know it. He broke all the rules and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is perfect, the writing, the staging and for me, the acting game. Looking at this show, you will realize that these characters are NOT real. The acting game makes you think that there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people do not watch the show because it's violent, it's not just violence, but business, family and a lot of other things that all depend on what you, the fans . For me, I do not like when people refer to the show, a show about the mafia. For me, it's a show about the family. A family that, through the generations, happens to be out of the crowd. Overall, it's a masterpiece of a show. That's what television should be. Right here. Complex characters, amazing actor, gorgeous stories, brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients? A show that defines excellence and dares to be different.
