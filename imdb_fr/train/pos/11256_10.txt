Without a doubt, the best of John Le Carre's novels, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, his real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus's Czech Intelligence Controller), Ray McAnally (the father of Magnus's secret man) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), with the rest of the characters, so perfect and natural, the person responsible for their casting should have received a prize. Even small parts, such as the major membrane, are executed to perfection. The power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel speak volumes about the fact that despite the duplicity of Magnus, one can not help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the glutinous Grant Lederer of US Intelligence. . I read the book at least a dozen times, I watched the movie almost as many times and I'm fascinated by both. If I had a book to take on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice over all others.
