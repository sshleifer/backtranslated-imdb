Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A cashier in a bank, everyone walks on him. Then his friend, a writer whose books do not please anyone, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss that he is resigning. He intends to spend the rest of his life earning a lot of money and sleeping with many women. And he manages to do exactly that. <br /> <br /> If it was not the amount of death (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the movie, it would be a joke. There are many jabs in marriage, politics, journalism and life. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant is a friendly amoral thug. Romy Schneider is at her most attractive. It's really worth a look.
