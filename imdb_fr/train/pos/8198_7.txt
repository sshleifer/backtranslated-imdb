Dirty Harry must find a rape victim who takes revenge by shooting at his attackers before killing them. A more appropriate punishment would probably be to let them live after the first shot and let them suffer forever, as she and her sister did ... In short ... a story full of action taking place again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz . The chief rapist, played by Andy Drake, is suitably naughty and receives his punishment at the end (of course!). It's not a classic film, but better than the others, with the exception of Dirty Harry.
