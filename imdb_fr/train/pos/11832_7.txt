It's time for a rant, eh: I thought Spirit was a good movie to watch. However, some things prevent me from giving a higher score than a 6 or 7 (I'm a little generous with the 7). <br /> <br /> Point n Â° 1: Matt Damon annoys me. I thought "what a dicky voice they had for the main character," when I first heard him tell - and then I realized it was Matt Damon. The man hits me so hard - his performance in "The Departed" was terrible and ruined the movie for me (before the movie got the chance to get lost, but that's another story for another time) , as he almost failed "Spirit". "I was able to overcome this fact because of the little narration there was in fact ... fortunately. <br /> <br /> Point # 2: Brian Adams fears ... the whole score was terrible ... the songs were non-original, generic, and poorly executed, not once did I find the music suited, and the lyrics were terrible, every time one of the lame songs I was almost extinct, I almost thought I would begin to hear patriotic propaganda slip into the lyrics of the super-American style of freedom (I could not help but think about those terrible patriotic songs that were constantly being radio after 9/11). Americans of the film, they should adapt the music using appropriate tools, not a small radio hit, a 14 year old girl. I thought I was back in college. I can not believe we could not have done better - I refuse to do it. If that had not been so, I would categorize the movie more with Disney, who knows something about the originality (ok, do not bother to say what I know some of you probably think;) . Too bad, it's a pity they could not hire better musicians. <br /> <br /> I loved art and animation, with the exception of some things here and there ... as sometimes the angles look too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick / dark lines mainly towards the end). It often happened that I thought they were trying too hard on the emotions and facial expressions and failed to arouse real emotion. But there were also times when the emotion was intense. Anyway, many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent. <br /> <br /> OK, I fall asleep here, so I'll summarize before I start to have less sense ... <br /> <br /> Nice test on an epic movie ... it's has proved mediocre. Matt Damon, you are afraid!
