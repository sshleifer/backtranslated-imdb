An ultra-modern house in a wealthy neighborhood seems to be the cause of a strange (and deadly) behavior of each of its inhabitants. Or at least that's what the character of Lara Flynn Boyle, Col. Kennedy, supports. After a series of deadly events in a gigantic house next door, Col knows something must give way. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also plays the role of the mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: The House Next Door works thanks to Lara Flynn Boyle and places (beautiful house) and elegant sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to say absolutely gorgeous. She brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing. Without it, it would have failed. "It's so alive," says a potential buyer with reference to the house. Yes, it's alive. But the story itself is not so important. <br /> <br /> Except Boyle's presence, not much happens here, as a huge part of the film is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I still liked it. Cinematography gives the film a neat look. 8/10 because of Boyle, premise of an ultra-modern diabolical house, places and cinematography, as well as decoration and wardrobe.
