Certainly one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is great, all the technical details (especially the cinematography) are accurate and the scenario is intelligent. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is great, as is Edward "Ned" Kelly. He is captivating as a legendary outlaw and is supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All action sequences are on the point <br /> <br /> The film is a film that goes all the way. One of my favorite films of the legendary Heath Ledger, which was the highlight of all the movies in which he played. And do not be deceived. <br /> <br /> An excellent film as a whole.
