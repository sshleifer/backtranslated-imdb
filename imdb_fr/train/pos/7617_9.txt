A very addictive series. I had never seen an exact combination of drama, action, suspense and science fiction ever before. I am impressed every chapter. The scenario is very intelligent, I do not know how the creators invent all these incredible stories, each character has a strange past, troubles, stormy relationships, it gives the show the human sense necessary to create intimate characters. <br /> <br /> The most incredible is the fact that all the characters are linked together: the numbers, they have already met without knowing it, and so on. The others, the enigmatic security system and the Darma initiative are elements that do not let us lose a chapter. <br /> <br /> Mr. JJ Abrams, what did you think to create this incredible story?
