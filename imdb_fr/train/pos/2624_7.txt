In this film, we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they are not shown - which is a lot! This film even goes back to before Simba and (probably) just after the birth of Kiara. <br /> <br /> Quite faithful to the first movie, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 elsewhere)" is a fun, entertaining, exciting and surprising movie (or a sequel if that's what you want to call). A package of surprises and hilarity awaits you! <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumbaa watch a movie at the cinema (with remote control), Timon and Pumbaa argue over which point of the "Lion King" "They will start watching, as Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning.They have a very fair compromise by watching the movie of their own story, which is what awaits it ... It starts with the first house of Timon ... <br /> <br /> For those with a sense of humor who love the first movies of all ages, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
