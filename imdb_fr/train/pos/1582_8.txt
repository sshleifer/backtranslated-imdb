Another small piece of the vast Holocaust puzzle is revealed in this documentary about the Rosenstrasse demonstration in Berlin, an event I was not aware of that started at the end of February 1943. Details are given in an addendum that follows . this criticism. <br /> <br /> The narrative of the film places the story of this event in another contemporary story that begins today in New York. Here, a wealthy and non-practicing Jewish woman, whose husband has just died, shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual. She goes even further, demanding that her daughter's non-Jewish fianc√© leave home. <br /> <br /> The girl in distress, Hannah (Maria Schrader) then learns for the first time from an older cousin than during the Second World War, in Berlin, her mother, then aged 8, had been collected and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah drops everything, goes to Berlin and finds this woman, Lena Fischer, now 90 years old. Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story. Everything seems a little too simple. <br /> <br /> The film improves thereafter, focusing through long flashbacks mainly on the events of 1943 that surrounded the event, in which the fictional central character is the same, Ms. Fischer to 33 years old (Beautifully performed by Katja Riemann), an accomplished pianist and baroness married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained at the Rosenstrasse site. <br /> <br /> The narrative weaves briefly back to the present from time to time and also ends in New York. While the scenes of the present are saturated in colors, the scenes of 1943 are faded, strong on the blue-gray tones. <br /> <br /> The quality of the game is generally very good, which one would expect given the talent pool. in Germany and under the direction of Margarethe von Trotta, the most prominent director of the new German cinema, herself a former actress. <br /> <br /> The story of the event is told simply. A single missing feature could have helped: non-textual notes at the end indicating the final result for those in custody in Rosenstrasse, which, as the addendum below indicates, is incredibly positive. <br /> <The "Rosenstrasse" did not stand up well in the opinion of most film critics. Too long, superimposed unnecessarily, provider of gender stereotypes, music manipulator: go as usual. It is too long. But I found in this film a voice of protest austere, powerful, spontaneous and quite convincing on the part of the women who watched before the vigil in front of Rosenstrasse where their Jewish relatives and other people were arrested. I did not find anything elegant, contemporary or manipulative in this representation. <br /> <br /> The very absence of extreme violence (no one was shot or physically abused) intensified my tension, which increased as the film progressed. You keep waiting for a vicious attack to start from minute to minute. The darkness of the film stayed with me after. I woke up often later in the night when I saw the movie, the mind filled with dark, melancholy, chaotic images and feelings evoked by the film. For me, this rarely happens. (In German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B +). (Given the 31/05/05).

Normally, those arrested are detained for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the East. But before the prisoners could be expelled, the wives and other members of the family got wind of what was happening and appeared at the Rosenstrasse address, first in groups of two, then in ever-increasing numbers . <br /> <br /> Some 6,000 people may have participated in the event, but not all at the same time. The women asked their husbands to come back day after day for a week. Unarmed, unorganized and without a leader, they fought the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, the Gauleiter (governor or district chief) of Berlin, eager to make this city a cleansed racial affair, was also in charge of the morale of the nation. In both cases, he was concerned about the potential impact of women's actions. Rather than invite more open dissent by shooting down women in the street and fearing to compromise the secret of the "final solution", Goebbels, with Hitler's consent, released the prisoners from Rosenstrasse and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them already sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For Hitler and for Goebbels, the decision was a simple postponement of the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost everyone released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. The women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction.
