This film begins hilariously from about 15 seconds and continues throughout the film. I do not remember a scene where I did not turn to watch people laugh with me. He is the ideal actor for this role because of his appearance and manner of dressing. <br /> <br /> The comic parts were nice to see actors not very big or popular. As you can see, this movie has been rated at 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be in 250. Let's say it this way, I have not seen this funny movie since the American pie or the original holidays. see if you want to laugh. I give this film 2 some of the most beautiful congratulations I've ever seen since I discovered IMDb, an excellent movie site.
