Deeply emotional. It can not leave you neutral. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a love story between two 18 year old boys. But this is just the body of this movie. And it has been removed. You only feel what happened with these boys. You feel the soul of the film. Of course, there is action, sex, but it's not pornography, it's too many feelings. <br /> <br /> It was just a "story" of summer, and it became, from love to hate, almost the most important moment of their lives. I loved him, too, regardless of your feelings.
