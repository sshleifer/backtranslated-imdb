It's sad that this film is at the top, it should at least be among the top 250 movies here. It's still the best action movie ever made. Today's action movies are poorly made. Actors and directors do not know how to do it properly. only a few steps how to do most of the time in Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. The stunts are so clever and wild that I do not think we'll see what's ever going on. The departure of Chan and his team in the car race through the city is simply amazing. The end of combat stunts are for me the best combat stunts ever filmed. The final waterfall sliding down the pole crashing through the window, Jackie was badly injured.
