Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's latest "serious" performances ("The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), I always thought his genius was that of physical comedy. That does not mean he's a fantastic and talented actor: these Academy Award bozos seem to love him so much less than he has ever had a nomination or a (really deserved) award. Well, any "institution" offering 11 Oscars like "Titanic" should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> Let's go to the exam. "The Grinch" is the sweetest, most beautiful, most played and most played seasons movie since "The Nightmare before Christmas". The two films also look very similar, with their very stylized decorations and the postulate of someone who steals Christmas. Both give the impression that their main actors look like villains (one to a higher degree than the other), they both form a solid moral lesson and are really nice. <br /> <br /> It's as long as you do not realize that Jack Skellington is a doll and The Grinch is a human being. But a human being so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so like a cartoon, so unreal, that never interferes with the film. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a world in 3 dimensions, where people live in 3 dimensions. He jokes, he laughs, he cries and finally he saves Christmas. I loved this film in small pieces and I can not wait for it to be released on DVD. It's one of those movies you'll really enjoy in 20 or 20 years. As timeless as they come.
