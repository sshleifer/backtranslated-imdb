I know a lot of people have a penchant for Dickens' version of Alistair Sim, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I have a copy of this movie on VHS and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often notice that we could also see it at Halloween, because it's a very scary ghost story. moving. I think his performance is better in Patton. The spirits are all effective, each more frightening than the last. Observe the skeletal, floating and dark form of Christmas Spirit Yet to Come gives me thrills every year. And what a support cast! David Warner, in particular, is in top form as Bob Cratchit, as is Susannah York as his wife. <br /> <br /> I seem to remember that this version is closer to the original story than most others, but I'm wrong, because it's been several years since I read it. Anyway, it's a wonderful Christmas classic.
