Hickory Dickory Dock was a good mystery Poirot. I admit that I have not read the book, even though I am a big fan of Agatha Christie. The adaptation is not without problems, there were times when humor, and there were valiant attempts to do it right, was a little exaggerated, and the events that led to the final solution were rather rushed. I also thought there were slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded. However, I loved how Hickory Dickory Dock was filmed. His visual style was very similar to that of the excellent ABC Murders and there was really an atmosphere, with his dark camera work and dark lighting. The darkest moments were somewhat frightening, thanks to one of the most haunting scores in Poirot's adaptation, perhaps less disturbing than that of One in Buck Two My Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the essential ingredients, but not as complicated as Buckle My Shoe, and in a way it's a good thing. The acting was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can not use that word forever but I can not think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) like Poirot, and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran do justice. to their full characters brilliantly. And the students had great personalities and well developed overall, especially Damian Lewis as Leonard. Overall, the mystery is solid but not among the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
