Budget constraints, time constraints, turn a scenario and then cut, cut, cut ... This crew is a group of good and young filmmakers; reflected in this script - yes, allegorical - clever in zero dollar effects when time and knowledge are all you have, relying on actors and friends and kind others for their time, dedication, location; and get a first feature in the box, a thing of 1 in 1000. These guys make movies. Good. Check out their collection of "Heartland Horrors" shorts and see the development. And I can attest, working with them is the most fun thing you will do in this area. I am blocked by the harsh and insulting critics of this film, asking me if a critic has not heard a single word of dialogue, thought about a thought or a concept, or if all that one Wanted from this job was the visual flair of hitting and burning down some stupid vision of what horror should mean for an audience. Let "The Empty Acre" come to you. Do not advocate what you hope it's just because it's put into the thriller / horror genre because of its supernatural premise. It's a drama of a depth that goes beyond the extent to which you can stick a blade to someone who has respect for a message that does not attack the visual center of your brain, but rather appeals to his imagination empathic to experience the mental and mental suffering of others. Ridgway brand, Curtis, "The Empty Acre"
