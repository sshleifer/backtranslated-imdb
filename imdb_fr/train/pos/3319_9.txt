As a long-time Red Sox fan, I just had to go see the movie. It was great! Although there are never enough live footage of the 2004 Red Sox miraculous season, some of my favorite Red Sox players have been superb. Although the film is certainly a female film, it contains enough baseball footage from the incredible return of the 2004 Red Sox to make it one of the top 10 movies of all time. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene where Ben meets his buddies on the day of the draft to determine who will get seats at some games is hilarious! A must see if you're looking for a healthy movie to watch with your spouse, your date or any other meaningful goal ... especially if you're a baseball fan ... and even more so if you're a Red Sox fan !! !
