"Inspirational" stories about the "triumph of the human spirit" are usually a big inconvenience to me. The most surprising thing about MEN OF HONOR is how much I enjoyed it despite myself. The film is as predictable and cliche as possible, but it works. The intoxicating performances of both leaders are largely attributable to credit. This is a perfect role for Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is wonderfully remembered here. We expect a lot from De Niro, and he does not disappoint. He creates a dark and funny portrait. Director George Tillman, Jr. decided to make an old-fashioned film and propose a winner.
