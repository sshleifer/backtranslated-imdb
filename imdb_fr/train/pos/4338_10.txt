The film was very moving. It was tender and funny at the same time. The landscape was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award-winning performances. Olympia Dukakis was great. I understand that because of the story, its part should be brief, but I would have liked to see more, because she is a true professional. You will be able to remember experiences in your own life, positively after seeing this movie. We had the chance to see Paul Reiser at a question-and-answer session after watching. He is a wonderful, intelligent, eloquent man and a "real person". It was really a nice evening! It's a must-see movie. You will be so grateful that you went.
