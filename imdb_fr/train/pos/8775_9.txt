Warner Bros's excellent effort with Errol Flynn in one of his best on-screen performances. He is often cited as his best and I can not really judge until I see his "Dawn Patrol". However, his work in "They are dead with their boots" takes a hit. I'm a big fan of Flynn (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps to be an Australian) and I think he's just wonderful, an excellent on-screen presence and also an excellent actor. He is the centerpiece of "Gentleman Jim" as a legendary boxer at the sophisticated footwork, but he is also backed by a playful, hearty and entertaining script, and by the direction of Raoul Walsh. Every Walsh movie I've ever seen never loses a pace, he was really a born filmmaker. Walsh directs the ringside scenes to perfection, as he does for the lighter moments and the beautiful and last poignant scene between Ward Edge and Flynn. Add to that excellent production values ​​(the "Gay Nineties" have never been so beautiful!), A nice distribution and almost perfect entertainment. Alan Hale usually played Flynn's buddy, but here is his dad and everything is still working. Alexis Smith is the love interest of Flynn. The pair is madly in love with fighting.
