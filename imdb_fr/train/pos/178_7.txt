"Protocol" is a photo of chance starring Goldie Hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who rescues the night of an Arab visiting an assassination attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job in the US government. Will the corridors of power in the capital of our country ever be the same? Hawn is excellent as usual even though "Protocol" is not as funny as his best film "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
