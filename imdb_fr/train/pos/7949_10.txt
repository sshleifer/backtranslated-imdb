SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: The incredible journey is an important film of my life because it's the first film I can remember having seen in my hometown cinema as a rascal 4 years old. The story is based on Sheila Burnford's novel and explains why it is impossible to write this one as a brainless Lassie clone. <br /> <br /> The basic story: two dogs and a cat live happily in the Seaver family when the new husband of the mother of three finds a job in town and they have to settle temporarily in downtown San Francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live there for a few months. The links between the animals and the children they watch are particularly strong, and Shadow, the golden retriever and Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat, are heartbroken like children, although the young and happy American bulldog known as Chance to be a little less worried and a bit cynical (partly because of his voice over explaining that he was abandoned as a puppy, taken to an animal shelter and bought by the family), well that its growth as a character during the story provides much of the important narrative. <br /> <br /> The three pets escape the ranch and head for the vast and dangerous wilderness (fantastic places by the way), under Shadow's leadership instinct. They encounter many dangers on the way, hoping to return home, while family and ranch guests are suddenly concerned about the disappearance of an animal. There are fun moments throughout, a great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a touching camaraderie that develops between the main characters during the narration, punctuated by moments of Sadness (such as when Sassy's arrogance trying to cross a river without getting wet makes her fall into the river and get overwhelmed by a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss felt deeply by the spectators). <br /> <br /> I do not see what the inclusion of saving the lost girl in the wild adds to the story and journey they undertake. This seems a bit useless in the story. <br /> <br /> The end raises the stakes when the shadow falls in a pit in a train yard and is injured in the leg, has trouble getting out and gives up, exhausted, followed by Luck with him to persuade him to go out, telling him how important he is to him and how he pushed him so far that he should not spoil everything so easily. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of this (brilliantly done) scene leaves an ambiguity that lasts in the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere. While everything seems lost, he slowly appears and is reunited with the family. The conclusion of Chance at the end speaks of the camaraderie that developed between him and his fellow travelers, and the realization of what he really is at home after his long journey to get there leaves a beautiful epilogue for demonstrate how much his character has grown, but also how the other two have too. Wait a second, I think I'm going to cry ... <br /> <br /> In any case, I did not read Sheila Burnford's book, so I do not pretend to know where the differences between the book are and movie lie. But it's a movie that the whole family can watch, and even though kids love talking animals, older viewers will better understand the storyline (as I discovered when I watched the movie after several years without seeing it). This film is a masterpiece of cinema and I suggest you, if you have not seen it, to go out and get it! <br /> <br /> And please, avoid following (see my comment on Homeward Bound II!)
