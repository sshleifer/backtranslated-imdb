My father was the prison warden (he's retired now) featured in this documentary and I grew up in prison life, so maybe my point of view will be totally different from that of anyone watching this movie. I will say this, the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people. They had the courage to A) introduce themselves and tell this story, B) to penetrate the minds and hearts of these inmates, and C) to do all this responsibly. Respectful of their art and, more importantly, vis-Ã -vis detainees and staff of the Luther Luckett Penitentiary Complex. They should be congratulated endlessly for this work. To take 170 hours, yes HOURS, of video footage and to be able to reduce it to 93 fascinating minutes is nothing extraordinary, and I have all my respect. <br /> <br /> I saw this film under such difficult circumstances very few could see it. I was screening detainees. I was in the same room as these men as they watched their hearts pour on the screen. I saw men crying on the television crying on the chair in front of me and let me tell you that it was a very deep experience. These men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases, but have found a way to try to redeem themselves, even if they consider themselves non-tradable. How many of us have the courage to do that? How many people could do what they did in such a difficult environment? To see them react to the film was an experience for which I am eternally grateful, and I will never forget it. I thank the men who allowed me to fly over their lives, I thank my father for making everything possible, and I thank Philomath Films for taking the time to shed their blood, their sweat, their soul and their tears in this project. <Br/> <br /> This movie will change everything you think you know about life in prison and detainees who are detained there. "Oz" is not real, television is not real. "Shakespeare Behind Bars" is.
