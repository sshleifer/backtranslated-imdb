"Let's Bowl" started on local television in the Twin Cities. It started late at night, something you would have come across while surfing your channel after your 7th Hamm bottle. <br /> <br /> Even the commercials were produced locally, starring Wally outside Grumpy's Bar, holding a microphone and stammering nervously. - "Ahh ... to you, Steve Sedahl." I do not know why, but it always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There was a bowling competition under the pretext of settling a dispute between two bowlers, but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips. Sedahl played right, counterbalanced by Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious "Wally Hotvedt". Among the highlights, segments such as "How to properly get rid of an old bowling ball" (throw them in a lake) and "Tips on dating", where the duo "date", two prostitutes and Wally ends with the bitter complaint, "I could have done it myself!" <br /> <br /> Another segment - what the duo did during their days off - starred Steve in a beer can barrel-lit, coming out of the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs of Taylor's Falls, dressed in his pale blue blazer stockings and oversized helmet. Hilarious! <br /> <br /> Wally's astounding comments about the "bowlers of the league" and his struggle to apply the good euphemism to different divisions were also highlights. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" was taken over by Comedy Central We had good moments, but the network never really knew what to do with it, launch it at prime time and emphasize the " competition "bowling, which has never been the goal of the series. The constant advertisements interrupted the flow and the secondary characters (Ernie, the Pig, Butch, etc.) were more of a distraction than anything else. Everything seemed hasty and forced. Even Jon Stewart dissected Let's Bowl at the Daily Show - (not enough sneaky jokes?) - an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved much better. <br /> <br /> How often does a "Let's Bowl" come into the world of modern television, a mix of comic genius and shit with local flavors? The networks have the cold "total shit" part, but it's sad to watch them kill such a dark, strange and funny gem like "Let's Bowl". <br /> <br /> Hoping they put it on DVD.
