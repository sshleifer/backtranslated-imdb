So, this may not be the type of movie "Best of the Year" (apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think has won some awards), but it's really a very good movie about "The Kid" (Prince / O) and the events around him that live in Minneapolis and play his music.The music is absolutely superb, in my opinion, you MUST own this soundtrack, it's is really a classic and sums up the sounds and the 80s wonderful fashion.And the movie itself plays a nice plot, it's worth seeing again and again, especially if you like Prince / O (what I do) well sure.
