I hope the score has already changed because of my brilliant and amazing criticism that persuades you to go watch the movie, creating an instant chorus of "8", the true score of this movie. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before Chris Rock is the king! Before going to see this film, I was not so out of the ordinary about it, but now, I'm knocking on the doors of Chris Rock's website, begging him to take me for his protégé. This movie is really funny, if you do not find this funny movie, you REALLY need therapy and humor that targets all areas of society, including race (as expected), class division, love, wealth, jobs, dreams, comedy standing up. The list is long. <br /> <br /> There was, however, a slight disappointment for me. It was while entering this film that I did not realize that it was actually a remake of "Heaven Can Wait", a very good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and the plot suddenly turned into a film that looked much like an older movie I had watched on TV a few months ago. weeks. This film is, in my opinion, the best version of both of them simply because of the different areas covered and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty at any time of the day or week of any what year or other year ... you get the picture. <br /> <br /> Well in the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not waste the experience for yourself! Do not read the plot! Just watch a movie because there have been so far two critics on IMDb who are crazy about it, go see it because it's the funniest thing you've seen in a long time, go see it because it's a cinema experience that does not let you growl ad nauseum at the price of movie tickets. Go see it because it's a good movie!
