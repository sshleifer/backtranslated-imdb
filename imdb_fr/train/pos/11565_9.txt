SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is the others". In "The Odd Couple", Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau demonstrate how accurate this can be. Like Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together. As the two begin to grow more and more frustrated with each other, bursts of laughter multiply before Felix leaves, leaving Oscar a different and cleaner face. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely superb As a neurotic, cleansing is an obsession for the divorced woman who lives with a single person. Walter Matthau, unlike the character of Lemmon, is as good as the sports journalist Slobbish who just wants to play poker to earn money with his family allowances. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are beautiful in their role dependent on Neil Simon's beautiful script, and simultaneously because they work well as a team. As two friends who have fundamentally different ways of life, albeit similar in their relationships with ex-women and children, these two late-stage actors create a partnership that is virtually impossible to recreate. So big in fact that the world has shouted so much for something similar, that two years before Matthau's death and three before Lemmon's, the characters were reunited in a lower sequel. This idea, while following Hollywood's irritating obsession with the sequels, might have worked to some extent, but at the same time, it could never reproduce the genius of this original film. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not really possible to say anything else. With Simon's amazing scenario, filled with humor and laughter, the creators of this movie were already on a hit. The casting of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in the role of Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison is however the most important part of this film. "The Odd Couple", with his traditional soundtrack (who even earned a tribute in "The Simpsons"), his excellent screenplay and his genius, these are genius leaders, is a tribute to the cinema and a long footage whose story must be remembered.
