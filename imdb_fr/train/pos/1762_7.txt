Okay, here's the problem: if you're easily offended, you might want to stay away from this one. There are painfully funny moments in the film, but I probably blush as much as I laugh. In fact, I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I did not blush literally outside, I blushed inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that bothers you, then you simply are not ashamed. I guess this is not a sign of honor or not. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that I laughed, but it is a film that I simply can not give to a general recommendation. because of his subject. If I had to say, "This movie is hilarious, go check it out!" and a sweet little old lady who goes to church goes to the theater and has a heart attack during a very explicit sexual situation, well, it's just something that I do not need in my consciousness . <br /> <br /> So, how hot is it? Um, try about 100 times less than Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mother would be out during the first scene. I think I must at least tell you what to expect. <br /> <br /> There's a cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what I'm expecting from the man (Judd Apatow) who got his hands on Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming, "If I hear Ya Mo being there again, I'm going to burn this place," it's hilarious, but it's one of those things that most people will not like. <br /> <br /> And when we see Steve Carrell's 3-second flashback singing on Cameo's Word, I laugh for a good two minutes after the end of the joke, while most people sneer and forget about it . <br /> <br /> Strangely, despite the kick-off, history presents an admirable morality. The film does not portray Carrell as a bizarre loser just because he's a virgin. He is really described as a nice and admirable character. Of course, he's a little weird. After all, he has a framed poster from Asia, "more video games than an Asian kid" and a toy collection that features the BOSS of Million Dollar Man, but we're never inclined to believe there's really something wrong with the fact that it's blank. As strange as it sounds, there is a little message "it's OK to wait". <br /> <br /> But, man, man, please be warned that it pushes his R score about as far as possible. . It was definitely Apatow's intention. According to him, he simply let some of the guys (especially Rogen and Malco) improvise and talk as they normally do, all with the aim of finding many new ways to get dirty. If you manage to handle that or if you talk about it yourself, you'll love the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of excessive jokes and sexual jokes. I find that this subtle and intelligent humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of sexual discussions in f-word or fratboy. But it's me. As I said, there are absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to wonder if they are worth watching one of the most vulgar films you will likely have to see at the theater. I just do not know how much women will be interested in what men talk about playing poker. Honestly, ladies, you may not want to know. If you've ever been curious about why some girls think the guys are disgusting, well, that gives you a good idea. <br /> <br /> Here, my humble and honest vision of what to expect. Be your guide. This should definitely not be seen with your Sunday school class, your mother, your grandmother, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anyone easily offended by excessive profanation or explicit sexual discussion. If you see it with any of the above, you will apparently have no idea what it means to be uncomfortable.
