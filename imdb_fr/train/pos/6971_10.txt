Of course, the average Battle Star Gallactica "Sci-Fi" fan will hate that. That makes me happy. I do not like these sci-fi series especially Gallactica, and that's why I like this series. <br /> <br /> The creators of the series had a lot of heat to make this film -fi way) and it was worth it. I read on Wiki that they wanted to please everyone, including women and not just science fiction fans. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most promising series since Lost. This is the most interesting scenario, the most intelligent and profound of all the shows for some time and it is really unique. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this show is that it's like a big Anime! Young teenagers running a pistol, going through a complex scenario and extremely well balanced, robots, it reminds me of something that came from Japan, except a little better (most cartoons are too confusing).
