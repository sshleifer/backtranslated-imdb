It's one of the most soothing, relaxing and beautifully made animation movies I've ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie! This film is not only great for kids, but also for adults. It teaches you lessons, such as never forgetting who you are, you can do what you think about it, brave and dare. This film can also make you cry sometimes, which is always nice in movies. This movie is funny, sad, cute and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Some movies really make you feel fuzzy once you've seen them, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one! With my vote of 9/10 stars for animation, music and a wonderful movie idea, it gave me a lot of Spirit!
