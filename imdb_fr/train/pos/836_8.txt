It will probably not be voted best comedy of the year, a little too much coincidence and intrigue. However, we are talking about a movie in which a handyman and a white bread seller become friends, so some randomness should not surprise you. Brosnan is excellent in this role, the wooden James Bond (a role in which he was lost) is gone. If he can maintain that kind of quality, I hope he will continue to do comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as a straight member of Brosnan. I read some negative comments about Hope Davis here, but I thought she was pretty good as a smiling housewife with a dark side buried deep inside him. There are a lot of good laughs as Brosnan makes his way and some scenes where I almost die laughing. My father (a consultant) almost lost him when Julian describes himself as a "facilitator". Just like "Grosse Pointe Blank", another hit comedy, the humor can be very dark. If you are there, be ready to have fun.
