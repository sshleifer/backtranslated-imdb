Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality of the horror work done in Italy in the 60s. The film contains all the necessary elements: old dark house, atmosphere, decent history and Barbara Steele. Steele turns almost all the movies that are worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story is about a haunted castle. People visited, but none came back. Our hero is betting that he can spend the night in the castle and come back for his winnings. But the night he visits is a special night. It is the night of all the years when the dead relive to relive their death. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I see in the movie is the duration. It feels almost padded. There is a large part of the first act where literally nothing happens. Our hero stumbles in the darkness without finding anything interesting. But once he has found something, the movie resumes and becomes very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is a must for Steele fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general.
