*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Jackman Hugh, Ian McShane and Romola Garia. Directed by Woody Allen. Just after his work with Johansson on "Match Point", the two come back for "Scoop", a comical and fun ride for Corky. When a student reporter (Johansson) discovers a new scoop of a dead journalist (McShane) when he enters the materialization of a lame magician (Allen). The scoop being that of the new tarot card killer in London, who could be Prime Minister Peter Lyman (Jackman); while Sondra and Sid play the detective, Sondra falls in love with the handsome who would be a killer. Allen finally hit a mark, not as good as "Match Point" but certainly more fun. I laughed a lot more than I expected, one of the must see years
