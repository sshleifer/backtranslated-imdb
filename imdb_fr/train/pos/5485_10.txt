One of the most timely and exciting documentaries you'll ever watch. Although the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, it offers an intimate glimpse into the political dynamics prevailing throughout the Western Hemisphere. Although it is essentially another chapter in the history of the "Latin American coup d'Ã©tat supported", this film tells in real time what can happen when the poorest are armed with unity, political sense and courage! <br /> <br /> The political ideas proposed by this film are invaluable. Clear examples from the private media are obtained as a formidable force of deception and mass propaganda. We see the poor people of Caracas struggling with the brutal realities of "American politics". If the people fail to cope with the blatant tyranny, which has been brutally and illegally infused on them by the conspirators, the victims get a clear sense of disaster. We also see the arrogance and fascism of private media, plutocrats and generals, backed by the CIA, who conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's rule. Although ruthlessly led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. Their answer is the highlight of the film. If you're looking for an excellent portrait of what the US government is, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela, this film is his!
