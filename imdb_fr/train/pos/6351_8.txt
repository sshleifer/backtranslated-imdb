When the Grinch came out, I was excited that I thought it would be a happy and lucky film. Although he had a bit of a nightmare before Christmas touched on her. You know kind of dark and spooky. I loved this movie because it helped fill the Christmas spirit. So especially the Grinch saved Christmas. And what happened afterwards in Whoville, they say that Grinch's little heart grew up in three sizes that day. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
