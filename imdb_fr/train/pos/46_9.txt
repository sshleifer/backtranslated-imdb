I just watched this movie for the seventh or eighth time, I picked it up a night previously seen at Blockbuster and I loved it, I already showed it to 4 people and they also enjoyed it. Avoid all the Hollywood glamor, the special effects and the stress on the "shock factor", this independent film of Paul F. Ryan hits the neck to face the consequences of the traumatic situations. After the shooting in high school, two characters, Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen), form an unlikely link. Alicia, the stone-hearted girl, Goth who has a pessimistic attitude to life helps Deanna to overcome the problems of life and death and to live as a result of it. Meanwhile, Deanna tries to help Alicia see the sweetness and light of the world again. Do not insist on the shocking event of the shoot, but on the interpersonal relationships between those who have survived, this film is unique. Despite its small budget and short filming time, this film is far from being cheesy. Ryan pays tribute to a situation he has never experienced and tries to delve into the human psyche. Philipps, an astonishing and up-and-coming actress, adds drama and drama to the film and film, and Christensen helps balance the movie's "sadness". Overall, I recommend this film and if you like the subject of aggression and violence in school and learn more, I also suggest the documentary "It's a Girls World", broadcast by the CBC in 2004, which deals with the subject of social bullying. We compare and oppose two groups of girls, one in Montreal, Quebec, and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of Dawn Marie Wellesley, a 14-year-old girl who was is suicidal after being brutally bullied.
