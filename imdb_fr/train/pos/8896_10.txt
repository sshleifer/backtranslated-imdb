Can anyone help find the title and artist of the song, which was played at least halfway through the film. I do not remember the current scene. The words of the song are of a ballad. Some words go like "It's a natural way of telling you something that's wrong." It's a natural way to say it in a song. "It's a natural way to forgive you. "Help me, please, with this question, thank you very much, and that's why I'll be embarrassed to find someone who can help solve this problem." I wish I could pay special attention to the scene as it unfolded.
