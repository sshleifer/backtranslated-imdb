Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones is the waiter serving when Hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the lakeside restaurant. I watched this movie on a video I had recorded on TV. When I watched this scene, I thought I recognized Jones' voice when the "server" laughed at the end. I rewound the tape and slowly crossed that part as the camera stepped back and pointed to the server. Listen carefully to the server laughing when Hagarty looks up and tells him they're going to have a baby, then watch carefully or slow down the scene when the camera shows the server, albeit quickly.
