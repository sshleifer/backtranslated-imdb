Mark Frechette plays Mark, a radical left-wing university party. Mark is accused of killing a cop during a riot on campus and fled to the desert. He does this by flying a small plane to the local airport and flying it himself. <br /> <br /> Once outside, flying over the desert, Mark spots a car in the air. A young woman named Daria comes out and sees Mark turn on the plane. Mark lowers the plane several times, causing Daria to slip away or be hit. When he lands, he meets Daria, strangely charmed by Mark's airborne sounds. <br /> <br /> After engaging in a moving conversation for hours, Mark and Daria undress and make love in the sand. But with Mark evading the law, they realize he has to keep running. Thus, the brief conversation of Mark and Daria is poignant enough, because it must not become a true love story. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was the eraser of the early 70s. Both films have a vague, vague quality, with meanings and complicated characters. Fr√©chette was as reckless as his character in this film. A few years after creating Zabriski Point, Frechette robbed a bank. While serving his prison term, Mark died of a despicable death. He was killed by a weight of 150 pounds that fell on him when he was in weightlifting. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is its superb cinematography and special effects. The incredible slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion were a stroke of genius. Although the film is not as innovative as Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still resonates with the counter-culture of the early 70s. I recommend it for those who love avant-garde films that highlight the upheaval of the youth rebellion of the early 1970s.
