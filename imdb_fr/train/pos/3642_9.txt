I saw this film for the first time 3 years ago. It was presented by Disney's chef, Eisner, and the real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago, he came back on television and this time I filmed it. Since then, I had to watch it at least three times. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful, inspiring, good-looking film that is intelligently written and interpreted in a credible way by everyone involved. He resists all the sentimental fictions contained in the book, as well as all other clich√©s. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to see a movie where children are not fools and have a whole series of behavioral problems. and the jocks are not described as muscled heads by testosterone. <br /> <br /> These are just normal people who have dreams like you and me. <br /> <br /> other extremes to what they call "gritty realism", make movies where everyone curses and who has aggression problems. <br /> <br /> This film is about a man who has a dream and who is encouraged by his friends and family to pursue this dream. The people of Big Lake, Texas seem so nice that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the film does not try to be too sentimental. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappoints. I look at it since the late 70's and it is so underrated. <br /> <br /> But this movie has great performances from everyone, and congratulations to the writers. <br /> <br /> A jewel in the film is almost over when Jim trains in the dugout before the big game and his wife calls him from the stands. He rushes to his family. The look on the faces of the three other launchers sitting on the dugout bench is invaluable. <br /> <br /> If you want to change the rhythm, opt for this movie.
