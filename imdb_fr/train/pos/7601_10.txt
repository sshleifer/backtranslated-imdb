Lost is one of a kind ... it's so enchanting and full of suspense, thrills and emotions. I have never seen a TV show like this before. It is full of thrills in the jungle and has a good scenario. The actors moved life on an island in such a natural way that I felt lost watching it. It's a great job narrated in a very clever way. The series looks like a movie describing the life of survivors lost on a deserted island. I am tempted to watch one episode after another and I highly recommend this series to all lovers of TV shows. Check it to see the magic to get lost in nowhere.
