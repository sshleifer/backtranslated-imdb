Hidden Frontiers is more than fan fiction, it's a well-thought-out and organized series that keeps the Star Trek worlds alive and growing. From a small fun project to a well-known film series; Hidden Frontiers has something special for all Star Trek fans. Hidden Frontier addresses topics and issues raised in other Star Trek series with predefined stories using well-developed characters, storylines and storylines. Star Trek Hidden Frontier took up stories of social context that Gene Roddenberry did not show on screen and showed the development of characters in long-term space assignments - the real things that are happening closely as well as wars and exciting conflicts in space-addicts know and love. Made in a studio "Green Screen"; Hidden Frontiers brings a series of seasoned players on the screen and in your hearts. The large group of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. The inventive use of green screen technology, accessories, make-up and costumes helps make the Star Trek Hidden Frontier worlds fun and believable. Hidden Frontier went few people into the world of science fiction and thrived once there. Hidden Frontier offers a great asset for a well-thought-out website, with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and performance staff, and a fun weekly discussion. I highly recommend taking the time to charge and watch.
