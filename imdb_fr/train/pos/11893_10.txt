The next two seasons of this original series were less than dull. The disastrous rework of recent seasons has contributed to its short life span of three seasons. Perhaps if the catch had been removed after the first season, it would have been a cult hit. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the first season was really hilarious! Witty, smart with superb writing was promising. The excellent beer of the first season had the right ingredients: characters / actors, scenario, etc. In addition, a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original. Nora and her colleagues "photographers" on the lookout, night after night, day after day for exclusives. <br /> <br /> Many things do not seem logical to me. I like how this show, and another of my favorites - Gross Pointe has never "succeeded". If only the first seasons of Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, make someone happy ?!
