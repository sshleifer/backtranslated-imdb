This film was broadcast last week and although at this time of day (around 18 hours) the quality of the films is almost never good (at least here on Mexican TV), I could not turn off the TV. The story of Madelene Moore really touches you. She does not seem to be a very friendly character at first, but by watching the entire movie, you just want her to succeed. This film really lets you think. And I think this is largely due to the great role of Brooke Johnson. I had never heard of her before or seen her knowingly in another movie, but it was great to play. Compliments to Brooke. I hope to see her soon in another movie.
