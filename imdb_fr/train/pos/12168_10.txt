"A Guy Thing" may not be a classic, but it's a good and funny comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up the day after his bachelor party without memory and Becky (Julia Stiles) lying naked in bed. Before he can understand what happened, he rushes Becky out of her apartment because her fiance Karen (Selma Blair) arrives. After that, as you can imagine, chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> Almost all scenes of "A Guy Thing" offer bright laughter. The funniest moments come from when Paul imagines what could happen if he tells Karen. Selma Blair is a truly talented actress and the worst aspect of this movie is that she is underused. Although she turns out to be funnier than the Stiles character, who is actually not that interesting. Of course, not all comedies are perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "A Guy Thing" is not a classic, but it's not bad either, 7/10.
