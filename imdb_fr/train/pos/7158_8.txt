Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnats IV is wrongly convicted of stealing, he is sent to Camp Green Lake. In this camp, the supervisor and her two henchmen, Mr. Sir and Dr. Pendanski, order camp comrades to dig holes, holes after holes. But why? Stanley intends to find out. <br /> <br /> I never really intended to watch 'Holes', and I have to admit, I only really watched the movie, because I'm a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not a fan of him, then it does not matter. 'Holes' is one of those Disney movies that the whole family can enjoy. The story is beautiful writing and incorporates a wonderful idea to include flashbacks to the past. These are not distracting and really gives a big story back. All the actors are great. The young stars are playing well and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a joy. Shia LaBeouf shows that even at 17, he can act without any defect. This is a Disney movie that you will certainly enjoy with your family. <br /> <br /> "I learn from failure". - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
