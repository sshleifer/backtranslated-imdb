I really enjoyed this movie. I am a single father with a 17 year old girl who is smart, athletic and talented. I wish my daughter is so good at solving crimes and helping others! So for me it may be a PG Fantasyland level. I read a lot of Nancy Drew's books as a teenager a long time ago. Of course, this character was skillfully portrayed by Emma Roberts but does not look like the Nancy Drew I remember the books. It is thanks to the scenario and not to the acting of the actors. <br /> <br /> Emma is an adorable teenager, who plays a confident, hard-working, proud character with good manners and good taste. It is not caught in the fashionable competitiveness that surrounds it. There are some weaknesses in the plot, in addition to not looking like Nancy Drew's books and trying to figure out what decade we are. I read the IMDb overview before watching the movie, while I was looking for Rachael Leigh Cook in other movies. This is not one of his best roles, but I will continue to search for more of his films. Rachael was too old to play this role, but did an excellent job as an orphan orphan at the center of the mystery. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the other reviews written here. Some expect a perfect connection with books, others expect more credible situations or action movies for adults. I had what I expected! Good entertainment well focused on teenage girls and their fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and excellence. This is a Teen PG movie, not James Bond! What would you like as a model for your teenage daughter?
