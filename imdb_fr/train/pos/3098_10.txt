I liked this show so much and I'm incredibly sad that it's canceled. I thought he was back too, but just two stupid weeks. It's terrible. I hate how we never find out how everyone ends up coming. it sucks. Take it back! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and so on, but does not give time to good shows like Six Degrees. If they complain about ratings, it's probably because they have a bad place because it was really a good show, something that I could understand and anticipate. JJ Abrams was delivered, it's great, I would like ABC to trust him enough to complete the story. I liked the whole cast too. I was eager to see how everyone would meet one day at a time. The story of everyone is now incomplete, I will never know if Steven and Whitney would meet or if Carlos and Mae would meet. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and all the others. This is really such a negative point.
