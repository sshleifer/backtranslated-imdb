The latest installment of the action thriller franchise is arguably the hardest of the three films. He goes further in the anti-Bond theme. Bourne does not like what he does and wants to know more about his blurred past. Everything about this film goes straight to the point: from cinematography to choreography / stunt, from scenario to acting. <br /> <br /> The film begins in the wake, Bourne fleeing the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up where the first film stopped. Or does it? The weather is a bit confusing here, but we understand that Bourne remembers some things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself almost makes him catch, but he succeeds and does not kill anyone. They are not his target. From there, we discover the intrigue of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect him at all costs. Pamela Landy is back, as is Nicky Parsons, who also seems to have a past with Bourne. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is in your face that follows just about everything. The car chase is even more intense if it seems possible that those of the first two. And the cast of veterans chasing Bourne is superb with a nice role of Albert Finney. It also has slight political nuances with respect to restitution and other government policies, but it is a minor step and very well integrated with the plot. Overall, this is the best conclusion of the trilogy this year, if not the best action trilogy of all time.
