It's not Braveheart (luckily), but it's a good entertainment with endearing characters and a good acting. I enjoyed this film when it was released and, after watching it again last week, I found that it had withstood the test well. This is not a classic film, but a very fine film and appreciable to watch as an excellent entertainment.
