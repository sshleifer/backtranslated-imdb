This film is a riot. I do not remember the last time I had such a good time at the cinema. I saw some good comedies in my day and they are usually pretty funny. But this one is wall-to-wall in outline. I think Best in Show is the last movie in which I laughed so much and laughed. The movie was nonstop until the end when they cleaned up the 5 minutes of the sentimental plot. Other than that, it's a constant barrage of steamers and wacky situations. I'd like to see him again before he leaves the theater, because it's like Zucker's movies where all the jokes are not ridiculous the first time. You have to see it two or three times to understand everything. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it might have been used with better editing, it is sometimes jerky this. All the characters are great. It's not like in a film by Adam Sandler where he tries to be funny and everyone suffers around him and is the target of the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for years because they are all very friendly. No victims in this movie. Plus, thank God, a 45-year-old actress played her girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays it and she is darling in this movie. You just want women like she really existed. She is not a "10" like some of the other big ladies, but her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts'. I assure you that the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give all the good jokes. Some of the most mediocre. <br /> <br /> Oh and one more thing. I hope the critics will add it to their top ten list. Many complain that comedies do not get the recognition they deserve and at the end of the year they do not put it on their list. That means you Ebert !!!
