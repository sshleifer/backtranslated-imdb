Many people like this movie and many others love it, but it seems to be for the wrong reasons. Scarface should be loved and loved, but not the way he was. <br /> <br /> Many people say that the acting was excessive, but who better to make an excessive character than Al Pacino. To say that Pacino went too far here would be a euphemism. Yet he does it so well, he brings you so well the inner demon. His character, Tony Montana, was not a great guy to start with, but his thirst for power was just bringing his sickness of greed to another level; an inhuman level. Of course, sometimes Pacino seems to be a bit caricatural and surreal, but that does not seem to me to be a handicap at all. The support distribution did its job very well. Michelle Pfeiffer was not really at her best, but she certainly matched the role she played. Steven Bauer was at his best, but he is still Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and, like Michelle Pfeiffer, she was very good at her role. Robert Loggia I have always loved to watch seeing him scream. Apart from Pacino, they were not really remarkable or memorable. Everyone just seemed to match their roles by being there. They did not find their place perfectly, but were sufficiently convincing. <br /> <br /> Brian De Palma directed this film very well. Whenever an actor is able to become larger than life thanks to his performance, the director must be recognized and I will certainly give it to De Palma. Brian De Palma, even if he is not respected, is a director very versatile in my eyes. He knows how to make movies based on their genre, but sometimes it does not work. Here it really is, it's a gangster movie, but few of them are much better because of De Palma. <br /> <br /> The writing was excellent, it was purely Oliver Stone. When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and Oliver Stone wrote that, I was not surprised at all. This is a testimony for him though. I always thought of him as a great writer and he proves it again with Scarface. Nobody knows how to write for Oliver Stone a surreal reality for a film. <br /> <br /> The music was good but not so good. It is certainly not my favorite of Giorgio Moroder. The music was a little too 80-ish for me, but it did not bother me. The cinematography was good, not surprising, but who really cares about a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the most influential films of the last 25 years, but as mentioned before, it's not for valid reasons. . People should realize that Tony Montana's character is not a hero, he's a monster. In any case, he does not inspire. He is greedy, thirsty for blood, uneducated and self-consumed. Yet he is a role model for many people because he is somehow a rebel, but probably most of all because he is a misguided gangster. A vigilante would be like Mother Tereasa next to Scarface. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this film is that it shows that Tony Montanas are not the real problem. If we, or the authorities, want to silence people like him, we could do it, but we do not do it. In a bizarre and twisted way, it is a necessity of our society. He is someone who can be blamed and who is more comfortable doing so. The Tony Montanas of this world are the scapegoats of our society. That does not excuse people like him. Instead, it is a reminder that we should not apologize or allow us to do bad things simply because we are up to par or think we are up to a gangster or a drug dealer. I like this film because it's more than a film about corruption, it's a film that strangely makes you think.
