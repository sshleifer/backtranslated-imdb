It was the first episode of Columbo film to be filmed, but it was aired as a second episode after Steven Spielberg's "Columbo: The murder of the book". It is also at the same time one of the best! <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was one of the great directors of creation! No wonder they then asked him to direct three other Columbo films. The film has real creative and innovative shooting sequences and the film as a whole is clearly designed with style, passion and attention to detail. Every shot is connected and is one reason why this movie is better and as beautiful as any other film made for the TV movie. It's certainly one of the best-made films of Columbo. <br /> <br /> This is an original Columbo entry for several reasons. Murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act. So the killer does not have the time this time to plan the "perfect murder" in advance and clean up the traces later and get rid of the body. The killer in this film is not only treated as the man who committed the crime, but rather as the one who helps Lieutenant Columbo solve the murder. It also makes the character more interesting and more layered and also helps to make the way Columbo solves the whole crime much more interesting because of it. Of course, Columbo begins to suspect him early enough and, as always, he manages to find a solution by making himself vulnerable and looking more stupid than he is of course and gaining the murderer's trust. This is obviously not a spoiler, because that's how all Columbo movies are configured. I liked the film's story and how it progressed. <br /> <br /> It also helps the film to have such a successful cast. At the time of this film, Peter Falk had really taken on the character of Columbo and it was already fully developed. Robert Culp is really great as a short-tempered Brimmer. What's funny is that he would come back later in three different Columbo films and in an episode of "Mrs. Columbo", in totally different roles. He even played the murderer in some of these films. He was not the only actor to have done this in other later Columbo films. The great Ray Milland also appears in this film, as the victim's husband. <br /> <br /> In total, this is a very good first Columbo film and among the best in the long series of films. <br /> <br /> 9/10
