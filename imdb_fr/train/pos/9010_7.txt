A little weird and close to bad taste; but smart enough to be worthy to watch. Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter), a young woman in a wheelchair, teams up with a reluctant caregiver, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who dreams awake of human flight. He builds a plane in his garage and plans to fly it. He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of Jane, an independent dying woman with a neurological disease that left her almost speechless and not very motivating. Wheelchair bound and witty, his last wish is to lose his virginity. She offers herself to Richard, who will not help him directly. but is willing to steal a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the act. I found this film ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and sympathy.
