During the initial broadcast of this video in 1984, my wife and I recorded the film on our very first VHS recorder. I still have this aging band that I try to watch every year. It was the year my first child was born, and seeing A Christmas Carol in this incarnation reminds me of good moments of happiness - many hours have been spent reading in the background of this film. I finally broke down this year and ordered a DVD, which prompted me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the film. The story of Charles Dickens is captured here in an exceptional way. George C. Scott is absolutely incredible and totally credible as Scrooge. The support cast is just as spectacular. This is, in my opinion, a flawless production. The small details add a lot to the joy. The game "similes" nephew and wife of Scrooge play with their guests at the party is a neat item. (I've since recreated it with my English high school students as a brief respite from class work!) Honestly, I can think of few ways to entertain myself during the holidays that I enjoy more than just indulging in that production of CBS, which was originally sponsored by IBM. (Incidentally, it's fun to watch the old tape with the original IBM ads ... showing how computers have evolved in 21 years ... amazing to see how things have changed!) In summary: A Christmas Carol is a timeless story, and this rendering is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, everyone!
