Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best witty comedies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is misunderstood because it lacks the values ​​of the "social commentary" that many films of the day (1969) required to be successful. <br /> <br /> The characters are exaggerated satires of ordinary people and all actors play them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Plummer shines brightly as Lord Foppington, a noble with hair too big to fit in the door. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the usual stuff of the 18th century; Wrong identities, upset romances, corrupt officials and jokes at every turn. <br /> <br /> He answers the following questions: what happens when 4 turbulent and eager sailors leave on leave in a small British coastal town? And with whom do they get involved and how does it happen? <br /> <br /> Despite his mediocre box office results, he has great costumes, great music (inspired by the musical Mermaid Theater of the same name). ), great, acting and sets that are obviously authentic. <br /> <br /> That it has never been released in VHS or DVD is really a shame because so many bad movies are out every day.
