This complicated story begins quite simply when an English journalist accepts the bet of Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood not to be able to spend a night in the haunted castle of Blackwood. Once there, the writer walks through the dusty corridors and halls, until the music and a glimpse of a couple of waltzers lead him into an empty room. He sits at the harpsichord and begins to play the melody he has heard. He is surprised to be hit on the shoulder by the incredible beauty of Elizabeth Blackwood. She informs him in a charming and strange way that she has prepared her room upstairs and that someone is still waiting for that night ... the night of the dead. Begins then a surprising series of supernatural events which disconcert the journalist all the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: It will probably not surprise viewers to learn that the beautiful Elizabeth is actually a ghost. This does not prevent him from falling in love with the journalist, but it makes their lives more difficult for them than for the average couple. It's a fun movie, with absolutely everything: ghosts, spooky castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence (though they've been toned down in the version most Americans have seen over the years.) is the main reason to see it. She has a strange charisma unlike everyone you've seen in the cinema. Recommended!
