At the risk of appearing a little sacrilegious, at first reading, I am rather inclined to put it on an equal footing with "Shaun of the Dead". Now, since I consider Simon Pegg as an indisputable comedy genius, I realize it's a pretty big claim. And how far you agree with this last statement can be a good preliminary indicator of the relevance of "Fido" for you. <br /> <br /> In a way, the comedy takes over where Shaun stopped, except that we are back in the small American town of stereotypical origin of the 1950s, time of the undead . The zombie wars are over and the zombies themselves become more useful and better adapted members of the community. We are informed from the start, largely thanks to the scientific progress made by the good people of Zomcom - a beautiful piece on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in its description of a respectable neighborhood that preserves the core values ​​while leaving room for zombies and the particular risks they represent. The charm and balance with which he operates are quite perfect. The themes that you can expect from a more traditional kitsch comedy are tackled: the polish of a clean and healthy lifestyle, the maintenance of the appearance, the repressed emotion, the confused parenting values, the social decorum and the tragic fate of the alienated individual. <br /> <br /> a story told with a happy heart and a wide appeal that comes alive in a striking way thanks to the strong distribution of the film. This is one of those works where it's really obvious that everyone involved had a great time participating. It's also fun to imagine what Billy Connelly had to learn from writing his screenplay ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion, so it's likely that you'll enjoy the humor of this movie unless your father is not trying to eat you.
