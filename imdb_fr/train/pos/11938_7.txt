I enjoy movies like this one for their minds, no pun intended. It's a decent and clean movie about a baseball team that's falling behind, and a young fan wants their win, since his dad, fool, said it was the only way he could come back. <br /> <br /> The spirit shines through in two ways: a fun distribution with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and celestial herald Al, in the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. It's an energetic film. It makes you smile and really involves you in the sport. <br /> <br /> That's where my problem lies. The only thing that bothers me a bit is these sports movies that turn you into an unconditional fan for the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I find it just strange to have to leave the film thinking that the Angels are a strong and cool team, while my basic loyalty, as it is, rests on the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, really. If it's just a movie about a team of underdog kids, then it's good.
