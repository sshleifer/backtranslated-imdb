"Footlight Parade" is one of the many wonderfully fantastic musicals that Warner Bros. produced in the early 1930s to ward off depression. "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were also produced at that time. They have literally inspired millions of Americans to forget about their problems for a while and have fun. <br /> The great talents of Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, only Foolight Parade had the incomparable James Cagney. Nearly ten years before his best-known musical, "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here, he dances in the most original dance styles, with his arms generally lowered at his side and his legs doing all sorts of ripples and kicks. It's easy to see that he's having fun, which makes us love him more. <br /> <br /> While almost all the musical sequences appear at the end of the film, they are well worth the wait. I think this film was shot just before the installation of the production code, so some costumes and scenes are a bit risky. But everything is in the fun. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film does not matter, know that there are many laughs and an exceptional casting. Besides those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is at his best, troubled here. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
