I could not help but comment after reading the very short comment "Not bad". This movie is a lot better than just not bad. The acting is stellar, even from the children of the cast, who do not play cute or anything else, but act as friends of my son. The film is intelligent and expects its audience to be so. The stories in double back flash are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than acting as a time filler. I watched this movie with my kids and watched it all alone a few days later. If you have children and are tired of seeing movies that inspire diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, check out "Holes." My 6 year old loved it as much as my 11 year old, and my husband and I enjoyed it as much as both. How many movies can you tell about this?
