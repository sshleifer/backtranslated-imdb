Child, I loved this game. I played a million times in the spring of 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how many times we played there, we never seemed to get bored. Then Streets of Rage 2 is out. And we quickly forgot that it even existed. <br /> <br /> You play the ex-cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who left the force to face the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to cross in a dilapidated and corrupt city run by the evil Mr X. Beat all the bad guys and the end boss is a lot of fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my favorite because you could throw bad guys in the holes of the river. You even have the chance to become Mr. X's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the "bad end" in which you become the boss of the union. The way this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the union when you go to Mr. X, but it is so. <br /> <br /> Streets of Rage also offers really fantastic music. Composer Yuzo Koshiro has done absolute miracles with the limited technology of Genesis Sega. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are remarkable tunes. <br /> <br /> As the owner of the Wii, I'm proud to have it forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it makes somehow the first a little outdated. <br /> <br /> For: <br /> <br /> Average graphics but beautiful backgrounds represented in a comic strip as a progression of the panel that corresponds to the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> > Great tunes. <br /> <br /> Easy to enter and hard to put on. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <Absolutely inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2. <br /> Poor AI enemy. The bad guys often get away from you instead of fighting. This is particularly infuriating for the level 5 boss. <br /> <br /> Lack of combos. <br /> <br /> Lack of decent weapons. <br /> <br /> Bad models are repeated far too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Sustainable Call B-
