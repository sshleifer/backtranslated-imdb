It's such a good movie! It does not matter the low note here. I really do not know where it comes from, so they have to discuss a different movie. Because I absolutely loved him and I found him a little hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> The story was so original and charming. I really do not see anything wrong with that. Maybe it must be "your kind of thing", but, I saw it with my sister and my mother, and we were all seduced. <br /> <br /> The acting game was also very good, and it's hard to do in a movie like this. But I found all the characters very intriguing and friendly. <br /> <br /> I always liked Dougray Scott and I found his new role "dark" very interesting. It's really awful to make me love a bad guy, but that did not really trouble me this time. Even more, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should absolutely go see this movie, no doubt! Anyone who wants to see a movie with 80% bloodshed should go and rent something else, but .. But I guess the title already gives it a kind. This is a love story, not Saw 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 stars out of five !!! Good work !!! <br /> <br /> xxx Enjoy!
