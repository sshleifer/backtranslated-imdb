I only saw this film once 25 years ago, and to this day, I've always told people that it was probably the best movie I've ever seen. Considering that there was no verbal dialogue and a dialogue of thought, I found the film exciting and I even found myself holding my breath to make no sound. I highly recommend this film, I would like it to be available on DVD.
