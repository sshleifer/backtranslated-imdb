Okay, before I review, I have to ask, why is not it individually? It may have been just a TV show in Italy, but for international Lamberto Bava fans, it's his own movie. In America, this film is distributed on VHS and DVD under the names "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know it has nothing to do with "Demons," except for one cast member and film crew. But yes, I was personally upset by the difficulty to find on this site, which is otherwise so useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, let's review "The Ogre". I have often seen the trailer on YouTube and honestly, I found it rather scary. The film itself (it's a feature film, which makes it a movie) has a lot of strengths and manages to scare you. The last act displeased me, but on the whole, I do not regret having bought the DVD before seeing it (available from Shriek Show). I suppose that the television origins of the film explain the last act. I will not reveal any spoilers. <br /> <br /> The plot is a little familiar: an American horror writer on vacation in an old castle with a husband and a son, to realize that it looked exactly like the nightmare of his childhood. There are faint echoes of "The Shining", but it is a different brand of supernatural horror. The woman (Virginia Bryant) finds more and more evidence that this is the real place of her nightmares, but her husband will not believe her. Great atmosphere and terror ensue. <br /> <br /> The multiple nightmarish sequences have been rather distressing. The Ogre cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a bit of Uncle Frank's resurrection of the first "Hellraiser". There are also some good shocks and a well done underwater scene. I give them props that the film has never yielded to imitating American movies with similar concepts, namely "A Nightmare on Elm Street". "The Ogre" is an original. And the monster itself was scary when it was presented correctly. <br /> <br /> On the DVD of Shriek Show, there is an interview with Lamberto Bava in which he takes care to mention that this is not part of his classic "" Demons ".He also gives a lot of credit to the real castle in which the film was shot.This parameter contributes a lot to the film, Simon Boswell's music also helps. <br /> <br /> There are many good things here. "The Ogre" is not perfect, but is worth the detour.Take it as a less beautiful achievement of Lamberto Bava.
