Director Otto Preminger recovers his stars Laura, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney, in this black and rough film: Where The Sidewalk Ends. This film is complete with a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected turns, intelligent dialogue and an attractive look with superb camera movements and black and grainy lighting. Dana Andrews plays detective Mark Dixon, both gangster and cop, who has the reputation of being too physically tough with criminals. After a case sees Dixon looking for suspects and answers, he gets involved much more than he would have liked. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is great in her role - tough and nervous, Andrews Dixon is ready to be caught off guard if they get on the wrong side. He's the perfect black anti-hero movie - he's not very nice all the time, but we still have it. Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role, although she is a soft shoulder for Dixon. Tierney's role may not be excessive, but it certainly goes beyond what others could do with this role, hitting all members of the audience with his kind smile, sweet air and sparkling eyes. The basic cast is not that bad either - Karl Malden being the most memorable, he starred and gave a good supporting performance as Lieutenant Thomas. Where The Sidewalk Ends is not Laura, it's a big black movie full of great characters, stories and photos.
