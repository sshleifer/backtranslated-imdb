I do not understand why the critics of this film are so bad to the universe, unless I just come out of my rocker. I found him sick, bright, twisted and psychologically sophisticated. You will not go deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie than this one. There are layers in the layers, a cast of actors nuanced by Stone and a scenario that will let you guess even after its end. People have to forget that Sharon Stone is 48 years old and Michael Douglas is not part of it. I predict that this film will be a huge hit on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to critical critics. Give yourself a shot, you might be happy to have done it!
