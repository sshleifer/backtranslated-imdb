I found this movie exciting from the start - as in a Spielberg movie - and the plot is intriguing as I try to understand the real situation. <br /> <br /> begin - before the opening credits - the action begins, bringing with it an immediate suspense. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very nice. (I have a hard time loving the Baldwin, because of Alec's extracurricular political activities, but William was not that bad in this film.) <br /> <br /> There were several very unexpected twists who contributed to the pleasure. <br /> <br /> There were unfortunately many places where there was a high-pitched sound in the soundtrack - something like 19K Hz. I suspect the microphone was capturing video monitors on the set.
