Carter Wong plays a noble hero in search of a healing book that leads him to seek ultimate revenge! The rhythm is good in this film and there are many fight scenes for the film to continue. The flying guillotines look nasty and the main villain has no problem using them. Although the story is not solid, the action is fun and brings you to the end (which, in my opinion, could have had a sequel). !!
