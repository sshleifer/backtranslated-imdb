Sometimes you have to look back to move forward. The 60s did that. We must remember the past. The past is part of the future. <br /> <br /> Excellent blend Gary J. Coppola. I see a big future. You deserve to be nominated and win the Best Mixer Award of the year 60. <br /> <br /> The best mini-series of all time. <br /> <br /> Thank you Ursula <br /> <br />
