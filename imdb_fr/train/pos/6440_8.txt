I never seem to write a review on IMDb unless I am extremely surprised to see how good or bad a movie is. This film enters the first category. Every year, I try to see all the nominees for Best Foreign Oscar Film, even those I do not like. "As It In In Heaven" seems to do the trick. The plot looks sweet, sentimental and slow .... For my tastes, which go rather to the original, dark and / or daring foreign cinema (Michael Haneke, Fran√ßois Ozon, A lot of Japanese / modern Korean cinema) "As It In In Heaven "does not seem particularly interesting ... It has not been marketed in the United States. So I sat down to watch a VCD I found in Singapore, ready to "wipe it off the list." After a boring debut, "As It In In Heaven" becomes this rare film where you get really inspired by what's happening on screen. Weaknesses: the characters in the film are pure "original" characters: the wounded dreamer, the city bully, the battered woman, the desire of a cowardly woman for love, the repressed minister ... Fortunately, they are mostly friendly, well written and well played. Ingela Olsson, as wife of Minister Inger, was nominated for an Oscar if her performance had been in English. Highlights: the music is beautiful and the main song, sung by Gabriella, is truly dramatic and memorable. And keep an eye on actress Olga, 87, who plays with dance steps and girls! I will not discuss the end, but I will say that makes sense. There are a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the movie, and you do not really know why they happen. Although nothing is explained with words, it all makes sense as the film turns into a crescendo. **** out of *****. Probably the most powerful Swedish movie I have ever seen.
