As I said in my commentary on the first part: These two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess. <br /> <br /> The scenario of the second film is not so moving as to see the destruction of human civilization, but the next day, thousands of refugees fleeing into tiny bins, protected by a single powerful spaceship . <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story heats up, postponing the battle to Planets Cylones. Okay, there's a bit of Mad Max because all they're fighting for is a fuel for their spacecraft to continue to the far-away land, but it works for me. It's an exciting sci-fi show featuring beautiful actors and decent special effects (though they tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-)). <br /> <br /> I would have liked a suite with Starbuck and Apollo on board. Instead, we had a second sequel, with no character names, which proved that the story had already worked, especially because the main characters were so well chosen ... <br /> <br /> Then congratulations for the productions of 1980, but Bravo for the two films of 1978.
