So I consider myself pretty big in the animated scene, with very few shows that I will NOT watch. <br /> <br /> This show, however, I would recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the most original series to date, she has pretty much everything I could ask for. A story parallel, so to speak, about an unconditional love that will NOT be admitted, a very flagrant comedy and a very well done distribution of dubbing (interpretation in both Japanese and American). <br /> <br /> If not for the terribly funny aspect, it would be, just another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I have noticed, a "like him or hate him", very few people I have seen present at this series will end with a disgust for her. <br /> <br /> Original at heart, with everything you could ask for one afternoon, bet the house on this series. I am ready to assure you that you will enjoy it.
