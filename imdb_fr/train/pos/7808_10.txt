It's a movie that everyone should watch. In addition to raising extremely important points (although South Africa is on the road to recovery, many countries are in similar situations at the moment), the direction is superbly focused, while Denzel Washington realizes, in my opinion, the best performance of his career so far. Kline also gives a good performance, although perhaps not as surprising as that of Washington. John Thaw also plays an important role as chief of police. <br /> <br /> There are many areas in which a film about apartheid could fall, but all these problems have been avoided. It would be easy to simply describe Whites as bad guys and Blacks as good ones, but Attenborough did not do it. Of course, there were some white characters that seemed fundamentally evil, such as the Captain during the Soweto uprising, but adding extra dimensions to all the characters would make the movie unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the film as it is, but I think it takes two and a half hours to tell the whole story because it's really amazing. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie is Steve Biko's funeral. When the whole crowd begins to sing the South African national anthem, it's probably one of the most moving scenes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie before, look at it. It may not be comfortable to watch, but it is certainly worth it.
