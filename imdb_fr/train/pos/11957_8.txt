Big Woody Allen? Good Woody Allen? Absolutely. I found myself, with the audience present, laughing and often in the best lines of Woody Allen that we have heard for a while. Aging Allen has created a proper role as "father" of Scarlett Johansson ... well, sort of. Some have said that Johansson plays "a young Dianne Keaton". I do not agree. She plays the dialogue of Woody who, in his comedies, always has a very similar feeling ... like a comedy by Woody Allen. It's good for us, the Woody appreciators. She certainly made Woody's dialogue much better than the young cast of her latest comedy, Melinda / Melinda. Woody's humor is sometimes boring for some, but for those of us who love it, we are waiting for the next one.
