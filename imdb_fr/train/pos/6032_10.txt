Antonioni really showed some "cojones" when he made this movie. He went to America to work under contract with the Most Sumptuous Studio (MGM) and made the most damning portrait of American society I have ever seen. Having seen LA first hand, here is the most accurate portrait of the overcrowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni had met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The subsequent burial of the studio is understandable, after such an investment and a dismal return. It is unfortunate that people do not see this film anymore, because I think Antonioioni was right. Here, he predicts the end of the hippie civil rights movement in American politics. Everyone is much more interested in what is in their pockets and in the constant expansion of living space in the inhospitable (yet magnificent) desert and beyond. I would love to see this film revived and a sumptuous DVD. <br /> <br /> Please look at Zabriskie Point with an open mind and heart. We have a truly unique film commenting on a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet and we have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected jewel.
