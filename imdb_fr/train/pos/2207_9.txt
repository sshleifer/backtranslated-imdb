This is not a bad word to say about this movie. At first, it did not impress me, but it quickly grew. I like that a lot and I find it unfortunate that many people do not understand the fact that it has been banned in some territories, mine being one of them. The film delivers in the department of shock, blood and atmosphere. The score is a beautiful piece of suspense. It just seems like Chris Young has become one of the best composers in the industry. The game in this film is of a high enough level, although a little wood in some places, and the effects are very real and grainy. All this praises a good slasher movie in my book. I noticed in some reviews that the film was seriously criticized by the shooter of the famous killer, P.O.V. And I ask: What's wrong with that ??? This is a classic shot that arouses fear in any good fan of the genre and is great to keep the identity of the secret killer. The only thing that keeps this movie from getting the best ratings in my book is that the surprise twist (killer revealed) is not handled more carefully, I mean it happens just fairly quickly, although the remarkable performance make it almost credible. Apart from that, PRANKS is an excellent movie (although I prefer the original title) and it's a pity that so many people are attacking it like a cheap shit. It's more than that, but not many people know it, because it seems to be lost in the haze of the slasher of the early 80s. What a pity ... It's a very good movie people! Believe me!
