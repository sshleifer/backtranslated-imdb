Legend of Dragoon is one of those little-known games that people love or hate. Some people claim that it's much too similar to other games, namely the Final Fantasy series - which is understandable because it was originally intended to be the equivalent of Sony's Final Fantasy. Honestly, I can not say more about the similarities, because I'm not very familiar with FF games. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of the game is the combat system. Not only do you have the ability to switch to a more powerful dragon form, but each time you attack, you must be careful to complete the attack by pressing the buttons at the right time. In addition, enemies may attack you in the middle of a sequence, which means that you have to press different buttons to avoid damage. Even the use of some attacking objects requires some maceration of pimples. If you do not want to attack, you can still protect yourself, which not only halves the damage, but also increases your health without the use of healing potions. <br /> <br /> VVMs are pretty good, about the same quality as Final Fantasy 8. However, graphics during the game are not quite up to scratch. They are nice, but they could have been - and honestly, should have been - better. The translation also leaves something to be desired. Not only does this raise interesting questions about character relationships, but there are also grammatical errors that simply should not have been allowed. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I found interesting is that you lose the main characters of the party - one dies and the other becomes virtually useless for the party and goes away. While the death of one of the characters is often considered irrelevant, it quickly makes you understand that the characters, although the heroes, are still as deadly as the next person. People who replace lost characters simply earn all their stats, so the transition game is relatively fluid. Maybe my only complaint about the characters is the love interest of the main character, Shana. She is the incarnation of the helpless woman who needs to be saved, pathetic to the point of pushing a player to scream in frustration. Although you can use it in your party, she is incredibly weak - I do not even know what her dragon powers look like, I hated her so much that I never used her. The character Rose, however, is probably my favorite female character in all games. She is not a wimp and her magic of dragons is extremely useful. Meru is also strong enough, although he is sometimes an annoying talkative kid. <br /> <br /> The character designers were, like most people, inclined to make the female characters look pretty or whatever, without thinking too much about it. to the real utility of the outfits. Seriously, no armor and having most of your exposed skin is not useful for fighting monsters. But I will give them accessories because they have women serving as knights in different countries. <br /> <br /> I can not say much about the plot, because, honestly, I did not pay much attention to it. where I had to go to the next. I do not know if that says a lot about the plot itself or my style of play. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very nice game. He has his flaws, but for me he has found the right balance between thinking, squeezing buttons and killing monsters.
