I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! How is it that I did not see this great film until three years after its release? It made me laugh, it made me cry and it really warmed my heart. Highligths. It's hard to describe in my rotten English - but I still have to try: <br /> <br /> The distribution is excellent in all cases - from the beginning to the secondary roles, the acting is great, the dialogues are excellent and the film is perfectly made and mounted. <br /> <br /> I think the Farrelly brothers' films are often underestimated - they're not light comedies - they're deeeeeep! They talk about what life is (I will not tell you!) <br /> <br /> In my case, this film told me what relationships are: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: Free them, let them be - try to share passion and pain and stay faithful to each other. <br /> <br /> I am not a sportsman, but an ignorant sportsman. . But in this movie, the vibrations touch you. I could feel the atmosphere of baseball. Finally, this film explained to me what being a sports fan can mean for you and which fan families should be present. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much, Pete and Bob! <br /> PS: If you have not seen it yet, visit KINGPIN!
