Why did not Dynamo have pants ?! Where did they go?? This has never been explained. That's why this movie was so great. Plus Starsky gave AIDS to his children !!!! Excellent game too. Richard Dawson deserved to win the best supporting actor! A I D S My favorite phrase in the movie was "That hit the spot". A I D S. This film was for "birds". I tried to give this movie the "stinkeye" but he kept playing. What am I doing wrong ??? !!!! I thought the "HATEBOAT" was funnnny lol;) I would like that for a show. Why did not Dynamo wear pants? I know his arm was skewered, but ... what's up with these future crazy nets. Why did not this type of family, Ray Combs, get a net? He could have used one. AIDSSSSS
