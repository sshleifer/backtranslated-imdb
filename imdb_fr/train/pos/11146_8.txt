A fascinating descendant about a potential scammer in New York forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled crook. An extremely grim examination of modern moral and social decline, extremely well directed by John Schlesinger (who never dominated his work here) and superbly interpreted by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. The packs are quite punchy overall, but the "fantastic" scenes - some of which are played with a muffled laugh - are slightly intrusive, as is the "mod" night on drugs. The relationship between the two men is sentimental, but the filmmakers are careful not to get confused, which gives the photo an advantage that it might not have had with a director smaller than Schlesinger. Originally ranked X in 1969 and winner of the Oscar for best film; Writer Waldo Salt (who adapted the book of James Leo Herilhy) and Schlesinger also won statues. *** 1/2 of ****
