Hard to classify the movie - maybe it's a cutting-edge spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut novel, and certainly one of her easiest novels to adapt to a feature film. The adaptation of the film is very faithful to the original book. The "independent" approach to producing this film is probably more effective than financing a big Hollywood studio. Nowadays, I doubt that a clever novel like Mother Night will get the green light from the big mills of Hollywood. And normally, it's a pity, but not in this case. Mother Night has a tight direction and a solid cast. Nick Nolte, who seems to have better roles as he ages, still has this "eternal" character that allows him to assume a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and brilliant as always. I always thought she deserved better than she came out of the entertainment industry. I suppose that debuting as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with little airtime is not the most chosen role, even if the TV series becomes a minor phenomenon. Anyway, this movie is totally enjoyable and you do not have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given the geopolitical realities of today, the premise of the novel may seem dated and some younger viewers unfamiliar with the story will be utterly bewildered by the events unfolding industrialized world in geography, history, and lord knows what other topics!).
