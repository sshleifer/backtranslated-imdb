Cross-Eyed is a very original and funny movie. I think Adam Jones brings refreshing new eyes to the comic genre and reinvents it in a good way. This film is smart, concise, entertaining and fun. As a writer / director, Jones totally controls his characters, both absurd and kind. History is definitely something you have not seen before and that is good. It's unique and fun, and combines visually fantastic elements and the long-lost slapstick genre into a comedy. <br /> <br /> A very promising first film.
