As everyone is well aware, South Africa has long suffered from the racist and vile oppression of apartheid, which has completely subjugated the black population. Steve Biko, murdered in prison, was one of the most famous anti-apartheid activists. After the murder, journalist Donald Woods sought to spread Biko's message to the world. <br /> <br /> In "Cry Freedom", Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before he is arrested, deceived. When Woods tries to get Biko's message across, he and his family start living under threat of attack, and they are eventually forced to flee the country. The last scene shows the police firing on protesters. <br /> <br /> "Cry Freedom" is one of two films (with "A World Apart") that galvanized the anti-apartheid movement. maybe the best job of all time.
