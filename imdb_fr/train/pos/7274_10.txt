No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencia's best performances to date. Mencia is known for stealing and mocking racial issues. However, he does more than that in this performance that took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencia's material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with today's society. <br /> <br /> In this one-hour performance, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration, women really mean when they demand equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion on Mel Gibson's passion for Christ and an argument he had with a woman about whether or not Jesus is affected and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally handicapped. Mencia even wonders if we should have the right to speak and tell a joke. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not afraid to take offense, which often causes him trouble with his critics. For example, he goes a bit far (and he admits) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and what he's probably doing in paradise right now. <br /> <br /> Mencia's main message in all its performances is that we all have a voice and we should use that voice to talk about how we feel and not be afraid to offend. He reminds us that we have the right to speak and that we must use this right as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you like this performance, I highly recommend you watch Mind of Mencia, its show on Comedy Central.
