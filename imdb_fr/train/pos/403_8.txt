I remember that the trailer of Legend of Zu was quite impressive and being a fan of A Man Called Hero (my favorite of all time), Storm Riders, I decided that I should also watch this one. I know there's a lot of criticism about Ekin Cheng's acting ability all over the world, but he's currently my favorite director in Hong Kong (way better than Nicolas Tse) and that's one of the factors that pleased me in this film. This film is undoubtedly a work of art from the beginning to the end. I even thought that only the actors were real and that everything else was computer generated at the end of the film. They had to put a lot of work into this one and they deserve a good credit for that. The story of the film was a fairy tale between good and bad with a love story (I guess Ekin Cheng pulls the girls easily). The story is not very intellectual and profound, but it's not what you expect when you watch an action movie. I wish there were more martial arts activities with fists and fists instead of fights with magical abilities, but hey, that's life and it never happens the way you want . And why did they look like supersonic planes in the battle across the sky in the end? It's so funny. Legend of Zu can not be a man called hero in my eyes, but it flows like a video game and it's not a bad thing at all. If a company decides to publish games on this movie, I will not be surprised because it contains all the elements of the video game. Good work. Please make more fantastic movies like this
