This could be a 10 if there was not enough predictable and Hollywood scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as a leading actor of our time (why not ask the lead role) and the rest of the cast is held at a very high level. I was personally impressed by Hugh O'Connor, who played Christy Brown as a child. The very first scene where I watched it was really strong. Sensational.
