In this film, the acting was superb, but mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa made it heartbreaking. It was good that the writer had isolated Boesman and Lena from those who were leaving their homes so that we could fully share their triumphs and their defeats; the conflicts they shared as they grew together and separately. It's worth seeing when you put the film in its proper context.
