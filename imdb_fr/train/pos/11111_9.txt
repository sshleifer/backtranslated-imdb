The Sopranos is perhaps the most incredible series you can ever watch. It's smart, it's weird, it's funny - and it's so well mafia-like that most people can not help but watch. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters, located in the underworld of crime families in New York. Most of the time, you really do not know if the sages are going to stab someone in the back or buy them lunch. <br /> <br /> The depth of their personalities adds to the realistic approach of the characters of this show. They are dangerous men, murderers for the most part, but by God if you do not love them too. I mocked their sarcasm, tore up when they made a mistake, and felt frightened by the ruthless brutality of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The suburban setting of New Jersey fits perfectly with the subtext of this show: people are not always what they seem to be, and the stark contrast between the monster and the actions taken by these apparently minor criminals weighs heavily again. the chances. <br /> <br /> If you have not done so already, you should do it absolutely.
