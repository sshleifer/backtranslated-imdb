Like a streetcar named DÃ©sir (also directed by Gadg on stage and on screen), Panic In The Streets describes a New Orleans in which its main claim to fame - the birthplace of jazz - does not even deserve a mention. It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and undoubtedly helped to establish him as the handsome actor he really was, rather than as a mere psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in a small, uncredited role as the morgue overseer, but the film is rich in talent and begins with Jack Palance (still referred to as Walter Jack Palance) under the local 'Big' name. followed by Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig, as well as Paul Douglas, the policeman both strong and solid as the cop, appear before the point of view of Dr. Widmark. It is a very enriching film especially since we are little seen. Catch him if you can.
