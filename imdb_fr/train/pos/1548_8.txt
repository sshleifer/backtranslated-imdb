Fortunately, not knowing anything about this movie, I was curious enough to record it on TV. And then the tape was exhausted just five minutes before the end! <br /> <br /> But I'm happy to have managed to get the most out of it because it's a very good spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and some foggy intrigues, but also very chilling and even daring moments. Since the year of production 1969, some slight lesbian nuances have had to raise a few eyebrows. Of course, this no longer surprises anyone and these scenes seem to be very well done. And it's not just because of George's two actresses. <br /> <br /> The gas attack seems to hit all viewers very hard, it's not surprising, and it certainly hit me. Very effective. In addition, the opposing viewpoints on both sides give the whole story more depth in the usual suspense and action. It's not just a heroic war tale from a victorious side, but shows what's behind the victory, good and bad. Well, this is a war affair, basically bad. <br /> <br /> For the fans of the composer Ennio Morricone, it is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching but never excessive. And I think I have to try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! Hopefully they will receive it soon on DVD so that I can have the whole movie in my collection and that more people become familiar with this little-known gem.
