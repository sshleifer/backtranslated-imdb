... when this movie proves so well that they are actually useless. <br /> <br /> Although few lines, it was a bit strange to see this movie, no submarines, in an unknown language. A friend of mine sent a VHS tape with a few sheets with all the lines translated into English. with his translation next to me, I started to look at this story (this is a story) and, from the first tune of the sibilant melody at the opening credits, I was stuck. the colors, this minimal actor (well, in most cases), absurd comedy, slapstick, thoughtful, beautiful ... with some other movies (Paris, Texas and Nenette and Boni), this one is able to talk to the heart from anyone - without words. Whenever you have the opportunity, see it. Whatever you do - do not miss it. It is a unique experience in life. Oh, play well, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and told a thousand times before - but rarely (ever?) Like that.
