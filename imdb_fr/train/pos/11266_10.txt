I recently looked at that, but when it started, I did not know at all what the concept was like or what the subject was ... in short, I did not know at all what it was. Was it a documentary? Was it a comic routine? Well, it was BOTH. <br /> <br /> It started a little slowly, but I think it was because I did not know what kind of program was watching. But that quickly absorbed me. The episode I watched made Robert Wuhl discuss facts and fiction in the story. Primarily how we (Americans) learn a story that is not really true - and how we learned what we did. He acted so as to entertain and interest the viewer. In fact, I have learned a number of things and it is a true indicator of the effectiveness of this type of program. <br /> <br /> I would really like this series to be taken over for HBO. I think it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are "taught" in the same way as this episode.
