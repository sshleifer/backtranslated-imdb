It's a good movie to do with your girlfriend. My friend and I love dancing and met this movie at the video store. We had to get it. Without violence and such a warm story, it's a fantastic movie to relax and just enjoy your night. I would recommend this movie to any family or group of girls looking for a cute movie.
