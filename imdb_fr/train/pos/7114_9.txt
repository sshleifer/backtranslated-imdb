Certainly in the top five of John Garfield's best films must be Pride of the Marines. This is the true story of the soldier of the Navy, Al Schmid, who at the price of his sight, while being wounded, resisted a horde of Japanese storming the Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story splits nicely into three parts, the family life of Al Schmid where he is a simple tough guy who starts to be serious with a woman and who likes nothing better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor is bombed and he goes to war like millions of others. <br /> <br /> The second part is at Guadalcanal and we are witnessing some of the action in which he finds himself in an isolated machine gun nest, holding back the Japanese troops. His action prevented the sea posts from being overwhelmed, but a grenade did it in his sight. <br /> <br /> And of course, the third part is his painful adaptation to civilian life and his assurance that people do not care about him. for pity's sake, especially the girl he saw Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This film was aired on MCT John Garfield's 95th birthday and a Garfield documentary was presented by his daughter. One of the interviewees stated that Garfield was the most credible actor of the working class roles in owning and holding a union card. <br /> <br /> In this respect, he was lucky enough to have landed at Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he continued to play gangster roles in the tradition of this studio, Garfield was great in these areas because of his past, because he was from the kind of life that Al Schmid had, with the exception of his Jewish origins. <br /> <br /> In this respect, he was perfect to play the role of a working class hero such as Al Schmid, who accepted the responsibility of defending his country. No superheroes here, just a guy who would have preferred to be back in Philadelphia, but was doing a job that needed to be done. <br /> <br /> It's a great match for Garfield. It's a film not to be missed. I wonder, however, what happened to the real Al Schmid.
