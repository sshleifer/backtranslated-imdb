The movie was not terrible. The book is better. But the movie was not so bad either. It was interesting to say the least. The plot was suspenseful enough that I could keep watching, although I would not say that the movie itself interested me. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are both pretty enough to make you look :) They have some cute scenes that should appeal to romantics. Overall, I would give the movie a 7 or an 8. It was not bad, just a little lack of wise plot.
