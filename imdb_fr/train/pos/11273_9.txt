A year after losing the magnificent Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) of his rival Tarzan, the hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to try again to win the heart of the brunette. Mixing work and pleasure, he also plans to seize the ivory elephant cemetery that lies beyond the escarpment of Mutia, the favorite terrain of Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Accompanied by his friend Martin Arlington, a man the size of a woman, and a group of people carriers, Harry finally arrives at its destination (after having avoided the death of the hands of 'wild natives and great howler screaming rocks' and discovers that Jane is still in love with her muscular yodel, and even worse, that Tarzan refuses to let the hunters take any ivory from the cemetery. <br /> <br /> The evil Arlington decides to solve the problem by ambushing and shooting the ape-man, then informing Jane and Holt that Tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. Of course, Tarzan is not dead - only hurt; After being cured by Cheetah (!), He returns to action just in time to rescue Jane from a tribe of vicious lion-eating savages who attacked Holt's expedition. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and his companion, the second film to portray Weismuller as a jungle man with few words, is often cited by fans as the best of the series; Although I prefer the original slightly, I can certainly understand the popularity of the film: it's damn sexy and there are excellent action sequences! The undeniable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is fabulous and gives rise to rather wet scenes. With the two stars wearing legendary outfits, spectators will be filled with a thousand eyes (despite the success of O'Sullivan A scene under the water being played by a double, the beautiful girl shows still a lot of skin, even threatening to make a "Sharon Stone" at some point, his loincloth pounding on one side!). <br /> <br /> The most exciting moments of the film are in the form of a magnificent underwater battle between Tarzan and a crocodile and the final spectacular where Jane is attacked by lions and natives, but is rescued by her step-son, her ape buddies and a load of elephants in lions crushing mode (once again, the violence is surprisingly sometimes unpleasant, although nothing is more shocking to me than the vicious pygmies and their gorillas of the first film). Cheetah also has his share of excitement, avoiding rhinos, fangs and big cats, riding Tarzan's back as he crosses a river, and even jumping on an ostrich for a ride. <br /> <br /> Like his predecessor, Tarzan And His Mate suffers slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing props - sneaky projection, some derisory monkey costumes, several Indian elephants posing as their African cousins and swings badly disguised trapeze - but that should not spoil your pleasure. of this very entertaining film. On the contrary, they make the game even more fun! <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
