Starfucker (who reads Starstruck on my box) is the most incredible movie I have ever seen. I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. So why not a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look on a dark side of Hollywood. I forced a few others to watch the film and they all agreed that it was an exceptional film.
