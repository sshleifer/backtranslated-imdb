My favorite horror movie. From the first long tracking shot to the final scenario, it's Carpenter's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> On Halloween night 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. In 1978, Michael escapes from the sanatorium of Smith's Grove. On Halloween night, Michael is back home to murder again. <br /> <br /> The story is perfectly simple, Michael tracks down and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It is the almost invasive atmosphere of Carpenter's terror that generates tension. Like all great horror movies, events are telegraphed long beforehand, but they always seem to happen at random, never leaving the public time to guess the film. <br /> <br /> The dark light, the long-cams, and (most importantly) this damn music creates the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have not seen in the film yet. There is a number of bodies, but compared to the multitude of slashers after that, it is quite small. This and most murders are almost bloodless. Fear is not in death, but in not knowing. <br /> <br /> The acting game is a good deal. PJ Soles provides much of the limited humor of the movies (and one of the best dead), Nancy Loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. At first, her performance seems timid and uninsured, but you quickly realize that she is perfect for the character who is shy and uninsured, and who is not at all prepared for what she has to face. And of course, Donald Pleasence, perfectly embodied by Dr. Sam Loomis, determined (maybe a bit unstable). Rest in peace, Mr. Pleasence. <br /> <br /> If the film has a prejudicial fault, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film so many years ago, countless clones, copies, scams and imitators have arrived and stolen (usually badly) the best pieces of the film until almost everything has become familiar. Combined with changes in public expectations and appetites, much of the raw power of diluted films is found. To truly appreciate it nowadays, it must be considered as it once was, as something unique. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I have no reservations to highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. Best regard. <br /> <br /> 10/10
