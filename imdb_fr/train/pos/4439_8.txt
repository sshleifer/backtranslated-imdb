Successful horror novelist Cheryl (a solid and friendly performance of the charming Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (the friendly Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (beautifully performed by Patrizio Vinci) visit an isolated castle located at the summer vacation campaign. Local legend claims that the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a scary, furry and nasty ogre (David Flosi in hideous ugly costume) living in the basement. Cheryl must overcome her fear of the beast, deeply rooted in her childhood, to overcome the false find. The director and co-author Lamberto Bava does an expert job to create and maintain a disturbing and disturbing nightmare mood. In addition, Bava avoids the usual routine of the film of fear of blood and thunders in favor of creating a compelling and provocative fairy tale of dark adult fairy tales on the best way to overcome what scares us, it is to confront said source. Sabrina Ferilli in the role of Anna, Stefania Montorsi in the role of the guardian Maria and Alex Serra in the role of Dario. The brilliant cinematography of Gianfranco Transunto offers some fluid shots and a lot of atmospheric light. Fabrizio Sforza's crazy makeup, Simon Boswell's phantasmagorical and phantasmagorical score, and the dark, dark cellar covered with cobwebs all touched the skin. It's worth watching.
