I watch movies for a living, choosing those that are good enough to be distributed ... Throw aside those who do not make the cut. I'm not saying any more than anyone else on this topic, I'm just explaining how I managed to watch "The Gospel of Lou" ... Anyway ... So many bad movies are landing on my desk and I sit across each of them. In fact, I do not "watch" everything, usually I watch TV from time to time while I work on the production value, performance and quality of the presentation of the story. If anything catches my attention, I will take the time to look at it. "Lou" attracted me for the first few minutes when I closed my laptop and chair on TV so I could listen to it completely. Needless to say, I was captivated throughout the movie. The story is well told, the characters are endearing or repulsive (depending on the intention of the actor and the director for the character) and all very well played. Sometimes, I sometimes notice amateurish mistakes in camera work and editing, but the emotional nature of the story makes these mistakes easy to dismiss. I've heard comments from other people that the film sometimes brought tears to their eyes, sometimes extreme exaltation ... I laughed for a minute and cried the next and I was incredibly touched by this film. Unfortunately, I could not buy it because I was, as the saying goes, a week late and a dollar less. That's how it happens sometimes ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this one and can not wait to see what kind of response it would get. Good luck and good luck to you Bret Carr (if you are reading this), you are definitely a talent to watch.
