In this first episode of Friends, we present the 6 main characters in the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and possibly Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We discover that Rachel, a rich girl who has been Monica's friend since high school, has left her fianc√©, Barry, at the altar, since she has discovered that she does not did not like. She also decides to live with Monica and become independent of her father, getting a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. <br /> <br /> For his part, Ross discovered that his wife was a lesbian and lost her to Susan, his partner. (We see him moving to a new apartment during the episode) <br /> <br /> Monica, in this episode, discusses (and ends up sleeping) with Paul "the wine guy", who gave him the excuse to be helpless. since he divorced his wife. But in reality, he was cheating on her. <br /> <br /> Ps: I love the haircut of Joey and Chandler in this first season! =)
