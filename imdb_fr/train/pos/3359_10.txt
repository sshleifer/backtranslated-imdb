Una giornata particolare is a film that has brilliantly used closed spaces. It is in these empty and dull spaces that the public sees the emotional turmoil and turbulent outbursts of the two main characters of Ettore Scola.Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two decide to meet for brief moments in their apathetic life. It is the element of sadness associated with the story that makes people believe that they will take sides with characters close to them. All men would be very sorry for the character of Sophia Loren. All women would surely cry their heart in front of the Marcello Mastroianni's existential situation. Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this dark and poignant film. Most characters are struggling with problems related to their own sexualities. Una giornata particolare can not be called gay movie pro although it has been beautifully portrayed that a homosexual man mixes well with women. It is a film for which the Italian director Ettore Scola has elaborated a pretty good mix of facts and fiction. His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed the destiny of ordinary Italians. A word about the courageous character interpreted magnificently by the great Marcello Mastroianni.He acts like a real man does not pray for pity.He happily accepts his destiny and prepares to face the worst moments of his short but significant life. A true masterpiece of cinema !!!
