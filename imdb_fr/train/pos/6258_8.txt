They probably could have missed the beginning - I do not know why it started in the Asian part of Turkey. If it was because they were leaving the Mediterranean, they could have approached modern Lebanon. <br /> <br /> One of the cameras and teams heading to the Bakhtyari tribe is the start of an incredible 48-day journey. 50,000 people, with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses, make this incredible hike through what appears to be a very fast Karun River. They use rafts that are kept afloat by inflating goat skins - you can see where the head and legs have been removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep - I suppose a 60 degree rise would be necessary. <br /> <br /> Just watching this was amazing, but there was a lot more to come. To get to the pastures, they also had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. Being able to climb this mountain was pretty incredible in itself, but they (and all the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of this documentary is that some titles titles are not very humorous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary from the era of silence, or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only has to face, but overcome. This is just an incredible document from a little-known group of people facing all kinds of challenges.
