One of the best (if not the best) projection of Stephen King. Dark as dark can be, surprising non-Hollywood end, terrifying atmosphere, incredible book adaptation, exceptional casting, educational (do not play with the afterlife), in short, all that a good horror should be ... br /> <br /> My favorite horror movie, straight 10+.
