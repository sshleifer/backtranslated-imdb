But it's a big martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang ranks first as a combat choreographer, only Sammo Hung at his best. This is clear from his proud display of technique - rather than flashy camera angles, etc. - during fights. The direction is tightly controlled not only to excite the viewer with speed and movement, but also to amaze the viewer with the precision she demonstrates. This film also benefits from Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance at the banquet scene with which the film begins is one of the highlights of the kung-fu film's history. Liu is supported by the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung (from My Young Auntie) and 'Hsiao Hou', whose acrobatics are breathtaking and preferable to anything wired. but with character and moral development along the way, and a very appropriate resolution. Humor is also among the best. If you only watch one kung-fu movie, it would be a good choice - it contains everything.
