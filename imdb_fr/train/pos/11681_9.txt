Most of the reviews and comments I've read about this movie say it's a rather outdated movie and a performance by Clara Bow. Although the screenplay was rather typical of Clara's later silences, I still find it quite moving and incredibly entertaining. Clara plays a playful Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves ... too bad for the marriage of this man! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but I think it lends itself to the sweetness and overall enjoyment of the film. Although this is certainly not a brilliant story (quite typical, in fact), this film is a beautiful showcase of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
