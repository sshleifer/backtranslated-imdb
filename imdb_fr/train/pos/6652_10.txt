I saw the movie and I really could not stop my tears. It is tragic that India no longer has leaders after freedom, who dare to do justice to their own children, when they do not behave properly. In the current generation, politicians are introducing their children into politics without measuring their caliber and skills. I remember. Gandhi's dialogue "What kind of society do we want to create / create with such people (about Harilal)?" It is no wonder that it is a dream that India will hardly have such a leader in this generation or the next generation. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi: "After 50 years, it would be hard to believe that such a person with a body, a Gandhi) has ever lived on this earth. I sincerely wish THANK YOU to Anil Kapoor, Feroze Khan and all the movie actors / actresses for this fantastic movie about a great person and his relationship with his son. All fathers and sons must watch this movie once and take lessons for both roles.
