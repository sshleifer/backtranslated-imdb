The thief from Baghdad is one of my ten favorite movies. It's exciting without gore, it's beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless. The casting could not have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in geniuses. And the incarnation of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> .. I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and I do not get tired of it. This movie is an adventure for all ages ... no too old to enjoy. The thief from Bahgdad recalls my memories in a more innocent era ... I was ten years old the first time I saw him and the United States was about to enter the Second World War. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to pursue this underlying "evil spell" a few years later in "Casablanca". And I think Korda collaborated again with Justin and Dupree in "The Four Feathers" ... an excellent filmmaking!
