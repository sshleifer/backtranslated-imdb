Having not seen the movies before (and could not stand Matt Damon), I was reluctant to go to The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see him for AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that even a film with Damon could be nice. <br /> <br /> Fast fighting scenes, crazy motorcycle chases and BIG explosions are what have thrown you out of your seat in TBU. The near-incidents between the CIA and Bourne kept you on tiptoe and had fun. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, several things really shredded my cheese. <br /> <br /> First, the fact that the movie was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence became repetitive and finally dull. Although Damon entertained us and still seems to have a head start on the CIA, I was getting a little annoyed by Bourne's constant survival. He crushed a car and came out as if he had hit it or something! Very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> And secondly (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA. It was so fragile that it was completely perceptible and all the people who were going to see it in my class (even the tutors) were seasick. The tutors told us that if we used this in a movie we had done in class, it would be automatically wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. Well enough if Greengrass wanted us to look at Damon and Stiles holding a conversation, but we would not shake our heads so violently! <br /> <br /> But overall, TBU is a nice movie. and worth the trip. But I did not think it was the best movie of the year, when it was an entertaining film. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
