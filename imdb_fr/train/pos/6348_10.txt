Jim Carrey is good, as usual, and although there are some "Jim Carrey Moments", it's certainly not a "Jim Carrey movie". <br /> <br /> It mainly targets children and I managed to enjoy it as such film. He was promoted to Israel as another film by Jim Carrey, so those who expected a strange comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has nice moments and works well as a children's movie. I can not say that I loved this movie, but again I'm not his target audience!
