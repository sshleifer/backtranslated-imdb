*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Filled with memorable moments (like the quote above, immortalized by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four guys who made a trip into the wilds to do Rafting and get away from the big city for a while to find that their pleasure quickly takes a bad turn. It's not a Hollywood movie. There is virtually no special effect, the setting is extremely realistic and nothing is covered with sugar or looks pretty. City dwellers resemble city dwellers, and even the tough Louis, accurately described by Burt Reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of nature on this trip. This is a perfect example of a simulation movie. And if some friends were rafting in an area of ​​the forest that none of them knew and ended up trying desperately to avoid being tried and sentenced for murders they had been forced to commit to save their lives. own life? <BR /> <br /> There is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with the structure of society and classes and the relationship (or lack of relationship) between rural and urban populations. When the four guys arrive in the woods at the beginning of the movie, they clearly do not know how to interact with the people who live there and they talk to them as if they do not know if they would understand or be able to communicate. This communication block is illustrated in the most memorable way in the scene of the banjoes duel, in which they try to refuel in the car and truck and find someone to drive the vehicles downstream. While Drew and the obviously inconsistent and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are fighting with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the movie), Louis has some difficulty buying gas, and Bobby makes a comment on genetic deficiencies. . how pathetic When the boy turns away from Drew, who offered to shake his hand after their great jam, Bobby tells him to give the child a few dollars, knowing that none of them really know how to react. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing we see in Deliverance that installs a lot of the tension that will follow. This big scene where there was a lot of fun (including the funniest scene of "redneck dancing" until O Brother, Where Art Thou?) Ends with an indescribable embarrassment about what to do around each other. These people are apples and oranges and they live according to completely different rules of life. The people that Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed meet in the hills have grown up, separated from modern society and modern laws, and live by the rules of nature, who do not understand that you will not kill. Confused by their clumsy behavior, the four friends embarked in the river, hoping that the strangeness would end and that the adventure would begin. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) When they are briefly separated from each other, Ed and Bobby run in the hills by the river which quickly turns into a nuisance. Uncertainty about how these people live - which has been established by the scene above - comes into play to create as much tension as possible during the scene. I think a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the movie, namely assaults and murders, takes very little time on the screen but remains one of the most memorabilia of the film. There is no gratuitous violence here, everything is for obvious purpose and produces a surprisingly powerful effect. <br /> <br /> This is the violent confrontation of two very different types of people and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other. The descent into the rest of the river after the assault, which occupies most of the film, provides a spectacular and effective tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat without bombarding you with so many events that you become numb. It's amazingly effective when we discover that Ed might have killed the bad man up there on the cliff and that the tension in the film does not even weaken when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river. because they provide a dubious explanation to the police about what happened on the river and about the disappearance of the MP's brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> This is a very disturbing film that testifies to its success, because it is quite obvious that a film like this one is meant to shake people up a bit. Hillbillies are the human (ie more realistic) version of the subhuman rednecks seen in childish but rather similar films like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, which can never be compared to a timeless film like Deliverance . When we follow these four men throughout their fateful weekend in the woods, the natural element is so real and we know them so well and in such a subtle way that it's almost as if, as 'members of the public, we fifth member of the team. It is not often that a film is able to present itself in this way.
