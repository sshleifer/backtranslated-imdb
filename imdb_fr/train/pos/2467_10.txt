Why did not it take a bag full of Oscars? This is an astonishing interpretation of a play often filmed / performed. The visuals are breathtaking (especially in widescreen ... pan & scan really kills the wonderful cinematography and scenery of this film). Each frame is a painting. Amazing. The play is almost intact and Branagh's passion for it is evident from the opening titles. No Zefferelli here, just a good story, as only the film can do, but rarely. Jacobi is particularly perfect as Hamlet's murderer: he does not play it like a wicked mustache bandit, but as a charming politician, allowing us to see why only Hamlet suspects a foul act. Branagh also points out the subtlety of the line between Hamlet's real madness / madness and the fiery revenge in him. And the many cameos come well, from Billy Crystal to Robin Depend through Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, discreet if you are sucked by the vision of Branagh as I was. A fascinating piece.
