There seems to be only two types of criticism of this film on the net. Those who hate him and curse the name of Ralph Bakshis and those who love him adore the work of genius. I am inclined to be in the middle. I have to accept most of the critics of this film (eg, the cruel depiction of the story, the badly rotoscoped characters, the acting, etc.), but despite that, I still love this movie . Rotoscopy (when done correctly) adds a strange and realistic dimension to the characters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic. The surreal scenes where the nineriders pursue Frodo are elegant and well executed, and the musical score ... magical. Unfortunately, the negatives are higher than those of the film, but if you manage to ignore them, it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> (No doubt I'll be lynched by an angry mob that hates this movie after writing this review, oh well, this is life)
