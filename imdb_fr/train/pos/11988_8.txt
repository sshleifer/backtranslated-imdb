I watched this show when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I remember it only vaguely. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I vaguely remember are the opening sequence and the theme song. On top of that, everyone was ideally thrown. In addition, the writing was very strong. The performances were also excellent. I hope a network will bring it back so I can see each episode. Before closing, I would like to say that I will always remember this program in my memory, even though I do not think I have seen all the episodes. In conclusion, if a network brings him back, I hope that you will catch him one day before his final disappearance.
