Rather annoying that critics continue to compare this to planet Earth ... Of course, planet Earth is better - it has much more of the same. Earth is like a long trailer for the Planet Earth series and, as such, is inevitably inferior and simplified. But it's not comparing what's similar. <br /> <br /> As a feature-length documentary (or even feature-length film), it goes well beyond anything you'll see in your life (unless you choose to cross the Earth in helicopters with long-range cameras during years and wait for months in the most extreme environments to glimpse the most extraordinary beings of the Earth, which - let's face it - is improbable). <br /> <br /> About storytelling: yes, everyone in the UK - very well myself - loves David Attenborough, and there is hardly any excuse for him not to tell here but that hardly deserves to overturn a star or three. He was not a presenter on Planet Earth, but a narrator, and I'm sure he's modest and kind enough to realize that anything that can attract more viewers is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by his admiration, majesty and glory. All critics agree on that. Those who love it (ie everyone) will / should see a planet buy. So, three congratulations for its release in the cinema, and a big boom for those who have enough to buy it on DVD rather than the box Planet Earth. But as works of art, they are not competing here, people. <br /> <br /> The Earth is big enough for both.
