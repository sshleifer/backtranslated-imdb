The first was good and original. I was a horror / comedy movie not bad. So I heard that a second film was shot and I had to watch it. <br /> <br /> What really makes the film so successful is Judd Nelson's character and his sometimes intelligent storyline. A very good scenario for a person who wrote the films of Final Destination and the direction was correct. There are sometimes scenes where it seems that the film was filmed using a grainy-looking domestic video camera. <br /> <br /> Excellent film made for television. It was worth renting and probably buying to get that strange feeling and watching Judd Nelson's Stanley do what he does best. <br /> <br /> I suggest to newcomers to look first before looking at the rest, just get an idea of ​​what Stanley is and get some history.
