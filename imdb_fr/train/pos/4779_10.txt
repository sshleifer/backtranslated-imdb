On paper, this movie would sound incredibly boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man traveling in the country with a riding mower is not very attractive, but the real power behind the film is its charm and intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a film so successful than "The Straight Story". <br /> <br /> The perfect example is a scene in which Alvin meets a teenage girl on the run. She is pregnant and is afraid of what her parents would do if they found out. Alvin tells him a story about his own children a long time ago. He asked each of them to take a stick and break it, which they could easily do. Then he asked them to gather the sticks and try to break them. "This package," he said, "is the family." So many other films would feel compelled to go on and make sure we knew an individual could be broken, but together the members were stronger. "The Straight Story" realizes that we are smart enough to understand this and just let us contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Alvin's journey through Iowa is full of this refreshing, non-Hollywood character. the interactions. Each interaction is full of warmth and humor. Alvin is so cute with his clipper that we can not help but smile as he travels to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who has had a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story is not the destination, but the journey. It's a journey in which Alvin shares his life with all the people he meets - to their advantage and to ours. It's a slow, easy and relaxing journey that recalls all that we've lost with America's urbanization. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is the rare "G" live-action movie that really should not be missed.
