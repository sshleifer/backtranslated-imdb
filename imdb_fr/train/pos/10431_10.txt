I do not even know what to say about this movie. it's one of the few films ever made that I would consider romantic. trying to talk about intrigue, performance or technical details about this film would be in Frank Zappa's words "like dancing on architecture". he absolutely strikes the right nail in the way he captures those fleeting moments of life that move us and then flee us to never be lived again. it looks like the movie that Charlie Kaufman's character version in the movie Adaptation wanted to write. the end is left open and ambiguous, no happy ending here, just a mystery. no deep life lesson, just a couple of excited and intelligent kids exploring the possibility of feeling the most irrational and unrealistic feelings ...... romantic love. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 look at it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger ................
