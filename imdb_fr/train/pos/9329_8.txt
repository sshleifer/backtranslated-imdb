I saw The Perfect Son about three times. I do not see how this film is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I do not see it as a gay movie. It's a movie with a gay character, I do not see why every movie with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay. I think the film is conducive to the study of death, the death of a parent. I think Theo changes his life fairly quickly after his re-education because he wants to, and his brother dying in front of him forces him to reevaluate his life. I found the dialogue in the scene when Theo tells Ryan that he will become a very moving father. Ryan says he does not want to know what he will never see or share with anyone. Is not it horrible and sad? I highly recommend the movie.
