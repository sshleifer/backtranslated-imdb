I read Nancy Drew as a teenager and pick up the books as an adult. I loved the effect used at the end (and a little at the beginning) of the film where the line drawings in the style of the books were transformed into scenes of the film. It was an elegant way of highlighting the links between the situations in the film and the books. For example, the scenes with the Oriental antique dealer were reminiscent of the scenarios I remember from the books. I thought Ned was perfectly cast and Emma Roberts was a wonderful interpretation of Nancy Drew in the 21st century. (Just like Betty Crocker's photo, she keeps up to date!)
