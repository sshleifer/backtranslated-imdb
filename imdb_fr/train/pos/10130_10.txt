The pilot is extremely well done. He explains how the characters bind during the next episodes. I think no one could have created a better driver for this show. He demonstrates remarkable creativity on the part of the authors. Although not all settled for the moment because it was the very first episode, many events occurring in future seasons were highlighted in the pilot project. An example would be the future relationship between Ross and Rachels. Even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared, she was defeated by an incredible plot and an exceptional casting choice. Bravo. <br /> <br /> An excellent start to an unbeatable comedy!
