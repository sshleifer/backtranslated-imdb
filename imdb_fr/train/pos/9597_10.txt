It is a documentary film to see absolutely for all those who fear that modern youth no longer loses the taste of adventure and the sense of morality. Darius Goes West is an incredible roller coaster. We live the life of Darius and his team as they embark on the journey of their lives. Darius has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a condition that affects all muscles in his body. He is confined to a wheelchair and needs constant attention. So how could this crew of young friends possibly succeed in taking him back and forth 6,000 km to the west coast? Watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure - laugh and cry with the team that faces unimaginable challenges along the way, and enjoy the final triumph when they return three weeks later to their hometown for a lovely reception and nice surprises!
