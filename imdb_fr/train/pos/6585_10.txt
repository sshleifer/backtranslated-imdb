After seeing Jeremy Brett in the role of Sherlock Holmes, no actor should pretend to think that he could ever come close to Mr. Brett's portrayal of "one of the most interesting characters in Literature". Jeremy Brett IS Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion, there can be no other. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I must admit, very close, but remains second. One could argue that Mr. Rathbone's scenarios were inferior to the absolutely exceptional productions offered to Mr. Brett, and I agree with that. However, when all is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always be and forever the only actor to truly "become" Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this subject and we, the public, have taken advantage of Mr.Brett's unique performances. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
