I know I know it was a good ending, but honestly it was great. I love it when a film ends on a dreadful black nature but this time I was impressed by the reversal of Darth Vader against the emperor. I really was amazed. The agonizing sequence in this film took place when Luke was tortured and defeated by the Emperor / Dark Sidious. It is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith, eliminates his master of darkness. A beautiful sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised by all the ships of rebel fighting ships and all Imperial warships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they presented on screen, the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (Lando's co-pilot) and many more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in this film: 1-When Vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda, then Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the biggest stage of Star Wars) appears. 3- When LEIA kills Jabba by strangling the crime lord Hutt. <br /> Personally, I like the scenario and the battle of Endor which presents a terrestrial and space combat, as well as the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. PS: The scenes with Leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.
