Man, I really like the new DVD that Universal has released. I have never seen THE SENTINEL so beautiful for years that I have to endure poor quality VHS tapes. Unfortunately, there are no extras beyond a caravan that seems much more worn out. And avoid the Goodtimes DVD at all costs. That sucks. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the troubled model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) settles in the haunted New York Brownstone, but is more than haunted. It is also a gateway to hell and the Vatican is asking an old blind priest (John Carradine) to watch him and make sure the demons and arch-angels do not escape. <br /> <br /> The group's stars include old-fashioned actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc., as well as 1980s star stars, including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum. mysteriously covered) and Tom Berenger. And you will not even recognize Jerry Orbach from Law & Order. I had to make a double take when I did not know where I had seen it before. <br /> <br /> Pretty scenes gores Alison cutting the eye and the nose of the rotten corpse of his deceased father, possessed by the devil. And there is a definite end when disfigured and deformed people try to haunt Alison who commits suicide, so she will not be next to guard the portal. It seems that Alison's troubled past makes her a prime candidate for the Vatican to become the next sentinel. <br /> <br /> A clever 70s classic, scary, director Michael Winner not to be missed. I also recommended it to those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teen slashers and horror. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> -
