Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. In retrospect, Crowe's scenario is much more precise and more elaborate than Amenabar's. The Spanish filmmaker should have the merit of having thought of the story first, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved - even if only slightly. Note that you have no idea what the leader did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean by more "stuffed".
