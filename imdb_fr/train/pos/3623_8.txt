Disney could be on something here. First, they had "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a story based on truth involving sport and a small town in Central America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie ... yet another sport story based on the truth. <br /> <br /> Both films sometimes move you to tears, and you both smile and feel warm after seeing them. My wife and I attended The Rookie and we expected it to be a good movie type to feel good about. We were not let down, when we were asked if we would buy this on DVD when it comes out, it was obvious. Certainly.
