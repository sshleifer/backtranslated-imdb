This film has a lot of strengths. He owns one of the best horror casts outside the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, as well as leading man Melvyn Douglas. It contains all the necessary ingredients: bats, a castle with many stone staircases, a mad scientist, city-dwellers brandishing torches and chasing vampires, a "Igor" character, a beautiful girl, even a Burgomeister to madness. The work of the camera with soft focus is dark and imaginative. There is even a good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the scenario. <br /> <br /> But it's not really a movie of monsters because there is nothing supernatural in "Kleinschloss" ("little castle"). The plot revolves around the crazy generic scientist (well played by Atwill) who values ​​his work more than human life. <br /> <br /> This is not a prominent material, due to a stubborn resolution of the plot and some embarrassing dialogues for Dwight Frye. But it's worth going to see if you like horror images in black and white.
