It's time for Gunga Din to be released on DVD. I can not say exactly how many times I have watched this movie but I do not get tired of it. The main actors worked so well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. <br /> <br /> I simply can not overcome their exploits in India. Your first glimpse of the three sergeants is when you see them engaged in battles with other soldiers about a so-called treasure map. The three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened at the line of communication and they enter a city virtually deserted, or at least they think so. <br /> <br /> They undertake the necessary repairs and soon find some "residents" in secret. Shortly after, they are attacked by a group of lunatics and hardly make a return to the base. <br /> <br /> They are then sent on another mission which gives Sgt Cutter the opportunity to go in search of gold with Din. They find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil Kali supporters. Din is sent for help and Cutter is captured. Soon McChesney and Ballentine arrive with Din and they are too captured. <br /> <br /> Faced with their death, they look helplessly at the arrival of their regiment to come to their rescue. The perpetrators watch and are about to launch their surprise attack when an injured Din rises on the golden dome and blows his bugle which then warns the British of the ambush. In doing so, Din is shot. <br /> <br /> Soldiers attack the wicked and defeat them quickly. In the end, Din is honored because he is appointed honorary corporal of the British army.
