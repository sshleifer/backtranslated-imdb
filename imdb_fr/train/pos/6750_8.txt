It's a very well done film, meticulously done and with an excellent character game that is sometimes very moving - for example, the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife. The plot is elaborated in a convincing and exciting way. The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the hero's life. It is clearly stated that the cops are as rough and ready as the characters in the underworld. <br /> <br /> Some small reservations: I found the end slightly unilateral, because it celebrates the successful integration of the hero into the police and justice, which dispel the ambiguity of the characters of the police who been maintained to this point. I also found the main female character a little weak: hardly if it was only a catalyst for the salvation of the hero, all she seems to do is cry and faint while the hard to argue.
