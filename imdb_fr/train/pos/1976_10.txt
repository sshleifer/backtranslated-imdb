The man who directed "The Third Man" also directed the sequence "Who will buy" in "Oliver!" Now it's talent. <br /> <br /> I lift my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know that "second units" are involved, but it is ... <br /> <br /> And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> <br /> I guess the quality will be at the rendezvous. <br /> <br /> (This is seen in the final scene with Nancy [avoiding spoiler - everyone has to see Oliver for the first time from time to time].) How many lines do I type. <br /> <br /> Encouraging people to binge too much should not be encouraged. <br /> <I hope this counts as the "10th line".
