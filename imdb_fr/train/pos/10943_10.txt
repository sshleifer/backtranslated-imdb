I have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she sees this criticism, that she has pity on me, that she brings me to Hollywood and that she implicates me in her strange and funny world. But seriously, it was good. The first episode is obviously to find his feet, but there is this strangeness of Silverman that crosses it. It's not a kind of comedy to laugh loudly, but it's a good thing, too much has a laughter, and it would not be fair with hints to laugh, it's up to the public to hear their buffoon inside make fun of the absurdity of it all. I can easily see this as bizarro Drew Carey's show with its strange characters and incredibly strong central character. Worth the detour, look forward to the following episodes. A very good chance of the usual comedy there. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call me....
