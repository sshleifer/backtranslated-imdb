I first discovered Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1940) by Alexander Korda, in the early 1950s, during a reissue titled "The Wonderful Show of the Century!" The films of Korda Technicolor, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were broadcast as part of a program never to forget. Miklos Rozsa's music reinforced both films. The Technicolor in everyone was incredibly beautiful! The thief from Baghdad remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. Over the years, it became increasingly difficult to appreciate the color of the film as it was originally presented. True Technicolor ceded the Eastman Color process in the mid-1950s. Kino and Samuel Goldwyn both re-released the film indoors and on video. But Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and lessened the dynamism of the original Technicolor. The Laser Disc version of this title also has the pastel look - nice, but not as it should be. NOW comes the DVD number M-G-M (December 3, 2002). THE THIEF OF BAGDAD once again has the wonderful Technicolor on a DVD that is nothing extraordinary !!! It was so exciting to see him again like this after watching the DVD once, I watched it a second time. The only "extras" are a dubbed version in Spanish, subtitles in English and Spanish and an original theatrical trailer beautifully made. Thank you M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release. Now, one can only hope that Korda's FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (intended to replace poor copies of the public domain in circulation) will soon follow on DVD.
