I really enjoyed this movie when I was young. At that age, I thought the silly baseball antics were funny and the movie was cool because of his sport. Several years later, I can look back and see how well this film was. This film opened my eyes as a little child to other children's struggle and real world problems. This kind of exhibition is largely lacking in children's films nowadays, which, in my opinion, is not in the interest of our society. Of course, baseball antics seem really stupid now, but they have attracted kids. No seven-year-old will ask to see a movie about children in foster care, but he will ask to see a film about baseball. Disney became aware of this fact and took the opportunity to teach these children an important lesson about the world. <br /> <br /> As a young adult, the performance of Al and the other angels seems less impressive, but I credit the actors who play the two children and Danny Glover who have all done a job fantastic.
