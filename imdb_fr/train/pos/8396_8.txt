Maria Braun, sensual and tough. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of the Second World War and spends half a day and all night with him. That's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to jail. She continues her life and becomes a successful businesswoman not only sensual, but also intelligent, ambitious and willing to use sex whenever necessary: ​​"I do not know anything about business, but I know what the business wants. German women, you could even say that I am an expert in the field. " While climbing to success, she still remembers her husband, Hermann (his man) and persuades herself that whatever she does ?? is for him, for their future happy life together. The style of "Maria Braun" is reminiscent of the melodramas of Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk, and offers insight into the loss and survival of post-war Germany. Hanna Schygula shines literally in all the scenes of the film and she is fantastic. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
