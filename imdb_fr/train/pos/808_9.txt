I only wish that Return of the Jedi was made by someone else, I mean, there are far too many ewok scenes, totally useless. In addition to this time, our heroes look like different people: the princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke is boring, Darth Vader is no longer as perverse as before and Yoda dies. <br /> <br /> But there are still many extraordinary things. I can not hate this episode. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The attack sequence of The Sailing Barge. 3-The Emperor (now it's evil) 4- The Speeders hunt in the Endor forest. 5-The last battle. 6-The scene of seduction on the dark side. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration. <br /> <br /> Some of them are so good that they can make you cry. If some scenes were cut and another director was hired, it would have been as perfect as episodes 4 and 5, but it's still amazing. 9 out of 10
