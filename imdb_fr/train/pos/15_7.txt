I guess if a movie has magic, I do not need it to be fluid or transparent. It can ignore background information, go too fast in some places, too slow for others, and so on. The magic of this film is the scene in the library. Stanley & Iris has many minor flaws, but they do not detract from the overall positive impact of seeing people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the most difficult to correct. Both characters are intelligent. Yet Stanley does not understand enough to function because he can not read. he can not read because he has lived the adventure too much in his childhood. Iris, although well educated, did not have enough adventures and therefore does not understand how to go beyond the turn around that her life took. In their flaws and strengths, the characters complement each other. It may be a bit exaggerated to accept that an Iris ends up working year after year in a factory, or that Stanley never hides enough illiteracy to work in the construction industry or another job better paid. And while these "mysteries" are explained in the course of history, their development seems somewhat artificial. I guess nobody took the time to rethink the script. Still, it's a good movie - imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had done it!
