The 100-minute half-hour black and white episodes of the original sitcom "Mr. Peepers" were originally aired from 1952-1955 on NBC. Like many baby boomers, this and "Ding Dong School" are my first TV memories. Since both were used later in syndication, it is difficult to say how many of these memories are actually related to original programming. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" deserves more than being verified by its nostalgic value. It represents a situation comedy style very different from that of shows like "The Honeymooners" and "I Love Lucy". The genre could have gone in two different directions at this time and ended up taking the abrupt and abrasive path of these two series; which probably explains why they always seem contemporary. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers", which was differentiated by its sober and intelligent tone, can seem slow and monotonous in comparison. But it's really more a question of adapting to the different style. Once you enter the characters, it will seduce the most intelligent viewers. The credit goes to the show's producer, Fred Coe, a key figure in the beginning of television whose dramatic anthologies also deserve to be watched ("Philco Television Playhouse", "Lights Out", "Playhouse 90", "Producers Showcase "," Playwrights "56", "Fireside Theater", etc.) even on a kinescope. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" offered a much softer style with Wally Cox (being the voice of "Underdog" a few years later) in the title role, college science professor Robinson Peepers, his glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and his role as a passive observer. <br /> < The series provided Cox with exceptional support Tony Randall played his best audacious friend, history teacher Harvey Weskit Jack Warden played Frank Whip, the noisy gym teacher whose slight intimidation gave the show most of its conflicting elements. <br /> <br /> There is a conc love bear involving school nurse, Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit), and viewers quickly aligning on Mr. Peepers, who seems to better match Nancy. Their wedding on screen towards the end of the 1953-54 season drew national attention, one of the earliest versions of "Who Shot J.R.?" frenzy. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
