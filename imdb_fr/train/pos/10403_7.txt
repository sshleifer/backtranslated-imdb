It's an oriental fantasy about Arabian Arabian Nights, full of incredible adventures, fantastic witchcraft and wizards. Vizier Jaffar (magnificently portrayed by Conrad Veidt) jails Prince Ahamad of Baghdad (the seductive John Justin) who loses his throne, then escapes through a little thief named Abu (friendly Sabu). They arrive in Basora where Ahamad and the princess (the beautiful June Duprez) fall in love. But the prince and the thief are haunted by Jaffar, Ahamd has become blind and Abu has become a dog. The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as the transformation of the main character, a flying mechanic horse, a magic bow, a flying carpet and of course the colossal genius (overexecution executed by Rex Ingram) which gives Sabu three wishes, the eye magic, the goddess Kali with several hands, among others. <br /> <br /> This remarkable image ranks among the best fantasy films of all time. Produced by Alexander Korda of London Fim and directed by Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan, he is credited with an astonishing script by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson, as well as writer and actor playing the sultan of mechanical games. The Second World War epidemic triggered a crippling shooting, and the three Korda brothers and their collaborators traveled to the United States, continuing to film Grand Cannon Colorado. Menzies and Vincent Korda, the cinematography of George Perinal and the special effects of Osmond Borradaile, although dated today, are outdated and constitute an urgent remastering because the colors are worn out. In addition, a nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score of Miklos Rozsa. This lively tale with huge doses of imagination will appeal to fans of fantasy and movie buffs
