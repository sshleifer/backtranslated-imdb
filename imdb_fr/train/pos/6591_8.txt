The Invisible Man is a show everyone must love! It reminds me of the old school series of the 80s (a-team, airwolf, knightrider). The special effects are small but very effective !! but most importantly, it is the pleasure they had to shoot this series. It really shows! the whole cast fits perfectly in their roles and it looks like they can do what they want !! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this one! For me, it's amazing that an actor with so much sarcasm is in his acting style. show if you can. Is it worth it !!!
