Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost actor on the short film market. This market is dominated by short films Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies, from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able to publish hidden treasures, like "To Spring", an amazing story about the most beautiful season of the year. <BR/> <br /> In the environment shown here, spring is not caused by natural cycles, but is manufactured. And by whom? By little male elves who live underground. Every spring, when the snow begins to melt, they begin to work. They start by cutting down rainbow rock columns, then reduce them to rubble and use them to turn them into colored fluids, which will be moved to the ground and carrying grass, flowers ... In others terms, spring! The first half of the drawing illustrates the making of spring, but the second half is a little different. Old Man Winter returns and tries to prolong the winter by destroying the work of the elves. So we are witnessing a battle between the elves and Old Man Winter. <br /> <br /> The music heard here is deliciously wonderful. The melodic parts stick to the head like an ink stain on a piece of paper. The melodies of the second part are thrilling and fit perfectly into the action. It's fantastic, Giorgio! The animation sequences are also a delight. The colors are well mixed and every detail is presented in a massive and epic environment. The concept itself is great. Elves attract characters, as does Old Man Winter, who effectively portrays the cold, unforgiving feelings of the white season. <br /> <br /> This message also contains a strong message. The battle seems to be lost for the elves at the end, until only one late elf jumps into action and leads to the elves' victory over the winter. So the problem is this: one person can make the difference. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "To Spring" is a remarkable classic lost from the short period of cartoons. What is even more remarkable is that the director of this cartoon debuted here. And who is the director of "To Spring"? It's a certain William Hanna ...
