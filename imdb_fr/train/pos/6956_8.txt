I must say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was super cute and I mean very cute. It contained all the "sexual" content of most of Ivan Reitman's comedies, but with something of a tiny extra charge, CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke both have this difficult but credible chemistry that seems to transcend each scene. Both seem to create this strange, twisted and interesting relationship with a powerful "sexual" tension that you will laugh until you can not feel your face anymore. Anna Farris and the rest of the cast seem to be playing the role of everyone perfectly and the rather small role of Wanda Sykes will always make you laugh. This kind of comedy is not suitable for everyone, but I must say that I went with a person who does not like these movies and who laughed like crazy. This film is certainly not for everyone. especially the youngest, because some moments are a little too ... well, say ADULT for the youngest. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, although the ending I found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2 * out of 5 *)
