It is an "odyssey over time" via computer animation, supposedly the work of more than 300 artists. Made in the late 80s and released in 1990, it was a breakthrough material for the day. I thought it was good and quite interesting in places. <br /> <br /> Most short scenes made no sense, just shapes moving into other shapes, but it was fun to watch. These are visuals and not stories. There were strange sequences in which strange creatures seemed to dance with birds heard. All this is computer-animated, which was new at the time. Even the term "computer animation" was not well known. <br /> <br /> This is simply an opportunity to show this new technology in the form of cartoon scenes with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. No words, just pictures with electronic music. The Stoners really had to like that. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful and intriguing 40 minutes of "candy in the eye" and "sweet in the head". With the effects of current CG, this may have lost its impact, but I think it would still entertain you.
