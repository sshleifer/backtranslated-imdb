September 11 is a classic example of true cinema, a kind of realistic documentary, in this case New York firefighters battling one of the most extraordinary events in the history of the world. These are all tiny, discreet, portable cameras, often betrayed by the poor quality of most filming (and by the director, Naudet's hand wiping the screen frequently). <br /> <br /> In this movie, you get to know most of the firefighters - Tony Benatatos, the rookie (or "probie", firefighters tongue in New York), fire chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who discovers that he lost his brother later) and some others. There are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film, just to emphasize the personal and reflective nature of the events. The editing is quite dramatic and well done, especially the death ceremony in the fire department, with some useful pans and a kind of dialectical montage of the film rather limited (just like A Few Good Men by Rob Reiner). Tony looks proud. <br /> <br /> The view and angle of the camera are usually in the midst of firefighters, which is interesting and there are excellent pictures of the interior of the hall of the WTC1 while Pfeiffer and his team are planning what to do next - it's classic cinema. There is also the strange and haunting sound of the human body that crashes from time to time against the portico outside. It was then that an increasingly desperate fire chief, Pfeiffer, realized that his task was desperate and probably hopeless - and this before the collapse of the WTC2. You must recognize that Naudet knows which faces to film and when. <br /> <br /> The sound of the collapse of the nearby WTC2 is so terribly sad, poignant and terrifying that you realize how important this fire is to firefighters. From the lobby, it's like being at the end of the world, and the poor firefighters look so stunned and frightened. You hear a huge shaking maelstrom, like that of a giant monolithic beast that slowly falls to the ground after being fatally wounded. The neighboring tower collapsed, but the remaining WTC1 fire team is unaware of this event. Where is the communication? <br /> <br /> This film is captivating, but the story is amateurish and should have been avoided - clues such as "it was really a unique day" or the often banal statements of Naudet such as "you could see "Fear in everyone's eyes" and "I knew Tony panicked"! The film is actually a long video diary. There are no higher pictures in the building where some of the firefighters went. Imagine this film mixed with CCTV footage from some of the top-rated rooms or news stories of the day. The effect would be bigger. You can even combine this story with that of Mayor Giuliani and, perhaps, the famous Cornishman Rick Riscorla, who literally played the multi-story hero. <br /> <br /> I do not see much propaganda in this film. movie, as some critics suggest. This film is not a triumph of Riefenstahl's will. Some time later, firefighters draped the American flag on a nearby surviving building overlooking what became Ground Zero. So what? <br /> <br /> There are also moments of dubious camera work; For example, who is holding the camera when the two Naudet brothers are gathered at the fire station? Is it staged? <br /> <br /> There is an excellent finish, very faithful to the tradition of the excellent French director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima mon amour), with two strips of light reflected in the water, shimmering.
