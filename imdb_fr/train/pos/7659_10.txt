I just watched this movie, which pissed me off. We also went to South Africa twice, about the time the film was shot. <br /> <br /> It is certainly striking and the first scenes tend to "stage". The slow but steady increase in the rhythm hardly allows for a break and there are certainly few moments of light. <br /> <br /> You will never see Nigel Hawthorne again in the same way. He appeared as a very crooked individual and I found myself hating him more each time he appeared. <br /> <br /> Totally agree with the explicit and thoughtful comments of Steve-thomp.
