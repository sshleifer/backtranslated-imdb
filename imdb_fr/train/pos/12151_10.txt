This is simply the quintessence of what a television movie should be. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon, when my wife and I were in graduate school, we stumbled upon it. The nerdy acting. The script poorly written. Good old boys. The ridiculous premise, but somehow obvious, clich√© and banal. Riding in vans with your dead woman stalled. Everything is within your reach. <br /> <br /> You will meet familiar characters: a naughty dug into the gold, a rich and stupid boy who wants to fend for himself, friends who know better, a dad who knows better but leads far away. And the corpse of a woman. Propped up. In a pickup. <br /> <br /> Wow: and the title. Many things in our life have been the "tragedies of Texas" since we watched this beauty. Anyone involved in his creation deserves a medal.
