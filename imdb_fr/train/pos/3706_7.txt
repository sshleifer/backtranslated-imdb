The biggest surprise in this film was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Rather than playing the stereotypical blonde ditzy roles she usually does, she embodies an intelligent, intelligent character on the street and tired of the world. She does not have a huge role, but she does a great job in describing Lois Harlan as a tired but accustomed woman, covering her boss's indiscretions.
