This film is packed with memories of horror movies: lunatics chained, murder premeditated, a mad scientist (vaguely lesbian) with an even more angry father wearing a mask because of his horrible disfigurement, poisoning, castles spooky, werewolves and women), adultery, lost lovers, Tibetan mystics, victim of an unknown experience, robbery of graves, mind control, walled bodies, car accident on a deserted road, electrocution, knight in armor - the lot, all complemented by an incredibly awful score and some of Foley's worst work ever done. <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (even judging by the standards of the Spanish film Horror badly nicknamed) and some weird. In a scene where the nasty main scientist will visit our heroine in her room for one of the badly dubbed: "It's fantastic, I do not understand, explain to me again how it's going ...". In the movie, there is a hand in the girl's thighs as she gets up for no apparent reason, except to cover a break in the bad scientist "Mwahaha, all your werewolves are mine!" speech. I do not know why they went bothered, because there are many other jerky cuts, even taking into account the horrific panoramic scan of the imprint I saw. <br /> <br /> The director According to an interview with the star, he was drunk during most of the filming and the film looks like him. It's an incoherent mess. This is made even more incoherent by the inclusion of sequences of werewolves drawn from a different film, The Werewolf Brand (directed 4 years earlier, featuring the same actor, but playing the role with more aggressiveness and with a different shirt and makeup - is this a word in Spanish for "Continuity"?) and more padding of another actor in the werewolf who walks in a long shot. <br /> <br /> The music is incredibly bad and varies almost randomly from a frightening orchestral house complete music, to Bosannova, the longest duo piano and gong ever recorded. (Thinking about it, maybe it was not a duet, maybe it was a solo.) The piano part was so simple that it could have been chosen with one hand, while the player was moving away. the gong with the other.) <BR/> <br /> This is one of the most disconcerting trance movies that has caused the bad movies of the year so far for me. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "Ilona! This madness and this evil will turn against you!" What is the truth. <br /> <br /> Favorite Photo: The lover discovering his murdered girlfriend, dropping the candle in a cartoon-like surprise demonstration. Amateur rank performing there.
