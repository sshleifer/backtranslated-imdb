This film is a great way to finish the series. Peter (the boy of Puppet Master III) grew up and is now the master puppet. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn the secrets of Toulon, but instead, she listens to the story of puppets. Most of this film is composed of sequences of Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, The Curse of the Puppet Master and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... But I guess Paramount does not would not let use scenes from 1). Personally, I wish Puppet Master VS. Demonic toys would eventually be made, but at the end of this movie, they basically say "This is the last movie in the series ..."
