Chris Rock stars in this remake of Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait (himself a remake of the 1941 film Here Comes Mr. Jordan), a comedy about a man who dies before his time, before he can realize his dreams and his adventures new organ (although temporary). In the Beatty version, the protagonist was a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams of the time. In the hipper version of Rock, our main character is a young stand-up comedian who is struggling - and resolutely talented. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun to see razor-sharp rock playing a bad comedian. It's a bit like watching Tom Hanks play a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater at a non-amateur party. But every time he tests his equipment, he gets thirsty on the stage - so much so that his nickname becomes "Booie". His jokes are lame, his delivery painful. In short, Lance is all that the real Chris Rock is not. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a bike messenger, and he walks the street to try even more material when BAM! He is hit by a truck. Okay, so maybe he was removed from his body a tenth of a second earlier by a slightly incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he was going to be hit anyway. No dice, it seems that Lance is not due to Heaven before 2044. So what to do? King (Chazz Palminteri), Heaven's "boss", reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the undead, Mr. Barton. The problem is that the body they find is that of an old greedy white man. It turns out that this guy (a Mr. Wellington) has all kinds of things - he is the 15th richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine how Lance will change things. <br /> <br /> Of course, while he's in Mr. Wellington's body, Mr. Lance falls in love with a gorgeous hospital employee (Regina King). We, the men, know how difficult it is to find a woman considering our body, but try to win another while you are a lean old white! And it's even worse when she's not impressed by your money. <br /> <br /> This is Rock's first shot at a leading role, and in my opinion, he plays admirably. He still has a lot of stand-up humor - and, of course, if he wants to have multiple roles, he may have to stop incorporating stand-up routines in the scenario - but that's not the case. really a bad thing. Rock's personality - his dynamism, his game, his behavior and his passion - is what feeds this film. He clearly has a lot of fun in the role, and he seems to want to make sure you have fun watching him.
