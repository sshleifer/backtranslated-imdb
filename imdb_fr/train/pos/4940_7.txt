This film talks about human relationships. Charming, funny and well written, with significant text. It seems that Morgan Freeman surely has fun on the set. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I really like his role. Women like her are a good motivation to learn the Spanish language. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets the beautiful Paz Vega, the view is taken in an intimate journey with two strangers who learn to care about the direction of their lives. 10 items or less is on the zest of life. If you like this movie, see also The pursuit of happiness with Will Smith and his son. It's not an action movie or a nude comedy. It's all about human relations.
