WWE needed a savior while Wrestlemania 14 was spinning around him. The departure of Bret Hart and the subsequent evaporation of the Hart Foundation had left the stable Vile D-Generation X stable undisputed in the WWE. Their despicable leader, Shawn Michaels, had stolen the title from Hart thanks to Vince McMahon's intervention and, with the help of his cohorts, Triple H and Chyna had systematically eliminated anyone who contested his supremacy. But at Royal Rumble, a new competitor had emerged. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Hated by McMahonagement, Austin had worried DX. So worried that they had asked for help from Mike Tyson, "The Worst Man on the Planet", as a special chief of law enforcement. Austin would have a chance against him in his title game with Shawn Michaels. <br /> <br /> But first, there was an underlying map that kicked off the Legion of Doom, which won an unforgettable battle between Royal and NO. 1 contenders for tag titles. I had actually forgotten that this match existed until I returned to the PPV. Not very good and really pointed to the lack of depth in the divisional division at this time. <br /> <br /> The next match saw the Light Heavyweight title defended by Champion Taka Michonoku against Aguila. The WWE had established the light heavyweight title to compete with the strong Cruiserweight division of the WCW. It was not a success and it was the only time the title was ever defended at Wrestlemania. Short match, lasting about five minutes and actually too short to accomplish much. The little they did was exciting and it was a nice little game in which Taka kept his title. <br /> <br /> Alright, our next game saw Triple H, a DX member, defending the WWE European title, which he won Shawn Michaels was in fashion on RAW in December and did not was not defended on pay-per-view television against Owen Hart, the only survivor. Triple H had a grand entrance with the DX band to perform his theme song. Chyna accompanied Triple H to the ring, but was then handcuffed to WWE Commissioner Sgt Slaughter. Triple H and Owen have a nice little game, before Chyna interferes, bringing a low blow to Hart leading to Triple H retaining the title. Good game, could have been great if he had taken a little more time. <br /> <br /> But of course, we would not want to waste time on our next game, which saw husband and wife Marc Mero and Sable beat Goldust and Luna Vachon in the first mixed match at Wrestlemania in 8 years. And, in all honesty, it was not worth the wait. Although not terrific, the match was not memorable either. It was the end of Mero's only race at WWE and the main goal was to continue the disintegration of her relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> Then, we saw Ken Shamrock give in and get paid the title of intercontinental champion. while he was destroying IC Champion The Rock, but then refused to let go of his ankle lock, which led the referee to reconsider his decision. It was a short game, but decent for what it was. <br /> <br /> Then, the first good match of the evening was won by WWE team champions, the New Age Outlaws, who lost their titles to Cactus Jack and Charlie Chainsaw. fun dump garbage match. The decision was canceled the following night, as Cactus and his chainsaw threw the Outlaws behind the scenes of a dumpster, rather than the one used in the match, but it was still a fun match. <br /> NOw it was time for the very first ever-awaited meeting between Kane and his brother Undertaker. Kane had cost Undertaker the title of WWE Champion at the Royal Rumble, then "killed" him when he helped Shawn Michaels lock Undertaker in a coffin and set it on fire for revenge for the deceased. It was a decent match and told a great story as Underataker absorbed everything Kane could throw at him, then knocked him out with three headstones to end the match. <br /> <br /> There was only the main event that saw WWE The champion faces Steve Austin with Mike Tyson as guest conductor. Michaels suffered a crippling back injury during his match against the Undertaker at the Royal Rumble and was outstanding in this game despite his physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were banned in the back early after an intervention from the outside. The match ended with Austin, who attempted to attack Sweet Sweet Music and hit the Stone Cold Stunner. TYson then came into the ring to score all three, celebrating the win with Austin and eliminating Michaels after the match. It turned out that Tyson and Austin were together and that the cat was playing with the mouse from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It was Shawn Michaels' final match for the VPP for four and a half years. This helped to establish Austin as the biggest star of the wrestling industry, and the publicity generated by the appearance of Tyson proved to be a turning point in the WWE battle with WCW. Austin will become the biggest star in WWE history and, along with Rock, Mick Foley, The Undertaker and Triple H will lead WWE through the period when they would gain the highest degree of cultural relevance. And it all started here at Wrestlemania 14.
