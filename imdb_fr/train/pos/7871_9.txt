Madhur Bhandarkar makes every effort to tackle taboo issues and gives the most realistic picture of modern society. One has the impression of the director of his previous films like Satta and Chandni Bar. The issues discussed in this latest film are explored and fully exposed here. The casting is amazing and we can see the judgments on each scene from several angles. Above all, the film lets you ask questions about many facts. As you begin to guess things, you end up being close, but you miss the target in many scenes. This leaves a lasting impression at the end. <br /> <br /> The actors to watch are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni, among others. The dialogues are well written and you feel like you have lived around some of these people. There are still scenes that make you think of more depth. The songs are in the background to save time and the voice of Lata in a very significant song "Kitne Ajeeb" lets you feel that you are alone in the middle of modern society!
