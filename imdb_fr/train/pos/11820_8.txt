Hey, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with an 18-year-old comic book movie and rated 5.9, would you fool me? It's just to catch your attention. Every day, I meet people who complain about the lack of good movies and who seem to know only recent blockbuster movies. It's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those who can not be easily obsolete in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> Negative critics have mostly complained about DT's "messed up" story. But it seems to me that the story is quite clear and that I had no problem following it. I have not seen comics, and yet I'm not a big fan of American comics, but I appreciate the quality of his films and his performances. Maybe the expectations of most people were too great about the story to tell. But, if you see a movie reuniting Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what are you waiting for? I had some scratches on my head and I can not help but wonder if we really saw the same movie. The main role, although not as competent as it may seem, was still able to pull it and charm the audience. Madonna was more expressive than "breathless" in her seductive role, but she added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was funny and prodigy for himself. Apparently he is bold enough to go sarcastically on his previously successful roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro hitting our stomachs to make us laugh. And thank you very much for the makeup. <br /> <br /> For me, it's not bad at all. The surreal feeling really got me.
