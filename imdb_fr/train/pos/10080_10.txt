In the rapid economic development of the 1990s in China, there is a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, due in part to rising nationalism accompanied by increasing wealth, and more importantly, due to the feeling of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post-cultural and revolutionary era. <br /> <br /> However, the resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, namely Confucianism, did not take place without disasters, as the Chinese adopt the whole tradition without eliminating the bad part, and discrimination against The girls' story demonstrated in this film is a great example. <br /> <br /> Moreover, not only the part that should be rejected has been inherited, the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, have ignored during the resurgence and disappearance. <br /> <br /> The director used this film to criticize the problem of the re-appropriation of tradition by contemporary China. This is the deep meaning behind the film.
