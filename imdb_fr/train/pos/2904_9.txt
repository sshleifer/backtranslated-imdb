This film is Damian Szifr√≥n's second immersion in cinema after his excellent study of characters in "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes", he creates characters extremely well done, far from prototypes and with unprecedented chemistry between them. I saw Szifron's talent in presenting each character lightly but just enough to engage us emotionally with them. His control over them is magnificent. It restores the film to a beautiful direction and a generally polite scenario, the characters laugh and cry with a real feeling and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on the screen. <BR /> <br /> Spanish takes over the English, the cityscape of Buenos Aires at night replaces the Hollywood sets and its principle is just as interesting as any other. So we have a movie that dares to compete with the Hollywood group. </> <But I want you to see the movie mainly because I've never had to deal with such endearing characters. It seems that the scenario is perfect for actors and vice versa. I really think that with a film like this, Argentina is really up to the competition.
