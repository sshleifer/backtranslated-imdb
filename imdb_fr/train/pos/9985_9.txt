I recently saw this film in Winnipeg - appropriate, given the location used. I read Lawrence's book for the first time in the 1970s, and for me it has always been a very powerful image of the challenges of aging in our society. It resonated when I was young and it sounds even more so now. When the movie came out, I wanted to see if the story could survive. and was very impressed, especially by Ellen Burstyn's performance. She manages to give us a complete human being, even if the character is usually grumpy and critical - someone you would not want to live with. It's great to be able to see the favorite characters come to life so authentic.
