The rookie made me smile from start to finish. Dennis Quaid played the role perfectly. The little boy playing his son was fantastic. He made it an unforgettable father-son film. The messages are good. Follow your dreams. Failing to chase is ok as long as you try. The excitement is palpable. I think this movie will be a classic.
