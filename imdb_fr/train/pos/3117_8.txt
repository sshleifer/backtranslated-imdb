I will start by saying that I am very happy with this culmination of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please do not ruin this by doing a series of years or a precedent. Leave alone. As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is ... it looks like he was just destined to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Bourne's first two movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. It sticks to what works and adds a little more. I was very happy to see how much information we get in "Identity" and "Supremacy" fit into "Ultimatum" to finally get a complete picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are fast and keep you on the edge of your seat. The battles between Bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. I've always been a fan of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA brings together its Intel. This film fits perfectly in this street, which makes it even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without looking at the two previous episodes ... you'll still enjoy the movie but I'd still recommend you watch them first. This would allow you to fully understand the character of Jason Bourne and become attached and be part of his world. This allows you to enjoy and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the best of the first two, but I personally think that "Ultimatum" could, perhaps, have the advantage if we compare the trilogy.
