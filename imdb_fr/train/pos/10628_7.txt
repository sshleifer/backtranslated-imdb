Despite his acting and his story "We see everything before everything", it is a pretty compelling film. <br /> <br /> There is suspense, the scenes with the demon are actually pretty scary, some visual effects are superb and the best of all, no humor ridiculously misplaced to harm the film because too many horror movies (wannabe) are now included <br /> honestly, this is not the biggest movie ever made, but it attracts you and tries to at least develop your character. <br /> <br /> I was happy to have watched
