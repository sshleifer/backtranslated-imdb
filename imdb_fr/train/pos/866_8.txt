Put yourself in Carla's shoes. It is an overloaded and unrecognized administrative task that is invisible. You know her: she has trained three of her last three leaders, knows where all the bodies are buried and could even look at you in the mirror while brushing your teeth. Always having the time to perform another thankless task and doing it better than most despite a severe disability, she has the office on the way to the toilets that become the deposit of half-finished cups of coffee that ask to be knocked down. What? You do not want to hear it? Well, she can not, and you can not, either, until your hearing aid is in place. Prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) needs a change in her life. Work does not lead anywhere. friends rely on it to support their domestic needs and the only way out is a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed. She will not take a vacation - a contract is critical - the only alternative is to hire an assistant. Carla submits requirements that reflect her real needs: a "neat" man. This brings an applicant to approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Cassell) has done everything wrong since the beginning of his job interview and his hiring clearly demonstrates Carla's interest in his non-work-related qualities. She sees the potential of this former thief and as the story unfolds, their relationship grows into a very unusual co-dependency pattern. <br /> <br /> Paul has a difficult transition to return to the world outside the walls of the prison and is in another kind of prison: one of office type and another of contract servitude to pay an old debt . Her skills as a thief help Carla win a political battle in the office. But Paul sees a greater opportunity with Carla's skill in lip reading and takes him further into a world of intrigue. <br /> <br /> This is a brutal black film that is unrated and probably suitable for older teenagers. Carla becomes more powerful, both professionally and personally, as the story progresses and her disability gives her obvious advantages over the rest of us. She grows up as a woman, discovering her sensual side as she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competition in the world of men. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are made for each other, in a strange way. Without Paul, Carla will remain in her role as a doormat. She has our sympathy, our hopes and our best wishes even if she does not make the best decisions along the way. <br /> <br /> You will hear the world through Carla's ears, delicate adjustments to your hearing aid, muffled sounds, almost inaudible without audible voices, when you can see who's talking. As a major sense is disabled, we see Carla's increased intuitive power to compensate. And we can all use this meaning to hear not only what people say, but what they really mean.
