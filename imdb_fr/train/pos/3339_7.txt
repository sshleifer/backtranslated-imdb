The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, start again. With "Fever Pitch", the creators of other films that addressed many unusual themes abandoned this tactic when they decided to show Nick Hornby's film on screen, which would have been difficult to do. The novel, of the same title, dealt with the obsession of football for men, since it takes place in England, where this sport consumes most British sports fans. The writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell has the merit of turning the book into a language that will appeal to most Americans when they make their hero, a fan of the Boston Red Sox. <br /> <br /> "Fever Pitch" is a film that features a haunting fan, Ben Wrightly, whose life revolves around the Red Sox season and who is an eighth grade teacher with strange ways to involve his students in the subject he is trying to teach them. When Ben takes four of his best students around a local business, he meets Lindsey Meeks, a young woman who travels, but at the age of thirty, she has no life. The story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the Red Sox during home games at Fenway Park. The fans of this team are probably the most loyal people in the world. They remained loyal to a team that does wonderful things but, until 2004, has never won a world series. In fact, the end, according to what we've heard, had to be changed, because this is the year when they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty-six years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as a couple at the center of the film. Mrs. Barrymore is a natural person who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, a popular TV comedian turned movie actor, has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in "Taxi", in our humble opinion. <br /> <br /> The Farrelly Brothers movie will also satisfy their fans as baseball fans with this baseball tale.
