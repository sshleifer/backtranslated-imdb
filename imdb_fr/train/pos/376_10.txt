The first dramatic film of Spielberg is not left out. It is a beautifully made film without any flaws on the life of an African American woman. It also proves that all films with the African-American ethnic group in the center of the story do not necessarily have to be barred by an African-American director. <br /> <br /> What I like in this film is Spielberg's ability to produce very realistic despite being based on a book. In addition, Danny Glover was excellent as a Mr. And usually, he is only himself in most of his films. But in this area, he stands out completely and is someone else for once. But the resistance performance of the whole film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She is excellent like Celie. You will never forget these characters once you've seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I've heard that the musical version of this film will also be a movie, and all I can say is: I hope it's about as good than this one, because this one is a movie not to be missed.
