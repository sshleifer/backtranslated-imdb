I must say that this TV movie was the work that really showed the talent of Melissa Joan Hart. We are so used to seeing her in a sitcom now and I really hope that a TV channel will air this TV movie soon as it will show Sabrina fans that MJH is shining in a drama. Seen as we have watched on Sabrina for 5 years now and give viewers a taste of his unused talent would be a plus. Melissa plays her role so well in this desire to "make disappear" her parents to be with the guy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice is that Melissa is working with David Lascher in this area long before he plays Josh in Sabrina. It would be interesting to see this video each time it will be broadcast again. Let's hope that MJH gets good roles in the movies or even in several TV movies, a bit like Kellie Martin who has always shone in TV movies. Lots of unused talents waiting to resign when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you always shine Melissa !!!
