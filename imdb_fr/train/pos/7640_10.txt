Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 star <br /> <br /> The theme of "Mr. Destiny" is recycled from many films spanning several years. His theme ranges from recent parodies on such plots (see "Scrooged") to the same more serious and dramatic notion that has worked in "It's a wonderful life" and a century earlier in Scrooge's story told by Charles Dickens in "A Christmas Carol." "It involves an ungrateful man who takes a guided tour of his life and sees how his life could have been (or would have been) firsthand. <br /> <br /> In most of these types of films, the A guardian angel saves a man from his ingredient and shows him his life in retrospect, or how it could have, it should have been, in which case we were shown a businessman named Larry (James Belushi) .He hates his lives with a lifeless wife (Linda Hamilton) and aspires to a bigger and more meaningful life.If he had the upper hand at the state high school championship years ago, he is convinced that his life would have been better, remember that seemingly tiny moment of his life because it had a big impact on his subconscious side, but I doubt that an adult aspires to a single act in high school, yet it works in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Larry gets home from work one night, where he plays the r journalist with Jon Lovitz, when hello. car breaks down. He walks into a bar looking for a public phone and reluctantly decides to talk to the bartender (Michael Caine) about his life's evolution. This is where we see him for the first time remembering the baseball training of his childhood. <br /> <br /> The bartender listens and nods, apparently not caring about other guests. This is probably due to the fact that the bar, although old and ragged, seems to have never been occupied by any living human being except these two men. In fact, Larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before. It's probably for a reason that the public waits before Larry. <br /> <br /> Thus, the bartender, who may as well be an angel of God incarnate, like Clarence, gives Larry a glass of his own, which ends up putting Larry's life backwards, showing him what his life would have been like he had hit the house all those years before. But Larry has no idea of ​​a change at first, just as Jimmy Stewart did not realize Clarence had erased his life until he got into the bar and got fired. Larry continues to be unaware of any change until he goes home. Find a different lawn on the outside and a tall, fighter-like man occupying his home. <br /> <br /> Larry soon discovers that his life would have been different if he had hit the home run. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, he married Rene Russo and settled in a large mansion with children. He discovers that Jon Lovitz is no longer his friend but one of his employees. And the most amazing thing of all is that, with his new life, what Larry always wanted ... he finds himself in lust for his old wife, Linda Hamilton; The proof that sometimes, money and a beautiful but superficial woman do not compose everything in the life of a man, like a smart woman, a love and a real happiness. Just like "It's a wonderful life" showed the public that a man's life is what he did, and that every person has an impact on people, "Mr. Destiny" shows us that wealth material is not the same thing as spiritual wealth, a lesson has taught us again and again, but never so soft, forgettable and truly sweet as it is shown in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny" is never too hilarious, but it's a sweet and good comedy that never takes itself too seriously. The problem with all "It's a wonderful life", like "The Family Man", is that they try to be as influential and memorable as "It was a wonderful life". But it is very often that you can single-handedly scam a famous movie, and "Mr. Destiny" knows it and plays it right. He does not try to be what he is not; it is rather something that he has not tried to be and this is obvious to the public. <br /> <br />
