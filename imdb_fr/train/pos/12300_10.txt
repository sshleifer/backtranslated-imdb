This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo still plays Anna Christie, but all other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were shot one after the other because Garbo was so popular in Germany. Garbo herself would have favored Anna Christie in this version compared to the English version. It's a good story and a must for Garbo fans.
