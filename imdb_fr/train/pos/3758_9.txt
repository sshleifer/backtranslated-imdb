This movie is great. If you take it too seriously, you will hate it of course. However, the amount of "dudes" and "good for nothing" brings laughter and faint memories of about 15 years ago. I like his ability to just make me laugh at obvious jokes and foolishness, and his ability to make me want to look at his forerunner, "The Great Adventure of Bill and Ted" (1989). If you're looking for a movie full of multi-faceted jokes and fully mature humor, do not look at it; However, if you want a humorous and silly movie, both intelligent and engaging, you'll enjoy it. In fact, I hope that more of this kind of images is present in theaters today. And hey, it's Keanu Reeves who acts the way everybody parodies him by acting like he does ... well ... it's not better than that :)
