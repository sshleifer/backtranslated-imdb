From the author of "What ever happened to Baby Jane?" and "Hush .. Hush, Sweet Charlotte", this end of the horror cycle of the sixties is fun and mysterious. Micheál Macliammóir plays Victor Buono, but too often the film stumbles dangerously close to a bad musical ... There is a particularly dreadful children's recital at mid-term. Debbie plays, plays tangos and plays a trick around the corner, while the Winters religious fanatic has a lesbian side. Agnes Moorehead presents herself as an evangelist. Weaver has nothing to do - and even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
