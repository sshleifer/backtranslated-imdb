Critics should review what they classify as a quality film. I think critics have seen too many action films and have succumbed to the style of Matrix movies. Europa is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that watching is not enough to understand or appreciate this exceptional film. Lars von Trier shows that old filming styles can produce a wonderful cinema and create drama and tension. The rear projection effect he uses during the film evokes and values ​​the characters, as well as the center of the conversation they have. Other effects he uses, such as color and black and white in a scene, like Hitchcock and the girl in the red coat, attract attention and reinforce the drama and sense of the scene. The comment is superb and has a hypnotic effect, keeping the focus on the central characters of the scene and its actions. <br /> <br /> I could talk more about the effects, but I think you'll all agree that they push that far. film in a category apart, and really enhances the drama of the film. A movie to buy if you do not have one already and one to see if you do not have it. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Do not miss this artistic black film from one of the great directors.
