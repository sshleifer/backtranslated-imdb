Everyone has already commented on cinematography (good to excellent), personalities (larger than life), the structure (chronological, with many references to the culture of surfing through time). What is missing is a more important question of sociological importance: juggling American culture for something more rewarding and rewarding. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm movies in local SoCal high schools. I remember the pleasant feeling of surfing all day long until my skin glows with warmth, putting on a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and seeing the latest surf film at night. Often, the narrator was the filmmaker himself, reading a script on sheets of paper. Sometimes a surf group or a proto-punk band added music. I have never been so happy. Seeing "Riding Giants" made me go back in time, except howling and screaming. <br /> <br /> Computer science also reinforced the feeling that life was at the limit, regardless of money or social and corporate growth. ladder, do not follow the pace of Jones, push yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question "What is the purpose of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton, etc., they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest enough with ourselves to pursue: living life only on our own terms. Maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it's wonderful to see people who actually live their dreams. <br /> <br /> It's this message that really impressed me.
