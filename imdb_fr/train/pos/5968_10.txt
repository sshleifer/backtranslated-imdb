When you encounter a jewel of a film like this, you realize why the 80s were the most beautiful decade of life. Rock music reigned, and movies too ... especially horror movies. The filmmakers knew how to entertain us, and "Trick or Treat" is obvious. When the rocker Sammi Curr, which was probably written after W.A.S.P. Singer Blackie Lawless dies in a hotel fire. His number 1 fan, Eddie, is panicked. He goes to see his friend and his dj Nuke (Gene Simmons) to support him. Nuke gives him a copy of Sammi's latest recording; it's the only copy available. It was given to the radio station to be played live on Halloween night. When Eddie plays, it brings back Sammi. He helps Eddie with bullies at school, but becomes out of control. It's really a good movie. The problem is that this movie is out of print. I paid $ 25.00 to finally remove it from eBay. You should too ... well spent!
