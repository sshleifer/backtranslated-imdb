The movie "Frailty" is actually more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. It has all the characteristics of a horror movie but it is not the case. "Frailty" is a film about the perceptions of religion and the realization of the differences between good and evil. <br /> <br /> In "Frailty", a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons affirm God's work. It turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called "The Hands of God". We watch the father kill the "demons" quite brutally while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work of God and that what they are doing is right. He claims to have received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth. God gave him a list of names and in return for his "services"; he and his sons will be protected, which basically means that the police will never be able to capture them. We see all this happening in a very disturbing way. But what is really disturbing is the effect it has on both sons, especially the eldest son, Adam. Adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being, that is to say until his father and a week in the cellar change all that. He knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is almost certain that his younger brother, Fenton, is the same. Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything as if it were his own religion. He seems trapped in the world of God and the demons of his father. I guess it's because he's so young and easily impressionable. But all that happens to these three is rather convincing, actually TOO convincing. <br /> <br /> The events that occur in the film can be considered as a striking hallucination experienced by the three main characters. I say that because they each react differently to the situation and, at one point in the film, they all claim to see God. Dad first sees the murders as his mission. His "mission" consumes him later and quickly turns into an obsession with the eradication of demons. In fact, his hallucination is the main one. His "orders" and the list of names he receives are all part of this hallucination. Look at the scene where dad finds the ax in a barn to understand where I come from. Fenton, the youngest son, is easily impressed by all these discussions about demons and destruction. As he is so young, it is easy for him to fall into the trap of his father. Adam, on the other hand, is very skeptical about his father's actions. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> In a way, the hallucination ends when the father is killed at the end of the film. (I will not say how or under what circumstances). But I will say that it is not pleasant. After his death, he moves quickly to the present. (The story is told through flashbacks, as seen through the eyes of the eldest son Adam). In fact, it's Fenton telling the story, not Adam as we originally thought. The story is told in the way he saw it, through his actions and those of his brother. Fenton went crazy and pursued what his father had started by luring the FBI agent into his trap. <br /> <br /> Since religion is a major theme in this film, the film also shows how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those who do not fully understand it. Before Dad discovered his new mission, he did not clearly understand religion and did not fully believe in a supreme being. His sons Fenton and Adam often sang church songs of innocent little children, but they probably did not understand the meaning of the words. After the revelation of Dad's new mission, they both took off in a different direction - Adam continued to doubt the existence of a supreme being while Fenton was gradually sucked into his father's madness. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller that will make you crack, do not look at it alone.
