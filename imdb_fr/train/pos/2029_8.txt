As a horse lover, we can only appreciate this film. There are few movies that show riding like this. I would like to know if Brian is doing his own riding in the movie. Would also like to know if he likes horses. Brian has been in a lot of movies where he's gone. Where did he learn to ride? The only thing that is difficult for me to take is that the riding scenes are always as deep as if a horse could run at full speed forever. The work of the camera is first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be at the top of a horse. It would be very interesting to know how they chose this film to find all the very good riders.
