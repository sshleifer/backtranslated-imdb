Beautiful story. Good scenario. Good casting. Good acting. Good staging. Good artistic direction. Good photography. Good sound. Good editing. All is well. Gather everything and you will get a good entertainment. <br /> <br /> The shame is that there are not enough movies of this caliber being shot these days. We can consider ourselves fortunate that writers / directors like John Hughes can sometimes make their creative voice heard. <br /> <br /> Whenever I notice that I'm watching a movie for the third or fourth time and still find it fully satisfying, I have to conclude that something about this movie is right.
