An excellent documentary on the life of the New York firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time. This reason alone is why it should be a collector's item not to be missed. What shocked me was not just the attacks, but the physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think a lot of doctors would agree with me that in their physical state, some of those firefighters would NOT have come to the 79th floor with over 60 pounds of equipment. Having said that, I now have greater respect for the firefighters and I realize that becoming a firefighter is a life-changing job. The French are used to making great documentaries and that's what it is, a great documentary .....
