Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, better still, Jeff Fahey, all in one film. Wow is all I can think of saying about it. They are four of the most underrated players in the business and work well together. It's like poetry, the way they play each other and have the natural ability to look like best friends for centuries for even filming. <br /> <br /> The film itself is good and can be quite intense to see the first time, and the four stars help the ability to re-look to a great extent. I can not describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on the screen, the biggest moment being when they watched a couple at a distance and filled the voices themselves, it was almost crying. <br /> <br /> A good movie, an excellent cast, go see. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
