Reading the previous reviews, I guess this movie went straight to the cable. Well, I paid to see him at the theater and I'm happy to have seen him because it was a gripping film. Most of the sets seem to have been made in the early 1960s (except for the psychologist's desk which is dated in a different way), and if you let Neve Campbell's sequences go away, the whole movie has a faded atmosphere of the early 60s. And the use of restaurants in the movie was fascinating. For a new director whose course, I believe, is that of writing, he has a very good eye. During the first ten minutes, I felt that the plot lacked plausibility, so I simply suspended my disbelief of my own free will and went on an adventure. As far as acting and the representation of father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child relations are concerned, the film was perfect. William H. Macy, a pleasure to watch, seems to fill the gap left by the late Tony Perkins, if this and Magnolia are an indication. Tracey Ullman as a neglected woman was very emotional for me. It was a three-dimensional representation of a character too often considered by society as two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add that to his collection of unforgettable portraits. The representation of the parents (Bain / Sutherland) indirectly reminded me of Vincent Gallo's BUFFALO '66, although somewhat attenuated! I would certainly pay money to see a second film from this director. He has the self-discipline of a fifties crime director (something that P.T. Anderson will never have!), But he has a visual style and an actor style that catches the eye.
