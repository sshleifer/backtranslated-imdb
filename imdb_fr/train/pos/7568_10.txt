This is what I saw on my last day at the festival and I was happy to have spent two more days. Poetic, moving, and most surprising, funny, in its strange way. It's so rare to see filmmakers working in this style able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper-realistic world without seeming precious or upsetting the balance. Manages to appear at once improvised, but completely controlled. I hesitate to make comparisons, because these filmmakers really digested their influences (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the usual suspects) and found their own style, but if you like modern filmmakers in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene), you will enjoy yourself. It's a wonderful film and I hope more people will see it. If this movie is playing in a festival in your city, go for it! go! go!
