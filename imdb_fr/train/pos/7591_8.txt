A disorder of sorts, but it's mostly based on Stephen Chow's gender mixes for his inspiration. There's magic kung fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and melodrama crying for a garnish. The production is excellent and the pace is fast, so it is easy to overcome the many flaws of this film. <br /> <br /> A baby is abandoned near a basketball court. A homeless man takes him to a Shaolin monastery in the middle of a city, accompanied by a special manual on kung fu that the homeless man has somehow but can not read. The old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique described in the manual. The school is supported by a fake kung fu master assisted by four delusional monks. The new master is angry at the boy of more than 20 years who does not pretend to be hurt by the weak strokes of the master and throws him out for the night. The boy is caught throwing garbage in a basket at an incredible distance by a man who takes him to a gangster club to play darts. This leads to a great fight, the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation. <br /> <br /> All of this happens in the first 20 minutes, most of which happens in the first 10 minutes. Aside from storytelling in extreme shorthand, the first problem is the little knowledge we have to know the main character until the end of the film. The man who uses the boy is more clearly defined when the first third is over. The plot does not follow any new terrain, except for the crazy action climax of the movie. I'm sure you can easily imagine how wacky monks will show up late. The effects, the photography and the waterfalls are all of the highest quality and make up for the uninspired plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow is much better at writing intrigues and comedies and this film will live in his shadow, but that's not a good reason to ignore it. It's quite fun, even with a scattering end. Recommended.
