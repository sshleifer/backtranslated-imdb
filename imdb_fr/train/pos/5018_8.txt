if you are like me, then you will love this great teen movie that comes to adulthood. early 60s and he has a wonderful soundtrack. Not as many songs as in some of these types of movies but always great.It is so very funny sometimes and has a great interest in love.All young people are great.I wish there were more types of these wonderful films.my the favorite movie of all time is back to the future when Marty Mcfly returns in 1955 and well in these wonderful movies it stays in the 50's (early 60's) there are some movies of this type better than this but not much.
