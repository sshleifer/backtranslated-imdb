Of course, this film is not historically accurate, but it is an excellent entertainment. Most of DeMille's images, especially the latest epics, are slow and laborious, but the action here moves to a clip. The story is basically a series of peaks with very few quiet moments. The action takes us from an Indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the film with Jean Arthur excellent while trying to appease the painted natives of war. She and Cooper are then taken to the war camp and tortured. Later comes a long battle with the Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous but very entertaining and entertaining from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this time and she shines here.
