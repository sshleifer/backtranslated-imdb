It's nerdy, it's scary, it's disgusting, but that's what makes it so much fun. There are melodramatic moments that are simply laughable. It's good to make fun of this movie. Praise him for good laughs. <br /> <br /> The film is centered on three women presenters of the television news, at the time of mobile phones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can not get a room to spend the night. And that's when they meet Ernest Keller. He is scary in the psycho genre. And he proposes to let them stay at home. But he does not tell them the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> The performance of Stephen Furst is so amazing that "The Unseen", he really wears this movie. Most of the film is a little boring, although it is interesting to discover the truth about Ernest's family. <br /> <br /> The mere fact of seeing this cast in these scenes is worth the detour. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make beautiful candies for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I consider the film as an old gem, hard to find and worth a visit.
