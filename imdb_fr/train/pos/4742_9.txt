This movie contains more action before the opening credits than in Hollywood movies of this type. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and the stars Jet Li. This team has brought you many Hong Kong-worthy film productions, including the Once Upon A Time in China series. The action was fast and furious with incredible wire work. I only saw the wires in two shots. Aside from the action, the story itself was strong and not just a filler. To find other action movies competing with this, you need to search for a movie theater in Hong Kong in your area. They are definitely worth the trip and usually do not disappoint.
