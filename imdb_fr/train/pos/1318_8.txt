I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra because it received a good rating of 7.3 stars, but only a few of the critics at the time I wrote were particularly positive. A strange situation and, hopefully, my positive opinion will direct people to this old anime movie, almost forgotten. Space Cobra is the amusing story of a smuggler and a thief who gets involved with the three sisters of an old and dead planet and a devilish force that wants to exploit the powers of the planet. This is an old movie and animation shows, but what lacks modern sophistication, it is composed with an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very suitable for Western audiences and very easy to watch. There is little or no reference to specific Japanese culture and it is good to watch and appreciate for Anime novices. Space Cobra itself is witty and friendly. I can not say how much this is due to English dubbing or the intentions of the manufacturer, but it's one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find really funny. The style is very barbaric of the sixties with a fantastic soundtrack of Yello. The style is colorful and imaginative and there is constant action to advance the story. The strangest aspect of this film is the way it starts as a comedy and ends on a very dramatic dramatic note. I can not think of another anime or general movie that has been able to do it in such a transparent and compelling way. You hardly realize that this is happening, but it is done in a very subtle way and seems perfectly natural. You also feel that the characters have gone on a journey and that their lives have been changed by experience. Check if you can.
