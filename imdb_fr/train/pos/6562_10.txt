Simply the best reality show ever made. The first two seasons (the only ones that count) are on Hulu. I challenge everyone to watch the first three episodes of Season 1 and not to like it. I guarantee you will finish watching the season. Then I guarantee you will watch season 2. <br /> <br /> Here are other quick reasons to watch it: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. Locations in Europe are awesome 3. Games are difficult mentally 4. It's very interactive 5. In an episode, a player responds to another player's desperate message: "I'm trying as hard as I can!" with one also desperate, "Not necessarily." <br /> <br /> Can you understand ... Who is the mole?
