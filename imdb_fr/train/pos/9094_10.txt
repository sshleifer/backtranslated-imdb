I saw this independent movie in Philadelphia and it was a nice surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made the movie so funny was that this movie was based on a true story - hilarious! He also has excellent actors. Mindy Sterling is in and is very good. I loved him at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also great. I remember him from the class leader. I'm tired of all the edgy dark movies that continue to be made. It's fun and light, and I can watch it with my family without being embarrassed. I keep checking to see when it will come out on DVD. I will definitely buy it.
