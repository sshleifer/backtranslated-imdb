Few people like Bertrand Blier's films simply because they do not understand them. Simply because they are different types of people. <br /> <br /> If you have not lived in deep despair mixed with great personal hope, it may be difficult for you to enjoy the humorous humor presented here. <br /> <br /> And also the film of blier can not easily be classified as a black comedy or a cult, like those of fiction, etc., because there is a delicacy that the audience of the North America does not appreciate often. <br /> <br /> When I watched these two "hooligans" with Jeanne Moreau in the seaside restaurant, I felt they were nicer than any gentleman could have been being. <br /> <br /> The desire to make love to savagery is the normal reaction we feel under the insupportable pressure of an insignificant being symbolized by the truck that suddenly emerges at the Carrefour. <br /> <br /> SO, the Vals is a better name than leaving. To dance a waltz, you must be smart, but go to places you do not like.
