I saw "Fever Pitch" somehow by accident; he was playing on the plane for Europe. It was not half bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the biggest fan of the Red Sox world, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) may be painful. The film is a pretty interesting look at how global events can affect relations between peoples. It is particularly telling that the Red Sox have ended their series of 80 consecutive losses. I guess that kind of thing happens all the time and we just do not notice it. Not too bad. Another film depicting an unusual relationship to baseball is "Frequency". Check them both.
