Any screen adaptation of a story by John Grisham deserves a traditional Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman is one of the most recent filmmakers in which I would choose a mainstream version. But this southern fried boiler is pretty good. Although it's not among the best of Altman, it's certainly not among the films he made that let you scratch your head and ask what he thought. <br /> <br /> Altman had made his hat to the mysterious thriller with black accents. previously, in his 1973 film "The Long Goodbye". "The Gingerbread Man" is not nearly as good as this movie, but it's pretty good all by itself. Kenneth Branagh is an arrogant lawyer who is being murdered after being involved in a client (Embeth Davidtz) who asked him to help protect her from his cuckoo father (Robert Duvall). The film takes place in Savannah, Georgia, as it approaches a tropical storm, giving the film an oppressive atmosphere that I loved. The twists towards the end of the film become less and less practical, and Altman turns out not to be as good at staging the shootings, but overall, the film is not a bad addition to 'Altman. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, Jr., Hannah Daryl, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Category: B
