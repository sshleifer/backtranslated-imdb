HOLES is not your usual thing at Disney. It's really very entertaining, even for adults who are generally afraid of the "family entertainment" designed by a discussion group, which Uncle Walt's studio calls real action. Perhaps the secret to the success of this film lies in its fidelity to the original book, which is a little darker than your ordinary kid thing. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys' detention camp, where all detainees are forced to dig holes in the desert sun to relieve them. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story merges with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie on a boys-only prison camp has the right to being. Jon Voight is particularly mean and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
