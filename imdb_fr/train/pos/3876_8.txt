The charming Danish actress Sonja Richter steals the film under the nose of everyone, which is no small feat given the great performances that surround it. <br /> <br /> Richter interprets Anna, an unemployed, independent woman, a neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who gets a desperate job and cares for an elderly, mute and disabled father, named Walentin (the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth, who died at age 77 shortly after shooting the film). <br /> <SPOILER ALERT> <br /> <br /> Walentin refuses to answer anyone - until he confronts Anna, the gifted, whose whimsical and mischievous way brings back the poor old devil beaten with the death penalty he himself imposed. <br /> <br /> Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty that a heavy businessman's son (Jorgen, played by Clausen) has to love a father who does not has never accepted. The film turns out badly late, but Clausen has important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and compassion, and how one person, the irrepressible Anna, can change the course of a human life. Highly recommended. The performance of Sonja Richter alone is worth the entry price.
