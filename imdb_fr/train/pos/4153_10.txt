it was a fantastic episode. I saw an excerpt from it on YouTube and I promised myself that if it were to be broadcast on TV, I would stick to it so I could watch it. I ended up with a friend of mine, who happens to be gay, and we both cried at the end. It was a sincere and sincere episode of forbidden love between two cops who, in my opinion, were really (in Coop's words) "the luckiest". It's episodes like this one that have made Cold Case one of the most captivating and most beloved of CBS TV magic. I'm anxiously waiting for more episodes and a replay of "Forever Blue" because I still live it over and over again.
