First of all, I would just like to say that this movie is more raw than all the recent shits that Hollywood has prepared from its entrails. McBain is a real action movie with more violence than most viewers can handle. It contains all the classic elements of an action movie from the late '80s or early' 90s: free and random acts of violence (that is, when Walken and his team come forward to confront each other drug traffickers to get money, rather than let them live and take their money), broken necks, hot guys, flying guys, and of course the guys on fire who fly off buildings. Walken is at its best in this image offering memorable lines such as, "Let's sit .......... on the deck." and others that make this movie one of the best purchases from the video store rack in the local video store. If you are hungry for unnecessary and random acts of violence, rent this movie today and quench your thirst.
