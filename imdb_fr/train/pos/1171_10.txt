I found this episode to be one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. The creators of South Park made the best parody of a Romero movie I have ever seen. They really touched Romero's underlying social commentary that he did with each of his films. I would like to know George Romero's opinion on this episode and I'm sure it was purely positive! Keep intact his true vision of his zombie epics! Most parodies deal with pure gore without making the viewer think as Romero tries to do with his films. I think that if a zombie outbreak occurs, we may worry about the value of our property before our life, as this episode shows!
