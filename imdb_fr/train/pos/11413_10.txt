I thought it was a great movie for kids from 6 to 12 years old. A little sullen, but the story tells a story. This proves that a teenager's dreams can really come true. I think it's a great story for any child who is low spirited or feels like trying to juggle too much of them. Very "cute" movie. Bravo.
