Some people loved "The aristocrats" and others hated it, often walking in the middle. The reactions to Eddie Izzard are not likely to be so extreme. If you can handle a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and whose vocabulary is, shall we say, enough use of the word "f" in his program. would be a long beep if presented on the network television. Many Izzard fans are so dedicated that they do not see any flaws in his performances. On the other hand, I thought that this show was sometimes flatter than the chest of Izzard but also most often funny, and at times absolutely hilarious. It has a way of connecting routine references at the beginning of the series to its subsequent routines. He is not a storyteller. He is not a joke maker. It's not a frantic fantasy like Robin Williams. He plays with ideas, some of which work and whose routine with the San Francisco cable car and Alcatraz, for example, are completely foolish. However, it has the means to move gracefully beyond the flopped routines and expand those that connect. I gave this performance a 7 and I could be persuaded to increase it to 8. But a 10? No way.
