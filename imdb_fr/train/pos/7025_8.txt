I found this adaptation charming, very lively and fun. With the exception of a few major mistakes, the cast is beautiful. I must echo some of the previous comments - Chynna Phillips is horribly badly received as a teenager. At 27, she is just too old (and, yes, it shows) and does not have the "chops" singing for a Broadway music. Vanessa Williams is a pretty decent singer and, for a non-dancer, she is adequate. However, she is NOT Latina, and her character is definitely. She is also very STRONG, which becomes tiring. <br /> <br /> Sweet Apple's Conrad Birdie fan club girls really shine - with special congratulations for Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also enjoyed Tyne Daly's performance, although I'm not generally a fan of her work. Finally, the dancing Shriners are a riot, especially the three dorky bar. <br /> <br /> The film is suitable for all the family and I highly recommend it.
