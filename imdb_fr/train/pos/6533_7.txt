I must say that it was not very exciting but talk about fashion and strange ways to solve a mystery. A little too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... it's fantastic! I really liked this part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter) is however extremely hilarious ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed really desperate ... he should have been more angry at her for the way she treated him ... <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is a tour and a disguised fashion. Anyway, I recommend this movie, just for the pleasure of summer. Still Nancy, just for fun. More spy movies for teens by Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... remember? She becomes good at this delicate detective work.
