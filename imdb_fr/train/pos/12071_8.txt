Nicolas Roeg's projects are variable, but never interesting. "Insignificance" is obviously, above all, an adapted play of scene: it is verbose and rather "related to the play". BUT, it's worth watching this movie more than once: the underlying themes are not clearly presented and, in addition, it takes time to adjust to the juxtaposition and reversal of the roles of the four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is overwhelmed with guilt over Hiroshima, but believes in the simplicity of a sexual affair with Munro; Munro is tired of being seen as a bimbo and needs intellectual credibility; Senator McCarthy is at the peak of his witch-hunting power but is a helpless handbag; DiMaggio is not sure of his celebrity, obsessed with himself and inclined to violence. Each of them contains the seeds of its own destruction. Each character has a troubled, abused / abusive past and an uncertain future. Gradually, we see that the obsession itself is the central theme. America's obsession with postwar icons and cultural mores; the obsessions of the protagonists for something no one can have: peace of mind and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> Compared to the theory of relativity, a proposition of unified field theory and, indeed, of the cosmos itself, all the aspirations and interactions of the protagonists of Roeg seem insignificant. Yet these aspects of the physical universe (everything is quantum, believe me!) Affect us when they are applied to developing ways to destroy us. Monroe's mention of the principle of the neutron bomb (without naming it as such) is not an anachronism in itself, but can only be understood by a contemporary public. Indeed, ALL the references contained in the script are accessible only to an informed spectator: a person familiar with the occurrences of the 50s / cults of the personality and the way in which they affect us in the XXI century. <br /> <br /> This film and its scenario are either very, very intelligent or extremely opaque and pretentious. In the end, though, probably not important. <br /> <br /> live long and prosper :) <br /> <br />
