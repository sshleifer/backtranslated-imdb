This first version of the tale "The Student of Prague" was made in Germany in 1913, with Paul Wegener (who also appeared in "The Golem" a few years later). In this film, he plays a double role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film to see him in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he has need to woo a countess he had previously saved from drowning. <br /> <br /> Moving fast (the film lasts a little over an hour) and quite well written and characterized, "The student of Prague" has echoes of the legend of Faust as well as of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, thus starting with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, and developing into good and bad sides of the same person.
