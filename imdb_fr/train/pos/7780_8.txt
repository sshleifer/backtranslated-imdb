Robert Stack has never really lost the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for his role as Kyle in "Written on the Wind" following Anthony Quinn's 12-minute performance in "Lust for Life". Stack plays the deeply disturbed alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. He lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunk slut in love with Mitch. Their story is played in glorious colors under the wise leadership of Douglas Sirk, who has truly dominated the field of melodrama with incredible films, including "Imitation of Life", "All That Heaven Allows", "Magnificent Obsession" and Well others. </ b> <br /> Make no mistake: it's a cauldron, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role . There is an amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she dances wildly on loud music when her father collapses and dies on the stairs. We are led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the one who pumps gas, because she is in love with Mitch. Mitch does not want to have anything to do with her. He is so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt he is so eager to make it today, no matter how much he was in love. <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacall have less exciting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the good guy who cleaned up Kyle's picture Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on the most volatile players. <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" is an effective film in the hands of Sirk, and the big scene at the end of the mansion is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of film and, despite his many imitators, he had never had an equal.
