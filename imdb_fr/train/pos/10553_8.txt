... that this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams had worked together on a movie? This film begins with a touch of Brazil ... when, at a given moment, the story moves directly into the twilight zone ... bringing nothing new, but just nothing ... and nothing is really funny! When Dave and Andrew start exploring their new environment, the movie gets really nice ... bouncing heads? well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> anyway ... this movie was, in my humble opinion, the biggest surprise of this year's FantasyFilmFest ... <br /> <br /> As in Cube and Cypher Natali gave this one a minimalist design, strange but very special, which makes it difficult to locate the place of the story or its time ... timeless in some way ...
