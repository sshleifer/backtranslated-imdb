Indian Summer is a warm film composed of several characters, which would make a good afternoon movie (with a little editing). <br /> <br /> The film begins in the past with a group of children to whom a moose has been shown. which sets the tone before cutting in the present, when a group of adults from the "golden age" of the camp is again invited to spend a few weeks of vacation at the head of the camp, Uncle Lou. The film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters while remembering their stay at the camp and creating new memories during their last stay. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds in the quality of its characters. in this beautiful setting, and gives them room to grow without having to worry about plot developments. Watching these people remember and their relationships with each other are the focus of the film and why it works so well. He is never exaggerated and melodramatic, always keeping his warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a film where nostalgia is so well captured, and I found myself attracted although I had never been to one of these camps when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> For a warm and nostalgic character film, I sincerely recommend.
