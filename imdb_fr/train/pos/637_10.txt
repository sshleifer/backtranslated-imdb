Okay, this show is nothing but great! It has a great story and storyline, as well as great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is so hot and he's perfect for the role! He is gunna to be big in Hollywood. He has a promising future! This show lasts longer because I love this show and I hope it will be very successful! It's so interesting. I was waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it's finally here, and it's great! I record it too. I can watch it when I want it now! Too bad it's only once a week. I wish it was at least twice a week, because now I would like it to be Tuesday every day! I hope you all love this show! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashley ~
