Even though the plot was sometimes a bit dark, and VERY rushed at the end, as if the director had run out of time and needed to hurry up to finish the story, it was overall a good thing for Made-For-All. Back-Woods Kind of cable TV. <br /> <br /> However, the actress who played the babysitter, Mariana Klaveno, was very good! I hope to see it more often in the country of films. The music was also well done, making the most of the freshness of the dah-DUH-dah-DUH type music-based tension formation (think "JAWS"). <br /> <br /> I do not think I would like to look at "While the Children Sleep" again, but if I did, it would focus on the performance of the talented Klaveno.
