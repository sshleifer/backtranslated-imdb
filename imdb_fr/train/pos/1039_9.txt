I have seen this movie many times and I watched it today (on TCM) only because of Geraldine Fitzgerald. She is a very unknown actress and I must admit that I have a crush on her since I first saw her (probably in "Wuthering Heights" 40 or more years ago). The real star of this film, however, is Paul Lukas, and he deserves all the honors. He says clearly, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means. Nazism had to be stopped and anything that could help to do it was good. He explained to his children that they should not be mean, but as he said earlier when he was talking to adults, he would do that again without hesitation. Lukas gave an excellent portrait of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he had done was a very difficult thing to do. <br /> <br /> Some people think that his victim is a Nazi. I do not think he was right after the money. His Nazi associates knew it and that's why they did not use it much. <br /> <br /> An interesting point of the film, and probably also of the play, is the fact that Muller (Lucas) is a German. Although the anti-German hysteria of the First World War is not repeated, it arouses a considerable anti-German sentiment and some Germans are buried in the same way as what happened in California with people of descent Japanese. It was a kind of bravery for Hellman to write a play about the good Germans at that time (she thought maybe they were the ones who signed the German-Soviet pact!). After all, the US and British air forces bombed German cities and did not hesitate to kill innocent civilians. However, I think that the bombing and the fire in Dresden took place later, after the publication of "Watch on the Rhine". <br /> <br /> The title is kind of a play on words, because the "watch" looks to the west, from Germany. Watch am Rhein was actually a German army marching song - used during the Second World War, but the Nazis had their own song that was also used. But Muller is a German and he is engaged in his own "Wach am Rhein". <br /> <br /> All the other actors did a great job here; Although Bodo was too much, there are children like him. I'm surprised he did not reveal his father's secret. In real life, he could very well have done it.
