As far as the erotic genre is concerned, I am lucky to be able to cover the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up and looking for something else to watch. This film is different. Julie Davis (I like you do not touch me) has made two very strong actors, Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery, in this thrilling thriller. Kira is convincing as "Kim" a sweet and innocent novelist who gets caught in the seductive web of "The Man" by Doug Jeffery, a handsome stranger. Kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role and as an actress, giving what could have been just another T & A depth and credibility. I believe this is her best performance to date. And the direction of Julie Davis is a beautiful gift for eroticism.
