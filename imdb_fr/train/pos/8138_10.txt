CB4 was awful, but he may have given Cundieff a better idea. Closer to Spinal Tap than anything else, the movie is smart from the start. Surprising all those who saw it in the mid-90s. The performances are played for laughter but not so much, they are cartoon characters, rather like Marx brothers. These guys are real and slightly different. They react to situations like any of us. Well, we may not be able to get angry when our performance hats arrive late, or pull out the guns and shoot down an executive of the record company, but you get the picture. N (n *** a) W (with) H (hats) is taken seriously enough to attract you, so you are hooked. rent or get this at any price, even if you're not really into rap music, it will always let you gas out loud. Comparing this to CB4 is like comparing George Lucas's Star Wars to Gil Gerards from Buck Rogers.
