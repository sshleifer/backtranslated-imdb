Lars Von Triers Europa is a very good movie. How's Sorting in a very stylized way of telling a story, at least he did it with Europa. For me, the whole movie was an experience even if I saw it on a small TV screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this movie is the most complete, moving and moving movie, and most of the top 250 films. I also think it may be the scariest, most gothic and most complete movie ever. Okay, there are others too, but this one is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most poignant scenes of all time.
