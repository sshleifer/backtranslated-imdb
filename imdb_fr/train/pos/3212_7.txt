I watched this film a second time to try to understand why it did not have the same success (commercial or artistic) that it should have been and I discovered a considerable artistic merit - which could have been late account of having caused his commercial loss. <Br/> <br /> First of all, this film tries to make science-fiction "serious", a social commentary, rather than action-adventure. There is action, but it's not really what it's about. If you focus on that, you'll end up with (as others have noted) a bad "Aliens" clone. But, again, that's not what it's all about. <br /> <br /> The film actually talks about Todd's (Kurt Russell) transformation of a man into a quasi-machine and a man (almost * in return). But since he's not trying to give you a typical Hollywood response, Kurt Russell has to make this transformation without speaking and especially without great expressions. And it really does a great job - two views are needed to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The "social logic" that surrounds it is flawed and it is never adequately explained whether Todd's ability to defend himself against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or its new humanity or whatever, but the film is still a wonderful showcase for Russell's talent (easy to underestimate).
