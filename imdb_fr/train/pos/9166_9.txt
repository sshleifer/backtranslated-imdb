If a more masterly adaptation than this existed, you do not need to look for it; you will find everything and more in this almost perfect presentation of Charlotte Brontë's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a film that made me read the novel on which it was based, but I admit it here. Although I did not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I missed very little dialogue and intrigue, nor intensity and emotion. I only wish to explore the novel because of the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has aroused in me. <br /> <br /> I do not need to divulge anything in the form of a plot here. Let me just say this: If you may not know if you have to watch or read the beautiful story of Jane Eyre, I beg you, do not doubt it! All the atoms of power and magic that made Jane Eyre a popular classic of English literature were captured successfully in this film. <br /> <br /> What Brontë did not bring, Clarke and Dalton managed to translate under the spotlight. with prodigious intensity. The success of the film is undoubtedly due in large part to their acting prowess. <br /> <br /> Love Jane Eyre or hate her, but appreciate the richness, the vitality, the truth of the story; love the characters; love the actors; just as you would like what's great at the movies.
