~~ I could see this movie yesterday morning on a hasty pass ~~ <br /> <br /> I am a mother of 2 children, aged 11 to 6 years old. So I'm sure many parents can relate to having to see a lot of movies for kids. It was refreshing for me. I did not read this particular book, so I do not know if he stayed true to the book or not. But this has certainly brought the coarseness factor to a high level. This is the story of the "new" kid in town and there is a group of boys who have formed a club and love to pick on children ... does that sound like something to you? Have not we all suffered once? He has the little brother he can not stand and parents who annoy him. What I liked the most is to see how each character is totally different from another, they all stand out. The bully (why do they still make the bully a red head? My daughter has red hair! And she is not a bully! It took twists and you fall in love with each of them and you find really on the way for all the characters! Even the parents, good connection between father and son All around nice, sweet, funny, raw, etc ...... Take your children !!! You will enjoy as much as them!
