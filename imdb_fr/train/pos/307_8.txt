"They all laughed" is one of those little movies I always recommend to friends looking for something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the romantic traditions of the past, but it seems more contemporary. Even the decidedly early 80's atmosphere does not date too much. Bogdanovich judiciously keeps the whole enterprise so light that this reality never leads him to destroy it. But that said, this kind of short film absolutely depends on the actors, and "TAL" is lucky to have a dream cast that understands the requirements of this kind of story. It's a film that will not stay that long in memory if it were not for the small moments provided by the excellent casting: Colleen Camp at the same time cries out orders to John Ritter and his dog; Blaine Novak unleashing all these hair under his hat; and especially when Dorothy Stratten falls in love with John Ritter and says, "How ... strange." It's such a piece of fluff that you do not want to put it down too much, for fear of crushing it, but it is certain that it always leaves someone with a light heart and a smile on their face.
