In Mexico, this film was broadcast only on pay TV. The life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a faithful example of a good German and especially a good man. The conversations between the Tukur character and the Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. A real war of ideas: two different Germans, both convinced. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as a Bonhoeffer. I highly recommended this film, especially in this difficult time for the planet. In Mexico, we know little about the life and legacy of Pastor Bonhoeffer. This is a great job to save a forgotten hero.
