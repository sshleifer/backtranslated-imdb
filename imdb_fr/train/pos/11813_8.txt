Like it or hate it, it's hard not to find Warren Beatty's version of "Dick Tracy," the 1990 film adaptation of Chester Gould's famous cartoon, unlike the classic genre. Superhero movies have been off the beaten path in recent years and may soon become a genre all by itself. <br /> <br /> Beatty's film generously exploits Gould's source material, producing its effects, turning in the six films of the band. primary colors and thus giving this unique and yet familiar world of easy-triggering mutant gangsters and seductive and seductive women a lush visual style and tone. <br /> <br /> It can be said that the strong visual aesthetic of the film is extremely short - change the characters and their acting abilities, which I think can not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" savoring in his look and his dreadful characters, and Beatty himself, who plays the nail and incorruptible detective of the title, is appropriately stoic and ready to get rid of the bad guys at any cost . <br /> <br /> In addition to the visual pleasures and award-winning makeup, there is a plot and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, delightfully daring in an Oscar-nominated performance), seeks to eliminate Acy in a well-planned move, but also seeks to control all the criminal actions of the city by uniting all the gangs in conflict under him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tracy juggles with her relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who, as the name suggests, stays faithfully by her side and cares for The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who ends up finding a paternal figure to look into our devastating hero. Tracy's loyalty to Tess is challenged by the tempting temptations of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is also Big Boy's main pressure tactic. At the same time as it all goes down, things become hot when a new criminal character comes to town and decides to play both sides against the middle. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, while Beatty's attention to the tense and romantic relationships between each of the tracks becomes the focus of the material, as opposed to focusing on useless action and special effects . Pacino freely embodies the landscape in a truly remarkable role. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and most neglected comics genre. I think if Chester Gould was still alive, he'd be proud of Warren Beatty's stance on his beloved detective fighting crime. <br /> <br /> 8/10
