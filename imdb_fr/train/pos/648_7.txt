I decided to look at this because of the recommendations of this site. I must say that it was worth it. However, you should take note that this movie will last 210 minutes. If you do not have the strength to stay, save it on tape and watch it for a few nights in a row. <br /> <br /> Now, for the film, what I say will contain "spoilers" and if you do not mind, here: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a promiscuous idiot , a womanizer and a gigolo. He lives with an older woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and she provides Alex. Alex spends his days in cafes and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had already imbued Gilberte with whom he lived before. Gilberte abandoned her for a less attractive man than she liked, because Alex had abused her and beat her. At this point, Alex was ready to find a job and help raise their child before discovering that Gilberte had had an abortion and planned to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> By chance, Alexander meets a nymph nurse called Veronika and they form a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika fight for Alex's affection and have a three-in-one more. Finally, Veronika is pregnant with Alex's child and Alex asks her to marry him. We assume (as mentioned above with Gilberte's situation) that Alexander will even get a job and will be the provider of his new love and his new family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title of "The mother and the whore", I deduce that Jean Eustache related to the character of Francoise Lebrun of Veronika. She was a whore and then she became the mother. Therefore, the mother and the whore is the same person? In any case, what do I know! French films are mostly (not all) very talkative, without political purpose, preaching, drama, tasteless, deplorable and full of quotes. Lebrun and Leaud played their stubborn characters well and held the film together as part of the story got a little lost and disjointed. <br /> <br /> Not a bad effort. 7/10.
