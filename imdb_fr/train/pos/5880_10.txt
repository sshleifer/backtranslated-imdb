Unlike the person listed above, I found that this movie was really funny, especially in scenes where there is a lot of confusion. I do not want to give the plot and the scenario to people who have not watched it yet, but I will say that Paresh Rawal does not have a role as important as in previous Priyadarshan films, like Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal plays an amazing role in the small role that has been assigned to him, John Abraham does just as much. Akshay Kumar proved that he was no less in this film than in Waqt and almost all his films after Andaaz. Even if the three heroines of this movie were in their infancy, they played very well, especially Nargis, who is very beautiful and sexy. I would say that if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri, this movie is absolutely worth watching.
