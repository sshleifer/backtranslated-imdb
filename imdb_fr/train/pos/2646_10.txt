I think the majority of people do not seem to have the good idea of ​​the film, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure it's a film about addiction; it's more like a film about how these brothers of genius think, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, this is not a commercial film that you see every day and if the author wanted it, it definitely failed because most people think it's one of the many movies on the market. drug. However, I think something else is the case. As in many films describing different cultures, the public generally understands films describing their own culture, that is, something they have grown up with and are familiar with. This film aims to show what these "genies" think very often and what problems they encounter. The reason they do this is that they do not know what to say :) They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept them as if they are organizing space shuttles on a daily basis. They start a pretty hard and excellent job in no time. They feel like- I went to work, I did not do anything, I'm twice as good as the guys around me when they were doing their projects, what should I do now with my free time. And what's more boring? When you can begin to predict behavior not because you are a psychologist, but because you have already observed this trend. So for them, on the one hand, it's a little demanding job, which is also quite boring sometimes, and on the other hand, they start to understand people's behavior. This is a recipe for big boredom. And the most stupid things are usually done to get out of this state. The guys who mentioned earlier that their biggest problem is trying to understand life in terms of logic (mathematics describes logic), while life is not really a logical thing, is actually all about is right.
