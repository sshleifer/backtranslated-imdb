I looked at the pie-lette last night and the word that comes to my mind is "original". It's a little used word on television, because they all tend to copy what the other network does and you end up with seven nights of crime series, no-nonsense comedies and real-life bullshit. <br /> <br /> The first thing to do that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those who are not familiar with the British series "Carry On ..." or those who have not listened to a Harry Potter book may not know Dale. I do not know if his presence as a narrator adds or distracts. I will have to give more, but it gives the show a "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a present. It never explains where he got it, but he can take someone back from the dead for a minute. He teams up with Chi McBride ("Boston Public", Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent. All is well and is funny until he meets a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal, The dream begins, Chronology) and things get really complicated. He can not send it away and he can never touch it. Boy, would that make a relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I will be listening to see where this series is going in the hope that it will continue to entertain.
