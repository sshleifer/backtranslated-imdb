All in all, it's a good movie and, better, if the film had not been shot, the story could be hidden from the masses. Brosnan does a good job as an American with a hidden past and the photography is beautiful. For some, it may be too fancy, for others boring - for me, it's a sweet tale, well told and perfect for family watching. Now, it's not something you get a lot recently.
