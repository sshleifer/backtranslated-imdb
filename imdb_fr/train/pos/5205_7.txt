A group of American students and their guardian decide to visit the ugliest part of Ireland to study ancient religious practices. Despite repeated warnings about the dangers of off the beaten path (by the Irish natch, terch), they do, and end up inside, graciously offered by a family of consanguineous cannibals (the descendants of the infamous Sawney Bean, who, according to the stupid plot of the film, would have pushed sticks of Scotland to settle on the island of Emerald). <br /> <br /> If you think pornstars and low-budget horror automatically equate to tons of nudity play, then think again: Evil Breed is bristling with adult stars, but in reality, there There is not as much nudity as one would expect given the "talent" involved, and the acting, though worthy of Oscar, is not all that bad (except for Ginger Lynn Allen, who we know can do a wonderful "French" but whose Irish is ugly). <br /> <br /> Evil Breed begins in a superb style with the brutal massacre of a couple of lovers campers: after a brief sex under the canvas, the silicone hottie is dragged from the tent and torn in two ; the guy has his arms and legs cut off and is roasted on the spit. It's a very bloody start and auspicious for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising start, things begin to deteriorate seriously: we are introduced to the main characters, a group of twenty years who are just waiting to become cannibals and who lose a lot of time in the form of terrible false alarms, blarney on the murderous druids of local Irish madman Gary (Simon Peacock), and worst of all, a post-modernist conversation about the conventions of horror movies (what skill!) . <br /> <br /> Then, it seems that the film will never improve, the director Christian Viel decides to become serious: a guy gets a knife in his head and there is a free sex scene under the shower featuring the beautiful blonde Gillian Leigh (NOT a porn star, but I'm sure there is a career to wait if she wants it). After that, things get better quickly when the cannibals engage in a flesh-eating machine, and the film turns into a real bloodbath: Gary is pounding the machete (at about the right moment!) And strangles; Ginger Lynn kicks a mutant; Jenna Jameson is torn, eviscerated and gnawed at her silicone implant by a confused cannibal; a guy is beheaded by cheese thread; and Taylor Hayes is seen bloody, bruised and naked with a dead fetus between her legs (apparently, she was captured and used as broodstock). <br /> <br /> All of this is so horribly bloody that it's hard to sit around the least interesting worth, and Evil Breed earns a final score of 7/10. <br /> <br /> NB. Intense production and studio interference led Christian Viel to abandon the project. The covers were made and the gore was heavily cut for an American release. The good news is that, although the film is not flowing as well as it is cursed with a terrible end, the British DVD (the version I watched) seems to have been left relatively untouched. which concerns splashing. (only 13s were cut from the film altogether).
