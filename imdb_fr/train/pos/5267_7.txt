Apparently, Ruggero Deodato understood early on that his story would not work if he addressed the issue too seriously. So he decided to hide it. The result is a film that can be seen as a ridiculous and epic epic or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I'll go in the second direction. The brief bloody moments are well done, the Paul brothers openly mock the material (they even bark against each other in a scene!), And there is also a charming performance, full of excitement and good mood of Eva The street, like the girl who labels with the "boys". In addition, where can you see the inside of an illuminated dragon as a disco? (***)
