This film has a clear storyline, which is quite unusual for the musical genre. "Cats", "Phantom of the Opera" and other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber can be considered metaphorical because they use literary works as a frame. The story of "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches the heart of human relations, especially Indonesians. Although the film is based on an "alleged" fairy tale, it is actually a fantasy of "the child" in Indonesian adults. The dance sequences are not perfect, but the songs represent how Indonesians express themselves. I think the choreographer should explore the Indonesian way of dancing, not dismaying the fact that the development of dance in Indonesia tends to be more Westernized. The dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and are not synchronized with the songs and / or the music. Still, I still like this film and consider it a new wave of the kind of Indonesian film that I hope to improve in the future.
