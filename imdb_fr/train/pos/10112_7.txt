I had originally caught him in 1996 during his week-long film shoot. It impressed me and my feelings did not change much. <br /> <br /> Documentary about the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. covering his life and his films. There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. They include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. The interviews are mixed with film clips or strange recreations. It's interesting (a bit) but was it really necessary? I saw all of Wood's movies and they are just terrible. Wood had ambitions but not a talent to achieve them. I would not say he was the worst director of all time, but he is there. Do we really need a document about a very poor filmmaker? I like the fact that they did not try to make Wood a saint. More than a few of the interviewees (especially Lugosi Jr.) hated this man pretty much and the message is clear and clear. In addition, they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. It's always interesting if you're a fan of Wood. The best interviews are with Vampira (who tears Wood) and Dolores Fuller (a long-time girlfriend).
