This film, which begins with an interesting opening of two hot blondes who ride in the back of a vehicle in motion, without driver, has quite the original little personality. The cast of seven people (although a girl does not count for the count of the body, which is unfortunate because the number of dead is already so small that it is) is quite exciting, because our story is centered on teenage girls partying in the desert (a strange but effective adjustment choice), who are hunted by a terrifying man with black gloves and jeans driving a black truck. He preceded many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers"), where the killer's vehicle itself becomes a diabolical antagonist. The killer himself is pretty scary and we find comfort in the extremely friendly heroine Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in black, while our caring heroine wears all the white clothes, as lean and faded be ). Director Bill Crain does great things with his camera, neat tricks on the screen and the actors try their best. There is enough gore in the body count to please gore fans, and enough T & A of some girls to please fans of T & A. Overall, this movie is highly underrated and very much in demand in the world of cinema slasher, because it turned out rather rare to find it on video. Highly recommended.
