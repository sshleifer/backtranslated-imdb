It was really a good movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the entire baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very nice actor and very nice to watch. The chemistry of the team once it's done is spectacular, it shows what you can accomplish when minds come together to do one thing. This team has returned to the brink after several losing seasons to win just about everything. I love movies like this one because they are really inspiring. <br /> <br /> In addition, the character of Dennis Quaid gets a place in the major leagues. You can not do anything, but root for this guy. It just seems that when someone is supposed to do something, he will do it. It turns out that things get in place and make everything click. <br /> <br /> This film, based on a true story, will really make you think that "nothing is impossible."
