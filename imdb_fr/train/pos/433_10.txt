It's one of those rare films, it's charming and convincing, dignified and original, a real gift. I consider this a prerequisite for any trip to Italy, or even all holidays, because it reminds you to open up to a wider experience (yes, find magic). I especially liked Josie Lawrence, as Lottie Wilkins, but every main and second actor is flawless in this film. In addition, the costumes, if you are attracted by fashion and costumes, are extremely well made. I just wish they released it on DVD because I wear my cassette version! <br /> <br /> Absolutely your time, make sure you sit down to watch it, without any interruption.
