I spent years looking for a copy of this movie (16mm, dvd, vhs) to be able to show it to my children. The film is fun, and Spike and his band members explain why they were the best musicians on the market. They had to be as good to play as crazy. I love it and recommend it to moviegoers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The film tells a fire station of the beginning of the century, with a team of deceivers who are firefighters and the group of the department (without fighting fires). There are common gags, plus the chaos of Spike Jones and his orchestra. In addition, comedian Buddy Hackett and boy Hugh O'Brien were filled.
