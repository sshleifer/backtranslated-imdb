Very slippery, very pre-code Hays, and always very sassy. I highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you are not a fan of Stynwyck. She's funny, sexy and hardworking - and loves her permeability! <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a braggart who takes her place in the world and is perfectly represented by a bank. John Wayne (in costume!) Play one of his first conquests. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are a disappointment, but the sets, the lines, the clothes are added to a sacred film on the vertical rise in horizontal position.
