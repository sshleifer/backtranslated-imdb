It's a beautiful film ... The first impressions of cynicism and cruelty are soon dispelled by an amusing demonstration of how the lower motivations of men and women diverge (Long live the difference!) <br /> <br /> > You can love people despite sometimes because of their weaknesses. Humans are a little crazy, but we have a big heart and we do our best, despite the temptation. It's not our fault that sometimes we can not resist temptation, that's who we are. <br /> <br /> Elegance is constant from beginning to end; sharp photography and clean composition, very nice visualization when you add challenging content, well-adapted music and funny scripts. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the very young "lonely voice" ... brilliant; the wisdom of innocence balancing the comedy of the human condition.
