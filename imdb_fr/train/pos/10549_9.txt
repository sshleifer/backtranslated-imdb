I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival and I hope it will grow because I want to see it again! It's a character-driven movie, and Andrew and David are up to the task. Any discussion of the plot could be considered <br /> <br /> as a mess. So I will simply say that the scenario is intelligent, the acting is superb and the effects are incredible. Well filmed and well paced too. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and very refreshing in this summer of sad movies <br /> <br />. The audience laughed all the time. See if you can. (I especially liked the "Candy bar! Candy bar!" Scene.)
