Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this film, funny, tender, brave and in love.It gives a superior dimension to a film that is even a masterpiece, as much by the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) that by history or rhythm. Never boring, always creating new emotions: for me, the best French film of all time.
