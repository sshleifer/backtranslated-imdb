It's a film about life, the triumph of adversity and the wonders of the human spirit. I challenge anyone not to shed a tear at the end of the film. It's more than just a tearful, it's an engaging and challenging drama, with excellent performances from the actors, but especially from Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. Seven years later, I'm surprised that Luke is still a virtual unknown and Washington has made only one other film. Nevertheless, apart from a slow implementation, the story of the struggles and tribulations of this foster child and the way in which he continues to affect him as an adult is the kind of film that you have long after the have seen. Like many images of fox projectors, it was more of a hit in bed and did not praise the mass criticism it deserves. The scene where Antwone finally meets her mother sums up the film for me. There were so many ways to proceed. It could have been completely ridiculous or unrealistic, but Washington set the right tone, his mother never said. a word and could only shed a tear, while anowne simply asked why. Her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend herself? One of the most moving cinematic scenes I've seen.
