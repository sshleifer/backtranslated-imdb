'Arms and the Man' is one of Shaw's funniest pieces if handled properly, and this production does its job pretty well. Helena Bonham-Carter, star before the film, is Raina, daughter of a military family, who has the peacock of a fiance (Patrick Ryecart) and who houses an enemy soldier (Pip Torrens) during a raid on the city. . <br /> <br /> Full of color and energy, this production is proceeding at a good pace and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit, as a cleaning lady, are a little surpassed by the rest of the cast, they hold always ground. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are lovely, and the whole room is generally happy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
