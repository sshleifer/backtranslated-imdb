High school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrifying onslaught on their high school. As they begin the murderous countdown to their last act of revenge, they both launch a video diary to explain their feelings and tell their story. <br /> <br /> There is another similar film like this, entitled "Elephant". Why am I talking about it? To compare the two films, of course. I must say that although I liked "Elephant", it's a much better movie. What is the difference, you ask? Well, to begin with, it was shot differently, in the lineage of "Cloverfield", "Blair Witch Project" and "Diary of the Dead". This makes the movie all the more interesting as it is much more painfully realistic. <br /> <br /> But what convinced me was that the film was ready to show "the other side of history". You get to know these two shooters, unlike "Elephant". In fact, I was worried about one of the shooters and I could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This film makes you really nice with these people and it's a good thing because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, that's why I almost cried in this movie. The characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions. You get to understand them. It's not like they want to kill people to get attention. Overall, this film is emotionally gripping and very haunting and far better than "Elephant".
