Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fantastic adventure for kids, featuring Angela Lansbury as a witch apprentice who, with the help of three evacuee children and a "witchcraft teacher", thwarts a Nazi invasion. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly inventive, with lots of laughter, this film will delight children of all ages with its great characters, exciting story and catchy tunes. Lansbury is perfect like Eglantine, the not-so-perfect witch who takes the three kids on a life adventure, and her three young co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are as impressive as the Cockney. rogues who help fight the evil Hun. <br /> <br /> The special effects are a bit old-fashioned, but let's face it, kids do not care about those things as long as they're entertained. And entertained, they will be. With impressive scenes blending brilliantly real action and animation, and cinematic magic much truer than a hundred Harry Potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escape. In fact, only a fairly long musical number set in Portobello Road preserves the film's perfection, but with so many other things to savor, it can easily be forgiven. <br /> <br /> And moreover, any movie featuring British television The legend Bruce Forsyth as "Flash" Harry's style is a good note from me.
