I did not think that at all, but my friend said that the first thing he thought about when he heard the title "Midnight Cowboy" was a gay porn. At that time, all I knew about him was the reference that was made in that episode of "Seinfeld" in which Jerry was trying to get Kramer to Florida on that bus and Kramer was all sick and had the nose in blood. <br /> <br /> The movie was awesome, and surprisingly optimistic and not pessimistic pretentious like some movies I do not even remember, because they're all crappy. <br /> <br /> The plot was essentially a young, cowardly cowboy, Joe Buck. in New York, trying to become a prostitute (a prostitute, roughly), thinking it would be an easy task, but to hit hard against the brick wall when a woman eventually pushes him to push him, accusing him of his sexual intercourse. <br /> <br /> Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, nicknamed "Ratso" by everyone and gay guys who make fun of him all the time. You think of him as a scoundrel, but an adorable one (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and, surprisingly, he and Joe become friends, and the movie is so sweet and comforting to see them be friendlier, and so on. Rizzo turns out to be a sad and pitiful man, very sick, very depressed and self-conscious. He hates being called "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks life will be a lot better and that all his problems will be solved. and he will learn to be a cook and to be famous there. <br /> <br /> It's comforting to see Joe doing all he can to bring them both to Florida, with many hilarious moments (like Ratso trying to steal food at this hippie party, and get caught by the woman who says, "Well, you know, it's free, you do not have to steal it." and he says, "Well, if it's free, I will not steal." , and this completely impromptu and unexpected classic moment when Hoffman is almost hit by this cab, and shouts "Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking here!"), and the game is so believable, you'd never have thought that Joe Buck would become the distinguished and respected actor Jon Voight, and that Ratso Rizzo would become the legendary and beloved Dustin.Hoffman.This is not the first time they work together in leading roles, but the chemistry is so thick and intense Then, there is the sad aspect that I find it rather exaggerated to call it "depressing." Ratso Rizzo is in the process of No collapse throughout the film, can hardly walk, barely eat, coughs a lot, is sick and reaches a head on the bus en route to Florida. He is in pain and, a few miles from Miami, he finally dies on the bus. The bus driver reassures everyone that nothing is wrong and continues. Sad, but not in the way that would make you go home, cry and miserably miserable as if you had just lost your 13-year-old dog. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's an excellent film. And the soundtrack is about "Everybody's Talking" played all the way through the film at the right moments, a strange but excellent gesture, because the song is good and fits perfectly with the tone of the film. see, it's great, go buy it
