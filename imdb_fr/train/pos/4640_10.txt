It's one of the best films I've seen in the last two years (I saw the Prime Minister in Tel Aviv, Israel, in the summer of 2006, just when the last war broke out. ..). This problem of communication between people, those who provoke wars, interest me for a long time, regardless of boys and girls, heterosexuals and homosexuals, Jews and Arabs ... I have already seen the bubble 3 times, and it's always This surprises me and excites me - each character reminds me of one of the many people I know, and the difference between them, as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I have it I saw - it was with my friend, who is an Arab Christian. and it was Israel's Independence Day (the most symbolic I could, how ironic) and ... he finally cried !!! - If he was touched and not embarrassed - everyone would be hit by the bubble!
