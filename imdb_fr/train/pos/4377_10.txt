The beginning in the mid-90s was, in my opinion, a highlight for the historical drama. Rob Roy, the last of the Mohicans, described a distinctive passion and intensity at their respective times. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was the unique and intriguing taste of a place and a place rarely represented by the film. There is really everything - an interesting story, an excellent performance, a remarkable dialogue and breathtaking landscapes. I was particularly impressed by the seemingly genuine dialogue. I imagine that is how the people of the early 18th century spoke and behaved. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that surprised me is the vulgarity expressed by the characters. I found it more repulsive and shocking, though often more subtle, than most movies in modern movies. The film had a very racy and sexually charged, unique and probably very realistic in the context of the time. <br /> <br /> The pace was very tight, with barely a moment of boredom. There were many intrigues and political sub-intrigues that complicated things a bit, without harming the main story. <br /> <br /> The action was also very well done and captivating. What I will always find amazing is that during the film's flagship action piece, there is no soundtrack. This is a very tense and exciting sequence, as we have no musical clues as to the direction and resolution of the scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always be at the top of my list of favorite movies. I would recommend it to everyone.
