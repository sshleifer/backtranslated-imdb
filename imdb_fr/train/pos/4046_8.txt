Rohmer returns to her historical dramas in the true story of Grace Elliot, an Englishwoman who remained in France at the height of the French Revolution. It has always been suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but who knew him reactionary to red blood. If you can put aside the unscrupulous defense of Rohmer's monarchy (and that's not easy, since, for example, the French lower classes are portrayed here as hideous thugs), it's actually a elegant, smart and polite film. . Lacking money for a great 18th-century cinematic recreation in France, Rohmer instead made the actors play against obvious painted cards. It's obviously artificial vanity, but it works somehow. And newcomer Lucy Russell manages to make sympathy a character that should not be.
