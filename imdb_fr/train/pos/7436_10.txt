This filmed presentation of the film "The Rhyme of the Old Mariner" is a very beautiful and interesting interpretation of Coleridge's mesmerizing poem. The vivid cinematography, combined with a collection of two centuries of effort to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world-renowned artists, and the superb narrative of Michael Redgrave, are well worth the time to see this great visual work. <br /> <br /> In the age of television, such work is a valuable tool for encouraging young students, as well as adults, to explore and learn the value of great poetry. To my knowledge, this type of work is really rare. it is regrettable. As a student of world literature and a former university professor and academic advisor, I think more great epic poems like Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner should be translated. Although I am not a film critic, but as a diligent reader of classical literature, I am happy to recommend this beautiful production without any reservations.
