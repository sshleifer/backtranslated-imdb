I remember the first time I saw this short film, I laughed so much, that as in many other films I've seen, no sound came out! Curly is really good at "singing" opera in this one, I'm surprised he did not consider a career as a professional singer, because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you noticed that this was turned towards the end of Curly's career as a Stooge, you will find that he changed because he had lost weight and was thinner, his voice 's sink, his face was gnawing with wrinkles, although he still could do it, he looked to be fifty to forty years old. It was because he was suffering from many minor strokes before his big one that ended his career. But he still managed to succeed in his last! <br /> <br /> If you do not like the fact that Curly is really sick at this point, it's actually one of their funniest shorts. I know that the fact that Curly really changes did not bother me, because I always thought he was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
