In a sense, this movie reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Do you remember Whoopi Goldberg at the shredder? Whoopi eliminated the tranquillizers? Whoopi like Blind Lemon and imitating Mick Jagger? Of course the good times were filmed, but the film is still not good, right? That's what I feel about "Rich In Love". A man hears his wife singing for the first time. Post-coital teens talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream in a bucket and, in another scene, wakes up pleasantly with regard to his absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to his wardrobe. But there is only the murmur of a plot here and you can not wait for it to move. The Graces by Charlotte Caffey, a former Go-Gos band, gives a picture of a great pop song ... the picture is awake ... and it's over! <br /> <br /> This image is the equivalent of a lazy summer day in the deep South American.
