This is the last Dutch film directed by Paul Verhoeven before shooting in mainstream Hollywood movies "Basic Instinct", "Robocop" and "Total Recall", among others. He opens the way by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in his web before meeting Gerard Reve, a boring and boring writer with morbid imagination. Gerard was invited to speak at a literary club meeting in a coastal town about an hour from Amsterdam. Verhoeven lets us see how Gerard's imagination distorts reality. When asked if the writers are a little close to madness, he admits when he reads the newspaper "and he says" boom ", I read" woe ", when he says" flood ", I read" blood ", when he says "red", I see "dead. "When he tells a story enough times, he begins to believe it," I'm lying the truth. "He accepts the offer to be the guest for the night of the club treasurer, a gorgeous wealthy salon owner. As he gets to know her and learns that her husband is dead, he begins to imagine that she is "a black widow." Is it her plus of her reality twist or is she a murderer? a psychological drama and by telling me which of these old movies was etched in my memory, I understood that it was my favorite genre, and looking at his corpus, it seems to be Paul Verhoeven's too, and he's a Master in questioning our own understanding of reality, it's a good change of pace from the usual Hollywood price, I saw it in 1983 and it's a movie that "stuck".
