This is where the term "classic film" comes from. It is a wonderful story of bravery, courage and extreme loyalty on the part of a woman. Poor Olan was sold to her indifferent husband who, over the years, has come to appreciate him. (Yeah yes, a pearl !!) <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer was the beautiful star who won the Academy Award for best actress the year before for her small role (and what an Oscar mess) in "The Great Zigfield". It really did not show what talent, if any, she had other than her exotic beauty. But in "Good Earth", she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she did not have big costumes either. People say she did not show real emotions in this movie. Like hell. Her character Olan is a timid shy woman with inner strength. She is silent during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. Example: these scenes during the fall of the city and the time when looters were shot. If you say that his role in the movie is bad, you are NOT watching! <br /> <br /> Paul Muni shows that he can also act. His character does not please me. He never sees her as she is, until the very end of the story. A sweet, loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own beauty. The greatest of all, the beauty of the interior, like a pearl. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, watch it. You will see one of the best movies created by Hollywood's golden age.
