Such a delicious movie! Very comforting. We can not help but fall in love with the character of Gigi. He is adorable in his childhood and becomes a sensitive artist. The whole film revolves around him. He lives in a wonderful world ?? live all your life ?? curiosity, desire and anticipation. There is an elder brother who tries to steal his glory but remains in the shadows all his life. The father is very stereotyped Italian and the mother too. I wanted the father to come and meet with the mother in the last scene ?? and make them cry and laugh. I would also like there to be at least something that redeems the older brother. His personality seems to have been completely destroyed. Passion and ardor ?? it's the key to life. And looking through the camera ?? focusing on the small details and savoring the delicate details of life.
