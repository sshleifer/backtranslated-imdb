Splendid film that, in just eight minutes, displays a mixture of unusual genre: mystery, thriller, musical. In short, we are allowed to tell the story: a girl enters a European cafeteria then ... Sweet transition from insane mystery to narrative logic. Vigalondo has managed to seduce in black and white thanks to his imagination and despite (thanks to) the tightest budgets. <br /> <br /> Because of the unity of space-time, the film reaches the intensity of a short poem (almost a haiku). Spain, land of fast poetry in black and white ("Do you remember the beginning of Bu√±uel?). <br /> <br /> A place not to be missed to reassure our faith in young cinema outside the United States.
