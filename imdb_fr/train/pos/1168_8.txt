Tony Arzenta, a hit Sicilian or a professional Sicilian assassin, decides to leave the company, but his former employers do not agree. In terms of content, this very nice action movie does not have one; in terms of pure fun, it's fun - it's very melodramatic, violent, quite brutal, the car chases are remarkable. "Arzenta" is an unpretentious and yet very nice film - much better than the current Hollywood trash with the same label. This comes from Delon's rather short flirtation with the 1970s B Italian cinema. He carefully uses Delon's hard character, belonging to the gallery of foolish thugs he made in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really appreciated the fact that Delon shot this film, that he played a role in a good movie Eurocrime. <br /> <br /> The score is very good, with a good introductory song This is what the Italians considered a synthetic work, where the musical art plays an important role. <br /> <br /> In Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out, the very attractive Erika Blanc (31 years old in '73) appears as an unnamed whore. At the same time, Sandra, Arzenta's girlfriend , is played by Carla Gravina (a star who almost left the cinema after '75). <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" It is interesting to film - an ambitious visual design, particular expressionist angles. The film was directed by the prolific Duccio Tessari, the one who also shot Zorro (comedy Delon). Needless to mention, these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very different. The first is a violent violent melodramatic film. action film - the second is a light comedy, closer to a parody, although remarkably coherent and made with talent.Duccio Tessari has directed films like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Son of Satan, The butterfly stained with blood, Â¡Viva La Muerte ... Tua! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
