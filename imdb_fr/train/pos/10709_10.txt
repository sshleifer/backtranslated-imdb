This film really woke me up, as if it woke up the main character of this film bravely different from the sleep of his life. <br /> <br /> This guy, John (Ben Chaplin) leads the mediocre life of a bank teller in a small English provincial town, until Nadia (Nicole Kidman), a wild girl and Deceased, ordered by e-mail from Russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, according to Johns' plan. However, a little problem arises - Nadia does not speak a word of John's language. Although calm and emotionless outside, John is so interested in the beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the correspondence service, he buys him a dictionary to start the process of communication. <br /> <br /> What's happening now in the plot really shakes poor John from his sleep from a well-paid casual employee into a decently-thinking decision-maker, giving the viewer a subliminal message "you probably would have acted the same way. " <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz form a great acting Russian team and they are almost indistinguishable from reality, "almost" only because of the slight accentuation present in their Russian dialogues, so light that it may surprise a Russian by the hard work done so that the words sound good. Nicole Kidman proves once again her talent by interpreting a character very different from the previous roles, at least because of its cultural context. <br /> <br /> The film is fast and captivating, and you're certainly not ready If you stop watching when the ending titles appear, you feel like you're in the middle of the plot and you want to see the rest as soon as she comes out. <br /> <br /> My advice is go out and get this movie immediately and watch it and enjoy it. To summarize, he has an unusual plot, an excellent interpretation and ideas under the surface. Like the idea of ​​the "brutal awakening" of the artificial routine life of a wheel in a Society machine, the life that the Fight Club members were so anxious to leave and the machine Pink Floyd sings ("Welcome to the machine! "). I bet in the end, John was rather left with Sophia who was heading for the unknown than not to have met her at all. <br /> <br /> Thank you, writers, for the beautiful story and all the others for that. super movie! Please make a sequel! And you can stage it anywhere and name the place of your choice, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to 99.9999% of potential viewers, I'm sure.
