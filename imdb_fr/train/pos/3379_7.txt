In the 1970s, Charlton Heston played in sci-fi films of varying quality. "Soylent Green" is one of the best. He plays Robert Thorn, detective in New York in 2022. In the future, most foods are so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But when Thorn discovers the deplorable truth about this product, he finds himself on the run. <br /> <br /> I guess it's quite natural that this film looks dated today. Nevertheless, this raises interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture. Also with Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in his last role).
