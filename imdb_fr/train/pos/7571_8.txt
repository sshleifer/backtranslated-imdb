This game ranks first and foremost so far. I had the honor of playing mine on PS2 and the graphics were really good. The dubbing was above the norm. The difficulty level is right. Wesker must be in my opinion the best character in the RE series. The story amazed me and took many variations that I did not expect. The only note that this game deserves is great.
