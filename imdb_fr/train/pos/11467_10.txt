It's the best movie I've met for a long time. It's not just the best film of its kind (shooting at school). The way Ben Coccio (the director) decided to shoot was magnificent. He filmed it with teenage actors who were still in high school. He filmed it in the actors' own room and used the real parents of the actors as their parents in the film. In addition, the actors also filmed with camcorders, which made them look more like a video diary. It's almost clever. (If that's a word) There are some errors however, for example when Cal calls brads (?) A rover range rover (or vice versa, it's been a long time since I've seen it)
