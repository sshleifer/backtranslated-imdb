One of my friends, a French actress, dragged me into this film about four years ago. <br /> <br /> During the first half hour, I was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, hating this movie. hate me and even hate the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened, but I was trained in the film like I had not been in years. And this despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to make every change by hand. I was at the theater for almost four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I believe that great movies take you into a world, become part of it, and allow you to chat with your friends over a coffee or a drink. This movie did that. This is one of the best filming experiences I have ever had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
