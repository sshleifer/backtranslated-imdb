I read the book and saw the movie. Both excellent. The film is a diamond among the embers at this time. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without fail. This film should have made them stars. Shame on the studio for not putting all they had behind this movie. It could easily have been a franchise. The release on DVD is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film. Look for it in your TV guide and, if you see it, even if it's late, look at it. You will not be disappointed. Do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). It will surprise you. Times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to think they did it.
