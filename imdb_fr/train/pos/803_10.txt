As you may have already seen Star Wars: Come back from the Jedi, you may know it's a good movie, but as you may have seen on video, they might have a party at the end and they will probably finish the movie with the party with no wits or anything, but on the original (Live TV) when they are partying, but before saying more when Ben obi-wan dies in the imperial ship or the death star, they saw him disappear and Yoda died of old age or internal illness But because Luke killed Darth Vader (his real name: Anakin Skywalker) when they are all partying at the end , when Luke or someone stops the spirits of Ben and Yoda stands by his side and smiles while another spirit appears is his Dark Vader but not like a Sith, the old habitual, separates from him and started to smile with Ben and Yoda I think this made the movie ends a little interesting But the producers or all the world e should create a spirit of Padme and Mace Windu and other Jedis killed with Younglings Under There are weapons the bottom
