and it's a very disturbing film. Maybe I'm wrong, but this is the last film where I saw Burt Reynolds as a real actor, who transformed the role and sent a message. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They are unpretentious and unconscious; businessmen who want to enjoy the country. They did not know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Photography and scenery are realistic and natural. It was before the days of Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> What is most disturbing in this film is the fact that places like this still exist. In America, peasants still hate city dwellers; It has been almost a century and a half since the civil war began. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was filmed in the rural areas of South Georgia, which still exist. Just do not go to Mobile, Alabama; This area has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
