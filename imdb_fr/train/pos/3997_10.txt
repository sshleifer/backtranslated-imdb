What a moving film. I have a dear friend who is in her 60s and who has been telling me for the last 15 years that people do not see her anymore, and she longs for the company. Being in her late forties, I start to see what she's complaining about. You are no longer young, beautiful or touchable. When May says "... this piece of body ..." wow. How our bodies change and how we are told that it is no longer beautiful. I love when she starts to change what she wears ... the colorful scarf ... the more the frumpy woman. <br /> <br /> It's a sad and wonderful picture at the same time. Sad in that may betrays the trust of her daughter ... beautiful in that it is through the difficulty of the case, and chooses to move on and finally have his own life. I like characters who even dare to initiate their love story. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, I like the film because it's finally an image that shows the complex nature of relationships, whether family or not. We see Paula's vulnerability, but she will have what she wants at all costs ... (when she tells her mother that she will have a baby for Darren, whether he has one or not after his mother asks him if Darren wants a child or not). The film shows how relationships can change, while revealing what it has always been, dormant. May stifled her own creativity to raise a family. A family she did not really want, but that was "something you did when she was young". I love the scene where Darren calls her an old pie, and she smiles and says, "I never called myself that before." It was really a movie gem. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig. Well, I just like it. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is he pleasant to watch, he is a real talent. What a neat role. He is much more than any 007 who is safe and I look forward to seeing him play more roles of this nature. The scene where he pleases May and the look he gives her is, in a way, a marvel of being able to exercise such control over this woman, and also of pleasure to be able to give it to him. He really likes to give him pleasure. A wonderful scene. The contrast is the love scene with Bruce. Bruce is totally absorbed in his own pleasure ... two completely different men. <br /> <br /> Alas ... I wonder where is my Darren?
