Until today, I had never seen this movie. His film was shot on the sets of Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bats suck the blood of the villagers. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it's a really good film that has an atmosphere to spare. and a cast that does not want to stop, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas interpret the character of Brettschnieder, which interests me because it was the maiden name of my great grandmother. <br /> <br /> a carefully modulated film that has suspense and spiritual lining that builds slowly for its short run time, only going astray when about ten minutes before the end, they realized they had little time to pack everything. From this point to the end, it's a straight race to the end with very little fun that preceded it. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb record 71 minutes and prevent shorter prints. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin may be wrong, and in this case, I think they are from a source that trusts me, says that the total time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia The scrambling about this is crazy, but since most of the copies that are available tend to run about 60-63 minutes, the amount of missing material is considerably less if it lasts only 67 minutes. Personally, I think that it will not matter much, since it is at most five minutes and I doubt very much that the film succeeds or cancels the progress of the film. <br /> <br /> Whatever the duration of your film, if you like old grumpy movies, do not miss to watch this movie, it's a great black and stormy movie night.
