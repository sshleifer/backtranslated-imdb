First of all, I am a white man and straight. But even with this handicap, I love this film. It's about real people. A real time and place. And of course, New York City in the '80s. I had a lot of gay friends growing up in New York in the' 80s and the only thing I've ever admired about them is their courage to live their lives as they intended. It does not matter the consequences. It's courageous. You must admire this. It's a fantastic movie, watch it and discover the man of a flamboyant African American or Hispanic homosexual in New York in the eighties. It's the real life. In the end, it's the real life.
