In fact, I really like what I've seen of this caricature so far. Of course, the animation is not the best, but frankly, I would prefer to see this type of more cartoon style be done quickly and cheaply than the old type of style to be done quickly and cheaply (which started to perform more and more often ... it's only a style that looks good when you put in a lot of time and effort). There is nothing wrong with the angular lines and small dotted eyes - in fact, I think it's really cute. As a child, I never thought that Scooby-Doo's design was particularly adorable, but I think I might like it better. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Shaggy has always been my favorite character, and believe it or not, but I think he has the most potential for some depth. Of course, the series is not centered on the original "Mystery Resolution" theme, but it was still an old tired formula. Do not get me wrong, I'm sure some writers would be able to generate more interest in the traditional activities of Mystery Inc. (which were recently missing), but in the meantime, show is a fun away from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny, but it's not just a comic relief. They are always cowardly, but finally have the opportunity to use what appears to be intelligence (shock!). It's always the same old slackers who eat too much, but now they seem to be living their lives with the help of Uncle Albert's legacy. <br /> <br /> I used to find Scooby-Doo's most original jokes. to be pure cheese and unintentionally hilarious at best, but this show actually exerts a capacity for true humor. Also, I do not really like Casey Kasem as Shaggy, so the new actor does not annoy me as much as the others. (I still think Billy West was the best, though) <br /> <br /> Overall, although it's not a big cartoon in the whole story of drawing animated, it remains a feat among other incarnations of Scooby.
