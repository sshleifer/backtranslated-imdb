I can not believe that we do not have this show of the 70's anymore. I have all the 8 seasons of this show of the 70's !! I absolutely love it !! I went to bed each night and watched several episodes before falling asleep. At the end of a long busy day, it's nice to relax and laugh before going to sleep. I was so sad that they took the series ... at least we still have the re-runs !! I hope and pray that they will come back with at least one meeting ... As maybe when Donna has finished her studies and we can finally see her and Eric will get married !!!! Would not it be great !!! It would be even better if they continued for several years !!
