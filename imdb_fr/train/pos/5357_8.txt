This cartoon style movie is funny, has a well-paced action and a great futuristic style. Writer Steven de Souza, who also wrote Commando, gives Arnie a lot to say: "Send me a copy," after signing a contract and stabbing a pen in the back of the lawyers; "What a pain in the neck", after strangling subzero with barbed wire; "He must have split" after slicing his body between his legs; and finally, as Killian slips through a billboard with his own face, Arnie concludes, "Now, that's fine." Curiously enough, some similarities are reminiscent of a few more similarities, another science fiction film starring Schwarzenegger.
