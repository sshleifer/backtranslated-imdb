I loved this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did an amazing job in describing Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding with her young son in a mysterious past. As an angllophile who loves novels ... this film was just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone looking to escape a few hours in 19th century England. I must also mention that Toby Stephens, who represents the very magnetic Gilbert Markham, is reason enough to watch this wonderful production.
