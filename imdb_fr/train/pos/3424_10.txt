The information in this film is a little familiar to many people who have recently paid attention to the news. The scandals of Walter Reed show that we do not take care of our injured heroes on their return. <br /> <br /> What the film still shows is a truth common to all wars. The psychological trauma suffered by soldiers when they are at war and the difficulties they experience when they return to civilian life. They are not just changed or affected, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with this because they do not know each other. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film shows what the army does to our young men. for women by preparing them for war and the policies and practices they must follow in order to continue a war that causes a whole psychological trauma. <br /> <br /> We have more than 3,000 soldiers killed during the four years of this invasion. ; but we have tens of thousands of people who will suffer physical and psychological trauma for life because of this war. Regardless of which side you are on, it is up to you to know the cost of the war to decide if we should be in this area. This film perfectly illustrates the costs for men and women.
