Well, I guess I'm emotionally attached to this film because it's the first movie I went to see more than 10 times at the cinema ... helping me throughout my thesis, or rather stopping me from work on it! <BR/> <br /> But after reviewing this film several years later (and many movies), what a gem well designed! I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr. Knightley - where do we meet such a man ??? <<< sigh >>> Sophie Thompson's turn as Ms Bates is a virtuoso actor of the finest (oh, napkins, sorry!) and the rest of the cast is not a disappointment either - Toni Colette brings a lot of Muriel to her Harriet, and Ewan McGregor has a compelling charm - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect "impossible" couple! <br /> <br /> Of course, the sets and costumes as well as the beautiful soundtrack contribute greatly to the feeling of well-being, almost the Hobbiton The atmosphere of the film - although as regards the cinematography and the art decoration, it's almost a visual overload. Very very pretty, but a little more austerity could have given a better sense of the time. But what's good is that the film does not take itself too seriously and that there is a lot of fun - and a few nice montages - that prevent it from sinking into the saccharine mode of Merry Old England. <br /> <br /> Mon The ball scene is particularly popular - there are some great actors and directors here, and the final dance sums up the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley. Too bad that the scene of the final proposal extends a little too long - two shots (I can think exactly of those!) And it would have been much more in sync with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> My God, I just realized (reading the imdb listings) that I saw Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without even knowing it was him - it seems he has a lot more for him, as an actor, just to be a gentlemanlike English idol! Hmm, I guess I have to visit my video store ... <br /> <br /> Nice movie. My favorite adaptation to Jane Austen so far - although Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility is, strictly speaking, the best film, this one is the most important to me - and I've certainly seen it many times ! Watch him if you can - and do not be too hard on his small imperfections. <br /> <br />
