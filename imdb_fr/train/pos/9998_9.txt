Since the average number of votes was quite low and the video store clerk thought it was "OK", I did not have many expectations when renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But unlike the top, I loved it. It's a charming movie. He does not need to grow on me, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a great performance as a main character, I think a little different from his usual character in his films. <br /> <br /> There are not many jokes or anything, but there are some hilarious scenes. and, overall, it's a very nice movie and very easy to watch. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended
