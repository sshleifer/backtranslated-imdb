<br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. One of those rare films that Hollywood really does not do anymore. William H Macy is just awesome as a hitboy with a soul, and Neve Campbell is just fantastic as a woman who puts his life on the path of redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see this movie. He deserves his praise
