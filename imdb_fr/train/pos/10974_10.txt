Why should you watch this? There is certainly no reason not to watch it! Superbly done and amusing by Albert and David Maysles, Gray Gardens was originally intended to be a film about the gentrification of East Hampton, but it appeared to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of both Edith Bouvier Beales, aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Their life was certainly fun (Edith spent most of her day singing operas, Edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats, one named Ted Z. Kennedy). The film is interesting because it is both funny and sad. Edith died shortly after the release of the film (in February 1977), at the age of 82, after experiencing the celebrity she and Edie enjoyed after the film (she danced and sang at a discotheque Edie Beale Jr was born in 1925 and still lives in Miami.) Beach.This film is both engaging and mesmerizing.
