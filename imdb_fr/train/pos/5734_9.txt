I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works, as he provides viewers with absolutely unique animated images with typical "Lynch elements". Having seen most of his works, I naively thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was completely wrong. Dumbland is something I could never have imagined as David Lynch. Nevertheless, after recovering from the first shock, I began to reflect on this extremely primitive main character and came to the conclusion that all the nonsense, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here reflect fragments of reality, accentuated by deforming them. There are things in our lives that we rarely emphasize, because they are disgusting or horrible, yet they surround us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these fragments. This is not a film to enjoy, even if you sometimes laugh at a strange and perverse sense of humor, it's a lively reflection of everything we refuse to respect, with its simplicity, its morbidity and its absurdity. Take things as they are, you do not need to love them. It exists. Finally, if you are attentive enough, you will also find typical elements of Lynch. I recommend it to tolerant people !!!
