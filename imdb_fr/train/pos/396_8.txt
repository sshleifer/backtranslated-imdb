The legend of Zu <br /> <br /> I remember very well the original Zu Warriors of Tsui Hark, made 18 years ago. During a Christmas, a rare week when Channel 4 in the UK aired a week of movies in Hong Kong, Zu Warriors was so captivating for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it was etched in the memory of now big up sprog ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the original movie Zu Warriors is one of the first films I saw as a child, which I remember well the screenplay and scenes Action. And memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their premium bonus. <br /> <br /> So when I saw this remake of Zu Warriors, there was a feeling of apprehension. Could he defeat the dream childhood memories that I had of the original, or will he follow the path of other remakes and die of a death more horrible than the bad guys and their broken necks that the are these kung-fu movies? <br /> <br /> Well, the answer is that I can not say. But that's because it's not really a remake. Stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /> <br /> The Legend of Zu tells the story of King Sky, a lone warrior, whose mistress, Dawn, declares his love but his life is lost. from her by a monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later, insomnia comes back, Dawn is reincarnated enigma and insomnia came back to destroy Zu. Meanwhile, White Eyebrows and Red are trying, with the help of King Sky, to put an end to insomnia. <br /> <br /> The plot is not rich in twists, but it had enough details for me to stay interested. But I can see this movie as the one you like or hate. The film speaks a lot about special effects, the majority involving several computer-generated environments, much like The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two films, this film was not an exaggerated graphic and was in good taste. Nothing seems rushed - unlike Hero. The sets were complementary to the acting game and did not dominate the scenes at all. <br /> <br /> The story also involves a lot of characters and the mix of so many people makes the movie intriguing. It was perhaps on the verge of "too many cooks", but in general each character had his part in the story. But some of the roles seem to be "extended cameos" in my opinion, and I have to somehow question the need. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play very central roles in the film, but I can not say that this film showed their best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems at least to have matured in her acting, but it is still quite raw. Kelly Lin was the new revelation for me. Despite his very short role, I apologize and admit to ogle! <br /> <br /> Overall, I must say that I enjoyed this film as much as the original. Since both films were made by the legendary Tsui Hark, the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film production in Hong Kong has changed over the past two decades. And one of the advantages of this process is the fact that you can not really compare the two films, as long as the apples are apples and the pears are pears. <br /> <br /> In the end, both films are quite enjoyable. right. And I go back to my memories by watching the original again. <br /> <br /> Two to look at, but not to compare.
