I saw the Thin Man series - Powell and Loy are really great, but there is something terribly sweet in the chemistry of Powell and Arthur in this movie. Jean Arthur shines when she looks at Powell. There is an unmistakable buzz between them. This film may not have the spirit of the Thin Man series, but undeniably catches it in charm. While watching TV, I thought Powell was having an affair with Arthur. My friends thought the same thing. This is a film where I wish I could go back in time (to chat and lock the lips with Powell!) There does not seem to be an end to his adorable playful smiles! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably closest to "the perfect man". Ok, it sounds too gushy, but I can not help it.
