I saw "Breaking Glass" for the first time when it was released in England in 1980. I liked it at that time and I just watched it in August 2005 on a Canadian station, it is still great . The only thing I regret is that I can not find the soundtrack or DVD in stores? ... everyone wants to make the light, or do I have to order it from an Internet company offering excessive prices? But to get back to the film, the music stands the test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about Britain in the 80s. In fact, it's the same decade that I moved to Canada for the same reasons, one being "Thatcher" what she was doing in Canada at the time. Please, if you have the chance to watch this movie, you will not regret it!
