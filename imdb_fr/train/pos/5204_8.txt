I do not watch a lot of porn, but I love pornstars. And I love bloody movies. So when I heard about a porn star movie, I was really excited. Of course, it was years ago and when I heard about all the problems involved in making and finishing the film, I never thought I could see it. But I did it and I'm not ashamed to admit that I loved it, even with all its faults. <br /> <br /> First, the defects. The story happens in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story she seemed to want to tell is about the Scottish Sawney Beane clan. So, why not define it and ignore the third year report on Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? In addition, he breaks his own rules by declaring that you are safe on the tracks, but then the cannibal mutants start running wild everywhere. You never know how many cannibals we are dealing with. There is a large stone castle that is obviously ancient, but no one had noticed it before. Conscious horror movie references are annoying, just like the characters. The heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends including a character she has never met. The end does not make sense. <br /> <br /> So, what works? The gore! Of course, I would have liked more, but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that was not afraid of being a gore movie. Two murders have been committed and Taylor Hayes has a beautiful disgusting scene. Both wild murders even receive long shots on the DVD. I always thought that Gore could overcome a stupid story and Evil Breed reinforced it.
