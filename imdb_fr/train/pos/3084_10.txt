Oh man, why? "Six Degrees" is a show about this so-called theory that we are all connected by someone. Focus on the life of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> The first time I heard about this show, it did not catch my attention. It seemed too ordinary, actually. Then I saw episodes ... and I loved it! First, the characters. They are all well written and different from each other. There is an alcoholic, a woman whose wife betrays her, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother, and so on. ... Contrary to what we are used to, most characters interact in losses, as in our daily routines. Awesome! My favorites are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> Next, the distribution. They are all great. Jay Hernandez, from "Hostel", shows here his acting skills in a character more 3d than his previous job as Paxton. The others also offer excellent performances, including Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> Well, when I arrived at IMDb, after watching some episodes, I could not believe it was canceled. Seriously, I do not understand the lowest odds. <br /> <br /> Too bad he did not have more than one season. It would really be a good show to follow!
