In this excellent black film of Twentieth Century Fox, the metropolis is a labyrinth of desperation in which scavengers and predators survive by living each other. Covering cityscapes that descend on a disgusting humanity in a dark expressionist symbolism. <br /> <br /> A prostitute gets her handbag in the subway. It contains a microfilm and a communist espionage network will try to recover it. Two parallel investigations take place as spies and police seek out valuable information. <br /> <br /> The Skip McCoy anti-hero pickpocket is played with scornful insurance by Richard Widmark. He knows the cops are his moral equals and his intellectual inferiors, so he taunts them, "Come on," he said to Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), "throw an accusation, throw me in. You already have it. In this ruthless world, cops are just one more group in the streets. Just like Candy, the prostitute, Lightning Louie is corrupted to get an advance, just as the police are busy paying pigeon stools for information. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that when Widmark shot this film, he was already at the beginning of his Middle Ages. . The 39-year-old star, coming to the end of his contract with Fox, plays upstart Skip McCoy with the irreverent temerity of a teenager. Today, it may not be acceptable for the romantic thread to pique its amorous interest in unconsciousness, then revive it by slipping beer into its face, but according to the customs of that time, it meant hardness. - and Candy, after all, is a fallen woman. <br /> Jean Peters is as radiant as Candy. Here, in the middle of her five years of celebrity, she is beautiful and attractive like a whore with a heart of gold. She is the victim of history, a martyr of her beauty as much as all the rest. She means well, but is constantly manipulated by cynical men - Joey, Skip and the cops. <br /> <br /> The real star of this movie is New York. Haunted urban landscapes and slick metro stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living and malicious force. Like maggots in a decaying cheese, human figures roam the alleys of the city. Elevators, subway turnstiles, sidewalks - even a mute server acts as the engine for the flow of corrupt humanity. People cling to any niche for security: Moe has his room rented dirty, pass his shadowy shack on the Hudson River. When the characters move and interact, they are framed by a bridge architecture or trellises of beams or divided by a hanging winch apparatus. The personality of the city imposes itself constantly. The angles and transoms of the quayside beams echo the lattice street plan, and the map files in the squadron room mimic the Manhattan skyline. When Joey's exit from the subway is banned, it's as if the city's steel tendons are trapping him. <br /> <br /> A surprising proportion of this film is turned to the extreme. The character directs the plot, as it should, and close-ups are used to increase the character. When Skip questions Candy, the close-up captures the sexual energy that separates them, denying the hostility of Skip's words. The beauty of Jean Peters is painted in the light, with very beautiful close-ups blurred. The device is also used to increase the voltage. The opening sequence, the purse, contains no dialogue: the drama rests entirely on the close-up for its powerful effect. <br /> <br /> Snoopers, whipping on the whip, populate the film. Moe (Thelma Ritter) earns her living as an informant and her place in the hierarchy is accepted even by her victims. When Skip observes: "She must eat", he sings a recurring chorus. In the same way that "straight" New Yorkers peddle lamb chops or lumber, the underworld is engaged in the information commodity. <br /> <br /> And yet, even the stool pigeons are superior to Joey and his communist friends. Joey's feet on Moe's bed symbolize a transgression of the most basic moral code. Joey is beyond pallor. Moe will not trade with Joey, even to preserve his life: "... even in our shabby business, you have to draw the line somewhere." <br /> <br /> "The pickup" was created in the depths of the cold war. Richard Nixon had just been chosen as Republican candidate for the vice-presidency, after having made a name for himself thanks to his false statement of Algiers Hiss - a false communist microfilm. McCarthy's show trials were a daily reality. We see the cops in the movie fighting against "the traitors who gave Stalin A bomb". <br /> <br /> You can see New York as a giant receptacle in which human offal cheats, whistles and dies. The containers form a leitmotif throughout the film. Moe carries his box of branded ties and Candy's handbag, containing the microfilm, is the driving force behind the plot. Skip retains her only possessions in a submerged crate, symbolizing her secret wisdom. The coffins of the poor, who go down the Hudson on a barge, are containers of a single additional cargo moved around the merciless metropolis. <br /> <br /> The film is a masterpiece of composition. Candy is shown above Skulking Skip on the rickety catwalk of the cabin, which means her moral ascendancy. When the gun is placed on the table, the extreme perspective makes it look bigger than Candy - the violence begins to deny compassion. The lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a handler hook, reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute, but subordinate to the whims of the sinister city. Enyard the Communist is a shadow on a wall, or a puff of disembodied cigarette smoke. He is like the lonely cat among the rubbish - a predatory ghost of the night. Shoots taken under taxi cabins, in newsstands and across the bars of hospital beds are constantly reinforcing the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis. We are a mulch of civilization.
