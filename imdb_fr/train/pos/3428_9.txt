I saw this movie tonight in New York at Landmark Sunshine. I did not know what to expect, I did not read much about it because I knew I would see it anyway. Overall, it is very well done. It does not focus on the generalization of the "anti-war" statements that, for me, have left politics aside. The soldiers mainly talked about their awareness of toxicity during their training camp training and the difficulty of their lives once they returned to civilian life. It was really nice to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia talking about the difficulty of surviving not only the war, but also the refusal to give the order to go back when it was against personal morality. Make no mistake: it is not an anti-war film. Anyone who says that this has not been seen or does not live with the scars of war on his soul.
