It's funny to see how your life can change in a second. Attending "The Waterdance" for the first time has been an unforgettable experience, the way you have to get used to a new way of life can seem scary, and If you notice that other people are going through a similar situation, it may help you continue. <br /> <br /> The representations of Eric Stoltz and mainly Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the purest and most graceful woman in the world ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. A simple and yet profound film that does not leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted to us: enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> Really for a film like this one the hour is not attended !!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression ...)
