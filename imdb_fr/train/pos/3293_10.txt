If ever I were asked to remember a song from a movie of yesteryear, it would have to be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" for its meaning, as sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd . Rafi, Kaif Bhopali's words and film photography when the boat stands out against the black background and shining stars. The other should be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was Meena Kumari's last film before her death and the time it took is visible on the screen. In each of the illustrated songs, she looks young but after that, she did not do it. Raj Kumar, who has fallen in love with her and especially her feet, is one of the actors who has not changed appearance. He accidentally entered the cabin of his train and, after seeing them, leaves a note explaining how beautiful they are. . <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, as far as possible, should be watched on the big screen, in the interest of photography and songs in the cinema. The film stars Meena Kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> The grandson of Kamal Amrohi began to revive his grandfather's studio by making a humorous film.
