First, let's start with the negatives: 1) There are huge gaping holes in the plot and questions that are raised and that will have no answer to give; 2) The film is not for everyone, so rude viewers will worry and start barking during the movie. <br /> <br /> The two point above is important because the film is very calm. In an older type of theater (like the one I went to), you can sometimes hear the reel go through the projector. I loved it. The film does not occupy you with music, nor effects: it allows you to think about what is happening. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm that generates a fascinating atmosphere and quite pleasant. The same kind of atmosphere created by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for everybody. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to movie lovers because the cinematic work is amazing. Those who base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be totally disappointed. This is the kind of story you need to create afterwards. (My version of it is damn cool, but probably pretty off-track!) If you go see the movie, there's a cool part: when the two cops talk to each other on their cell phone. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Hat to the person who thought to do that.
