I saw this movie when it was originally released in 1989. I enjoyed it then and I still do it now. But what I realize now is that it's a pretty "adult" movie for a movie rated G, especially the notion of death and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work very well, and Reynolds' voice is perfect for a scrappy dog. There are some good songs ranging from optimistic ("Let's Make Music Together") to downright emotional ("Home to My Heart"). I found the plot good, even if it is tangent once or twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I have ever seen in the animation. A movie to live.
