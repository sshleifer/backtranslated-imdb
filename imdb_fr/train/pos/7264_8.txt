I agree with Cal-37, it's a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and cute, of course, Jim Belushi has well deserved his fringes! But I really wanted to really like the piano song, if you're a musician or do not watch this movie just for that, you'll know what it is. <br /> <br /> "You're nobody before someone loves you" Written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock and James Cavanaugh <br /> <br /> Have fun watching <br /> <br /> See you soon, <br /> <br /> Nelson
