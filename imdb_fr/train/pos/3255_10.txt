Each scene was perfectly assembled. This film had a wonderful cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr., none has and will never exist. He has the ability to brighten up any movie with his incredible talent. This movie was perfect! I saw this film sitting alone on a shelf in "Blockbuster" and, as if it called me, I could not help but take it and bring it home. You can call me a romantic romantic, but this film touched my heart, not to mention making me laugh with pleasure at the same time. Although it made me cry, I admit that in the end, the whole film comes to illuminate my vision of life later. I suggested to my horror film, action and pure humor a brother who absolutely loved this film. It can make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love and enjoy your life.Every time you intentionally miss this movie, know that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspiring film. Who knows? And if that could really happen to you ?, and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life.
