One word can describe this film and it's weird. I recorded this film one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old, so I thought it would be interesting. The film is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body and revenge. Along the way, he meets very colorful characters and finally has to decide whether he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you're a fan of animation / science fiction, you might want to check that out.
