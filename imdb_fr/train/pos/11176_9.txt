Ok, I must first point out that when I saw this movie, I was 9 years old. If I had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time, I would probably have noticed that it was just another cheap horror movie on cable TV, with well done scenes. But when you're nine, you do not care about those facts anymore. That made me very scared at the time, especially those scenes from Zelda (and it still is). Nowadays, I'm a little addicted to this movie. I have to see him maybe once a month, and every New Year's Eve, I watch him with a pack of 12 bottles of beer and a group of friends. It's like an aperitif for a good party! I agree with those who said that playing here was rather ineffective. Midkiff and Crosby seem to want Louis and Rachel to look like, but we can not see much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two. Hughes and Gwynne pretty much preserve the scenes under which "Creeds" act. What I mean by this is the fact that no other film has a resemblance to Pet Sematary, and I'm not talking about the zombie stuff here. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NEW AND UNIQUE. Honestly, how many times have you seen a film that, on a superficial level, looks like a movie on cable TV, but leaves you a thrill compared to the only horror coolers out there? All right, I broke a couple of balls from the casting a minute ago, but I have to say that all the pieces on this level have the effect of perfecting the game as a whole. But hey, tell me if you really know a movie that looks like Pet Sematary! I'd really like to know ... And I'm not talking about the night of the undead here ... This one is unparalleled in intelligence about that one.
