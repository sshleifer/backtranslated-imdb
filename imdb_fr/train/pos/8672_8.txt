The last WWE PPV in 2006 proved to be a hit with fans, but for one reason only, the ladder match that was to take place between Paul London and Brian Kendrick, against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But the recent PPV poop being from December to November, the WWE knew it had to do something to get the fans talking again, it proved useful when it introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz into the mix and was announced that the match was going to be a ladder match. <br /> <br /> The game was brutal and one of the best ladder games I've ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a mess. Johnny Nitro did not even check his partner, they continued as if nothing had happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the match, except to hit the players with some ladder shots. In the end, London and Kendrick kept the titles. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere in the show, Kane defeated MVP in a decent match by setting fire to his stupid costume. Chris Benoit beat Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms beat Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the WWE Cruiserweight title in a solid effort. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a total mess, King Booker teamed up with Finlay to face John Cena and Batista. The fight was of poor quality and Batista did not matter as far as his partner was concerned. <br /> <br /> Overall results: Kane beat MVP in an inferno match. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick were named to WWE Team Titles against Hardy Boyz, MNM, David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder game. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit beat Chavo Guerrero to retain the American title in a decent game. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the Cruiserweight title. <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman beat the Miz in a terrible game. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker defeated Kennedy in a last game played. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista beat King Booker and Finlay in an abyssal match. <br /> <br /> Overall rating - B
