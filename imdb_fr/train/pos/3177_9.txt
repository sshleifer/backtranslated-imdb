Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There is nothing I did not like about this movie. Cross Eyed has been beautifully shot. Adam does a great job developing not only the main characters, but also the minor characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to all low-budget films. You do not have to spend a lot of money to create something that deserves to be watched. There is something to love for everyone. If you had a terrible roommate. if you have already chosen a dork in high school. if you have already parked anywhere in the city. If you have any sense of humor, you will love this movie. This is the type of film that will exist for a long time and will eventually resurface once Adam makes a bigger name. I look forward to Adam's future plans.
