It's not well shot, well written or played, but it must be the most addictive show I've seen since Twin Peaks. Each revelation is so well timed that you have to see the next episode to get some sort of closure. They even slowed the pace of the series, revealing only a tiny amount of information per episode, but they feel like they've told you everything you want to know. However, the acting is almost horrible and the duologue is downright brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. The most experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out from the actors who play the role of Jack, Kate, Sayid, etc. The development of the series can also be very frustrating because the next episode may not show what the previous episode has led. The boring secondary intrigues are now part of the story and sometimes do not tell you anything. However, the second season has developed to such an extent that previous stories reveal more about the island than before. All in all it's a big show but not perfect.
