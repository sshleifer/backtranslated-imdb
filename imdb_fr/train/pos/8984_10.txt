I saw this movie for the first time while flipping through DirecTV's movie channels, my parents. It was on Sundance and had just started. I love music, especially in the late 60's, and here's what the BJM looked like (the Dandies are doing well). Everything about the Brian Jonestown massacre has intrigued me from music to Anton and Joel's personality to illicit drug use. It was funny because while I was watching the first party scene where everyone was playing, that my parents were going by and decided to look (the look on their faces was priceless). Anyway, it's definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to the Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is now my favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> just watch it ... seriously
