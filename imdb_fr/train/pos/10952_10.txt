Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I read the other "comment" on this show as well as the messages on the bulletin board and people simply do not understand. Nothing that appears on T.V. is an accident. Too much money, time and work is spent on producing a TV show so that there are mistakes. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid. This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted it juvenile. I thought the jokes were great and the thematic show, along with the other musical numbers, are wonderfully weird. It's a bit like the Pee-Wee Playhouse for Future Star of the American Valley Porn. The casting is great. The scenarios and the action are well paced. I hope this show will succeed since Comedy Central did not let David Spade keep his show. Who plays Sarah's sister? She does not appear in the list of actors on the homepage of the show. I would love to see her standing up. Does anyone know about upcoming concert dates or DVDs that could circulate?
