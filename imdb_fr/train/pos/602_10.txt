I had never danced flamenco before, but I feel that this film is perfect. The colors, how blatant the dances were, the gypsies and the rivals put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too early. I have seen other films by Carlos Saura and I agree that this film could be his best production. I think the best features of his past films have been collected and aligned to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors to reveal the activity behind the cameras. Watching this film, I felt as if I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, watching comfortably the dancers banging on a wooden board around a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this film fits me like a glove. I do not know how I can get a copy of this film in the United States in the next few years. I recommend this film to anyone who is attracted by the livelihood of other cultures. It is safe to say that this movie is definitely on my favorites list.
