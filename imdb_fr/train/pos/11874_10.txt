The best role of Arguebly Al Pacino. He plays Tony Montana, a small Cuban group that has turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he has in the world, his balls and his word, and he does not break em for anyone. Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) starts working for a big Cuban dealer and quickly climbs the ranks of the organization with his long-time friend, Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon, he has the eye for the boss's sexy wife, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony, he tries to assassinate Tony but without success. Tony is angry and nothing can stop him now. F. Murray Abraham is a nervous gangster, Harris Yulin, a dishonest cop, trying to shake Tony, marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as his younger sister. Credits to Oliver Stone's Ecxellent script. This movie is one of Brian DePalma's strong points in his long career of ups and downs, you can see that this guy is very talented. The film has a magnificent appearance. Also pay attention to two memorable scenes: the chic restaurant ("Say good night to the bad guy"). the other is the last shootout where Tony shows that he always knows how to kick his ass and kills about twenty assassins who have invaded his house. it's certainly one of the most impressive endings of a movie I've ever seen. For Al Pacino fans and crime movies, it's a must. For the rest of you, it's highly recommended. 10/10
