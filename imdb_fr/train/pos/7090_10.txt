A linear displacement in a nonlinear structure. It is a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows between this present, the future and the past. However, the linearity of the film can not be avoided: it is the very work of the projector, the unfolding of the story. <br /> <br /> What we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. . The world of this film by Terry Gilliam is a world with little space for free will. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, we learned about the schizophrenic's prophecy that a plague would rule the Earth in 1997, force the few survivors to live in hiding - the only place uninfected by the virus. <br /> <br /> The mission of Cole (Willis) is clear: back in the mid-90s to investigate all that is related to the release of the virus. virus. There is no way to change the past: all that can be done is to gather information that can help present scientists (who, for us, viewers, are the future) to find the cure. Do not change what happened (the past is inevitable), but improve the present. <br /> <br /> In his "returns" in time, Cole is gradually approaching a striking dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present. <br /> <br /> The latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists who elect "volunteers" (this word is ironic) to embark on trips in the past. <br /> <br /> Scientists have not yet reached the highest level of success in time travel, and Cole ends up making mistakes. This will later be used as a conspiracy to prove psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe)'s mental health. <br /> <br /> We can see, through the evolution of history, that linearity and non-linearity intertwine in a circular temporality. <br /> <br /> There is more than one moment in which the scene that is first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the climax - appears. He modifies himself, according to the evocation of Cole's memories, which arise in his dreams. <br /> <br /> In an airport, a man is shot and killed while he is running, armed, to someone else. A blonde woman runs after the one who was murdered. <br /> <br /> It's the scene that connects the past (where Cole is a kid who visits the airport with his parents), the present (story time) and the future (adult Cole) All Throughout the story, Cole feels that he has already experienced the reality he is experiencing now. His prophetic dreams are proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. The agents who shoot him prevent him from killing the mad scientist, Dr. Peters (Morse), responsible for the spread of the disease. <br /> <br /> What could not be changed. And, in Cole's case, what was it will be. Eternally. <br /> <br /> A film not very well understood for many. For me, nothing less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Other good films on the same theme: The trilogy "Back to the future" (which has another angle with regard to the character of "mad scientist", and shares the atmosphere well decadent - especially in the second film - he is much more optimistic than Gilliam's work, which is a strange Hollywood image). <br /> <br /> In another register, there is "Strawberries", one of the masterpieces of Bergman, it implies a striking and instructive journey in the past through dreams and reminiscences. <br /> <br /> I have never watched "The Pier", but only because I can not find it.
