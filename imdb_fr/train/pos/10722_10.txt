Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids love, and Mom and Dad can also have fun watching. Growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed this movie, its plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD so that when I have my own children, they can have fun as much as me watching this movie. The plot is fun. A group of children embark on a journey they did not expect, when they were propelled into space by an outperforming robot. They were early but when they realized they did not have enough oxygen to recover from the panic. Once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station, they returned to Earth as best friends and a newfound respect for life.
