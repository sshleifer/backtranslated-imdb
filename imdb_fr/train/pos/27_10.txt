Emilio Miraglio's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo I've ever seen, mixing all the necessary elements in a sinister stew. First of all, and of paramount importance to me, this is a complex and sinuous plot that makes sense, and the killer here does not come out completely from the left field to the end. The story, which concerns a series of horrible murders (you already know how much of the title of the film, no?) That unfolds so as to seem to fulfill an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters, involves murder, and the murderer, the camouflaged of Red Figure with the crazy laugh of a crazy woman, is both scary and memorable. Every big giallo needs charming leading actresses. Here we have a varied assortment, led by Barbara Bouchet, ridiculously beautiful, in the role of one of the two sisters and, in one of her previous roles, Sybil Danning, as a lascivious vagabond at Barbara. Another essential ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy and humble score, and Bruno Nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days. Beautiful landscapes? Recheck. Filmed largely in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, the photo is a feast for the eyes. Okay, okay, but what about these murders? After all, is not that the gialli? Well, I'm happy to announce that most viewers should be very happy with the various knives, filming, impaling and other carnage that this film unveils with great taste ... not to mention the crypts, the bizarre dream sequence, the rats and bats (and many, too!), references to drugs, a rape scene, mandatory red herrings and, in the person of Ugo Pagliai, a great head man for viewers. As I said, a perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD was written by the people of No Shame, and you know what it means: a wonderful impression and many extras, plus! Thanks guys!
