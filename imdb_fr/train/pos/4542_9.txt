Centered in the city center and on the outskirts of Detroit, this comedy seemed like a great new comedy duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a very funny man, who is a Japanese policeman on the trail of a thief of industrial secrets, who stole a super proto-type turbo charger. Reluctantly, he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character collides with the fast-paced "Jay Leno" character of the business-type detroit policeman, and as they meet, the honorable "Ways" of Japan meet with the investigator. General "Old Way" Detroit police.The two stumble and stumble over each other at first, but then develop a "rhythm" that turns into an explosive two-level team, which resolves the case, cold. Having fought against a city crime leader for the stolen "equipment" and closed the file, these two will despise each other to become friends and work well together. to wear and needing a long vacation, they come to a victorious close, I noted this as a 9. Lewis's direction makes it a near-perfect comedy Fun for all ages I highly recommend it. *)
