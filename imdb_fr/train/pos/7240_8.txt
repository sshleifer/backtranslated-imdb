When I found this film in my local record store, I was expecting another American vampire movie just like "The Lost Boys" (1987). To my surprise, "To Die for" is a very good movie. It's a bit cheesy at times, but there are always enough decorations and surprises to satisfy vampire lovers. It's a perfect mix romance and horror and it's surprisingly gore at times. Highly recommended.
