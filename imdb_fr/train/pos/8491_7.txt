I saw this movie when it was new. Later, I rented it in Japan after spending three years here, fearing to hurt myself when I saw it in the light of my extended international experience. The film pleasantly surprised me with the precision with which it depicts the clash of cultures between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I come from). In fact, everything is not clear, but the tone is perfect. <br /> <br /> I am still in Japan many years later and I continue to enjoy this film for its impartial treatment on both sides. In history. Interestingly, although the Japanese-American actors have spoken Japanese in the original, the dialogue is redone in the Japanese version to cover obvious issues of diffusion in a second language. <br /> <br /> I noticed that a critic used it in a Japanese class. . I think you can learn more about what to expect from a meeting with Japan by watching this movie than by reading one of the "serious" books on the subject (most of which have been written in 80s and funded by the propaganda of Japanese companies). Do not be fooled by the average of critics attributed to star reviewers who, among others, have found it unlikely that the Japanese want to build cars in the United States. (Of course, the Japanese operate many plants close to customers and to avoid commercial frictions.) This is a very warm and funny movie that I would evaluate above without some clich√©s of the 80s, like dancing around electronic disco music cheesy. Michael Keaton has never been so funny.
