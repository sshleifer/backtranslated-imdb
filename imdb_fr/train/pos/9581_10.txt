This film documents the Harlem ball circuit of the mid-eighties. Much more fun than Palazzo Volpi, although just as sick, this film is a true jewel of misery. We can not help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness. The only goal of middle-class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of the basket and ostentation. Here, the most amazing waste is extremely well documented and duly glamorous. The characters' penchant for the idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves from the viewer, creating a "phenomenon phenomenon" effect that makes this film a work of art .
