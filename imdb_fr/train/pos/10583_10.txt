The stock market crash of 1929 and the depression that followed almost ruined the American theater, in fact, it was the coup de grace for the vaudeville. Those behind the curtains were as affected as those in front of them. <br /> <br /> To stimulate the economy of the show and its own economy, the out-of-work theater director James Cagney had a brilliant idea. Showcase relevant prologues from the movies shown in the various theaters that come out of the old theaters overnight. Some competitors are aware of it and the competition is launched. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite movie of Busby Berkeley. This gives James Cagney the opportunity to demonstrate his versatility as a dancer and tough guy. In his retirement, Cagney said that although he had often spent some very different films, he could barely miss some of his dramatic films. He would have liked to do more musicals during his career, and I wish he did it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the staging of these Busby Berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies logic and reason. But it's so creative and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell sings three songs in Footlight Parade, Ah the moon is here, Honeymoon Hotel and By a Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler, further strengthening this team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two years and she joins James Cagney in my favorite Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is the sensible daughter of Cagney Friday at the theater. As in Blonde Crazy, she has the real brains in this duo and it is his quick thinking that saves him from the domestic problems he has in addition to his theatrical problems. One of the best on-screen roles of Blondell. <br /> <br /> Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the chorus, as shown in the IMDb pages. John Garfield is briefly seen in Lil's Shanghai issue. And in a scene at the beginning of the film, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a movie theater where they present an American director with John Wayne. The duke's voice is undeniable. But what is even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh, who plays another Cagney's assistant in Footlight Parade. I think the Warner brothers were playing a little joke. I must believe that this clip was deliberate. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at his best surrealist.
