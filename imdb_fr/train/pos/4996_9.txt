I've seen tons of actors from HK, and this one is at the top of the genre. Action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've seen in an action movie. The kung-fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnics breathtaking, the waterfalls are breathtaking. The editing is perfectly rhythmic, increasing the tension and completing the fluid work of the camera. This film is directed by the old pro Corey Yuen, whose curriculum vitae is full of some of the best of the genre, including Jet Li's vehicle, The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If one thing is missing in this film, it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin, the main male role, comes closest to it. This film is full of archetypes rather than characters - the sexy killer, the zany thief and his little bitch, the biting villains. That said, Shannon Lee is remarkably on the screen. she's great with fighting, stunts and guns. When she's on screen, it's hard to take her eyes off. She is so good. Why is this woman not a major star?
