Zero Day is a film that few people have seen and what a shame. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end, the two main characters come down into the room and kill people without mercy, then commit suicide and it made me stomach. I was shaking, it's the strength of this film. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. It's too amazing not to get a perfect ten. It is unfortunate that so few people understand the true beauty of this film. It is not a budget that is good for a film, it is the amount of feeling that filmmakers put into it that makes it good. <br /> <br /> This leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply can not go out. This makes you realize the real horror of shootings - especially if you knew this person, and this film makes you feel like you know them. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel ripe. enough to watch it. I'm fourteen years old and I think this movie is too incredible to be put into words. It's like you're watching something that really happened.
