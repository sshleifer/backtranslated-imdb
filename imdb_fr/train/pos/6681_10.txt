This film deserved better. It's a lot of fun, there are great jokes and gags in sight, props for the "Geeks" among us (and we know who we are), and the effects are really effective. Watching Paul Reubens fart face a winner of an Academy Award alone is worth the price of an admission. I had never read the comic series before seeing the movie, but since. as good as they are, I still recommend the film to MM. (Although the flaming carrot as a character would have been cool too) Greg Kinnear is, well, ... as incredible as Captain Amazing, and no one else could be The Shoveller except for William H. Macy . My favorite line in the movie? "We have a blind date with Destiny, and it looks like she ordered the lobster." See this film. BUY this movie! It's only $ 5 and a little change at your local Wal-Mart. You will thank me. Really you will do it. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo is inside. THAT ONLY makes him worthy to look
