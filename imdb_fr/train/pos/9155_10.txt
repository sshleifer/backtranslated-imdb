Who has ever told the story is a sick person. I rented it for our slumber party and the six of us panicked because we are all in an acting class, and we know a few actors in the class. Apart from everyone screaming all night, I had nightmares. I kept thinking oh my god, if I got up to go to the bathroom pee, I'd be stabbed in the middle of wiping or something like that. I could not even go to the bathroom because we had watched this macabre horror movie. I also wondered why all the girls were naked in this movie, but we have no boys' units? You should make a horror movie in which the killer is a girl and who cuts out units. I would watch this again and again. Call it hard or soft or something stupid like that. I only give a 9 to this movie because you scared me.
