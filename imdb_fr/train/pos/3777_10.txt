Anyone who does not think Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs to check his head. In a way, he manages to be both completely stupid and thoughtless, but at the same time terrifying and intelligent. Bogus Journey can be enjoyed again and again. Highlights include the duel with Death and the end, which is highly "emotional". Keanu wants to forget all that Matrix garbage and get on with doing what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return.
