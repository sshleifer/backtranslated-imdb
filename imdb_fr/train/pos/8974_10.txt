Jiří Trnka made his last animation an indictment of totalitarianism that caused him trouble in his native Czechoslovakia. The elements are few, the simple symbolisms and its trademark ornament almost absent here, allowing the viewer to focus on the fable. A man in his room devotes himself to pottery and takes care of his only plant. But suddenly, a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue. The man refuses and he is persecuted by the gloved and threatening hand. In these days when the impression of the reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that try to replace the real world, it is refreshing to watch a movie, which incorporates its technique into pleasure.
