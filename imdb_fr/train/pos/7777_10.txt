Rich and alcoholic, Robert Stack falls in love with Secretary Lauren Bacall. He marries her and is so happy that he stops drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Rock Hudson, Stacks' best friend. And the nymphomaniac sister of Stacks, Dorothy Malone, covets Rock. Add some complications and the movie will become uncontrollable (in a good way). <br /> <br /> Very bright film in beautiful Technicolor with clothes and furniture breathtaking (check out Bacall's hotel room at the beginning). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in beautiful tight clothes. Basically, this is a soap opera with production grade values. The story itself is very entertaining and some of the early dialogues are hilarious. The actors of Hudson, Stack and Bacall are not very good, but seeing them so young and glamorous, it's great ... especially Stack ... when he smiled, my knees weakened! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - she rightly deserved the award for best actress in a supporting role for her role. She is sexy, violent, vicious and friendly ... convincingly. <br /> <br /> Playful and fun trash. Do not miss it!
