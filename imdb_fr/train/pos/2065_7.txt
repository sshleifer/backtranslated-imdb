The fearful symmetry is a nice episode with some flaws. The first thing about the episode is that it takes place near Mountain Home Air Base in southwestern Idaho. Season 'Deep Throat' takes place near Ellens Air Force Base, also in southwestern Idaho. I wonder if the air force bases are the same, but they decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always a benefit. Ed Meecham, the guardian of the zoo, reminds me of the grumpy old teachers. They must have loved children at the same time, you can not imagine how. Just as he had to be more interested in animals at some point. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt that there were some inconsistencies. If aliens are so good at removing humans and bringing them back safely, why can not they put the animal back in the right place? And the extraterrestrials simply have trouble making the animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory of the space-time continuum problem. As if he was an expert on the subject. I also thought that Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose was not well done. In addition to these nitpicks, I still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of extraterrestrials capturing animal DNA and human DNA.
