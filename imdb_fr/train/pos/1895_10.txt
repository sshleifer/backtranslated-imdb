I watched it during the Christmas season, I do not know why but it reminds me of Christmas so I looked at it, so we are there. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a film that I watch all the way through my face with a big silly smile and a mix of special performances, funky music and a happy script and a sparkling scenario of wit and charm . <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore creates a character who might be hated (fed, rich, lazy drunk who is sorry for himself) but turns him into someone you love. Liza Minelli is great as a waitress of queens, Linda Morolla, who manages to get rid of the hard / soft from the inside, Arthur almost gives up his world. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and refines them with taste. <br /> <br /> I can watch Arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good, check if you need a lift, it's a nice movie.
