A man starts living alone after 45 years of marriage. He must also solve the problem of the family milk cow, Tulip, who refuses to be milked. Until he sees his wife, the one who once treated the tulip. <br /> <br /> The tulip is inspired by a true story told in the family of Griffith, the generation of his grandparents. The film is a nostalgic look at an endangered way of life, a place where people always feel responsible for each other, unfolding in the lush Victorian countryside (the Australian state, not the time). <br /> <br /> Screenwriter and director Griffiths clearly has new ambitions in both fields, and this award-winning 15-minute short film is a beginner to her.
