Well not really. This film is however very amusing. I went to see this with the girlfriend last night and had to use the routine "I think there might be something in my eye". The film is an excellent combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is superb as a lucky journalist who is empowered to change and change the city in which he resides. In fact, all the characters are great. The film is neither too funny nor too wise, good movie to go to see with his wife. <br /> <br /> Overall 8/10 .... note * I am not an easy binder. That's all, at BigV!
