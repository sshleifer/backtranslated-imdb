An American woman, her European husband and her children return to her mother's house in "Watch on the Rhine", a 1943 film based on Lillian Hellman's play and starring Paul Lukas (who, I believe, repeats her role here ), Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. Kurt Muller (Lukas), an anti-fascist, underground worker, several times injured and wanted by the Nazis, needs a long vacation in the area of ​​his rich stepmother. But he discovers that there is really no way out because one of the guests (Coulouris) is wary of his true identity and is more than willing to sell it. <br /> <br /> The film contains great performances. a lot to highlight the liberal point of view of Lillian Hellman. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time of its publication, as the woes of the war and what was happening to people from other countries reached safe American homes. The big controversy of the film today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar against Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca". Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen and a fabulous Rick, but Lukas is transcendent like Kurt. The monologue he has on the need to kill is heartbreaking, to name one scene. <br /> <br /> Although it's not what one thinks of a Bette Davis film, it gives a masterful performance here. Kurt's loyal and affectionate wife, Sara. The love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film moved me to tears with the honesty of emotions. Lillian Hellman is not everyone's cup of tea, but unlike "The Little Foxes", she has written really nice and wonderful characters and a great story given the values ​​of casting and production from Warner Brothers. Highly recommended.
