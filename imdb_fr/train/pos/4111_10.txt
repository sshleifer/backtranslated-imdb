I first saw this film as a pre-adolescent, at about the age when children begin to think about their identity. The scene of the man and the children he raises as his own has affected me greatly. The eldest son has been mocked that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father (which Kurosawa highlights by having children who are not alike at all). The man always persuades the boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts. The man is reputed to be the father of all children except one who always prefers his brother. <br /> <br /> Each vignette is also convincing for its own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, even if it's not the best Kurosawa film.
