My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this movie. The viewer is carried away by modern life in ancient Japan while being exposed to very current themes. The characters are realistic and detailed. its end and its history are unpredictable, which is very refreshing. The story is made up of mini-plots in the lives of several geisha living together in a poor neighborhood of the city. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in realistic romance or life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
