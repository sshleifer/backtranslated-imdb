it's a weekend, I was watching this funny movie. and I really like it. all the children are cute, who remind me of my own childhood with these stupid thoughts. it's a real entertaining film for a group of families on weekends, which could make a lot of memories and laughs. The humor of the children always works. well played too. simple story but cool shot. great job for the director to find the path of the child. as for the children's film, I'm thinking of "12 years old". another this year but a different aspect of the world of children, real and cruel. great job. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood, which every child and every family needs. I think Twitch is Nemo's voice of "Finding Nemo".
