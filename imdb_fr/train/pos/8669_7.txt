If, unlike some of the commentators here, you are not leading a class war and do not mind seeing the lives of others who are successful, extroverted, bohemian (panting) and not very So, this is not a bad film, closer to European cinema than as an imitation of ordinary American shit ... I believe the minimal sound design and the cheap camera are a conscious decision rather than a bad shoot. The film is not worse, and it highlights the actors, some of whom are really good (Kate Hardie, thinks it's his name, because the sarcastic drunk is on the spot) David Baddiel is a figure exception and should never be allowed to make a serious appearance! It's light, and we're not going into this kind of anarchy of the relationship in this country, but if you do not have real friends with whom to go to a party, you could do worse than just sitting at watch this.
