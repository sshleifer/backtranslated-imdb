We stumbled upon the documentary, Gray Gardens, last Sunday and were "sucked up" without warning. Everyone who came into the room was moved by the television and the haunting images of Edith and Edie, who seemed to live their lives in practically the same room of a big filthy mansion on the beach, eating cream. iced and corn on the cob (cooked on the nightstand) - and the cat that is urinating on Edith's bed and her unbelievable words, "I'm feeding [this scent]." We had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were looking at and how these aristocratic women had managed to fill the position they held. Captivating! A must see!!!!
