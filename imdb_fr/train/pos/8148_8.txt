I have no interest in rap and ghetto culture, I'm white and, like classical rock, that did not stop me from enjoying this fantastic comedy. It's more or less the sequel to This Is Spinal Tap in that it's the same movie, instead of rap or rock. Still, it's hilarious. There are many funny jokes but not without some jokes that fall flat. The characters are all very funny and credible. I watched just because it made me laugh at 3 am, and any film that can do it deserves at least a test projection. One of the reasons this movie was so funny is that it makes fun of another's rap. Today's rap is worried about bad things and gets along with the sound of the studio and its small talent. This film comes from a time when rappers deserved more credit. All in all, it's a funny movie with many jokes about racism, sex and musical culture among the most obvious themes of humor. This is highly recommended for any fan of This is Spinal Tap. They are essentially the same movie, pretty much different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both movies.
