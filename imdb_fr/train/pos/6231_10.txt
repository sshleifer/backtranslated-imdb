It's just a very good fun movie. It captures the true essence of the decade and the people and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors. Although this film is only in black and white, it is definitely not part of the current content. The main purpose of the film is timeless. This film features excellent actor numbers, beautiful song and dance numbers, as well as quality design and shooting. Follow the Fleet is also comical, there are fun times, moments that will make you laugh, but other times when the acting would involve you so much in the scenario. It's amazing how this film can be shot in a certain decade, how it can affect those of today. If you want to see something big, go see that.
