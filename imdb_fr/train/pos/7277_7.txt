This is a strange film about an archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes a mummy (which looks very wrong) from a funeral cave and takes her home to study. Very quickly, she begins to act strangely and talk to this mom. And soon after, his son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even more strange events take place as the spirit tries to destroy the woman's family. All in all, it's really REALLY boring, and you'll fall asleep the first few times you try to watch it. But if you persevere, you can go to the end. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the secret of the mummy? Is the mother's spirit upset to have been removed from the cave? You may not be able to know what is the motivation of the mind, but if you like spooky maneuvers on a small budget (and the hairstyles of the 70s!), This will have some comforting appeal. <br /> <br /> The way I have it The narrative described is much clearer than the confusing and boring way the film has to tell the story. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well ... in a way, this one realizes that. It may be a good film in the mind, but it's done rather clumsy. I do not know. What I know is that I loved this game, despite its monotony. <br /> <br /> The fans of "Spider Baby" will be curious to know that some musical clues of this film are used in this one. (including an instrumental version of the theme song). <br /> <br /> Presenting a scary and rather well done sequence, showing rocks and rocks owned by themselves and possibly attacking some people in a camper. The other scenes in the film are simply phantasmagorical or offbeat; but this scene is actually pretty scary. <br /> <br /> See this! It's weird and it's worth it. You might even want one on your shelf.
