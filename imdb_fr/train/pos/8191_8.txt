The Impossible Planet and the Satan Pit together constitute the two best episodes of the second season of the "new" Doctor Who. That said, it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of Quatermass and the pit (1967) into a setting of outer space, the history of the universe being closely related to that of the Beast 666. These episodes cement the emotional feeling. the links that unite Rose and the Doctor, while highlighting Rose's growing self-confidence and placing her as a partner not yet quite equal but arriving with our beloved Time Lord. Also noteworthy is Matt Jones' elegant script, which reduces the occasional use of the doctor's duplicate, as well as the performances of the entire cast, including the excellent Shaun Parkes in the role of Captain Zachary Cross Flane.
