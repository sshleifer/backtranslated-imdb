If you want action and adventure in a movie, you'd better look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you want to have a good movie in this mood, check out "The Simplest Story". <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays a convincing performance, both sweet and warm. gentleman Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's trip on a horse mower in three US states to see his brother who had a stroke. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this role because he travels winding road, making friends with strangers and distributing a lot of grandfather-type advice on the family along the way. The story moves as slowly as the riding mower, but still manages to keep the viewer waiting for the next life lesson Alvin is going to offer. <br /> <br /> Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy. This is the only way to watch this very good movie, which notes a 7/10 in my book.
