I really enjoyed this movie. Most critics have been bad, but most critics think that a film should be like a drama of ideas. This film has a bit of drama, but the rest is just fun, very fun. Forget the fact that Julia Roberts is a pretty woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young woman and it's not all that. Emma was so much fun watching Nancy Drew. It is good to see a new face. I think she will go far. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be based on books, but the story is always good. There's also a good mix of character actors and supporting characters like Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - uncredited. I'm surprised Disney did not release this movie. Some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sexuality, violence or swear words. It's a good family film that is rare nowadays. So, take your family, watch this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can not wait for more.
