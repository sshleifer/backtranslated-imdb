He found himself accidentally, he was behind the movie box of what I thought I'd rent, did not find out before going home, I watched him anyway. Absolutely fantastic! a wonderful movie, and one of my favorite three of all time, I recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is nice and easy to follow, it could have been easily messed up, but the actors and the director did a great job of keeping it together. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are fantastic, have a wonderful character and do a great job. <br /> <br /> You have to find a copy somewhere ...........
