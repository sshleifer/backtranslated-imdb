Often sad, sometimes sad, story of two divorced men working - Lemmon, a clean and neurotic housewife, and Matthau, a very talkative sports journalist - who decide to live together to reduce their expenses. <br /> <br /> Nicely photographed and directed. The script is very cunning - that is, there is always more than one side on almost every line. This particularly funny scene features two British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem amused by all that is said, but when Lemmon unveils his pictures of children and, yes, his future wife, he has the girls who sob with him before Matthau can show up with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining.
