This film is perhaps the most touching and edifying I have ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes a great work of art like this film can give me an almost religious experience. We suddenly realize that there is really a meaning to life. <br /> <br /> I must admit that when I first heard about this movie, I was skeptical. I thought the plot seemed artificial and I was afraid the story was trivial. But being a fan of David Lynch, I decided to try. It took me about 30 minutes to be completely captured by the movie, but then, I was completely lost. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the cinema with the feeling of having really learned something precious about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical David Lynch film, and in some ways it was very surprising that he had to do such a movie after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so long. years. On the other hand, I'm not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and deep human understanding, because I also thought he handled it very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented directors and I think The Straight Story is his best to date. 9.5 / 10
