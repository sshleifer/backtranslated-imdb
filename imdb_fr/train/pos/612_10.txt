This remarkable film can be summed up very easily. First, although comparisons with "Princess Bride" are inevitable, it is almost pointless to do so. While the two films combine the wit and humor of adults with a fairy-tale setting, "Stardust" is so different from any other fantasy / science fiction movie I've ever seen. It's a hybrid of these genres, but its plot and storyline are so unique that with performance, special effects, cinematography and score, the finished product is just not comparable to anything ever appeared on the web. money screen. Second, the score is very effective in bringing us simultaneously into the story and the fantasy world in which it unfolds and to advance the story, while creating the right amount of fear and excitement to make the magic believable in the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film difficult or even confusing. In fact, the interesting interaction between the three main sub-plots made the thing even more attractive. Wonderfully cast and superbly played in all areas. This fantastic adventure (with sci-fi elements) is the best I've seen since "The Return of the King" (although I do not compare the two). Well, it's not so easy to summarize, but do not let the cruel and heartless and cynical critics, nor the pathetic public relations of the film stop you from enjoying the best possible moment at the cinema this summer (or even possibly in a long time )!
