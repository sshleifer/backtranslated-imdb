I do not say that, just as a fan of Chris Rock, I say it as a person who had little expectations for this movie and who was wrong. The first flaw is that everyone has seen coming. The problem number two was that I found the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed like a counterfeit. Finally, in this film, the acting was mediocre, the best actor being Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy. but I saw past this flaw and I saw a solid comedy. In a head-to-head scenario, observe that the sky can wait, it's better. So for all fans of Chris Rock, WATCH THIS FILM, you will enjoy it. He has good positions in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall: 7 out of 10
