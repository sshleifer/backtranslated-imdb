If you are a fan, then you will probably appreciate that. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema is, it's not the film to start with. It's very cute, silly, the girls are hot and it's fun to watch. There is no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45-minute film, but the score is nerdy and the plot is not a total trouble. Misty Mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is clumsy braided, so she's not as hot as others. But her panties are pretty cute (just watch the movie so it does not sound weird). If you like this one, you'll probably enjoy "That 70's Girl", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a bit more sexually graphic). If you prefer to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual and horror / exploitation-based movies (but with a lower budget), check out the Factory 2000 website.
