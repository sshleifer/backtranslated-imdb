I just saw this drawing for the first time and recognize the caricatures of famous black artists ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson Stepin Fetchit (notwithstanding) Louis Armstrong and the girls from the choir come out of Harlem's famous "Cotton Club". That's right ... the stereotypes are there, but it was like that ... and these cartoons were designed to entertain adults in your local cinema before the main movie. The caricatures of Harmann & Ising tend to be more "cute" and more classy (after all ... we're talking about MGM) than the classic animated shorts made at Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or Columbia modest . Even very early, Disney's Mickey Mouse had a lot of backyard humor before Uncle Walt cleaned it up just before switching to Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Disney also had cartoons with caricatures of black artists ... Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe" of 1937. But we must not forget that these films are part of a place and a given time. In 50 years, clips from The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park will also be examined, analyzed ... and even vilified by future viewers.
