A desperate guy tries to reach a gorgeous girl on a bus. She refuses, but when he runs after someone trying to steal his purse, they find themselves anyway. And here it begins - a relationship slightly tarnished by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic super-heroine. It can not be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that could promise to become a cool movie. And IMO, it manages to be a good movie. It's not a masterpiece, but I had tears in my eyes after more than one occasion to laugh: the two main characters are returning to a crazy love festival that is, even with the deceit in progress, credible. <br /> <br /> Then. Thin story, but really very funny and worthy of the cinema. <br /> <br /> 7 broken hearts out of 10
