I agree with "Jerry". It's a very underestimated space movie (of course, how many good low budget movies are not underestimated?) If I remember correctly, the solution to the mystery was a kind of variation (but not "d" 2001), because the computer controlling the spacecraft was actually a man who had been turned into a computer. And like HAL, they tried to disconnect its "spirit", but not its mechanical components, and as with HAL, this led to a disaster. There is at least one funny moment. When the character of Christopher Cary, who does not find food, finds the pet bird abandoned, there is a kind of worrying moment, but then the obvious thing does not happen after all.
