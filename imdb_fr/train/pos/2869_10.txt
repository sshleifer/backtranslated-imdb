First of all, I want to say, "Thanks Disney for finally getting the movie" Cinderella "on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animated movies on DVD (including the Limited Edition of 1999)! Do you go next? You go to Disney World !!!!! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> In any case, Disney remains magical in his 1950 classic animated film, "Cinderella", the film that staged fairy tales. . We all know the story of Cinderella, her half-sisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just to say "Boppity-boppity-boo!", And of course to go home before midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like in this movie: It's a big old fairy tale that kids love, now in film form (as well as on DVD too) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
