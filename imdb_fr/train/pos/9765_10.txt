I saw this pretty little movie at the age of 10/11 in 1979, when it was broadcast on CBS. I did not know it had happened in a theater. To note from the point of view of children, I would give 4 stars out of 5, because it was a boy at the time, it seemed a little "girl". <br /> <br /> The culminating scene where Gazooks tickle everyone's daylight was a little disturbing at the time but you're getting too big for that sort of thing. <br /> <br /> When I rediscovered a blockbuster video in 1995, I had to see it again! I still loved him despite the fact that he looked a bit "old". I do not know where the other reviewer got the idea that it was not on VHS. <br /> <br /> It's there. Maybe even be on DVD now, at least I hope it is. I want to share it with my children someday! 10 stars here, it's always a good movie for kids. (close) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally found a copy VHS !! Woo-hoo!
