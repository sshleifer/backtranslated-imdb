I think it's the most powerful film HBO Pictures has ever made. This film should have been released in theaters for the public to watch on the big screen. It is available on video so be sure to research it and check it. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the script. The performances of Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are flawless. A masterpiece of its kind.
