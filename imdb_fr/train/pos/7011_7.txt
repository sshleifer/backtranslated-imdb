First, I liked this movie. It was well played by all. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand the comments that some tell me about a surprise ending. I did not know anything about this movie except for a few "do-it-yourself" recommendations, but I knew where the plot was in less than ten minutes. (I will not mention what taught me not to ruin a good movie for others.) Still, it seemed obvious, but I kept looking. It was nice to see how everything went, specifying the details and motivations of the characters in the following scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not hate this when I guess the end is happening early in the movie. I hate it only when the path of resolution is lined with boring landscapes. <br /> <br /> The character of Will Smith on the screen is quite nice, even when playing a character so troubled. He is energetic and credible in everything I've seen him do. Seven Pounds is another good performance. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a strong performer, portraying an original, rather optimistic character despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and, with Rosario, if you do not find it beautiful, you should consider replacing it with your eyes. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I have not seen much of it lately, but it could be me. Woody did not have much time on the screen, but he sold his cheerful character, playing piano and blind, for all he was worth. Excellent. <br /> <br /> A little research on the jellyfish box tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I think this makes it a dubious choice for both the animal and the plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, I will not recommend this film for intrigue, but for very good performances and for the fact that it evokes some of the tragic emotions that we usually try to avoid.
