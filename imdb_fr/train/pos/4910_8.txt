This very good film cracks under tension. The stakes are obviously important: will the police and Widmark, the doctor of public health, apprehend the criminals who do not know that they carry the plague before the outbreak of the epidemic? But smaller elements of the plot create tension in every scene - between Widmark and the captain of the police, between the villains incarnated by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a man bruised by the plague who mistakenly believes to be the subject of a clandestine hunt in a valuable commodity, between Widmark and his wife, and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or by hiding the situation to avoid widespread panic. The film is superbly shot by Kazan. The shooting takes place in New Orleans. It ends with a breathtaking climax, where Palance flees like a rat from his pursuers, through the docks and warehouses of the city. The comment is superb, probably the best I've heard, covering cinematography, framing and lighting plans, the design of production, the cast of non-professional actors in small roles and the ironies and parallels of the plot, as an insightful seminar on cinematographic techniques of the 1950s and film noir in general. Watch it once to enjoy the film all by yourself and, if you are interested in making a movie, a second time with the comment to learn.
