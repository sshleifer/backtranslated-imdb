I can not believe some of the comments on this show! The show is only genius! Of course, this does not correspond to what has been tried and true, but as consumers, we always want the same things to be imposed on us again and again. Should not we be able to sit back and enjoy something new from time to time. The style is not as realistic as that of "Scooby Doo", but it's not supposed to be. The show is titled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo get a clue", in the part of this title, it is stated that all the beloved cast of other performances would be constantly joining the action. And nowhere do they say they solve mysteries and they do not even support monsters, so why would they? In fact, I'm glad they put some long-running plot points that work in a Scooby-Doo show. They still have jokes, clumsy collisions, quick change outfits in pursuit scenes, standard lane gag and even Scooby snacks. In fact, I'm glad this show is airing because I love it. I'm even glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and focused on two main characters and one villain. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's ridiculous, it's supposed to be! Of course it's different, it's supposed to be. It's supposed to make you laugh at the villain and encourage the fool robot conveyor to triumph over any intrusive vermin, no matter how small. You're supposed to have the "Roobi-Roo" joke. Everything is so well put in place that there is not one thing I can think that is FALSE with it. The writing, the acting, the animation, everything is top. The title music is great (my computer plays "GET A CLUE!" When it starts), and the background music is just striking.
