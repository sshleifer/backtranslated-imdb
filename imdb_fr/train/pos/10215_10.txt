Most people who are looking for films featuring Audrey Tautou do not seem to understand that Amélie was a character - she's not really Audrey Tautou's true personality. Therefore, every film in which she participates will not be Amélie part 2, part 3, etc. <br /> <br /> That said, I too chose this film just because Audrey was there. Yes, it's true, there's a big void after the first scene where she's not seen at all for perhaps 45 minutes, but she did not miss me because I had so much fun with the other characters. The guy who's lying about everything is too funny, the guy who justifies the people who come out of his coffee and jump on the bill by finding coupons and others that make up for the loss, actually .... get into all Characters here could take a long time, but it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The character of Audrey Tautou, Irene, is not a girl too sweet like that of Amelie. In fact, as Irene, her rudeness towards a tramp asking for change caught me off guard at first. In this film, Irene is a girl who has good intentions, but during a day (very awful), his disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie just great is you have all these stories and intrigues really interesting ... very fun to watch, beautiful landscapes and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all characters can play. The best part of the film comes with about 20 minutes remaining ... It's at this moment that all the intrigues begin to get entangled and that the walk resumes and everything is connected and makes sense, and that whole butterfly effect blooms. I swear it was the best 20 minutes of film I've seen in a while, and the end ... It made me think "fucking I was really lucky to find this movie". The end of this film is top. Whoever wrote the script for this purpose is brilliant, because not only are all these other subplots, but they are somehow connected together (and in a reasonable way, as is the case here), but they also allow each character to feel better. human and alive, not just a stale character used as a crutch to create all this butterfly effect ... very impressive. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest this film because it is an excellent movie to watch at any time, in any mood, with any company or alone.
