The Haunting is a film that claims a really scary home, good effects and sound, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and of this house. There are scenes that make you jump and the sinister aspects of what happened at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are some really scary moments in the film and I liked how the ghosts manifested themselves in the sheets, the curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave him the right atmosphere and the sound design made sure voices were heard around you. What I would like to do is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to face and I think he was a little too restrained. Poltergeist made a mistake when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds. The Haunting could have used some more scenes of pure terror. The end was for me a little anticlimatic. Overall, I liked it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish it scared me more.
