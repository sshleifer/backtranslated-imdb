I did not expect to love this movie as much as I did. I just because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films of all time. It did not look really great. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memory. <br /> <br /> This is a woman of twenty who wants to know everything. She stores all the information she collects in a huge archive. She is experimenting with sex, political activism and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film crew is shown and we see their reactions to the story and to each other. Nudity, explicit sex and controversial politics prevented the film from being screened in the United States, while its seizure by Customs was appealed. The film is a story, but it's a documentary that shows us the filmmakers' backstage world during the story, the fourth wall being broken. This film is the most direct way possible to make a movie that I have ever seen. The film works primarily as a time capsule of the 1960s psychedelic events, the struggle for freedom and sexual liberation. I like to think about it more than that. <br /> <br /> I did not think I would like to waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but I really do. This film is a buried treasure. Tries.
