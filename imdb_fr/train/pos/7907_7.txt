I completely agree with the score given to this film, and I think it is an example of the brevity of most viewers in the world. Really ... Are you forgetting that cinema was a kind of art before some of the magnates tried to make it an entertainment? This movie is not entertainment, at least not the easy entertainment you get with movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it's different, it's shocking ... That's why most of you have hated it so much: because it does not try to please you. It's just a story, very strange, I admit, but after all, a strange story. It's not a beautiful story, not even a good movie job, but I think it's worth giving a 7-star rating to the courage of the author and the director to shoot a story that is not made to please the public, and that would yield billions of copies and make the big studios even richer. This film is, for me, a European-style film made in the United States, and all those who apply it deserve respect. Whether for courage, or for the unique sense of humor.
