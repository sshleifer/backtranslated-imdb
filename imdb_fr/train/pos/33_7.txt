This interesting Giallo presents a typical but always fascinating plot and a really sadistic assassin who obviously likes to stalk his victims before murdering them in a bloody way. <br /> <br /> Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia who, a year earlier, also did the very interesting "The Evelyn note Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment on this subject), the film begins a little slowly, but overall, you do not waste time with useless intrigues or sequences. <br /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but it was released in Germany in video only in a version of 15 minutes intrigue under the stupid title "Horror House". At least, the scenes of murder, which will satisfy all greyhounds, are completely intact and the viewer always understands the motive of the killer at the end. But the Italian version containing all the images is always the one to look for. <br /> <br /> A convincing Giallo with mandatory twists and red herrings, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is highly recommended to Giallo fans and slightly superior to the other thriller mentioned above from Miraglia.
