I am a university student and I need the help and comments of all those who have a mother's point of view in the film, at the mother's. Whether you have experienced something similar or just wanted to comment and help me do more research on this film, any comments would be greatly appreciated. Comments will only be used for review purposes and will be included in my written exam. So, if you have opinions, I'm sure you can use them and you can help me get an A! I'm also studying 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole', so if you've seen these movies too, I'd be grateful if you'd leave comments here on this page. Thank you.
