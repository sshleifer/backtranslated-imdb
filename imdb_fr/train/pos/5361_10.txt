If you have grown up with a game show diet, you will understand that you are gradually in need of a larger and more effective solution. In the world of Running Man, your needs will be met. In this TV game, the prisoners fight for freedom and the ultimate prize: their lives. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was such a parody of agonizing tripe that we look at every day. This is not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but overall it's a very good movie. The underlying idea that TV companies will one day be the "real" leaders of the planet is very credible and is very well described in this film. Of course, there are the usual Arnie one-liners, my favorite is when he's about to be catapulted into the gamezone, the game show host asks "Last words?" Arnie says, "Yes, I'll be back" but the host launches "Only in a retry" and presses the eject button. I give this film a 10 for pure originality. I must have watched it 30 times or more. The only movie outside the Die Hard series that I have watched often !! <br /> <br /> In short, do not believe for a moment that you are the owner of T.V. - It belongs to you .....
