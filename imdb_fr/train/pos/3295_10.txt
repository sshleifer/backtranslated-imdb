Such a beauty film that is difficult to describe. Maybe it's the lack of superfluous dialogue, or maybe the absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it's just Meena Mumari's feet, but it's a pleasure to watch this movie again and again . I've never seen another Indian film approaching, and there are few countries that compete with perfection.
