Ang Lee clearly likes to slip into a movie, catch the action, the characters and the hoof, as they emerge. Covering the random end of the American Civil War through the random actions of a young, ill-informed or grown-up militia, this is an ideal approach. The film deals with the formation of personalities, adulthood and relationships. Lee also shows the magnificent panoramas of the south-central as a silent character, enduring the conflict as a sturdy parent. <br /> <br /> The scenario of James Schamus is probably the standard bearer of this film; Behind him are a number of well-appointed representations that carry him admirably. The name of Jeffrey Wright alone could carry this film for me. It is brilliant here, but in a role that turns slowly: instead, we enjoy very good performance (if not revealing) of a large set often recognizable. <br /> <br /> A noble and optimistic film. Watch out for example if you do not like Cold Mountain or The Claim, sweeter and more sweet and sour. 7/10
