This is not a film as bad as some critics, and as summarized in the summary on the IMDB page of this film, it is. Why? First, in 1984, filmmakers had the audacity to confront, as part of the intrigue, the problem of domestic violence - reviewers who complain about the plot unfortunately miss one of the main points! Secondly, without the intrigue of the relationship between Prince and his father in a movie, the musical climax would not work as well. Critics who say that only music is good have, once again, missed one of the points - in particular, WHY it's so good ... because all the music in this movie has an elemental background. intrigue that makes music more effective. Third, give pause to this movie! For producers and filmmakers for the first time, it's not that bad! There are far worse films out there by accomplished movie people !! And finally, critics who say that music is "good" have also missed the point - check out Prince's range of stylistic musical treatments, variety, musicality and stage performance - truly one of a kind, musically go there where no one was heading in the 1980s, and with a style that is found in the work of other artists (clothing and movement: what are the key elements of the composition, those of Michael Jackson or Prince? , see if you can see flaring fingers sweeping in front of Prince's eyes in this film, long before Quentin Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction." As a sum of its parts, it's not a bad movie at all.
