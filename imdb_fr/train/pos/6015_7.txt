In the early 1970s, many of us who embraced the hippie / acid / alternative culture wholeheartedly understood that society in general was not going to change the way we imagined it. For me, this film has defined the tension of "now what?" that many people I knew had felt at that time. Are we going to the commune and creating our own vision of utopia or radicalizing ourselves and asking for change? <br /> <br /> From futile gestures to police, from radical rhetoric, Pink Floyd's music, to love making and explosive images in the desert - there's so much there in. It captures a significant moment in time.
