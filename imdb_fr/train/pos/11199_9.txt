I sometimes get tired of reading less-known Hitchcock film reviews, because almost everyone starts with someone who says it's grossly neglected or is a Hitchcock hidden gem or 'a real genious Hitchcock or other generic if - only - people - would like - to look - this - they - would see - that - this - is - a - big - Hitchcock - movie - just - like - a lot - like - As long as - Vertigo - North - through - North West - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc. So, that being said, I would just like to say that if - only - people - would look - this - they - would see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock movie - just - like - - a lot - like - Dizziness - North - by - North West - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc. <br /> <br /> Now, it's likely to go a little over, the Ring is not far from the imagination even in the same league as one of those movies mentioned twice above, but compared to other films that Hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 's The Ring is one of the best films photographed and performed. As an almost brand new director, there are astonishing dream sequences and brilliant editing segments that show why Hitchcock attracted so much attention early in his career. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film begins with, among other things, the extremely disturbing spectacle of a black circus idiot (and I use silly in a definitive way, as Stephen King so often does). to throw eggs and fruit by a crowd of whites who do not look very classy. I guess this only illustrates how incredibly different these circuses and people were at the time, but I think this is one of the most disturbing sequences of all the Hitchcock films I've seen. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to hit any man in a round, but when he meets his match, it is against a man who challenges his authority. only in the ring, but also around his wife's finger. . Thus begins an entertaining challenge, even very tense, for the sake of a woman who seems to move from one man to another without effort and without thinking. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) There is, for example, a scene where her husband looks at her from above while she is being taken home late at night and just before entering the house. building, she is brought to the car for a kiss. This kiss is never explained, and there is also the fact that, even at the end, when she shows loyalty to her husband, or at least ultimately chooses it, they look at each other in the eyes but do not do not kiss. <br /> <The film is certainly beautifully photographed, even more than several films that Hitch made the following years. There is also a performance of Gordon Harker as a coach of One Round Jack who, in his expressionism with a stone face, reminds me quite often of the brilliant Buster Keaton. Hitch leaves a little ambiguous, but it's a good example of his early work.
