Ultra-dark criminal drama by Pou-Soi Cheang, director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", although it's not as polite as that. Nevertheless, it is an engaging and imperfect chaos about a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing, he kills the cop's partner Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is caring for his dying father. Sam starts a mad and obsessive manhunt for Pang that translates into nearly a dozen corpses and relentless violence. There must have been something in the air lately because I have never seen so many humans fighting each other goose bumps. It's a sinister and nasty thing, that's why I'm so biased, and I applaud its low rating. It's visually stunning and the sound design is truly unique. Dramatically, everything goes down until each character finds himself in a world of pain. A secondary plot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and creates a fourth surprise act that boasts a beautiful grotesque surgical gesture.
