For starters, I did not even know this show for about a year because of the Internet. I have never seen this on television in my country and many people are generally unaware of this show. It's a shame, because it's the most original and intelligent animation I've known in years. <br /> <br /> I do not give away 10 points, but it's a show that really deserves everything. 10 points. Although, at first glance, this may seem like a typical design, keep in mind that this is not a children's show. When the full story unfolds, you know it's a profound story, with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on animal spirits, an old Indian belief preserved for many years. This gives the show an original twist that you can not often find in animated shows. <br /> <br /> The general design is also something very different. Sometimes it looks a bit like Spawn in terms of sandblasted design, and at other times it takes a more style-based approach. I believe that David Feiss, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken, animated a segment of the series (because he also drew this segment in the comic strip). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a breathtaking show, show that it covers various topics such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, it's something you should not miss. Once you start looking, you will probably look at it all the way. A minor fact is perhaps that the series takes less material in comics, but it's not too boring. The only question remains however, where is the DVD ?!
