Having worked in downtown Manhattan and often eating my lunch on a summer day in a park near City Hall, I saw the mayor come and go. It was great to be able to go beyond the gates of City Hall and see how it looked in the lobby and throughout the building. Al Pacino (mayor of John Pappas), "Gigli", 2003, gave an outstanding performance throughout the film, especially when he delivered a speech to an African-American church for an audience. little boy who was killed. John Cusack (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Jury", 2003, was a devoted servant of the mayor and revered him in all his endeavors. Bridget Fonda, (Marybeth Cogan), begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives a tremendous supportive role. Last, but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", '01, played the role of a mafia leader who had some very difficult choices to make towards the end of the picture! Excellent movie with great performance and fantastic photography in New York!
