George Lopez is a funny man even without a sitcom. The first episodes I saw have too often made jokes at the expense of his mother. As I watched this more, there was more and more variety. Nobody on the cast is really safe from his mind now. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that as the season progresses, George is more and more comfortable with the role of the family sitcom. At first it was not, but it starts to do more and more in the groove. This makes it progressively funnier. They had added some characters for George to play this year too. The father of his wife is more and more involved in the plot. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but not as central as the previous seasons. I think it's safe to say with George's sense of comic timing and ABC's lack of good sitcoms, George Lopez is likely to be here on ABC long after George W. Bush.
