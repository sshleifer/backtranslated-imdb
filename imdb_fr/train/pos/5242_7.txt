I really enjoyed this movie for two reasons. The first is that it gives an insight into the world of loyalty in Northern Ireland, which is very rarely treated in the movies, most of which tell us about the Republican struggle. The second reason is the performance of the actors. I thought they gave a very honest and convincing portrait of a very shady underworld that few people have heard of outside of my native shores. <br /> <br /> In summary, it is an entertaining film ganster with outstanding performances of one in the Northern Irish actors. This will not move the Earth, although it may slightly open the eyes of some people to the troubled world of loyalist paramilitaries.
