I do not know if it's a sitcom or not, but I agree it's one of the best TV shows of all time. It's great that this show is still airing. And I love Michelle It's cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she was talking, and she sometimes said something funny. Aw. <br /> <br /> This show may be of interest to children, teens and ... families who are going through difficult times and trying to cope with their families. I do not know who would ever refuse an opportunity to watch this show with someone. <br /> <br /> I like the episode when I think her name is DD .. the eldest daughter accidentally stole a sweatshirt and she learned a lesson on the flight. It was a good episode. An example showing that this TV show shows the family who works in family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to everyone.
