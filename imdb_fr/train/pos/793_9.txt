I really liked this movie. (That's why I was surprised by the so low ranking of this site by so many users!) I'm not saying it's a cinematic masterpiece, but it was a great way to pass a cold and snowy Saturday night. It's funny, poignant, and it's a great story of the ups and downs of female friendships that go through hard times and bad things that friends tend to do to each other! (Patience, ladies, we've all been here!) Bill Paterson shines as Reverend Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove she can be a great actress when the role is right and she thinks about it. (And really, there's the best "wedding escape" I've ever seen or imagined in this movie ... more courage than anyone I've ever known!) You'll laugh and cry --- ignore all the marketing campaigns and how this movie is being marketed ... it's a hidden gem that should have made TONNES box office (now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
