"The Mother" tells the story of a mother of two grown children (Reid), a widow from her mid-sixties who died the day after her husband's death. the married lover of his daughter. The film talks about the silently passive mother, her tenuous relationship with her adult son and daughter, the silent needs she tries to calm down in bed with her young lover and the convolutions that flow from it. A somewhat antiseptic drama with noisy psychodramatic currents, "The Mother" does a great job of realistically dealing with uncomfortable problems while avoiding free sensationalism. Will play better with a more mature audience, perhaps women, who could better understand the central character, his needs and his problems. (B +)
