In my opinion, A GUY THING is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic and quite gorgeous chicks movie that guys will also enjoy. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles were dazzled as a disconcerted future bride and his future sexy handsome cousin. If you ask me, they lit the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before closing, I would like to say that the performances were first-rate, that the direction was perfect, that the design of the production was pleasant, that the casting was perfect and that the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, I recommend this film to all fans of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles. You have a lot of laughs and thrills, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, relax with a friend and watch it.
