I enjoyed watching this movie very late on TV and it kept my interest throughout the image. This wonderful, gloomy but mysterious English house, with dubious decorations, furniture, and rooms, makes you wonder why you would like to rent this house or even own it. There are four (4) stories about this house, and every resident of the house faces all kinds of problems. You will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the house, as well as the sweet birds singing, but make no mistake, there is a horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", '80 gives an excellent performance as a person living at home and even Christopher Lee, "The Curse of the Purple Altar", 68, and his granddaughter, Chloe Franks, (Jane Reid ) make a wonderful exciting story together, her daughter loves to read WITCHCRAFT BOOKS for some reason! If you like scary, horrible and mysterious movies, with a lot of surprises, here is the FILM FOR YOU !!!!
