Dudley Moore is fantastic in this great unknown classic. This film is a very spiritual film that relies heavily on the talent of the actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. It's not always well filmed and sometimes has very nerdy music that tries to force a mood (the music "psycho" in the wedding fight), but the actor overcomes it. The character Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But he is evolving well towards a more mature and more complete character, learning to live of his own free will. The end is pretty lame, though. I will not give it, but it could be improved. To see many times.
