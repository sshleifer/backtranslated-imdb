First, I have to start by saying that I am a big fan of Nightmare on Elm Street. I think it's the biggest horror series of all time. For me, Freddy is the boogeyman! Of course, Freddy's Dead, who tried to be the last chapter of the time, is a strange film. It does not have the same atmosphere as the previous movies. Freddy has a lot of time on the screen. Some people think that makes it less scary, which I share. And that is, in my opinion, exactly the point. This film exists so that we can get to know Freddy a little better, who he is, who he was, how he became the man who haunts our dreams. For some people, it's a bad thing, it's better if you never know it because it's more scary not to know why evil is bad. Obviously, these people will not like Rob Zombie's Halloween remake. To really appreciate this one, you have to see things differently. This is not a strange guy hidden in the bush of the country of your dreams waiting to scare you. It was the first and it was great. Over the years, Freddy killed more and more people and no one could get rid of it forever. It is now time to know the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's realm of terror. In addition to the story of Freddy's past, I also loved the atmosphere of the film. More children in Springwood, only crazy adults. The nightmare scenes are all great. The soundtrack is awesome, especially the opening song "I'm Awake Now," played by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can not believe it's so underrated. Maybe it's misunderstood or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. There are a lot of scary moments, but also funny, and a lot of cameos! Get ready for something different and you may not be disappointed.
