A great addition to anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys is a movie you do not see every day. He has excellent actors to accompany an excellent story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he plays the same role as John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus kills everyone on the planet and leaves a few hundred survivors. The story is not new, but the story takes a new direction about it. <br /> <br /> A man (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information about a virus that has largely eliminated man. <br /> <br /> the actors were great. I must give a mention to Brad Pitt, who was hilarious at the meeting of psychiatric patient James Cole (Bruce) in a psychiatric hospital. <br /> <br /> The director did a remarkable job presenting us with a troubling image of a devastated future. by a synthetic virus. <br /> <br /> Animals seen in the world of viruses gave the impression of leading the world when humans are driven into underground facilities. <br /> <br /> This film was excellent and must see and also one must possess. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
