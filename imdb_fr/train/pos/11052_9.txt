When I was six, I heard about a series called "Los Campeones". Even though I was just a kid, I did everything I could to convince my parents to let me watch "The Champions" and "The Avengers" once a week. . I think it was the golden age of the English series ... (I already have the complete cycle of "The Prisoner"!) But also lasted a few years later with "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch "(I just got it, or it's" Harry Potter "in a girl, of course, before.) As much as I want" The Campions "to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I'm also waiting "Dr. Who" (packs the entire series into a set of, uh, maybe 300 DVDs, please, I could not spend more, 8), "People of Tomorrow", and many more " "Small budgets", but great stories to be available in my affected areas Speaking and understanding English, but not everyone in my family, including my parents, who introduced me to these beautiful stories .. I hope that someday, someone will be able to feel the appeal of this series and then sell them as I originally saw them, dubbed or subtitled, but in the same I have seen them Remember, zones 1 or 4 are acceptable with my TV!
