Karloff and Lugosi - Together again! This is one of those movies that casual fans will pass without them tending to appreciate less. It's not a complete horror movie like the two previous duo hits, The Black Cat and The Raven. But, it is very worthy of the talents of each one and it is a funny film when it is revisited. <br /> <br /> The Invisible Ray was directed by Lambert Hillyer, a director who mainly made westerns, but curiously in the last days of the reign of the Laemmles at Universal, he found himself at the helm of film and the latest horror film Laemmles, Dracula's Daughter. The two fantasies are crisp and precise, and the contents of horror are very light despite the fantastic elements. <br /> <br /> Just as Lugosi unleashed in The Raven, it must be said that Karloff played in Invisible Ray. One aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfactory is that Karloff's character, Rukh, is acting so madly before he is poisoned by Radium X, that there really is not much to change once he begins to shine. This is very similar to the complaint people have about Jack Nicholson in The Shining - He's basically a fool from the start. There is no real transformation. Same here. Midway, Karloff simply has an extra goal for revenge. I still enjoyed his performance, as did the exaggerated antics of Lugosi in The Raven. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lugosi completely surprises you and gives a sober and thoughtful ride as Rukh's scientific rival. Dr. Benet. Lugosi also has some of the best replicas of the film, including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch Rukh, which I agree with horror film writer John Soister - "What if (Rukh "touches someone?" the inspector asks Lugosi answers hesitantly, in a way that only Lugosi could deliver: "They die." Just as Lugosi could be so unpleasant, he could also be more perfect than any other This is one of those moments. <br /> <br /> As a result, the interactions between Karloff and Lugosi are all very good as we get Karloff's crazy antics against Lugosi's cold logic. Karloff would continue to play several times with similar crazy scientists, but we would like Lugosi to be able to play more straightforward roles like this, with only one chance left (Ninotchka). <br /> <br /> Invisible Ray is a fun movie and a treat for the real fans of Karloff and Lugosi. It's one of those movies that enhances every viewing, not because it's a masterpiece, but because of the charisma and talent of its stars and the way in which this story complements their darker pairs and more horrible. The special effects of John Fulton, always innovative, are fantastic and the supporting actors adequate. Frances Drake is as beautiful as in Mad Love and plays a strong woman, something rarely seen in classic horror movies. The scene at the end, when Karloff harasses her and she does not scream, is one of the most haunting moments in the film. A great and fun movie!
