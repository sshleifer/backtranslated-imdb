It could be WWE's second best PPV of the year after Wrestlemania, it was a good surprise! John Cena had a great game in which he upset Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained his world championship title in a short non-play match with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won a pretty tough match against Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a very good match with Kidman, which was a surprise for me. Booker T defeated The Big Show in a match without dq. At one point, Booker T kicked Chisel to Big Show and sent him across the table. In a foolish decision made by WWE Christian and Lance Storm, jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with the help of Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock played the game of the night with highs and lows and RVD was able to retain their championship through a QD, so I was happy to retain the title. Triple H has also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means nothing. And in the main event, Rock became the first to win the WWE World Championship title seven times, defeating both Kurt Angle and Undertaker in a three-game threat. Overall, this is probably the 2nd best WWV PPV in 2002! 7/10
