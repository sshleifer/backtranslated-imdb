Watch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films made during the Second World War. Paul Lukas certainly deserved his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brightly as the great actress and beauty she was. I would recommend this film to those who are interested in this era and, of course, to the fabulous films of the brilliant Mrs. Bette Davis.
