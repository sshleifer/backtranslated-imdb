The only thing noticeable about this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first major role. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is untapped, raw and refreshingly honest in this charming little sci-fi horror play. Steve will show himself as the anti-establishment actor and car lover, who would become an icon of the film industry in just five years. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen would say that he hated this movie and that he "was the drip". But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. If we had all stayed like this. <br /> <br /> The plot is rhythmic and although predictable, it remains an hour of entertainment pretty much. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he becomes the King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before she becomes Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD some time ago and it's a valuable addition to my Steve McQueen film collection.
