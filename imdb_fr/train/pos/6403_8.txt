MEN OF HONOR presents Cuba Gooding Jr., which is probably his best performance to date. He plays Carl Brashear, a man of courage and heroism. He is a poor farmer who wants to become a diver in the navy, but who has problems because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racist redneck who nevertheless grows up to respect Brashear. The film explains how Brashear faces almost insurmountable odds, not once but twice. The performances are what makes this film special. Gooding is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in film history, gives an impressive performance - his best dramatic work in years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as DeNiro's much younger wife. The film is based on patriotism a bit too loud (although nowhere near the level it was in THE PATRIOT), and some characters are just a bad format (Mr. Pappy of Hal Holbrook is so bad), but the film is a rarity among today's movies. It's edifying and non-cynical. A wonderful movie.
