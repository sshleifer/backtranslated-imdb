Guinea Pigs: The Devil's experience is without a doubt a ***** star at first sight. It is a realistic, frightening and disturbing look that explores the dark side of human nature. This film goes straight to the point, you think maybe how much? The goal is to satisfy fans of extreme and bloody violence. This film has gore, torturing more or less violently a woman. There are really only 3 scenes that could be considered gore. I'll tell you one thing if the guinea pig: the devil's experience makes Hostile look like Sesame Street. If you thought Hostile was a disturbing and brutal torture film, then you did not see half of it until you saw Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experience. <br /> <br /> Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0- 10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experience (Uncut) ***** (7)
