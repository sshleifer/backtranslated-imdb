After some of the negative reviews I heard about this movie, I doubted trying, but I had Â£ 3.99 in my wallet and I was thinking of playing money buying a budget like a movie and I saw this and i gave it there and i'm happy i did it, i enjoyed it. Directed by movie stars such as Chain Reaction, The Ring, Bourne Identity, (Brian Cox), I had to play with it even though it was hogwash, but it was not at all, I found it funny humor, especially Alfred Molina the star of Spider-man 2 the character Doc Ock. It was excellent, the most enjoyable part of the movie. Of course, like many other people who bought this movie, I saw Matthew's name and that's what made me understand! And no, its part is not huge at all, it's very short at the very end of the film, it's not a big part that makes me think that's why people hate the movie . I suggest you try. Some parts are poor who need polishing, action games and a little more action. But it is observable.
