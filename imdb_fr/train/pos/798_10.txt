This excellent drama kept me in suspense all the time. I could not leave the screen for a second because each word connected the pieces to this confusing murder. This film really touched me because it showed how sad and difficult life can be. In the end, I really cried (which I do not want to give up!). It also allowed me to realize how cruel and disgusting people are about murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The only bad member of the cast was the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a good job, but not the director. I say that because he found someone who did not look like Anne Anne Fahey at all.
