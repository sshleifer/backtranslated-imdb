Whatever you become in your life, you must never forget that you have roots. This is the story of real facts that has been transformed into a beautiful and moving film! I dare to say that this film is well underestimated. This shows us a reality of life ... the more evil surrounds you, the better you become. Trust your instinct and know that the ideal of life is to live it happy ... without rancor, without living "under a rock". The concept of the film is more than interesting ... linking storytelling to real events ... keeping us informed of everything from facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! See, I recommend it to all young people. It's not racism, it's about living your life!
