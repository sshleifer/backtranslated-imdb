I remember Parker Posey in "As The World Turns" before becoming the Queen of Independent Films. In this film, Posey shows her potential as an actress in her own right. In this film with a cast that includes Omar Townsend in the role of Mustapha, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel vendor on the street and aspires to become a teacher. The troupe presents a wonderful actress who plays the role of her godmother and her only family, Judy, the old-fashioned, devoted and menopausal librarian. Posey while Mary learns that she has to grow and mature. The loss of his position as Library Clerk makes him realize how much he misses a place in his life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side village in New York before she gets bogged down with yuppies. This film is good enough for a freelancer and I came to enjoy Parker Posey as Mary as well as other characters in other movies.
