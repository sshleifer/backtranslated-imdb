I was speechless and annihilated after my first reading - many of GRAY GARDENS 'parts are very funny and incredibly surreal - not documentary, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a good deal for the weirdsville draw. I focused on how these women (who are clinically well beyond the eccentric) reveal their humanity in the most surprising way, and I wonder if their retirement from the world was caused by anything beyond Beyond the congestion of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, perhaps some abuse, or maybe just a wave of challenge and rebellion that are beyond their control and take a life apart. It may be one of the greatest movies ever made that is dangerously close to exploitation, without going far beyond - as the Edies do, I kept noting things like empty gin bottles in the room full of rubble, cats urinating on the bed, raccoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a kid's birthday party that went badly wrong . It's definitely worth seeing and looking for - you'll never forget it, but it's very disturbing.
