Excellent film showing the pathetic life of two old ladies hazelnuts. They could not live together or separated. By chatting constantly, sometimes at the same time, they chopped and chopped up the past; again and again on what could-should-shoulda woulda. I sometimes laughed at laughing, but most of the time, I was impressed by the sadness and abandonment of these two women. See this one.
