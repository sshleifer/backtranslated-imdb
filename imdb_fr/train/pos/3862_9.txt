As I am always looking for something new and unique, I watched this film online. I thought it would be just another "B" rate movie, but I was surprised by the acting. All the actors in this film were very capable and well directed. The plot was wonderful and unique also with an excellent moral for the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is certainly not for those who are looking for a sexual adventure, "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and guts. It's a wonderfully poignant film that shows some dark realities of life, the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting. I even saw a lot of people with high box office incomes. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
