Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an aspiring writer who is always looking for a chance. During this time, he works as a telephone counselor for a psychic hotline in Manhattan. One day, unfortunately, his building burned. Parker and his cat are alive, but now face the arduous task of finding affordable housing in the Big Apple. The news comes to Parker that a woman, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate but will only accept a gay man. Since Parker is straight but the price is right, he decides to pretend he's gay. Samantha loves her from the beginning and welcomes her as her new cohabitant. But, poor Parker. Sam is charming, intelligent and very desirable. How will he be able to keep his true nature under control? Besides, does not Sam have a successful businessman anyway? It's a sweet, friendly and humorous film with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Naturally, the plot is a succession of scenes "How can I follow this trick," with Sam asking Parker to give her shampoo while she takes a shower or begging him to hold her in bed when she receives bad news. In addition, it is necessary for Parker to produce his own "fake" gay mate, Boris, when Sam insists on rehabilitating him with a man she knows. Let's hope that the gay community will not find that too shocking, because this viewer thought that most issues were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. For a small film, costumes, sets and work with the camera were also very nice. Therefore, if you like these funny love stories, get them soon. You will love what you see, I know it.
