I really like this film, but it's a fact that you can not understand it unless you come from the former Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are now dead and they were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All this was in the former Yugoslavia, a melting pot of Balkan nations. It could be a dream land if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists did not poison the spirit of the country with their sick ideas.
