The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite movies. I first saw it as the Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it came out for the first time and has loved it ever since. I ended up seeing him 6 times in the theaters, and if it were aired today, I would go out to see him again. <br /> <br /> Now, many of the critics cited here mention the wonderful performances of the main roles. Matthau was brilliant, but had the misfortune of being nominated against Randall P. MacMurphy, portrayed as an Oscar by Jack Nicholson, in "Cuckoo Heart." Burns won, even though Richard Benjiman deserved at least to be nominated. Even the smallest roles have been played to perfection, as Fritz Feld auditioning for advertising on potato chips. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the reason why I reviewed this movie, the direction of the very underrated Herbert Ross, nobody plays "The Owl And The Pussycat" on the screen and makes it a full movie, starts again, opens the pieces without making them look like a photographic play. 20 minutes before the beginning of the film, we arrive at the scene that opens the room, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tells him about the special comedy. first few minutes, the sequence itself is totally new. A few years ago, I attended the rehearsal of the play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall on Broadway, which was wonderful. But I think Ross and the screenwriter and playwright Simon have improved it. It's just a wonderful movie.
