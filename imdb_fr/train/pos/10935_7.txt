Well, I must say it was a funny movie. Despite the fact that the dubbing was rather corny and that there were some strange moments when the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason, I was not disappointed. The story was actually quite interesting: the last member of the Poison clan must find the other five members and find out who among them uses his skills for evil and uses them for good. The problem was that during training, all members of the clan were masked. Since then, they have all returned to society disguised and changed their name. <br /> <br /> Fights are a pleasure to watch, each member of the Poison The clan has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. In the fight scenes, the actors jump everywhere, and fortunately the camera stays planted and uses a plan wide enough for you to see all the action. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of the film is that the story tends to slip a bit in the first half until the first fight sequence. But stay with that and you will not be disappointed!
