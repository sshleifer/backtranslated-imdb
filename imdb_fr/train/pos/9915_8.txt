I had nowhere to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I probably would have missed this movie if I did not choose Air Canada. Observed on a small screen at the back of the seat, I found it captivating and mesmerizing. I drifted to a few places and had to go back but I had to look to the end. Now, I can not wait for the release of the DVD in Europe, but it remains to be seen if I will be as punchy when I can go out the door! <br /> <br /> The photographic composition is superb and the film gives so much insight and "complete" the story told by the photographs. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have free time).
