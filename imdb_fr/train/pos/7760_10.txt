Director Douglas Sirk once again marks with this, the grandmother of all dysfunctional family films. This lush and trashy epic is a masterpiece that perfectly combines all the elements of Sirk's leaflets and strategically places them in a single film. "Written on the Wind" has obviously influenced the television series of the 1980s "Dallas" and "Dynasty", as it is essentially a long version of these nocturnal soap operas. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, wonderfully and subtly Lucy Moore, a New York city secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the secretary, calm but sexy. They all return to the Kyle family mansion in Texas, where we meet his white stalker, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning tour). Yipee! The sparks begin to fly - novels to cat fights, this is a campy trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight his feelings for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone because she can not have her only true love, Mitch. To top it off, Kyle learns that he is helpless, but Lucy ends up getting pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love him? This film is one of Universal's most popular films and one of the best works of director Sirk. Some dialogues are absolutely hot and visual metaphors are projected from all sides - the theme of the wind is great. The distribution is excellent, although Bacall is completely underutilized despite the fact that Hudson has been at the forefront of technology. The loss of Stack at the Oscars would have devastated him. He considered this to be his best performance and was apparently not too happy to lose. And it turned out a fabulous performance as a moaning alcoholic. What a beautiful movie! This film proves what I think for years: Sirk is the master of classical melodrama. Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
