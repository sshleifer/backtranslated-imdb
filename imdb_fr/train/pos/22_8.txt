If you advance quickly in the horrible songs, you will find a classic fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is very funny and surprisingly good in the role. His well-known acting style is perfect for Puss in Boots. The other actors are doing well for their roles. I did not find any of the actors terribly wrong or clumsy. The king in particular, however, appears as a dunce, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I do not remember the original story. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not too fake as some of the computer-generated tariffs we see today. Overall, I recommend this film to children and adults who care about it.
