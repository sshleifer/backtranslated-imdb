I can not believe this film is currently rated 6.9. Anyway, this movie was probably one of the most touching Indian movies I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a film about traditional family cinema. As for the story, I thought it was great, it was an arranged marriage between Shahid Kapur and Amrita Rao. He is a little happy, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who helps her uncle a lot, but the only problem is that her cousin does not seem to attract as much attention as she loves him so much that her aunt do not like Amrita with a passion. It upsets Amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her. It was also very touching to see that although Amrita's family was not as rich as the middle class, while the Shahids were more senior-class, she still treated her family with respect and did not even ask for criticize her. hit a nerve with me. It's because I have actually seen very rude people with people who do not think so far below their standards, which I think is very superficial. This film showed that the Shahids family was willing to take an interest in the great values ​​with which Amrita had been raised and turned a blind eye to the fact that she was not a wealthy business mogul or other girl. Overall, this film deserved an 8/10 I hope that more and more of this type of films are made.
