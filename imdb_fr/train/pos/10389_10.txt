I saw this movie when I was a child. It blew me away. It was before the time of television, so a film of this magnitude could send a young child into orbit. It impressed me so much that I went to see this film for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at that time were well ahead of his time. Sabu was a real treat, as was Rex Ingram as a genius. I found myself singing "I want to be a sailor" for months after the film's departure. I would recommend this movie to everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was such a naughty character that you would like to meet him. In addition, June Duprez has never been as beautiful as it was in this photo. The color was exceptional. Give this movie an AAA!
