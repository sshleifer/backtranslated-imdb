A fierce and incredibly intelligent work by the talented British writer Hanif Kureishi who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette" (the best thing he has ever done since). These are smart people whose lives do not count much. They have wasted what they have received and are largely empty ships. The only character living on the screen is the mother of the title but she feels dead until a rough handyman shows her affection and awakens to the joys of sex. He has his own motives but Kureishi treats him with great compassion. It's a movie in which people and places feel familiar, where characters exist beyond the limits of the screen. In some ways, it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" but it's a bit more difficult work. The director, Roger Michell, allows scenes to be built instinctively. And it's beautifully played. <br /> <br /> As the eponymous mother Anne Reid betrays her ruined life in every gesture. There is no false note in his extraordinarily experienced performance, and this very good actor Daniel Craig displays nuances on his character that even Kureishi has not yet exploited. If the film has a false note, it may be in the character of the girl without talent, caught in a complicated case with the man that his mother seduces (or should it be otherwise) and in a life still more complicated, but she played so well by Cathryn Bradshaw, she still hangs on you. The film is also extremely beautiful to watch (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and must undoubtedly rank as the best British film of the year.
