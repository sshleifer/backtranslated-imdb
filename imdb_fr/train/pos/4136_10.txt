I really liked Laurence Olivier these last weeks and I was delighted to discover this jewel. I have always found it wonderful to see a movie where I do not need to touch the remote if nudity is ugly. <br /> <br /> The divorce of Lady X is charming until The final scene had to be a real delight for viewers in 1938. I only wish that people today can accept and love real humor instead of the horrible trashy speech that people now call funny. <br /> <br /> X is well worth anyone's time.
