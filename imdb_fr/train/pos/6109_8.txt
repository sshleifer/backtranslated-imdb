My Tutor Friend is a well-written romantic comedy movie that has something similar to My Sassy Girl. There are no kissing / sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more about Korean productions. It is not always necessary to have sex in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The film is light, with occasional cartoon scenes that mingle with the film. I like the party when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The funniest moment is when Ji-Hoon hit Su-Wan's first love because he threw Su-Wan for another girl and he will soon be a father. The way he became a father was revealed in the following scene, which brings a smile to the audience. <br /> <br /> Mao Points: 8/10
