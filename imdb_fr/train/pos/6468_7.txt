It's a nice film OK ... yes, some parts are lame and exceptionally practical, and the film does not really justify the big distribution (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor who really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with singer KK). In the scene where he met for the first time the character of Amitabh, I thought that a man who could only look AB, continue to look and not say a word, while looking strong , was definitely a good actor. In fact, he again proved his worth in Sarkar, alongside AB for the second time. This guy should have more roles, he is brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you read the other reviews on IMDb, you already know the plot, and I agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry to Pakistan was a bit too easy. And the little angle of love he shared with "what-her-face" was completely useless. But he's a pretty good actor (as we see in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is cool to watch, always. and AB ... what can I say. I do not know if I'm his biggest fan in the world, but I know I can really compete for the job. <br /> <br /> An interesting watch, given that it's Bollywood, although a little inspired by the Hollywood oldies like "The Great Escape" and "Bridge over the Kwai River".
