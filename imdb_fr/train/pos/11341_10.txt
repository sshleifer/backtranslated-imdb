This is perhaps the most nostalgic journey in time and in time, when childhood begins with a journey through memories, in both directions, in both directions, in both directions. Jimmy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, Lion Ludicrous, and even the wicked Witchie Poo also through. The inspirations of Lidsville's last days, "The Sea Monsters of Saturday and Saturday, Brady's Pre-season for Kids," and Land of the Lost, both new and old, are the topics on which this show has bridged the gap, as well as the Donny & Marie Show, The Brady Bunch Variety Hour, aka Brady Bunch Hour & Even The Paul Lynde Halloween Special. Perhaps other things between Beyond the Buck continue to advance and even beyond expectations and unexpected limits. Now that we're updated in March 2006, we know that Jack Wild is gone and now it's even more symbolic for us to be really nostalgic.In August 2006, Jack Wild was playing the lead role himself on Sigmund and The Sea Monsters, as well as another episode, HRPuffinstuff too and to remember all the other nostalgic trips of all the characters of Syd & Marty Kroft, including the HRPuffinstuff Goodtime Club, the Donny and Marie Show, the Variety Hour Brady Bunch, aka The Brady Bunch Hour, etc. In truth, Stephen "Steve" G.
