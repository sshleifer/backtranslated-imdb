I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier, it's a great fan fiction series and I can not wait to see more. I only started watching this series last week and I just can not get enough of it. I have already recommended it to other people because it is well worth the view. I have watched each episode several times and I am waiting to see more episodes out. I noted it 10 but I think it deserves a dozen dollars. My compliments to the staff of the Star Trek Hidden Frontiers for its great work. If you like Star Trek, I highly recommend watching this Star Trek fiction movie. The detail associated with this series of films is excellent, especially the vessels and planets used
