A nice effort for an Australian show. which is probably not surprising in that there seems to be some upsurge in quality Australian drama. can I compare this show to the brilliance of love my way? no. but that recalls our old secret life. the casting is awesome, gibney is working his magic in the first two episodes I've seen, the british cast is strong, especially the characters callum and lizzie. but forsythe may be the emergency light (not that it needs to be saved) if this show is to have another season. I was not a fan of his performance in the awesome impressive mini-series a few years ago, but he was great as a young man always greener. It's also good to see Brooke Satchwell again. hope the show continues to improve with each episode.
