Well, I just discovered that there is a more disgusting and shocking show than "Little Britain" and I like that! "The League of Gentlemen" is a morbid British comedy about the most terrible, disgusting and disgusting little town in the UK. This place gives Dibley and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") a rather normal appearance !! The format of the show is very similar to LITTLE Britain, with the difference that it is centered on the inhabitants of this infernal city. Both series present the same sketches for each episode and some of them are obviously inspired by "Little Britain" (especially the class skit looking for a job). But the series differs because although it is as crude as "Little Britain" (so it's not a series for children), the series has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these series. Animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Now, if you have not guessed it, it's NOT a show for kids, easily offended people or normal people and loved c. However, you really need a very thick skin and an awful love to make the most of it. Funny and incredibly irreverent - you have to see it to believe it.
