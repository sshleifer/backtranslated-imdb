The psychotic transsexual Bobbi murders the patient (Angie Dickinson) of a renowned doctor (Michael Caine), then sues the prostitute dear (Nancy Allen) who saw Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) suspected of the crime and teamed up with the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the murderer. <br /> <br /> This can be summed up in a few words: it's very sexy (Dickinson and Allen is superb), it's very bloody - with the kind of gore usually reserved for splashed movies, and the boy is he designed well. Screenwriter / director De Palma's scenario is correct, but the latter's filmmaking capabilities are behind. It is very successful at the visceral level and I am interested / interested in these characters. I can notice the standard De Palma tributes to Hitchcock - at least one of Master's images. <br /> <br /> And to top it off, he has a professional and credible cast. <br /> <br /> It was De Palma's third film with his ex-wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies".) <br /> <br /> By the way, the dancer became actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the production assistants. There is a little triviality for you. <br /> <br /> I would not think that a thriller could be elegant and bloody at the same time, but this photo detaches it. <br /> <br /> One of the best is a particularly striking score by Pino Donaggio. <br /> <br /> 8/10
