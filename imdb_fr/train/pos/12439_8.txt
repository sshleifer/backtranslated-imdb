While the main story is supposed to unfold in Morocco, this film was shot in foggy Romania in 18 days with a very tight budget. As broken as their cards are, the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment, so that I finally found the result both touching and graceful. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau provides a great performance as a villain. The script and the direction provide some jewels. Whether you like the film or not, however, it will probably depend on your interpretation of Alexandra Staden in the lead role. Other critics have pointed out Staden's shortcomings as Modesty Blaise. They may be right, but I found his interpretation charming and very appropriate. Modesty manages to overcome terrible obstacles through discipline, innate talent and courage. Staden seems to be doing the same thing here.
