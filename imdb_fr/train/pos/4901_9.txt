No messages. No symbolism. Not an obscure current. Just a wonderful mix of music, nostalgia and good entertainment brought together by people who had fun. It is a refreshing antidote against the pretentious waste discarded by the studios. Of course, nothing with the incomparable Judi Dench deserves to be watched. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz vocals are a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. This goes on my movie shelf to be fired again whenever I feel the need for a warm experience and a cheerful laugh in a good mood. Just a wonderful movie!
