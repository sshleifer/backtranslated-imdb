It's a very good movie made for television. It describes the problems in the suburbs in the 1970s and the type of neighbors we do not want to have around us. The worst and most upsetting of this film occurred when punk teens killed the family dog. Teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family. But my boy !, The main character will take revenge on these punk teenagers at the end. The father / owner certainly does not take lightly the aggravation of punk teens and is quick to fight back after the lack of help from the police. He stands up to them and protects his home and his family. A very good actor..I could add. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV when I was 8 or 9 years old. I have never seen him on TV and I would like to Certainly a good one! This is the kind of movie you can watch very late at night on weekdays and you can not help but watch or watch a movie in the afternoon on a weekend. It's the kind they just do not show anymore. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth it!
