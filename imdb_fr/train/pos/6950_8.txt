On the day of the presidential primary in California, between midnight and 1 am, spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to the United States. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bauer has returned to his family and has problems at home with his teenage daughter Kimberly, who blames her mother Teri for excluding Jack from home. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim and discover that the girl has run away at home. While trying to solve his domestic problem, Jack is summoned by his colleague Nina Myers in the anti-terrorism unit for a meeting with their leader, Richard Walsh, who reveals a threat to the life of Senator David Palmer, presidential candidate , need to find the shooter. Later, Walsh has a private conversation with Jack and reports that there is a plot in the agency against David Palmer, and is summoning Jack in search of the conspirators. When a plane explodes over the Mojave Desert, Jack has another problem to worry about. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is the promising beginning of a hit series starring Jack Bauer. This is the first time I watch this show and I admit that I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story, with multiple characters and realistic. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect as a family man and trusted agent with three challenging missions at once: finding a killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in his agency; and find her teenage daughter who has problems trying to save her marriage. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
