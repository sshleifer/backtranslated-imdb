From time to time, a film arrives that raises the bar for all other films of the same genre. A film of this caliber will influence many films after its release in the years to come. "A story of Chinese ghosts" falls into this category. It's probably one of the best horror movies made in the 1980s; maybe one of the best movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers have designed a film that will appeal to all horror fans. The story is captivating and original. The bad guys are menacing and scary. The sets are scary and atmospheric. There is even a little blood and blood to satisfy the splash fan of the house. But do not let the "horror" label scare you if you're not a fan of the genre. This film easily enters into many categories. <br /> <br /> The screenwriter skillfully mixes dramatic, comic, horror, kung-fu and romance genres with a delicious luxury film pizza. `A Chinese Ghost Story 'is a beautiful epic love story told, thankfully, without the free nudity and / or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many' love stories' in Hollywood. Those who are put off by the romantic elements of history can sit back and enjoy the sword game and fast-paced "fil-fu". If that's not enough, actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma offer enough humorous situations to satiate your comedy appetite. This film offers something for all movie fans. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark have assembled a truly incredible cast for this film. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a talented actor, but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian. I can not think of an interpreter other than Cheung who could have better represented Ling Choi Sin (except perhaps Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is delighted by Lit Su Seen, the enslaved spirit that steals the heart of Cheung's character. His description of the main character is really haunting and memorable. Wu Ma is hilarious as a virile Daoist who helps young lovers. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, this film is very impressive, even with current standards. The direction is superb. I hope that today's Hollywood leaders are looking for talented artists, such as Siu-Tung Ching, rather than using the usual MTV video or Pepsi "directors". The cinematography is beautiful. You have to congratulate any director of photography who can make a film beautiful while most of his hinge scenes take place in the middle of the night. The composition of the special effects is excellent. In fact, most of the creature effects of this film sweep the ghosts and goblins of the computer-generated image that have become commonplace in modern horror movies. <br /> <br /> Since its release, "A Story of Chinese Ghosts" has spawned two sequels, a complete animated film and countless imitations. None of the films that followed or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic. This movie should be viewed by any horror movie fan or anyone looking for a great way to spend 95 minutes of your time. 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />
