Remember "The Invisible Man" by H.G. Wells? Well here's another movie like this, but more extreme. "Hollow Man" does not look like any story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius who is interested in the world of invisibility and makes it useful for military purposes. At first, making the serum was the easiest part, but getting the person back was not. Most early trials were unstable. Until the evening when he perfected the formula. And who else, except Caine, would be the lab rat. The gorilla was the first and almost died, so when he came, he was a loved one. So when Caine did it, he decided to use it for fun. Then, when he got tired of not being seen, the team did their best to bring him back into the world of flesh. However, the visibility formula is not working as it should, and Caine is going crazy. So he ends up being a crazy invisible killer. It would be better to go out of town rather than take the lives of people close to you. I do not care about those who hurt you. Great movie, a lot of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
