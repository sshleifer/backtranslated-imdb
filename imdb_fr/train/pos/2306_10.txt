Had never heard of the man on the moon before seeing him last night on THIS HDTV channel. Look, my taste is like that of others, eclectic. My favorites range from Blue Velvet to Dr. Strangelove, The Ghost and Muir, to The Wizard of Oz and his loved one, Eraserhead, The Repo Man and The Spy Within. <br /> <br /> The man on the moon is superbly done, a sweet, heart-wrenching, joyful and tragic movie, in which the actors really live in the moment rather than acting. This sweet story will soon be in our private library. This beautiful story of life at a much finer time in rural Louisiana literally transports you into its pastoral setting. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to remain stoic during the last moments of the film, especially when the girl's heart of my sister burns a personal pain and forgives everyone. <br /> <br /> Rather than spoil the joy or bother you with sobs with my prose without brilliance, you will end now with this suggestion of the one who loves films that speak from the heart to ours. <br /> <br /> If you do not buy any other movie, buy the Man on the Moon. This touching story is the one you will love to relive again and again. It is a joy and a jewel, a film too rare in this world of hearts that harden. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues that emerge from Man in the Moon are a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Key of Manasota, Florida <br /> <br /> April 05, 2009
