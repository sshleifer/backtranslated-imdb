A light and charming film, certainly, but superbly designed. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early presentation of her British accent and the cast gathered around her is at the heart of the dialogue. It came in the days of Sense and Sensitivity, and I'm sure I do not know why it caught the Oscars. Emma is the most accessible story and the least stifling of Jane Austen, she is well told.
