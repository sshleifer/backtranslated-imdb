Taken this movie at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect much (although the festival director told me it was one of the best films shown). Five minutes later, I was sold. Shot in B & W on a tight budget, this movie is hilarious. The actors play is solid, the writing is solid and the film aspect is solid. The acting game is probably the biggest revelation, as most movies shot for modest budgets tend to have amateur acting or drama. Not this one. It presents one of the most convincing, endearing and amusing representations of a character with Tourette Syndrome that I have ever seen. The plot is complicated without being confusing and raunchy without being free. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (hope I understand correctly) deserve the chance to present their films to a wider audience.
