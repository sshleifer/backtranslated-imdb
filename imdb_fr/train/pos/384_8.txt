The film version of Alice Walker's hugely moving and influential novel in 1983 (mostly letters from Celie to God) was a huge success at the Oscars, and rightly so. <br /> <br /> In the role of mistreated and Celia awake, Whoopi Goldberg gave him his best screen performance per kilometer. Not far behind was Oprah Winfrey in the role of Sofia, the burning woman tamed by fate. Other actors of the distribution have specified the characters that Walker had presented so clearly on the page: Danny Glover like Albert, the violent husband of Celie; Margaret Avery as Shug, a force for change for good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the preacher's wife; and the late Carl Anderson (better known as Judas in the movie of Jesus Christ Superstar in 1973) as a Samuel preacher. <br /> <br /> Beautifully punctuated and written with tact, "The Color Purple" does justice to its source while opening the story to involve the viewers of a feature film drama.
