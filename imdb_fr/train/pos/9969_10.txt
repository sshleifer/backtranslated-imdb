Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all the good movies. Great movies. But nothing, and I mean nothing lives the biggest Christmas film of all, Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The movie is so great and contains so many messages that I cried watching it. Seriously, this is one of those movies that you have to watch 10 times. When we see Pitch being told that he will have to eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes and we feel a deep sadness, then we wonder ... what's wrong with this ice cream? ? Does this mean that as humans, we treat ice cream as a good thing when it only makes us diabolical? Think that the movie makes you think. <br /> <br /> This film presents the best interpretation of Santa Claus of all time. Unlike other Santa Claus, he is a normal person. We see him imprisoning children and spying on his dreams, and we wonder; is Santa really good? In addition, this Santa Claus actually mentions Christ, the meaning of Christmas. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece. We should just stop making movies and not broadcast anything other than this epic 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets a 500/10. Whoever says that this film is bad is an ignorant fool.
