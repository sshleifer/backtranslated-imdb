I would say it's time, this movie was great ... and yes, if you do not want to become a Christian, why not look at it? I saw this film after being saved and I found it very moving. I see now that they brought these films to another level and they created the series Left Behind ... they compare closely and they are definitely more modern to touch people. I think that to judge this film well, you should see it, there are 3 or 4 in the series if I'm not mistaken ... do not use our comments to judge, see the movie by yourself- even! ! God will bless you if that is why you watch them.
