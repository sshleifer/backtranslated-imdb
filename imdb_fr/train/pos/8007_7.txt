This game is very addictive, I played it for hours until late at night, but also the fact that you can not save a game when you're in space contributed to that, sometimes I just had to play for do not lose all the data of the game. <br /> <br /> So, yes, "Freelancer" creates an addiction, but it is also quite imperfect. In addition, for example, something that bothered me a lot was that you could not ignore any of the cinematic scenes, you sometimes had to watch the same scene a few minutes over and over. It's a great opportunity for me to do multiple tasks at the same time, check my e-mail or chat with friends, among other things, while waiting for the scene to be over. <br /> <br /> The story begins. promising, but the more you get, the more ridiculous it all becomes. In addition, the game also ends quite abruptly, at least if he did it for me. It is obvious that they allude to a sequel. I do not know if a sequel is being prepared at the moment, but I'm sure I'll probably take one as soon as it's released. <br /> <br /> The gameplay is very simple! Even for those who are not familiar with flying games. To put it boldly, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are quite difficult and require a lot of effort. It took me about 1 to 2 weeks to complete this game, which may be a little too short. But thank you to God for the multi-player option! This allows you to continue playing short missions, as in the single-player game once you finish it. <br /> <br /> Even if the missions are identical, it's just cool to stay in the game in the middle of sometimes gigantic fights. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good but nothing revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> An addictive game, but beware of its flaws. <br /> <br /> 7/10
