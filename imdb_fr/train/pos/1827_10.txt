All dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw it for the first time when I was 3 years old. Now I'm 12 and I rented it, it makes me think of things and it reminds me so many memories, those were "the days". I love music, I love when Charlie arrives in paradise, I love the song "Let me be surprised". I love Charlie's look and his voice. Bert Reynolds could only play Charlie's voice as great. I love this film, the first is the best because it is original and great. It reminds me of memories that no one can describe, not even me. If only I could go back to those days. I like the characters If this is how the memories come back to me at the age of 12, imagine how I feel when I'm 19, I hope I can watch it when I grow up. When I saw this for the first time, I did not know that I was really going to look back and feel that, I hope he will be available to watch it. I am so happy that this film was shot and that this incredible idea comes to mind and heart. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it a perfect 10. It's an amazing movie. It's so hard to explain that feeling, when I'm grown up and if I have kids, I hope they can feel that way.
