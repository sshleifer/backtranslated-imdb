I saw this jewel of a movie in Cannes where he was one of the directors for a fortnight. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is simply superb. Very fun all along, with all the members of a strong cast acting their socks. It's a comedy out loud sometimes about a crook (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) who gets caught stealing a car and is sent to jail. In prison, he meets a "lifer" who tells him about "the ultimate bellini" ?? Which one for you and me? is a fast and safe diet. It turns out that there is a way out of an abandoned building until the city's jewelery store ?? which could net millions. Sounds simple? ?? introduce all sorts of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have the ingredients for a wild ride !! ?? the word goes from one loser to the next and soon, a team of them is reunited to try to make the most of Cosimos `bellini 'the failed boxer Pero (played superbly by Sam Rockwell, surely a star in the making ) and reluctant rogue Riley (William H. Macy) who is forced to take his baby with him while his wife was locked up for fraud !!. <br /> <br /> From the Italian film I Soliti Ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna Street) who also inspired a film similar to `Collinwood '?? `Palookaville '. This strikes points of this last effort and although his writing and directed by the Russo brothers he certainly has shades of the Coen brothers about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who plays a hilarious little role in the role of paralyzed vault breaker.
