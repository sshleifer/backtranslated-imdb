I loved this film. Not being a crazy fan of Ed Wood Jr., I prefer to appreciate his "boundless enthusiasm" and recognize his shortcomings. His films are fun, but his personal story is painful. I was hoping, and I was pleased to see, that this film would aim to understand his eventful life, rather than posthumously praising him. From beginning to end, this film evolved from documentary to mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly bound to each other and to Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> What we get are people who have known Ed Wood It is better to talk about him from all angles, positive and negative, and to show their character as much as Ed's. We discover Ed's personal and professional life: his novels, his drinking, his sexuality, his friends, his enemies and even his filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The film itself is shot inexpensively and seems to be made out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most of the films released in theaters from 1996 would be disrespectful (a little like wearing a suit more handsome than the chair). The scenographer uses his sense of humor and insight to match each cast member to his context. <br /> <br /> Fans will be delighted to hear personal stories about Ed Wood's controversy, and newcomers will do the same. astonished that this man was real. The DVD is filled with impossible-to-find jewels ("Crossroads of Lorado" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this film is its surprisingly appealing and interconnected story. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood used to define people by their association with him (for better or for worse), to the point where a woman will go down in history as a "pool owner" "for once by letting him and his friends be baptized in his swimming pool. This ability to define a person's heritage manifests itself universally, because the most amazing effect of the film is not only to give a complete idea of ​​the man who was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a global vision of the community to which he belongs. created. In one way or another, without ever having more than one cast member interviewed on the screen at a time, the link created by Ed Wood between the different people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer found with a great sense of commitment. <br /> Even the title alludes to the kind of horror B-list, but in the end, we see that even this is kindness. What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all actors will forever be woven into an incredibly coherent fabric that history will bring into a haunting unity with Wood's legend. <br /> In many ways, a contradictory life, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed from one point of view. This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing it that we can ever get. Being a juxtaposition of themes, he is at once respectful, provocative, thoughtful, captivating, amusing, sad, kind and fulfilling.
