"Mad Dog" Earle is back, accompanied by his sad bag, Moll Marie, and his wayward foot, Velma. The same goes for Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even Pard, the singer chewing the landscape. The only thing missing is a good reason to remake Raul Walsh's High Sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame, and with remarkable talent, at one or two echelons lower than those of the original. (Instead of Walsh, we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart, Jack Palance, for Ida Lupine Shelley Winters, and so on in credits.) The only change is that this time, instead of black and white, is in Warnercolor; unfortunately, there are those who would consider this an improvement. <br /> <br /> I'm dead a thousand times maybe useless ?? and lower ?? but at least it's not a parody; history always works on its own terms. Earle (Palance), fresh out of his pen near Chicago, heads west to carry out a big job orchestrated by the troubled king Lon Chaney, Jr. ?? overthrow a mountain resort post. On the way, he almost runs into a family of Oakies, when he is in love with their granddaughter; the strike even holds when he discovers that she is lame. Arriving in the huts where the rest of the band is found, he finds amateur heads against each other and Winters, who throws himself on him (like the doggie). Waiting until they receive a call from their man at the hotel, Palance (to Winter's sorrow) offers to pay for an operation to cure the deformity of the girl, a gesture that turns against her. Then the surgical strike against the station turns into a bloodbath. At the landing, Palance climbs higher into the cold sierras .... <br /> <br /> It's a pretty absorbing story, executed with skill, that does not have the distinctive character that Walsh and his casting in 1941, the year Bogie, with this role and that of Sam Spade in the Maltese falcon, became a star. And one last heretical note: these mountains are beautiful in color. <br /> <br />
