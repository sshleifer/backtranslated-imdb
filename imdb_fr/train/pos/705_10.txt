I came across An Insomniac's Nightmare looking for quirky independent movies, and glad to say that it did not disappoint me. This crazy half-hour drive made me think, and the end was great - one of those NOOOOO moments that really stays with you. I showed it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree. The ghost girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. She fucked me up, I can say as much. Nanavati did a great job in summarizing the problem. All the pieces have just been put in place and you can say that she is a great writer from what she did with this script. So well written. This is without a doubt the strongest part of the film. The staging was excellent and enjoyable, but the most important factor here is the strength of the script. Good job to this girl, I can not wait to see more!
