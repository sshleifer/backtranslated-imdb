That's what I'd written to friends earlier: <br /> <br /> HOLY CRAP, The Grudge is, honestly, one of the scariest movies I've ever seen! I became very soft in my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did a KICK A ** job! (I'm looking forward to Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared of sitting in the dark of the theater and would have liked anyone, anyone, to sit next to me from me (except the protagonist from Grudge, I saw the movie myself.) I swear, there were many many jump scenes that were not expected! I felt stupid but my nerves did not care! I was on the verge of the entire movie, the opening credits, and the music was incredibly scary. I can not stop thinking about this sound, though, and I do not like it! <br /> <br /> I actually gasped a few times and I cried, "oh" to a scene !! Oh, yes, I even half covered my eyes a few times! The word to the wise, though: I thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought that whoever wrote it was sick and psychopathic, but I do not remember the movie, so I can not compare. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I "enjoyed" this movie b / c I was terrified, but it was really very good and scary. The end scene, too ... whoa! To be a 32-year-old mother, I think I have nightmares of this movie, especially because of this sound. Please, come out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In short, it's not a film like the one I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is a phantasmagorical movie most of the time. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman and The Ring 2 are two great trailers of this movie !!
