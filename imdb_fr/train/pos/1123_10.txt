I really appreciated this one, and although the end made me angry, I give him another 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four students (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) In Florida, in their way, they meet 2 guys (Turner, Davis), they add nothing to the plot, but they are at least pretty friendly. The girls agree to meet the guys in Florida for fun, but they have car problems and never get away with it. One of the girls decides to ask for help at a nearby petrol station, the other three stay near the car. <br /> <br /> Soon, one of the girls must use the bathroom, lying in the middle of nowhere, she has no choice but to go to the bushes. Soon she sees a man (March) strangling a woman; terrified, the girl fled the region. She does not go very far but manages to get lost. <br /> <br /> Her friends at the edge of the car are looking for her, they too go in the woods and meet the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, answers the man pulling the girl to the head, the other girl runs away, manages to get to the car where she is also killed. <br /> <br /> Finally, the two remaining girls meet and get arrested because they have entered the service station. That's when I started to get angry, these poor girls are scared for their lives and the police in redneck do not believe them. <br /> <br /> They are abused and one of them is left alone so that the madman kills her in the cell, the last friend manages to escape, but not without putting himself in dangerous situations . <br /> <br /> This film has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene imitating Psycho, graphic violence against women and a solid story. Some women will probably find this shocking and sensitive people will not like the end, but above all, it's a great little unknown movie.
