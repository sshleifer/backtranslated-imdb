I look at Cold Case because of the experiences. He was very close to me and deeply touched me, so nicely treated, thank you Merideth. All characters are well developed in 3D especially Coop. The material is still difficult to approach, the United States is far behind the developed countries of the world. only this type of description and honest and real experimental treatment has an impact on the population. Of course, not everyone sees things the same way, but I am comforted by the fact that 3/4 of the men surveyed in the under-30 crowd voted in the same way as me. Place for this episode, please continue to take risks and accept my deepest gratitude.
