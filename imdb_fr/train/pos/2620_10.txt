What a pleasant surprise: a Disney suite DTV (Direct to Video) actually GOOD. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy affair that involves the favorite meerkats and warthogs of all, Timon and Pumbaa. He begins by watching the original film and commenting, until Timon complains that "we are not here yet". After fighting over the remote control, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the audience "their story". They start the new movie and the laughter begins. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I lost hope in Disney. Most of their live video shooting rates have been horribly horrible, with stories desperate to take advantage of the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: it tells the original story of a new point of view. Okay, that adds elements, like the origin of Timon and the way he and Pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly find the bond and friendship that made us love the first film. There are also some beautiful movie parodies (including a scene that simultaneously broadcasts "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "Cool Hand Luke"), and the screenplay is filled with fun memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Added Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons"), the mom who is afraid of war, Timon, and Jerry Stiller, Uncle Max, a little crazy, Timon. Matthew Broderick introduces himself as Simba and his "teenage" scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone is doing well, especially Robert Guillame (that's how you spell it?) As Rafiki, who exudes more and more Yoda in the film (Timon speaks about it several times). <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is an ideal alternative choice for those who are tired of the animation Shrekification. 10/10
