What can I say that was not said about "The Haunting"? He has everything that would make a beautiful picture. Beautiful scenery, music in a bad mood and unimaginable sound design were at the rendezvous. However, the script sometimes stifles the mind in such a strange and surreal way. The whole team must have forgotten to read it, perhaps because they were too busy creating center of gravity effects and creating gothic ensembles to see the conspiracy. Each cast member gives a dignified performance, but with little conviction for the material available. Lili Taylor has the most to do while the others react mainly to her. But that's about all. All I can say is that it's a nice two hours, but you'll definitely want more. Much more.
