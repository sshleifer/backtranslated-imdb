The only reason I saw this movie was Jimmy Fallon, who has had a crush on me since Grade 9, which was his first year at SNL. I am a hardcore fan of the Yankees and have only found the painful film in the last 15 minutes, when they started broadcasting footage of ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small noises not to hear what should not be heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable. <br /> <br /> I thought Jimmy played the role very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and offbeat, and he's a nervous and offbeat guy. I know it may not be an Oscar-winning film, but the film is just a romantic, fun and light comedy that men and women can see. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry on the camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in this silly movie?) What I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him, and thank goodness, because Taxi could have killed him. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone must stop criticizing his acting talent because he is just starting to make movies. I guess it must be difficult, and if you look at one of the other great players of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you will see that they started in chess. Busom buddies? Australian soap operas? We wish Jimmy a successful career on screen. I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do?
