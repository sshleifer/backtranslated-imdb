I got a free pass for a preview of this movie last night and I did not know what to expect. The premise seemed stupid and I thought it would be a lot of superficial humor to make fun of the virgin. What a good surprise. I laughed so much that I cried some of the jokes. This film is a must for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. OK ..... it's not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or little kids. The language is dirty, the jokes are (very) coarse and the discussions about sex are as graphic as you will find nowhere. What is amazing, though, is that the film is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I loved it. Steve Carell is great, but (just like The Office), the basic cast really makes the movie work. All the characters have their faults, but they also have depth and sympathy. Everyone gets their weight and the chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to get the DVD. I'm sure it will be up there with Office Space for reminders and lines that can be quoted.
