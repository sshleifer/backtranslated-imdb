It's not always easy to explain what a movie looks like, but this time, I think I found it. It reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (petty criminals condemning drugs and doing stupid things in Schotland) and The Blair Witch Project (because of the style of filming). <br /> <br /> This is the loyalty between two friends, one of them comes out of prison, the other has not yet been arrested. With a stolen vehicle, they cross the Scottish countryside but run out of gas. In search of fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks they want to steal it and point a gun at one of them. So everything is bad. One of the friends accidentally pulls on the farmer's daughter and has to flee. The following is a man hunting through the fields and woods of Schotland. The two friends must literally run for their lives. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this film was shot in just 12 days. Okay, it's not quite amazing, because most of it is still in the same place: the Scottish campaign, but I still find it pretty incredible. Especially because it's not really a bad movie. It may not be the best movie of all time, but they can still be proud of what they have accomplished. I had a good time watching it and overall I enjoyed the movie. I give him a 7/10.
