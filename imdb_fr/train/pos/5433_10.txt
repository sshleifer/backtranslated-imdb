This film is one of my favorites of all time. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what a cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy are both together. The final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the end always leaves me in tears. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it.
