I'm looking for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 years old when I think it was broadcast on television in 1983. All I can remember is that it was a teenage girl, alone, who survived a plane crash AND having survived the Amazon. I remember people were looking for her (her family) and she knew how to take care of herself. She tells the story and I remember her very well knowing that insects were under her skin. I do not remember much else about this movie and I want to see it again - if it's the same - and if any of you have a copy, could you send me an email at address: horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I would be curious to get a copy to see if it's the same movie that I remember. It was broadcast in Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983, and I was experiencing problems myself, and this movie had a huge impact on me. Thank you in advance!
