The ship may have sunk but the film did not !!! Director James Cameron of "The Terminator" did it again with this amazing photo. One of my favorite scenes is the "Dinner Dinner" scene, in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he has saved her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet "THE ONE" ... I hope I'll see it when I'm in the room with my future husband. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose have a link called 'MOVIE STUFF' but it's a good movie. We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck with associates who live off the wealth of their husbands. Rose commits suicide almost but the star of Gilbert Grape saves her. I really liked the hanging above the boat stage. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The film is long but it's fantastic !!! Good story, smooth running, good actors !!! Go see it twice if you want, it's worth it !!!
