As a lover of the surreal (in art and cinema), I had the pleasure of discovering this film on IFC. He is definitely a guardian. Most other reviews say the general plot (not quite right), so I will not be bored of bothering anyone with that. The bottom line is the concept of alternative worlds that comes from Ana's impending illness and how she manages to connect with someone else after being so "alone", and finally with her family, who always seems to me at least a little troubled. This movie can only be called a horror movie in the sense that it has frightening scenes, but it is a fantasy (with a hint of "transition to adulthood" only because that Ana is a pre-teen who "hates boys"). I highly recommend it to those who appreciate the stretching of their imagination.
