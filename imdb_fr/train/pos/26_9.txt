When I was a child, I watched this many times and I remember hissing the song "Happy Cat" quite often. All the songs are great and memorable, unlike many children's musicals, where the songs are stuck for no real reason. The scenes and costumes are sumptuous and the acting is very well done, which is not surprising given the cast. Christopher Walken looks a lot like a cat and does not need a stupid makeup or a cat suit for the viewer to believe he is a cat turned into a human. And Jason Connery is so cute, as the son of Corin, the shy and clumsy son of the miller, who falls in love with the beautiful and bold Princess Vera. It's a very fun and enjoyable movie where, unlike most fairy tales, characters have personalities. Some of my favorite parts are when Puss makes Corin believe that he is drowning; at the ball when everyone starts to dance a country dance, as it is "all the rage abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, he dances on the table (he's also a very good dancer!); and when Vera told Corin all the things she did when she was young, like pretending she was the daughter of a miller. I would recommend this film to children and parents who love magic and fairy tales. And it's actually a film that you can watch together, because it will not drive adults to the wall.
