Despite what others had said (* cough *), it's my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I waited to see him, but once finished, I immediately fell in love with me. Of course, it's strange, but it just gives a more exciting flavor. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first films of Gackt and Hyde. They did not do much, maybe 3 or 4 times. So give them a little credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best at first either. I think they're throwing strange situations in there, but I'm looking at that to find the best points in this movie, the emotions that are displayed and all the rest. Therefore, I gave and I will always give this film a 10 out of 10.
