I first read Pearl S Buck's wonderful novel in my ninth grade class and enjoyed every page of it. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would seize it, and considering its manufacture in 1937, the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Some things must be accepted: in 1937, there was no question of merging Asian roles. actors in a big Hollywood movie. This makes the final product a bit more interesting than if they had been able to use a more authentic distribution. <br /> <br /> Faced with this obstacle, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) took the trouble to hand-pick a beautiful and stellar cast. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was at the peak of his powers as an actor during this period and could play just about anything he thought. Once you've done makeup (that's fine, but no one will really confuse him with a Chinese), his performance has all the credibility of his best work. <br /> <br /> Then there is Luise Rainer. After winning an Oscar the year before for her performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the Viennese actress' star was on the rise and she was entrusted with Olan's plum role despite her lack of experience in Hollywood. His performance earned him a second consecutive Oscar, the first time in his history. <br /> <br /> Many critics have been made about Rainer's performance and his Oscar win here. It was called wooden and a note. There is a little grain of truth in this. HOWEVER, having said that, all you have to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, though not Chinese, played O-lan pretty much as Buck had written to him; It's actually a beautiful performance and one of the best screen book transfers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, it was MGM. At the time, they had the largest selection of actors and characters in Hollywood, as well as a big budget to pay the best and they finally got the best. <br /> <br /> The film softens Wang Lung's wedding to O-lan a bit. In the novel, with wealth come the lusts of the flesh and he takes a concubine, a gesture that devastates his wife but his feelings as a woman do not concern him. In the film, Wang Lung, contrite, returns to his wife the two pearls he had stolen from her years ago, when she realized too late that she was his true love. <br /> <br /> Corny, yes. But it's Hollywood. Given the obstacles they faced, the film could have opened to laughter. But despite the apparent shortage of real Asians in the cast, this film has been surprisingly good with the passage of seventy-three years. In fact, what is most amazing in this film is its quality, whereas it could have been a disaster as easily.
