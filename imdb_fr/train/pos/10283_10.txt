House of Games is a wonderful multi-level movie. It's a beautiful mystery and a shocking thriller. He is blessed with the wonderful performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, as well as a solid selection of support players, and introduces Ricky Jay, an extraordinary card player, conjurer and magician. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken as in a game of manners and gives the film (in which reality is often involved) an additional dimension of unreality. <br /> <br /> At first glance, House of Games is a convincing glimpse of the unknown world of cheaters and crooks, diametrically different from The Sting, which was played only for glamor and yuks. At this level, he succeeds admirably. <br /> <br /> However, you can not escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman who moves from a complacent professional competence to an incredible strength and self-realization . The only film I know that deals with the issue of the emergence of personal strength in a woman so worthy of interest is the underrated soldier Benjamin. This quite enjoyable film unfortunately spreads its purpose, jumping between several themes and exploiting the beautiful performance of Goldie Hawn to chase some easy laughs. House of Games stays true to its business. As Poe has already said about the good news, she is constantly leading the way. <br /> <br /> There is another line of films about women, summed up by Thelma and Louise, a big low-budget money producer with a despicable theme that women are doomed to, whether or not they realize internal forces. What tripe. <br /> <br /> As usual, you should really see this movie in a movie theater. This should be natural for film festivals. Offer it to one of your loved ones if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter. Better to see it on TV than not at all.
