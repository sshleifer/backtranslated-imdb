Although I agree that it is a good film, but not excellent, I still appreciate it for many reasons mentioned by other posters. One of the reasons is music: I would like to draw attention to the very cool appearance of the Candoli brothers - Conte and Pete - in a well-staged scene in the nightclub. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their time and managed to confuse the spirit of Jimmy Stewart by playing a hysterical trumpet duet, a trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. The Candolis have played really well too, although I suspect that the music of this scene has been doubled thereafter. I do not know much about George Duning, who gets the credit for music (other than that, he seems to have worked more than once with the Three Stooges), but the casting of the Candoli brothers as warlocks playing the game. jazz was a very good contact.
