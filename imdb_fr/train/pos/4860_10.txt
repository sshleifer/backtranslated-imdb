A damsel in distress is a delight because of the superb songs of Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a formidable support cast led by Gracie Allen and George Burns. as an American dance star in England with Burns as a publicist and Allen as his secretary. They concoct a story that he is an insect in love with women who would be victims left and right. He meets Fontaine who is held in captivity in his castle by a domineering aunt and a docile father. A stupid plot. <br /> <br /> The big songs include A day of fog, Things are better, A beautiful job if you can get it, and I can not be bothered now. Fontaine does not sing but does a short (and decent) number with Astaire. Burns and Allen are surprisingly good in a few dance numbers, including an inventive and fun adventure through an amusement park. <br /> <br /> Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Love Montagu, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite - Jan Duggan as a madrigal singer. <br /> <br /> Jan Duggan is in the middle of the trio of swoony singing a beautiful book if you can get it. His facial expressions are hilarious. She was also a thief in the United States. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, playing Cleopatra Pepperday. <br /> <br /> There has been a lot of abuse on this film because of the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, would have been hideous. The TCM facilitator notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews have been taken into account. Yuck. Two other potential catastrophes. Fountain is fine as Alyce and the dynamics allows musical numbers to belong to Astaire, with a broad comic relief of Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Fun movie, great songs, good distribution, and Jan Duggan in a rare light. !
