This movie is simply amazing! I was expecting something very different from the movie I saw. However, he is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its connection to animal behavior. Let me caution readers of this article who are easily offended by too much sexual content, because the explicit sexual nature of this film is like a kind of pornography with the head held high. He even presents a scene that is very similar to rape. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I strongly suggest to see this rare work of "sexual art". Moreover, every minute of the photo breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies. Do not forget that times have changed! <br /> <br /> Go see it! It's worth your time and money!
