Artistically speaking, it's a beautiful film - cinematography, music and costumes are beautiful. In fact, this movie is prettier than those made by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the film as it was shot several years after his death. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was well written and the story was sometimes well written. interesting. However, the story was also rather depressing, but with little involvement - after all, it's the story of a group of women working in a brothel. It is interesting to note that although prostitution is considered a much more acceptable activity in Japan, women ALWAYS aspire to a better life. It reminds me a lot of Streets Of Shame, although the characters in Streets Of Shame are much less friendly and more one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> So, overall, he gets a 7 - mainly because of everything, BUT writing. It's a pity that the weakest connection of this film is the story of the great Kurasawa.
