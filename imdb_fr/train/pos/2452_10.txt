It's a good show and I find it funny. Finally, the bad types of Latin stereo are over! ¡Gracias, Señor Lopez! I love this show and I just watched it about three months ago. The whole concept of a Latin family TV show really amazed me. I'm surprised that Latinos finally have a good chance of being on TV. This show is probably one of the best I've seen, it's funny, comforting, sensitive and enjoyable.
