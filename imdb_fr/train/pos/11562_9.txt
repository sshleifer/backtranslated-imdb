I just can not understand how brilliant Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon's couple are. It's as if the film did not even need additional characters because we never got tired of the dialogue between these two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon had already participated in several well-known films like Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau had just won an Oscar for The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder film also with Lemmon). This particular movie was not as good as this one because the story could not last that long (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this lasts about an hour and a half, even if the introduction of the events that led Lemmon to end up in Matthau is a bit long (just like this sentence). This is a small complaint though and for the rest of the time you are having a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> I already wrote a comment on the sucking of the follow-up of this film and I will not go further. in that. The reason for this joy is probably that the film was shot just as the innocence of American films began to fade into oblivion. There are some sexual references but they are treated so innocently that you can not even get a "Well, I never ..." from the most prude person. It's pretty fun to watch a film from a long time lost and that's probably why the sequel did not work because Matthau and Lemmon said a few words in f and that just did not suit them. <BR /> <br /> Of course, they are both gone now and you can just be happy to enjoy them in a wonderful movie like this one. I think the only male actor in this movie still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman is deceased recently. So there you have it. Simply one of the best comedies and movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Add: I just learned that John Fiedler is dead, and I am deeply sorry for all his fans. I did not want to be disrespectful and I will try to be more careful about what I blah blah blahi next time.
