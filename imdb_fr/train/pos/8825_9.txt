This 2004 Oscar nomination is a very short black and white film in Spanish. A young woman goes to a coffee shop, has a coffee and notices two musicians standing silently with their instruments. All the customers are still, like models. A guy, however, is quite cheerful and starts singing what's happening at 7:35 in the morning. There is a surprising moment after another until the end, which is very surprising. People, the place, everything looks pretty ordinary. And as the musical piece "Bolero", the thing continues to build until the climax. With its structure, theme, movement and spirit, it's an 8-minute masterpiece.
