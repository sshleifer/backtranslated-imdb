If you like the plot, here is your movie. It is impossible at any time to predict what will happen next. Nothing is as it appears or ends as you think. The characters are all gritty and endearing. Cage is at its best. Dennis Hopper again shows his deliciously sinister side. JT Walsh is perfect in his last performance. Laura Boyle sizzles. Dwight Yoakum makes a film debut superbly in a cameo. I classify this film in the category "I'm having a really, really, really bad day". Not a slow minute in this movie. A real sleeper. This film is underrated and, unfortunately, neglected.
