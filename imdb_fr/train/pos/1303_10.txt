Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker come together to play all their songs from 35 years ago, when they formed a trio called "Cream". It was the psychedelic period of England and America and these guys looked like skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played rock and blues and it was mostly good stuff. <br /> <br /> Well, these guys are now over 60 and can still sing and play at a high level. as we see this wonderful DVD concert record. Of course, I always knew Clapton very well, who had never been out of the way, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, whom I had not seen for decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so thin that he looked like a maniac of near-death speed. Now he looks healthy, fit and his drumming is solid. Bruce looked a little haggard but his voice is excellent, as good as ever and it's a pleasure to hear those old songs. It's just great material and performance from guys who know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Some people have criticized this show for its discretion. I do not agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song, "Spoonful", was remarkable, which was the highlight of the concert for me. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
