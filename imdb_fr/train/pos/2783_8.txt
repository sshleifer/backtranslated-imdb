This is not one of your most impactful stories, and it's a real strength of this movie. There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added too predictable romantic tension. Not only do they save the public, but they also create surprises at the same time. There are Disney-ish moments, especially towards the end, but they are manageable. Overall, it was worth the rental and it was good, fun and relaxed. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you have the DVD, look at the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi. We followed his instructions and it was great! Next time we will prepare it the day before our meal, because it is a dish that definitely improves with a full night in the refrigerator to let the spices out!
