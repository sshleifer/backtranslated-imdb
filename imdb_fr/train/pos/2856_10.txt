It's one of the movies that gets better every time you see them. It is full of so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail. As in the following Sabu movies (I have not seen "Unfortunate Monkey" yet, but the others are so great), failure, chance and humanism play an important role. The editing and editing are inventive and artistic, without the film being an "art" image, but very entertaining. When you compare it to "Run, Lola, Run", do not forget that "Dangan Ranna" was filmed a few years ago and that it was broadcast on German television as early as 1997 ... The film of Tom Tykwer , and not the reverse. Complementary to other reviews, I must add that I really like the acting and the end. This movie is very entertaining in many ways and manages to convey a message without being boring or pretentious.
