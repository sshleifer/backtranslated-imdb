This movie is very entertaining and never boring, even at almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are excellent in the film and are very believable. The violence was a bit extreme in the film but then it showed how vicious the drug traffic was at the time of the film. The end is amazing and is probably one of the coolest scenes of all time. Great movie and you will probably really appreciate it.
