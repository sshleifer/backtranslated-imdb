It was happening in our theater in Amsterdam and the film we wanted to see was complete, so we went there, knowing nothing about it except for a documentary on the planet. We were very happy with our misfortune because it was a very powerful film about life and the fragile balance we all share with the rest of the people of the Earth. This film contains some of the most breathtaking photographs I've ever seen in a film and took me places from deserts to oceans to tropical forests and posted things I've never seen in a movie, a television or a book! "Earth" is a film that every student should see before becoming jaded. I will encourage my niece to see this movie since it will inherit the planet as we leave it. It's also a movie to be seen on a theater screen or on a very large television because photography is so powerful and exotic.
