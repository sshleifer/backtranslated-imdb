"The Intruder (The Intruder)" is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life. <br /> <br /> Grizzled Michel Subor plays "Louis Trebor" like Jason Bourne, an old man with a hidden past, living simply in a hut isolated in the woods for precisely paranoid reasons (but attracting pretty young women useful for him). We learn more about him through dreams, flashbacks and a trip that can take place chronologically or not, as well as his abrupt interactions with family, lovers, associates and a striking nemesis . Like "The Limey", the film resonates with parent / child regrets and a suspicious past revealed through excerpts from an old film with the same actor as a young man (here Paul GÃ©gauff's adventure film "Le Reflux "from 1965). <br /> <br /> In a total contrast between the moods, we meet his son Sidney (Gregory Colin), who must be the sexiest husband in the world, because he performs softly and seduction household repairs and takes care of a baby, a toddler and all the children. need his wife who works. Certainly, the director and co-writer Claire Denis must have created it as a feminine fantasy if there is one and a lesson to give to other directors on the shooting of the preliminaries. There is another prolonged scene where he looks for his father in the woods while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a pocket. He is all that his father is not and has all the relationships that his father is unable to maintain; no wonder he thinks his father is "crazy". I spent the rest of the film worrying that something bad would happen to him, the nature of the heart of his alienated father playing slowly before our eyes. <br /> <br /> This film is a puzzle, but Subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we see him crossing countries and negotiating damaging deals, and the narrative of the voice-over of Denis' "Beau Travail" was anyway annoying. We need to understand from skylines and accidental signs that he is going to Geneva, Korea and the South Pacific. Time passing is indicated by the change of season, the creation of scars and healing. There are many images of water to clean up and to distance. <br /> <br /> Continuing his fascination with the transformation of colonialism into globalization, while playing a bit on the stereotypes of the mysterious East and Russian criminals, Denis incorporated elements of Robert Louis Stevenson, Paul Gauguin and Marlon Brando in Tahiti Idylls and a 40-page dissertation by French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, the latter for the title and intrigue of heart transplantation used for an ironic theme of limited immortality that has consequences. <br /> <br /> While "Louis" thinks he's managed to be above borders, rules and morals, there's some fun in the last act because locals do not know too much to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey, even if he is isolated again. <br /> <br /> Many people in the audience left feeling frustrated by the elliptical storytelling method, but surprisingly beautiful. The unconventional narrative raises a lot of plot questions about the details.
