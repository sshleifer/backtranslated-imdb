Absolutely brilliant. Powerful and evocative. The most compelling documentary series ever made about war. His tone contrasts with the often overwhelming media stance of the Second World War. Rather than shouting about the horror of the war, it allows Sir Laurence Olivier's quiet voice to take a back seat to the real images of the war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrorized citizens and soldiers, broken men, politicians indifferent, mistakes costing thousands of dollars of lives, the suffering of the innocent. Above all, it really reminds us of what humanity is capable of when all the normal rules of "civility" are removed. In a real state of nature, man has something distinctly Hobbesian: he will return to a stupid form capable of crimes that will shock and fascinate still 60 years later. Perhaps there could be a follow-up series entitled "The Century at War" for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors. I think it's ironic that it took an event that killed 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series like this.
