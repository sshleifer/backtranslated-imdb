It's easy to forget, once the later series further developed the arc of extraterrestrial conspiracy, that formerly, The X-Files had written episodes such as "GenderBender" and "Fearful Symmetry", where aliens were not all little gray men or "mind control", but might surprise you. <br /> <br /> "Shrinking symmetry" begins with an "invisible elephant" - actually an elephant dislocated in space and time, less than one kilometer from "The Walk" "- and ends by the removal of a pregnant gorilla, and it's really an episode of marvelous moments.The sub-plot is boringly valid - yes, we have it, zoos are bad unless they are not - but the ideas it contains are fascinating, visually powerful and very memorable, and they cover a largely neglected angle on kidnappings - why would * humans * be the only things that interest aliens? <br /> <br /> In the end, it was not an instant classic, but it was nice to watch while it lasted, again, very memorable, and mainly, it's something you can not imagine doing a lot of other shows.
