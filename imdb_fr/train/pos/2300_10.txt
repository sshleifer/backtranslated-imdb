This film has so many wonderful elements! The first performance of Reese Witherspoon is, of course, wonderful, but his chemistry is also Jason London. The score is remarkable, light and pure. James Newton Howard improves the quality of any film for which he composes ten times more. He also seems to have the crush on lost youth movies. Do not miss his score for the recent "Peter Pan" and the haunting Gothic music of "The Village". I saw this film for the first time around 13 or 14 years old and now I'm not only crying in the end, I shed a tear or two for nostalgia. Show this movie to your girls. It will eventually become a lifetime comfort movie.
