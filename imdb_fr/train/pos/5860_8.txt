A nice game, which offers a fun and easy game and a fair rehearsal ability. Staying true to the comics and providing a low learning curve gives this game something that is not seen in most action cartridges today. In addition, the narration and the animated scenes used (although the long animations are replaced by slideshows on the Nintendo 64 version) take full advantage of the capabilities of the platforms.
