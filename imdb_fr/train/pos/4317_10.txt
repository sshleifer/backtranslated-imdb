I really liked this film when it was released, and I still am, because the script gives hope to life in general and to people too ... one of the things I like about films by Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the positive vibes of the film, there are other reasons to love the Grand Canyon. On the one hand, his casting is exceptional: Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Best Film Oscar, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you positive. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark I would choose Grand Canyon rather than Crash every day.
