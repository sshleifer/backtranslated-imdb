I thought Mukhsin had been wonderfully written. It's not just about entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages that I think Yasmin was trying to convey. And yes, it might confuse some of you (especially if you have not watched Sepet and / or Gubra more than 76 times). <br /> <br /> I bet you noticed how they use the characters of the two movies right front? It's really ironic how the characters tell each other. As the authoritarian neighbor is this prostitute of Gubra. And the billiard girl turns out to be the religious and the woman of the pious man in the future. <br /> <br /> And I love voiceovers. It's brutal but awake freshness. For example, when they took a picture of Rumah Tumpangan Gamin, Mukhsin's voice suddenly spoke: 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim ..' (the scene where he climbed the tree). lightly, sneering how pathetic he is) described in the character. For example, even children can be really sharp (with the sharp and annoying voice) and simply bad speech throughout the film. And how can you be so busy and talk about people when your own life is not settled. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this film totally met my expectations, if not exceeded. <br /> <br /> He stuck me on the screen, I could not even take my eyes off her. Not even going out to the movies. Ha ha
