When I heard about the death of Sir Alec Guinness, it was the first of many films I thought I would see again. What a wonderful fun commentary provided by the movie even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave charm in every setting. His eyes and face are as bright as the white suit he wears. He and the film must be considered as the favorites of life.
