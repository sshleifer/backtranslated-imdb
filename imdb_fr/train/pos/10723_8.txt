I read some of the comments from other users and decided to add one too. Some users are stuck in a "realistic" mentality. This movie was supposed to be a "fantasy" ... a fun movie "and so". It was never meant to be "real" or serious. It was very nice for everyone I knew at the time of publication - even if it reflected the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 at the time and I really enjoyed the - my young son loved it too! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she loved it too. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that deserves to be appreciated just for that - fun. All "realists" of the world should lighten or watch documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. I'm really sorry for those young people who watched this film first and then got to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB in California) - they had to pick up the same kind of environment that the one described in the film and then felt "disappointment" ... I guess their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Never mind. If you like fantastic movies and you have not seen this one, I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
