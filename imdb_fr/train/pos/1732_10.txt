"Sandra, the factory of a woman" is a remarkable example among the exploitation films. It does so for two reasons: (1) an excellent performance by Monica Gayle, effortlessly, and (2) the fact that Gary Burn was at the helm of the project. These two talents, both underestimated, make "Sandra" a film that must be seen. <br /> <br /> Another key element of the film's success is its realism - there is nothing wrong or "Hollywood" about this film in California. It's really a slice of life. The modest house Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses worn by the character, the scene in which Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart jumping in front of her door, and Sandra is sitting on the couch without pretending. While Digart is trying to sell her beauty products, as if she had just woken up (but still beautiful), weird weird Sandra reveals that she loves to make love to her while wearing a bra, Sandra moves - all these elements of the film seem totally real and, as such, the viewer is trained from the beginning in the small world of Sandra and immediately interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also promotes her right to free love with eloquence and dignity. She goes out with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> This film would have easily failed in less competent hands and could have gone to any country. The usual directions of sexual exploitation, but the Garver / Gale team makes sure that "Sandra" is not only the shooting of a woman, but also that of an excellent film.
