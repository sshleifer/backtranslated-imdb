Mysterious murders in a European village seem to result from the horde of THE VAMPIRE BAT that afflicts the terrified community. <br /> <br /> This surprisingly powerful little thriller was created by Majestic Pictures, one of Hollywood's Poverty Row studios. Sparse production values ​​and rough editing add to its strange atmosphere and give it an almost expressionist quality. Overall, it leaves the viewer feeling caught in a bad dream, which suits a thriller of this type. <br /> <br /> Even if the final explanation of these heinous crimes is quite ridiculous and given the good development of the plot, the film can boast of having a good cast. Serious Lionel Atwill gives another of his typical performances, this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle. The beautiful Fay Wray plays her assistant in a role that forces her to do little more than be delightful and alarmed. Dour Melvyn Douglas appears as the perplexed police inspector who happens to be also, conveniently, Miss Wray's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Maude Eburne, who could be extremely funny if the situation requires it, steals most of her scenes like that of Miss Wray hypochondriac aunt. Lionel Belmore, a senior, plays the role of the terrified burger-restaurant of the village. And the little Dwight Frye, who will always be remembered for his strange roles in the films FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula, is here the most effective as a batsman.
