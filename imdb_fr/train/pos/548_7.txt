This film was as good as some of the other Westerns directed by Anthony Mann and James Stewart like Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This film begins as a western race but becomes more and more complex as you go. It starts with the arrival of Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan in Seattle, and Stewart is charged with murder. He is found innocent but his cattle are stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart then agrees to lead something but I forget what it is, but Stewart only cares to get his cattle back. As the movie progresses, Stewart cares only about himself, just like his character in Naked Spur. It's a lot better halfway after they arrive in Alaska. It's one of Stewart's best westerns.
