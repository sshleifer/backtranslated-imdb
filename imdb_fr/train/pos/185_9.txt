I finally bought and added to my collection a copy of "Show People". I can not comment more than what previous viewers have stated and the characters, the plot and the overall quality of this movie without repeating their own words. Seeing the cameo, the out-of-character appearances of so many silent stars M-G-M is worth seeing in itself. I really like the scene where Marion Davies plays herself and where she is met by the main character of the film, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read her lips because there's no title card saying what she says when she sees Marion Davies but it's something that has the effect of "I do not think I'm love!" Pop the corn, insert the cassette and get ready to go back over three quarters of a century in the history of cinema. Enjoy!
