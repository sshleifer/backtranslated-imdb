I did not know at all about this movie or even I did not know it existed until about a month ago, when I stumbled upon me while I was looking for other movies starring Dominic Monaghan. I thought this film was a strange glimpse of a non-sleeper's mind and how he felt during the hours he was awake while the rest of the world around him was sleeping. It was an interesting movie The good part was played by Dom ....... I think even if this film can not be bought anywhere (well, I've never seen it anywhere), you have to see if you have the opportunity, because it will make you really happy Think of people around us who can not sleep and have to suffer night after night or not be able to sleep or only sleep about an hour per night, so in the together, it was an interesting film of good quality.
