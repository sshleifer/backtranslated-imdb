I found that "Still Crazy" was wonderfully entertaining, and not just for those of us who went through that harsh era of the late '60s and early' 70s. My 15-year-old daughter looks at her with me every time I take out the DVD (do not worry, it's only been three times) and she likes it too. <br /> <br /> It's really a love, a hilarious at the time, each actor plays his notes to perfection. It was the first time I talked about Bill Nighy and I'm glad his "Love Actually" twist was more like it. Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the stereotype of the rocker damaged by drugs. It was interesting to see that Robinson made a name for himself as a writer. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie, I came across Billy Connolly at the local mall (he was living here at the time ) and told him it was one of my five favorite movies of all time. He invited me to sit at the food court with him and we talked about the movie for a while. We even talked about the idea of ​​an American-style remake before wisely rejecting that. Why play with the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it has not been very popular in theaters and that too many people have missed a wonderful experience.
