Since last September, I borrow four to six films each week from the Harold Washington Library, which has an impressive collection of DVDs. (The HWL is really a library in circulation: three quarters of his films have come out at some point!) Recently, I was delighted to find David Lynch's The Short Films. Yesterday, knowing very little about the animated series, I took over Dumbland. I'm here to point out that, for David Lynch fans, watching the eight episodes is a good half hour. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable feature of these short pieces is their soundtrack. Each episode has its own rhythm. The respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. The scandalous voices accentuate the breaks. Physical violence provides the beats. Twisting birds and buzzing orbits brush the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. The rhythm of the coarse animation often stays synchronized with the sound, but the soundtrack itself seemed to me to be Lynch's main interest in the creation and diffusion of this work. In a sense, these eight short films are unique lynchian rhythms. <br /> <br /> That said, the situations are strange, ugly, deep, silly and fun. And there is enough space in them to think about the absurdity that we humans can be. I can not say I'll look at the collection again, but for all those who marvel at the Inland Empire movement, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.
