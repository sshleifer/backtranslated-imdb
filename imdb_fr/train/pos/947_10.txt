and perhaps closer to the story of Dickens. Although I find the young Ebenezer hard to look at (who had the idea of ​​vintage hair, they would surely have done better than that!), But Scott does an amazing job as a Scrooge. The delivery of some of Dickens' lines finally made it alive for me. Edward Woodward is all we expect and more from the Ghost of Christmas gift. I find G.C. Scott's Scrooge is much more of a credible miser than the more recent version of Patrick Stewart. The Christmas morning scene, when Scrooge realizes he has not "missed" it, is enough to convince Scott to know how to act against suraction. He is phenomenal here. Almost all the casting is amazing. The Tiny Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a bit hard to watch, almost too cute. Nevertheless, music and landscapes make it a place not to be missed during all holidays. Enjoy!
