It's a well-known fact that when Gene Roddenberry launched Star Trek for the first time on NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was dismissed for being "too cerebral". When the series had another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to define the events of the episode rejected in canon. He did it by writing The Menagerie, which has the unique peculiarity of being a continuation of what was still, at the time. , an unpublished episode. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew are on Starbase 11, visiting former Enterprise Commander Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney), now horribly disfigured and paralyzed due to an accident. Pike joins his successor on the ship, where an unpleasant surprise awaits you: Spock, who served under Pike, actually hijacked the ship and set course for Talos IV, a forbidden planet (punishment is death) since the last visit of Pike and Spock at this location, 13 years ago. Naturally, being a logical creature, Spock presents himself and organizes a court martial in order to justify his actions. <br /> <br /> Needless to say more about the plot, because the rest will be played in Part 2.

In particular, it's fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who could not return to the Menagerie) interprets Pike as a more serious captain than Kirk and Nimoy's debut as Spock, whose personality has not It's the only time in the series that Vulcan has smiled spontaneously. <br /> <br /> In short, this is not just a big "mystery" episode, but also a treat for those who do not mind to find The Cage. in its original form (available in the box of season 3).
