Yes, it's a small budget. Yes, it's one of Candy's first films, but maybe it's the funniest! John Candy was not so far from his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and it shows. If you do not crack when Candy tries to help a guy do his shopping while being handcuffed to a escaped cohort, she is sleeping with his girlfriend with only the door of the apartment that separates them (eh? See the movie!), Or the way Euguene Levy (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) talks to his mother on the phone, or just the countless facial expressions that only Candy could offer you, the better you'll control your pulse! If you like the John Candy of "Only the Lonely", it may not be a movie that I would advise you to see but if you like the days of SCTV John Candy, this movie is a must see!
