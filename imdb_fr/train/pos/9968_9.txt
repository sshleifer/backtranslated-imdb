My mom took me to see this movie when I was a child and I can not wait to see it every year, like all my other Christmas favorites. What I remember most is that the devil and Santa Claus looked through his telescope. I waited and watched the guide T.V. every year thereafter to see when he would be shown. I usually find him playing on a Saturday afternoon. I only found the film in English that removed something special from the film and I am anxious to find a copy in Spanish. I hold this film very dear to my heart and I have never suffered from nightmares as some might suggest. Yes, it's a different film about Santa and that's what makes him special and unique. I can not wait to take a copy of this movie and watch it with my kids while I explain my favorite games and memories !!
