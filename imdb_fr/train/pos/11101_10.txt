The sopranos were probably the last best show of the 90's. It's sad that it's over, it was the best show on HBO, if not on TV, everything was not spelled out for you all the way through to think it was great. the distribution was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and has played his character in an excellent way, as well as the others. Each character had flaws that made them so real and allowed viewers to connect with them, which is why it took so long. The last episode was good, I do not know how to take it. Many different things can be interpreted by the end, like wanting to think that Tony did not die, but Meadow came in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for the suspense. Tony will have to go to trial and hope he is not dead, that's what I feel ... Long live the Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
