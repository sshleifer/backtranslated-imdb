I had few expectations for this movie, but I was looking for something interesting for a party. I left the theater totally delighted and a little surprised. This is a very good film tribute to baseball and a nice lesson on the pursuit of your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role and I was touched by his performance. Really worth a ticket at full price and a few hours of your time!
