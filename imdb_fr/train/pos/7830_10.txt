In "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried", Siegfried was betrayed. Now, Kriemhild is seeking revenge. She marries Hagen and, through a series of events, she finally embarks on a very radical (but appropriate) action at the end. <br /> <br /> One of the aspects of watching this movie right now is that we can watch some performances. Attila the Hun (named Etzel in the film) is presented as a strange person from the east, probably an allusion to the Soviet Union. Obviously, it was not Fritz Lang's fault if Hitler had used "The Nibelungenlied" for the German national pride of the Third Reich, but one can see what the Fuhrer liked in this story. Nevertheless, it is an absolutely wonderful film.
