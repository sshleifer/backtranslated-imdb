I enjoyed this show for two reasons: 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two artists made the show with the support of regulars and recurring actors. The replacement of RDA in seasons 9 to 10 was enough to make the heart lose the series. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between all the main characters is extraordinary. It seems like the actors like to get noticed after the camera has stopped rolling. This relationship is reflected in the program we see. <br /> <br /> GDR gives his character "O'Neill" a credible personality. He never knows when to give rest within it. You watch others rolling eyes, dismayed by some of his statements. Nevertheless, they know that he is the right man when the situation is dangerous. <br /> <br /> There's a lot going on between "Carter" and "O'Neill" under the surface. They manage to keep the lid, but often barely. The episode 'Solitudes' of season 1 presents one of the best dramas ever seen on television. The love between the two made the perspective of death bearable because they faced it together. <br /> <br /> "Carter" and "Jackson" must often alleviate some of the turbulence created by "O'Neill". Yet, the tactical instinct of 'O'Neill' still seems valid. He understands what to do without having to think about it. The team was repeatedly jeopardized by others who did not listen to his orders. <br /> <br /> The quality has declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. The original story has been largely exhausted and new villains have never really attracted my interest. Ben Browder was far inferior to the GDR in making the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping phoned for her performances these two seasons. You could see her greatly changed after having a baby. She probably thought more about the child than the show. <br /> <br /> The spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis' has a few moments, but mostly represents a lower effort. The main characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. The wicked (Wraiths) are so improbable that they are ridiculous. Amanda Tapping may be able to breathe some life into the program or it will not last beyond the fourth season. <br /> <br /> There has always been a problem for me in the special effects of the series. Having pyramids-shaped spaceships is a monstrous design rarely equaled in Sci-Fi. The use of torches for lighting these ships is just as bad. It is equally difficult to accept that the decorations of ancient Egypt conceal an ultramodern technology. <br /> <br /> I also wondered about the continuity of the show. In the first part of season 2, Daniel Jackson is hit and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was injured. He crawls into a sarcophagus, which heals his body and restores his uniform as if he had just disappeared from the wardrobe closet. The episode 'Hathor' has a sarcophagus fallen into the hands of the SGC, but it is never mentioned again. This device could have been used in several later episodes on 'Daniel', 'O'Neill' and 'Dr. Frassier '.
