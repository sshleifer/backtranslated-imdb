I just read the most recent remarks on this film and I would like to respond. you are probably not aware of the original story of rap group N.W.A. which dates back to the beginning in 1988, in 1989, ice cube left the group to go solo and finally in 1991, the group separated from the departure of Dr.dre. which led to a lot of beef from the departure of ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. this story was a bit based on that one. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie was a fun 90-minute party, the way they explained that the juice song of the boot was a hilarious political statement. not to mention the tasty "love song" was connecting. and when vanilla sherbert gets her ass kicked, just like the director of the record company is so hilarious and their directors get shot every time too. <br /> <br /> People who did not like this movie probably did not do it. to get it or were complete idiots, my opinion
