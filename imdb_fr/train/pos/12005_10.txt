This film was the best movie I have ever seen. Since I am SDJ, I highly recommend this film because you can better understand the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film was not made with highly acclaimed actors, it is a remarkable film that changes lives and can be appreciated and appreciated by all. I saw this film with my family and I can testify that we all changed our minds. This film allows people to truly understand how difficult the life of the prophet was and how much he faced tribulations. After seeing this movie, there was not a single dry eye in the whole room. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I'm not the same since I saw it. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
