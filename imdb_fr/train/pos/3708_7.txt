A lawyer interferes in a murderous game of the cat and the mouse when he engages with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates an atmosphere of suspense, Gothic but the script is weak. Branagh is a convincing South Lawyer and Davidtz seduced by his desire. Downey is nice as a private investigator. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his strange character. Hannah and Berenger complete the impressive casting. After an interesting staging, the movie gets bogged down and does not really keep its initial promises, but Altman is always worth a look.
