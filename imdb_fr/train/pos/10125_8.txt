This film is the first in the Triikes trilogy of the company Miikes, and the trilogy begins very well. The trilogy movies are only linked by theme, and these themes are actually apparent in all his films, if you look closely enough. The Shinjuku Triad Society talks about a policeman trying to prevent his little brother from getting too involved in a rather extreme band of strangers, fighting to reach the top of Tokyos yakuza. The little brother is a lawyer and the gang of triads needs it more and more as the film progresses. The film takes place in a very harsh environment, and is therefore quite violent and hard. Miike did worse, but since this is a serious movie, it hits you very hard. As usual, there is also a lot of perverted sex, mostly homosexual. The film is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with great motivation and real granularity. If you only saw extravagant movies (Ichi the killer, Fudoh, etc.), it's worth a look, because it's a kind of compromise between his aggressive offensive style displayed in these movies and his side more serious. , as seen in the other films of the trilogy. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes you will NEVER forget (see them and determine which ones by yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
