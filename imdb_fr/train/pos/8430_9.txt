It's always nice to see Angela Bassett play a role in which she can really bite her teeth. She is sometimes intense, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena, a "woman of color" forced to settle on a desolate mud bank near Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good in a role not quite likeable as a partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah interprets with a subtle nuance the unknown who discovers the new space of life of Boesman and Lena. It is not often that one has the chance to see a smart movie dealing with mature themes. Although it is a play, the late director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens the film by filming the film Cinemascope widescreen format. It also keeps things visually interesting by blocking the creation of actors and showing us things that are only mentioned in the play. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have directed Angela Bassett to an Academy Award nomination. It's really a film worth looking for.
