Fay, the sister of the famous Nobel laureate poet Simon Grim, still loves Henry Fool. Their son receives an ingenious boxed orgy from an undisclosed shipper. A pursuit across three continents ensues, featuring an extremely sad collection of state agents, terrorists, flight attendants and fighters. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey delivers a perfectly synchronized cartoon performance, including brilliant physical work. Thanks to strong contributions from Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fay Grim proves, in the purest tradition of Billy Wilder, that nothing is more funny than a beautiful woman in trouble. <br /> <br /> Another good Hartley score (and thanks to the credits at the American Academy of Berlin, where Hartley was a Fellow in the fall of 2004).
