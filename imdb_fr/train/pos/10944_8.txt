Sarah Silverman's program is ... better than any other series. No laughing tracks, no painful jokes, just a program. The Sarah Silverman program. If you're like me and you like comedy, it's probably a show for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman brings you fun and fun to the table. A mix of different styles, making it its own. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you do not want to start the comparative war because it has absolutely nothing to do with them (other shows). This show is his own entity and I think most comedians will like it. <br /> <br /> Go look and see.
