I liked this movie because it was essentially more with less. This could have been made more interesting if they had kept it even more confined to the studio (although some elements of the plot would have been more difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The guy playing the DJ did a good job. to show someone scared and haunted by his memories. I also found his dialogue with the interlocutors quite amusing. <br /> <br /> While you can see parts of the movie getting closer to one kilometer, other parts should not change as they have been. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part, focusing more on the living side of the equation. The last 5 to 10 minutes have been pretty well done and everything is revealed. <br /> <br /> Although it was a shorter film, it seemed to us that we had time to tell the story. More and it would have started hanging out.
