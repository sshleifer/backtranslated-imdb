This film is as unique as it is neglected ...... A different story is none other than that, it shows how much the need to survive or to be maintained allows to find the capacity to love if you have an open heart. an open mind. I saw this for the first time on cable in the late '70s and it really reflected the boundaries of the gay community at the time. I think this film was ahead of its time in describing a small slice of an obscure lifestyle. It is truly a classic in that it was a forerunner of what is now described as the extended family. This film should be available on DVD / VHS to recognize not only the extraordinary performances of Meg Foster & Perry King, but also to show how much we have come a long way and need to go further in terms of relationships.
