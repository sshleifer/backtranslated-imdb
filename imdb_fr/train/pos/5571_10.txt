After watching "Whipped" when screening a distributor at the AFM the other night, I must say that I was deeply impressed. The audience laughed from top to bottom. Unfortunately, each territory was already sold so I did not have the opportunity to buy the film, but I sincerely believe that it will be a resounding success both nationally and beyond the seas. I agree with the comment that "Whipped" should not be portrayed as a "Sex and the City" male, mainly because, unlike "Sex and the City", "Whipped" is a satire about encounters that never take themselves too seriously. "Whipped" mocks relationships in a way that most sexual comedies would not dare. In addition, the film I screened at the AFM had more of a plot and a story than "Swingers", "Clerks" and "Sex and the City" put together. "Whipped" never slowed down and provided the audience with a non-stop comedy. The performances of Amanda Peet and the rest of the cast were all very strong, which only made the movie more impressive given the budget.
