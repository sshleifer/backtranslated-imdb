This film is well made at so many levels that I am impressed by the fact that the score is as low as it is (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) at the time of this writing). This film has incredible special effects, an epic storyline, complex character interactions, and mind-blowing battles - you have to see them to believe them! The only complaint I have about the subtitles of the DVD version of HK I had (some lines have not been translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I just do not understand if I read from different sources: "he has a confusing conspiracy ....", "I could not follow the story ...." or "The characters came from nowhere ... ". From the first time I watched this movie, I understood it, I followed it, I knew why the characters were there and I loved it! I have already watched about 8 times and each time, it's pure pleasure. Oh, and that's not quite my opinion, because I showed this film to many American compatriots (people who had never seen an HK movie before) and who feel the same way. None of them failed to follow the plot and each person declared his love for this film. Oh man, why can not we have things like these coming out of Hollywood? At least Lord of the Rings had a good marriage of special effects, character development and storyline. <br /> <br /> This does not come from a beginner amateur of Asian cinema. I have an extensive library of Asian movies and I must say that this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. When you watch it, you'll be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie. You will be drawn into this fantastic world and you will not want to leave! I saw the 1983 version and the 2001 version (both made by Tsui Hark), and the 2001 version is much better compared to the IMO. <br /> <br /> In addition to subtitles, I have an additional complaint about this movie: I did not want it to end ... Please, Mr. Hark - can we do you like to have a suite?
