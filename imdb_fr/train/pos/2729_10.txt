I voted excellent for acting, not for content. It always gives me shivers after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ex-detainees travel to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe that one of the cons has learned in jail. During the ride, the tension rises as the soundtrack of the film adds to the overall anticipation. Once the killers finish their work on the farm the next morning, the remains of the family are found by a friend of the girl's church. The stifling scream, as the scene spun on the phone with the cord cut, made me really cold with blood and shivered. The fact that the killers have met their just destiny is a slight comfort for this condemned family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also very well written by Truman Capote.
