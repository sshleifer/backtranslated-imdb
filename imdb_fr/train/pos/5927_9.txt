Stephen King's movies are a fun thing with me. I really like them or I hate them. Some of the most sophisticated productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) did not please me. Some of the smaller ones, I really liked. I love watching somnambulists and watching them regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are somnambulists, creatures with changing shapes that, although human, turn into feline. They are immune to cat scratches and every time they move to a new city they set traps to catch and kill animals. When they move to their last city, they have to look for a virgin and when Charles finds one, it falls for her, but her mother has to feed her to keep fit. The story revolves around what will happen with the girl. Will Charles use it or use it to save his mother? <br /> <br /> Although this story has a connotation of incest that some might find unattractive, it does play a role in the story and therefore does not just appear in the film. for the scandal. Like most of Stephen King's stories, he is based in a small town with a lot of interesting characters. The acting is not the best, nor the special effects, however, one way or another, all tends to gel and a very nice and pleasant adaptation. <br /> <br /> For British readers: This production has most recently been broadcast on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror.
