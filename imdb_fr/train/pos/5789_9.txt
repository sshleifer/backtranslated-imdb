This is one of my favorites with the episodes of "Sandy" by Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing, as well as the episodes of Agnes Moorhead and the little astronauts. <br /> <br /> This is an important takeoff from mid-1961 on the long cold war in which the United States was then mingled. The city scene, the sparse dialogues of almost hungry characters, their worn out uniforms and the minimal action "says" all this: the absurdity of a conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization and all that who is sweet and redeeming about it. <br /> <br /> It's a "fable" because it was done at a time when events had unfolded differently, such as the second Berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the Cuban missile crisis that followed (October 1962), it would have been a reasonable representation of one of the big American cities, ruined and filled with some miserable survivors. . I also see it as a "fable" because it is not only an edifying story, but it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths: it is a love story, unfolding in an impossible situation, and involving two very mismatched lovers.
