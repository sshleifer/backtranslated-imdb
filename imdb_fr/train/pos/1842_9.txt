The series 2 has started well! I do not think you need to watch series 1 to understand what's going on, but as in any series, it's nice to feel the characters and care about what's happening to them. And this show makes you think like that! These 4 women of about 30 years seem to lead a glamorous and exciting life, but the principle is credible and realistic. The twists that occur through their sex life and love are exciting to watch, but you also know that these are issues that also affect real women. These are the decisions we make as women and how we are sometimes led on some pathways of our lives rather than consciously making those choices!
