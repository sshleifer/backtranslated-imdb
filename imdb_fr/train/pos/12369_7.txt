Ah, yes, the blockbuster of the stars. Take a mean concept, insert it into a script and load it with all the special effects the Wizards of Hollyweird can imagine, then round up the usual suspects: the most promising, the has-beens, wanna-be's and never-wuzzes , and stick them in set roles of different sizes before the ruthless eye of the cameras. And hopefully, some of them are not too old to remember their words. <br /> <br /> Let the bishops of Box Office finally apply the concept to horror films, as was the case with the thriller post-EXORCIST LA SENTINELLE. The novelist Jeffrey Konvitz decided to try to reconstruct the scenario of Ira Levin's baby, ROSEMARY'S BABY, with frightening (and finally satanic) neighbors in a New York brownstone. The result has been a controversial bestseller that some believe borders on plagiarism and an equally controversial, celebrity-laden / co-authored and directed by Michael Winner of DEATH WISH, but for many troubling reasons. <Br /> <br /> Cristina Raines (NASHVILLE) plays the successful model Alison Parker, who is quite stressed and overworked (I will not add "overpaid") I mean she is a model, so it would be redundant), not only by his schedule 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but also by his boyfriend Michael (Chris Sarandon of DOG DAY APTERNOON and the classic film SPS.IG LIPSTICK). One of the ways she tries to get away from it all is to move to her home; a big and beautiful Brownstone in Manhattan that she can get cheaply (that should have been the BIG red flag - cheap real estate in New York!), the accommodating and mysterious broker Miss Logan (Ava Gardner, the Senator of the Golden Age), fresh out of the sewer pipe at EARTHQUAKE. <br /> <br /> Things seem to be going well at first, but ah, yes ... then come the noises and the loud pounding of the apartment up at night. And what about the REAL strange neighbors like Gerde (Sylvia Miles) and Sandra (a very early Beverly D'Angelo), friendly "single friends" (read: lesbians) living together, and the nice old man Charles Chazen Burgess Meredith), who seems a little too worried about Alison's well-being? And this is not to mention other cohabitants with squirrels (you will never hear the expression "black and white cat, black and white cake" without wanting to laugh milk through the nose and possibly vomit simultaneously). Especially the old blind priest living at the penthouse ... <br /> <br /> Things really start to deteriorate when a nightmare full of appearances of Alison turns into a death macabre (in one of the fears the more underwear from the movie), and Alison and Michael, Jennifer (Deborah Raffin), Alison's mate, begins to piece together the puzzle that reveals the dark origins of the brownstone, as well as the deadly agenda of its inhabitants a another world, not to mention the link that unites them to Alison. it turns out that there is nothing fortuitous. <br /> <br /> Although there is no controversy about distribution, which seems to present all actors of different genres in search of a job at a time (Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer , MartinBalsam, Eli Wallach, John Carradine, and even the first appearances of Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and Nana Visitor!) The winner and his company have returned to groundbreaking bases and shot a "Tod Browning" ... by appealing to real actors with physical difficulties appear in the culminating sequence of THE SENTINEL'S - everyone goes to hell, what would any director do, not being able to access Linda Blair or a case of green pea soup . This certainly leaves you with arctic fingers playing the spinal cord like a zither, knowing this juicy little juicy info under your eyes. And this is a technique that filmmakers have only recently returned to: make-up on stage and special effects that do not appeal to CGI (which was virtually non-existent at the time). <br /> <br /> > THE SENTINEL has this kitschy cheese factor, late 70's, but manages to stand out from time to time with inspiring moments like the one mentioned above, not to mention the nauseating feeling that horror writers find easy to play , isolation and things coming and going shouting in the night. After all, what man living in the big city did not lie in the dark and did he listen carefully to what he hoped was "the building that was settling?" <br /> <br /> Konvitz followed THE SENTINEL with an inevitable sequel, THE GUARDIAN (not to be confused with William Friedkin's supernatural thriller), which has never been adapted to the screen. = sigh of relief =
