A wonderful first musical film by Ren√© Clair, as funny and witty as his dumb "The Italian straw hat". Using sound in an expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair influenced the early American musicals (the opera scene of A Night at the Opera is heavily influenced by The Million, for example). Should (but should not) be seen by all moviegoers, and the Criterion DVD is exactly as good as you'd expect. There are not a ton of extras, but most of the DVD extras I've seen are unnecessary fluff, and the Clair on Disk interview is an interview I've never seen. Get it while it's still there.
