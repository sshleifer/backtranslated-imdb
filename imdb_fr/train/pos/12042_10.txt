........... as I was when I saw this film), I will never see this movie again, not because it's a bad movie, but because it's so scary! As I said, I was 14 years old when my English teacher decided to show it to us. the reason is that we had read an excerpt from the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black passes through the window and floats over Kidd's bed. there was something that also frightened us, it's when Kidd found the ghost soldier under his pillow and he heard a child's voice say "It's for you". This scene still haunts me to this day, almost 7 years after seeing the film. <br /> <br /> If you are easily afraid, AVOID THIS FILM !!!!!!!!
