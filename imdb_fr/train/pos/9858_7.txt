I would not want to go so far as not to recommend this film, because the only problems I encounter are due to overexposure to the plot peripherals used in the movie - the kind of stuff that all children's movies have ever makes it appear, it seems. It does not matter, but I would not go far away from something. <br /> <br /> It's a bit of saccharine, so I could say that most people looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed by a movie obviously for kids like this -this. <br /> <br /> However, all this escapes the window when this squirrel (that of all the trailers) appears on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems obvious that the decision makers had the wisdom to say to these guys: "Could you stay a little more squirrel?" whenever it becomes intolerably dull. It does not save the film, but you can leave saying, "At least there was an aspect where I could not help but laugh." <br /> <br /> And of course, visually, it will not disappoint, but almost a given with Pixar movies. I would put this down all their stuff ... but that's not bad in itself.
