I'm glad someone made a film about the difficulty of risking your heart a second time. Or third. This movie is exactly what it promises to be - charming, fun and gives you that nice feeling around your heart when it ends. The plot may not be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not all been used yet. The cast is perfectly selected although Scott Wolf does not look like a father of an eight-year-old, even when wearing a costume. So, the sparks are in the right places, the secondary distribution is nice and although you can probably predict the whole movie, you would not want to change channels. It's just the right kind of entertainment for a Sunday night.
