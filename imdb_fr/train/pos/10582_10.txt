It sang. There is drama. He has comedy. He has a story. This is one of the greatest movies ever made ... point to the line. If you can not enjoy this movie, then you must be asleep or in some kind of mental disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy", James Cagney sings and dances to get to an Academy Award; but in this film, he is better! It's James Cagney at his best quisessential! It's fast with one-liners! He is fast with his feet! It's non-stop action. And the sketches of songs and dances are classics, especially "Shanghai Lil". And the support cast is great; and the whole film is optimistic, moves quickly and exudes confidence. And even though this movie was made more than 70 years ago, it's still visible even today. And of course, this movie features Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She is the ideal partner of James Cagney ... and Dick Powell too! If you like fast, rhythmic movies, with lots of songs and dances, this is the movie to watch.
