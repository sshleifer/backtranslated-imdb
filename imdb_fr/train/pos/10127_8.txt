It was the beginning of all that! Certainly, they are not friends at its best, but it was the driver of the series, let's not forget and not bad at all. We are introduced to the gang and Central Perk, where our story begins. Even from this first episode, we have a sign of the Ross-Rachel relationship that will form over the next ten years, when Ross says, "I just want to be married again" and that Rachel breaks into a dress of Bride ... probably It was not intentional, because at the time, the writers were turning to a relationship between Monica and Joey, but that's okay now. Something else .. in this episode, Rachel is presented to Chandler as if the two had never met before, but in later episodes, the so-called "flashbacks" are contradicted because they have already met at three times. Nevertheless, the point is that this is a good start for a great show. This episode may not be the usual friends as we are used to them, with the cast still a little inexperienced, but in the next episodes we will see why the show has become what it was! Keep watching, the first season is an explosion !!
