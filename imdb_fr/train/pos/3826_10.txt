I love Korean movies because they have the ability to capture (really strangely really) real life. I tend to watch Korean movies only for this reason. I have already seen these directors of other films. The one that most resembles the feelings I've felt is Oasis and another awesome movie called This Charming Girl. <br /> <br /> However, my title summary is supposed to be from Chrstian's point of view, so I'll start. do it instead of just praise it. <br /> <br /> For a non-Christian perspective, the director, Chang-dong Lee, captured the impartial and almost strangely real portrait of a modern Protestant church (whatever its denomination). . I have always been waiting for a Christian film that truly portrays the darkest recesses of church life. Because Christian movies tend to speak in a different language than the one they want to share their faith with. Many religious movies, even if they have good motives, tend to resonate with a Disney movie or a special show after school. They need to show life as it is. Real people curse, real people covet, real people fall. And while Christians believe that salvation is available to those who seek it, we are always challenged by the daily horrors of this life. And the character of Do-yeon Jeon is a totally honest and almost brutal representation of a woman who has found God, but because of the bitter realities of life, she loses that love she once had. She does not deny that God exists. It's just that she refuses to accept living with the idea that he is a God who loves and forgives. <br /> <br /> In a decent way, on the edge of morality and madness, his character asks questions of everyone, religious or not. <br /> <br /> "If God is Love, why does he allow such terrible things to happen?" This film does not answer that, rightly so. And I believe that the last 10 minutes of the film, although subject to interpretation, leave us a promising future for our main character and bring the idea of ​​the "secret sunbeam" in a loop. <br /> <br /> I do not do it. I believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had tried to become one. There lies the reason why it worked even more. It's real, it's honest. And because of that, it's by far the best summary of a real Christian life I saw in a movie.
