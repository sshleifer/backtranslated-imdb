You can do a lot with a little money. Blair Witch proved it. This film supports him. It's nothing more than a sitcom of length and complexity. However, because he has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes, he manages to be hilarious even with a budget that could not afford a minimal budget. The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe as a sincere and rowdy Watson, his darkening and slowness thwarting Cleese's wit. If you ever see the movie, watch it for a weird laugh or two.
