Be careful with this one. Once you put on your gloves, it will change the way you watch kung fu movies. You will now aspire to a screenplay of all kung fu movies, you will want depth and character development, you will want mystery and unpredictability, you will be asking for dynamic camera work and incredible backgrounds. Unfortunately, you will not find all of these together in a kung fu movie, EXCEPT for Five Deadly Venoms! <br /> <br /> Easily the best kung fu movie of all time, Venoms combines a rich plot, full of twists, with colorful characters (and developed), with some of the best camera work out of The success of those who love the film depends on the viewer's ability to decipher which character is who and who specializes in what venom. One is the centipede, two the snake, three the scorpion, four the lizard and five the toad. Each character has different traits, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. This is where the hook lies, we learn with the student character, discovering who these different men are. We are in its place (so to speak) and we must choose those we trust and those we do not trust, just like him. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> The plot, the characters and the filming are not only great, it's also fun to watch, which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of its kind . . It's worth looking at some watches to understand everything that's going on. Venoms is a lesson on what kung fu really can do. Do not expect many other kung-fu movies to live up to their glove.
