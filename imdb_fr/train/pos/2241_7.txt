Another comedy about a brave little country fighting in the jungle of the modern global world (for the forties) with only a native spirit and courage to guide them, here is a nice entry into the Ealing canon. Terry-Thomas sparkles as usual in the lead, while a man of impeccable ministry led to the brink of disaster when a country he is supposedly responsible for starts attracting interest from around the world, Ian Bannen takes a big lead romantic, Peter Sellers puts in one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politico and the super-suave John Le Mesurier plays against a rugged revolutionary leader type. Everyone has a lot of fun, especially the viewer; maybe not at the highest level of Ealing classics, but high enough.
