Rock n 'roll is a messy affair and DiG! demonstrates this masterfully. An ambitious and perhaps foolhardy project, the filmmaker is able to put together seven tumultuous years during which he has followed two difficult rock bands. That said, the abundance of quality materials ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience. If you have ever been interested in any area of ​​the music industry, this film will undoubtedly be a striking sight. The music of the film, although it suffers very little cut-and-paste, is worth only its price of admission. the next morning I saw DiG! I went straight to the record store to pick up an album from Brian Jonestown Massacre (I was already introduced to the sounds of Dandy Warhols). Defined primarily by his exploration of rock music, the film succeeds on other levels. Dig! is a sincere and objective look at the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people who are trying to attack these forces.
