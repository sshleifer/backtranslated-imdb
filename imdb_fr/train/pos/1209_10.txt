At a time of such horrific cartoons, I am rather shocked to see a movie with such a good moral on the IMDB background list for animated films. <br /> <br /> This film contradicts the first. I will not deny that. However, when I was in the target age group of this movie, I did not even notice it and it would not matter if I did it. The people who made it may have used "New Generation" to point out that this was another way the Bear Bear family could have started. Perhaps we are supposed to decide for ourselves the origin of the Care Bear family. <br /> <br /> It was my favorite movie, aged 3 to 6, and it did not scare or confuse me. <Br /> <br />
