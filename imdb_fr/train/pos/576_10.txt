this movie was just awesome, the cast, the sets, the story, the director, everyone really fits the role they played, and you can imagine being there, Robert Redford is an amazing actor and now the same director , Norman's father is from the same Scottish island as myself, I loved the fact that this movie was really linked, the witty remarks made throughout the movie were great, it was just great, so I bought the movie as soon as it was released for retail and I recommend it to everyone. The fly fishing was amazing, really in the end it was so sad, and you know what they say if you cry in front of a movie, it must have been good, and it really was, so congratulations for both little boys who played the role of Norman and Paul, they were just great. Children are often left out of the praise list, I think, because the stars who play them all grew up are such a big profile for the whole movie, but these kids are amazing and should be praised for what they have done, do not you think? the whole story was so beautiful because it was true and was someone's life after all that was shared with all of us.
