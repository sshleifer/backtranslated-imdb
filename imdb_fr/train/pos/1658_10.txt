If you saw this movie, you went to Puerto Rico. I have lived in Puerto Rico all my life and I must confess with shame that we are experiencing chaos right now, with drugs being the main reason for the shootings and murders we have almost every day. These people will shoot anyone, anytime, anywhere, and many innocent lives have been lost because of it. We no longer feel safe, and on top of that, our so-called "justice" is no longer driven by truth and justice, but by money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real and deplorable facts and accurately portrays Puerto Rico's three main problems: drug-related murders, money and power manipulating our courtrooms, and innocent people and people. corrupt and even dying children because of this. Ricardo and his wife Poli, with their loyal plot and their award-winning leadership (**), had the courage to present all this in such bad shape: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country, living a nightmare that does not seem not end !!! ** They recently won the Copper Wing Award for Best Director at the World Film Competition at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival.
