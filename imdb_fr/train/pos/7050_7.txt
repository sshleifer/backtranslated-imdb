I do not want to spend too much time here discussing the plot - you've seen the trailer, and if you have not seen it online yet. However, I do not recommend seeing it - it was poorly designed and did not pack the laughter or magic of the movie. So those who avoid this movie because of its ugly trailer should give this one a chance. It's really funny. I was blown away by the skill and originality of this film. I was hysterical for the first 40 minutes. My only problem was that the movie had become an unnecessary Austin Powers movie in the last 20 years. It is however one of the rare films where the end of the film did not displease me. the rest of the film (which is normally the case). Everyone gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are great times all along. Personally, I plan to see him at the exit, but only to capture all the details that made me laugh at the first viewing!
