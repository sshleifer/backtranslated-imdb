Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best horror films in prison (like "Death House" or "The Chair") in the late 80's. Twenty years earlier, guard Lane Smith had performed at wrong a convict. Now he is the guardian of the newly reopened prison, and the ghost of the man is back for a bloody revenge. This atmospheric and very sullen film features a lot of bloody horror and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are Onhand for the entertaining carnage.
