Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought it was going to be an idiotic and childish movie, and it was TOTALLY not. it was so funny for EVERYONE, adults and children. I've seen it before because it was almost out of the movie theater and now it's finally out on DVD this Tuesday and I'm really excited, as you can see. you should really see it if you have not already done it, it was so great! <br /> <br /> Liz
