Sniper gives a new meaning to war movies. I remember films about Vietnam or World War II, a lot of shooting, everyone dies, bam bam. "Sniper" takes the war to a new level or refinement. The film certainly expresses all the emotions it targets - the powerlessness of humans in the jungle, the hatred and possible trust between Beckett and Miller and the rush of the moment when they press on the trigger. A seemingly low-budget movie corrects every flaw with action, suspense and thrill, because in the end it's just a shot, a murder.
