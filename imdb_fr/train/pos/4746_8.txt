This film seems to draw a line of demarcation - on one side, those who love it, on the other, those who find it unbearable. <br /> <br /> For starters, there is a lot of comedy in this film that many viewers do not "receive". Of course, Jet Li's mask looks like Bruce Lee's Kato - he's supposed to do it, it's a joke. The guy who has a time bomb stitched in his heart - outrageous? Of course, it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask, if this movie is supposed to be so funny, why all this excessive and bloody violence? Well, on the one hand, tolerance at this level of violence is actually different, from one culture to another; and although the Hong Kong public acknowledges that the violence is extreme, it is certainly only slightly above average for an HK action movie. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is also the kind of film that respects the conventions and styles of a genre to the extreme, simply because the conventions themselves are totally unrealistic. After decades of watching people get shot without any apparent injury, many people were horrified to see Bonnie and Clyde and the Wild Bunch's outlaws pouring blood everywhere. But the fact is, when you shoot with a fast metal projectile, it is almost certain that blood will spurt out, especially from an artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a cartoon movie in Chinese. It's true that Spiderman's films never had that horror - but if they were true to reality, they would be! Despite its origins in comics, this film is true to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I can make is shooting and editing too stylized and flashy. If the film's directors had filmed it with nostalgia for the Hollywood style (like, for example, The Rocketeer or the recent movie on Sky Captain), I doubt anyone would have found it offensive. <br /> <br /> But as it stands, I had a lot of fun watching this movie.
