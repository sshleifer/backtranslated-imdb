This is one of the best "Our Gang" shorts of all time. Spanky is very cute and funny, and the babies he left behind are also hilarious. Tiny Spanky is forced by the band to watch all their little brothers and sisters. The foreground of them in baby carriages, amused by various things hooked by the gang to fishing rods, is a magnificent gag. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Spanky carrying his huge toy knife when the older ones ask him to look after his children is invaluable, as is his response - "Hey, where do you get that stuff - I do not mind babies! " The little boy saying "remarkable" throughout the film, all the beautiful gags in plain sight, and Spanky telling the babies "all about Tarzan" add up to make it one of the best "Our gang" you'll ever see .
