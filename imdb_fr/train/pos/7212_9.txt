I would not hesitate to place this adaptation of 'Death Trap' in the top 5 of the best adaptations of the scene to the movie: Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who never really had the chance to do more than sodden novels and "Superman") plays extremely well here, and even Dyan Cannon - which I do not normally like - plays perfectly in a role that exploits her uncomfortable value as an actress. <br /> <br /> I I'm not sure that the comparisons of "Deathtrap" with "Sleuth" - another brilliant adaptation of the on-screen screen starring Michael Caine - are valid or even right Yes, both stories have a lot in common, but "Sleuth" is just as much about the class war as the battle of the spirits, and the house in "Sleuth" is at least as much a movie character as the two actors - the house does not really of equivalent in "Deathtrap" and "Deathtrap" "This is not really a Battle of Mind is a sharp vignette of how bad people are (and never as smart as they think) and deserve all they get. I will simply say that both films are great examples of the genre and are worth your time and money. It's America, after all. You do not have to choose! <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the twists of the plot, but I do not think it matters anyway. I watched the DVD eight or nine times in a dozen years and I still enjoyed chemistry, timing and scary moments when things turned to "pear". Everything is so well done that the journey becomes more important than the actual destination. Those who love dark comedy and suspense in Hitchcock's film style will probably appreciate the "death trap" immensely.
