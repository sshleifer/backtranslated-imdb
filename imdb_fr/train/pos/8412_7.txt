Those who used the camera so early in the century had to understand its potential very early. It's a good story about a type of playboy who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, his soul is his double and he has to confront him frequently, tearing his life apart. There are wonderful scenes with people disappearing and, of course, scenes where both are on the scene at the same time. The central part is a little boring, but the story of Faust is always in the mind of the viewer. One thing I must mention is the general lack of attention of people in the film. In addition, they have almost avoided any action that would at least have given a little life to the thing. I was first informed about this film about 25 years ago and I finally got to see it. I was not deceived.
