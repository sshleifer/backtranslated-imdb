from the point of view of a NASCAR Maniac like me, the movie is interesting. You can see many race cars from 1983. Even tough, the racing scenes are not very realistic. But I must admit that I did not see any race before 1995, because before that, they did not show any NASCAR race in Germany) <br /> <br /> from the point of view of a Burt Reynolds fan like I am , the film is essentially what we used to see Reynolds in the 80s: Burt driving a car fast, as in Bandit Movies. <br /> <br /> If you like NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is a must. If you only like one of these two things, I recommend you watch it too. If you do not like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should still give him a chance, but remember, this movie was far from winning an Oscar Academy Award. <br /> <br /> It's the typical 80s humor. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you'll love that too.
