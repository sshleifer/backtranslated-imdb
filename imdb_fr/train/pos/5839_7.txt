The last (I think) of The Boys films made with Hal Roach, it's also the last really funny film they shot, before entering the twentieth century fox, which exploited their talents so badly. Even if there are weak moments - the case with the "lung tester", for example, is a bit, ah ... overwhelmed (but it's worth it to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but in Overall, this movie is a good summary of what the boys brought to the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) has appeared in other L & H films, and he's threatening here as a convict Nick Granger. The scene where boys have to eat their own synthetic meal ("it looks good, it smells good and it tastes good, eat it.") Is one of my favorite moments in the work. Stan and Ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of dedicated fans.
