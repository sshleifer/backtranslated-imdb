I have read Blaise's modesty for several years now, collecting the numbers of the band. After the fiasco film made many years ago on the first book "Modesty Blaise", I was surprised that the result was so positive. <br /> <br /> What I got is a movie that is not based on action or violence. The director focused on history and psychology. How was Modesty created on the basis of her own story and what parts of her life were affected by her non-childhood? I think it will give a better understanding to the next film (I hope). I just loved the old-fashioned movie style. <br /> <br /> However, everything was not so good, the game was not very good. almost boring and unreal. The acting game could have been improved too. I do not think the villain in this movie felt real, the only reason he was there was so Modesty could have someone to tell his story. They could also have expanded the film, showing in more detail when she built "The Network", but I guess it's for the next movie. <br /> <br /> And please, forgive me for my bad English
