A brutally depressing scenario and beautiful discrete performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed, as well as some good filming in the Ohio, propel this superb televised film about the difficult moments of the belt. When factories close and union jobs disappear, blue-collar workers are threatened by everyone: managers, owners, their wives and their children. Strauss is completely credible in her role and Pamela Reed is, as always, wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he gains weight. <br /> <br /> The heavy metal score - did someone make a pun? - is sometimes boring, but the cinematography of Frank Stanley is unimaginable, especially the mill scenes.
