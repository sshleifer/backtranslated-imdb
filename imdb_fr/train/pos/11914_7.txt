You know, this movie is not so good, but, I mean, come on, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I find that the plot is hilarious anyway, this kid's father says he will take it back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they will not do it). Kid begs his fake god to help the angels to win, god help the All the time (via the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end, his father does not take it back and leaves on a motorcycle in the manner of children. it's hilarious until Danny Glover adopts it and it's a friend. <br /> <br /> I guess the good thing is that the old lady is left alone to die with her sewing projects and stories. The real winner here, though, is god. Because later, he got a job as a writer for many joke shows. <br /> <br /> As a children's film, he gets a 7. As a film about the mysteries of blind and stupid faith and the nature of "god," it gives a 10.
