Okay, I know I should not like this movie but I love it. From the admirable interpretation of a Japanese stereotype by Pat Morita to Jay Leno's annoying roar, I laughed all through this film. If you consider that it's not the best film in the world, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> What I prefer is that Morita talks to her boss in Tokyo with a second to drink.
