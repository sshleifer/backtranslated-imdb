Terry Gilliam gives a beautiful film, which I really enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the little appearance of Christover Plummer make the film absolutely awesome! It's Terry Gilliam's only movie I've seen, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely in my top 10. I think it's one of Bruce Willis' top four movies; and Brad Pitt is the best. Brad Pitt offers perfect performance. Perhaps one of the ten best acting performances I have ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt have both done extraordinarily well. With the brilliant story to support the great performances; and to support that, Terry Gilliam's superb staging.
