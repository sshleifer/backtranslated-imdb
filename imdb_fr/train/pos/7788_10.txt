I love Ashley Judd and I think all his movies are great. Ruby <br /> <br /> in paradise is one of his best. It is a very sober film that you really have to look closely to appreciate. The story of a woman trying to get by on her own and refusing to give in to the temptations that would make her life easier. Some of his films such as Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill have probably done better at box office and video rentals. They were very good movies too, but take the time to really watch Ruby and I think you'll agree that this is one of Ashley's best. <br /> <br />
