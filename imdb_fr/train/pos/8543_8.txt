It was one of those movies I probably would never have chosen, but it came to the IFC one day and I said, Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I had changed channels, I would have missed a treasure. <br /> <br /> The subject is depressing - a young writer paralyzed by a climbing accident is summoned to a lower class rehabilitation center. It would have been so easy and tempting to make a manipulator. But that does not happen, because it was written by Neal Jimenez, after he himself was paralyzed by accident. No Hollywood happiness here. All patients in the service come from extremely different backgrounds, but they share a feeling of helplessness, of being at the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a type of "lone wolf", forced to take an embarrassing addiction to his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is just like a former women's man whose family is falling apart; but William Forsythe takes the cake like a tough guy, determined to charge someone to deprive him of his independence. <br /> <br /> See this movie.
