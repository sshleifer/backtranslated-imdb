This film contains such emotion, especially with its exceptional soundtrack that coincides with the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make movies and entertain. This movie was not the best the first time I watched it, but after about 3 other times, I decided it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes place in New York and progresses in his lifestyle. He discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then a mixture of extroverted imagination. This movie has exceeded all my expectations and is one of the best Cruise movies to date!
