I watched 'Speak Easily' one night and thought it was normal, but I missed something. Maybe Buster Keaton, strangely speaking, threw me to the ground, or the laborious online delivery of a main woman. The next day, I was still thinking about the movie. I could not get my head out of Durante's song, I was trying to remember Thelma Todd's first scene better, I thought Keaton might have had funny falls and a physical comedy. The next night, I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as an accomplice choir trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. A very amusing scene, the excellent actors, their faces, their eyes, their ridiculous expressions. So I watched another scene, their show starts on Broadway. Buster, in his happy innocence, botches every act. Again, I laugh aloud, enjoying Keaton's clowning and tumbling. So the next night, I watched the whole movie again, and this time, I see it for the first time: it's great! It's sensational! It's wonderfull! Three great comics! Todd dance! Durante sings! Keaton speaks! Of course it is not poifect ... but there is a lot of laughter in this picture.
