I remember seeing specials for this show before it was released in 1993. I was 8 years old at the time, and now at 22, it's strange to see this cult show begin and end and come back The 90s at once, seem so far, what a beautiful decade. Anyway, I watched MonsterVision all the time, because I'm a big fan of monster movies and horror movies. It was like version 90 of the Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get DVDs, why not show Joe Bob, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Many of Joe Bob's comments and information about the movies were just hilarious. Most of the films on this show were B-quality or C-rated, but there were a lot of Home A movies, like the top quality Hammer English movies, as well as many movies with the majesty of stop motion. from Ray Harryhausen. Many were weird movies that you would not see anywhere else, such as Japanese science fiction movies in addition to Godzilla, which is known to almost everyone and independent films like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new decade of film preservation and more independent filmmakers, I think MonsterVision would be a good show for the IFC because they already have a hit with the IFC grind house show. I'm sure this show will be resumed for reasons of nostalgia one day, I should wait and see. Until then "thats Great Television"!
