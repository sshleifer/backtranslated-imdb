If the scientists behaved in such a way that Wells was convinced, the future would not have gone so well that the story would not have been the same as in Things To Come. Almost 80 years after Wells wrote The Shape Of Things To Come on which this film is based, he is no closer to the world than he described above, somehow further away. <br /> <br /> Known players like Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwicke are part of the cast, they are more caricatures than real characters. This is the main weakness of this film, it is dedicated to the scientific philosophy of Wells that will solve all the problems and we remain fooled arrears. <br /> <br /> Massey's characters, two generations of the same family, share this extremely optimistic view. Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who thinks the man is rushing too far ahead. And Ralph Richardson is a warlord born of the destruction of another conflict of the Thirty Years War with modern weapons. By the way, since the atomic bomb was not invented, toxic gas was considered a weapon almost capable of destroying humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, science and conquest can never mix. Scientists as a group are far too much above the political world to engage in such things. In Wells' life, scientists have certainly fled the far-right governments of Hitler and Mussolini. However, these same people, to defeat them, subordinated themselves to the Allies and fabricated the atomic weapons that inaugurated the modern world. If they behaved as Wells would have liked, someone like Albert Einstein would have run a junta of scientists that would have established a new order after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Wells was wrong both in time and in development. Apparently, he never considered the computer as well as the atomic power. Computer programmers are much more likely to be our leaders in a new and brave world than the scientists of the moment. Still Things To Come, helped by the direction of William Cameron Menzies and the sets created, offers an interesting insight into the mind of HG Wells, certainly a respected thinker of his time, although he did not quite understand the form of Things To Come.
