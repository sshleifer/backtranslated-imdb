There are about 25 years of inspiration packaged in it. Starting with the existential themes of Blade Runner, as well as the vision of the future - with the advertising boards of companies, their technologies, the technologies of subsequent Matrix films and the AI ​​of Spielberg, and finally the graphic novel in black and white which looks like Sin City. The creators have put a lot of effort into the field of visuals and the result is a well-designed neo-black future. Add a crime novel and you have an interesting movie. I know what that meant, but whatever the amazing graphics, it was not enough to get to the final destination.
