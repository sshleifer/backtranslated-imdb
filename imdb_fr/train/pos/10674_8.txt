I do not agree with one of the critics who compared this film to American International Pictures. Basil Deardon made a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to represent the rise of juvenile delinquency in postwar England (but without the sentimentality of "Blackboard Jungle"). The cinematography was excellent because it really reflected the fear and isolation of the huge city. The estate looked like an old prison. Stanley Baker was excellent as a hardened detective, reassigned to the juvenile division - "Urgent, urgent - Larceny, five ice lollies" !!!! He discovers he is the target of many jokes. David McCallum showed that he was one of the best young British talents of the fifties. (He had a very different role in another Stanley Baker movie "Hell Drivers"). His portrayal of Johnny and the fanaticism he inspired were very frightening. Ann Heywood was also very good as a cynical Cathie. I would not say there was a romantic subplot in it. <br /> <br /> Detective Jack Truman is investigating a series of criminal attacks by a person called "Firefly". Just as he finds evidence that could lead to a breakthrough, he is assigned to the Juvenile Division - he is quite disgusted with what he feels is not proper police work. In the midst of all the ruckus, he gets his first call - the six-year-old Murphy twins work in a scam in the local lollipop shops !!! <br /> <br /> On their way home, he meets their brother, the charismatic Johnny, and their bitter sister Cathie. He begins to understand how life in scary cities can turn young children into criminals. As he becomes more involved in the family, he realizes there is a close connection between the fires, Johnny and a scared young Chinese man who works for a laundry. The local priest (Peter Cushing in an unusual role, far from the horrors of Hammer) explains that, when Johnny was younger, he saved people from a burning building and was hailed as a hero. He wanted to regain the sense of importance and utility and thought he could do it by lighting fires. The school's seat was filmed in a very real way and the spectator felt the fear of the children - the teacher (thinking only of her own safety) flees and locks them in the room with the scared shooter! !!! <br /> <br /> I thought it was an excellent movie that was trying to show some of the social problems that Britain had experienced after the war. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
