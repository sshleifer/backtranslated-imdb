Another large canal 4 canned well before the hour. Actor convincing Phil Davis and the rest of the cast. Sexy, smart and funny. I remember watching her at that time, and even then, asking, nobody had really heard about it. But try to find someone who can remember that it is even more difficult. Maybe Channel 4 is not doing its job well enough to create the necessary excitement. Either that, or the public in general is too much interested in the televised vomit that is Big Brother. I suspect this last. The download of Garth Merengie's Dark Place prompted Channel 4 to release a DVD of this series. Let's hope the same thing can happen with North Square.
