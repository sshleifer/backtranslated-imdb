This amazing documentary gives us an insight into the lives of brave women in the Cameroonian justice system: policewomen, lawyers and judges. Despite enormous difficulties - lack of resources, extreme poverty, multilingualism and multiple legal precedents depending on the country's regions and the religious / ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants - these brave and strong women make a difference. <br /> <br /> It's a rare thing, a truly inspiring film that restores a little faith in humanity. Despite the atrocities we see in the film, justice is done, thanks to these passionate and hardworking women. <br /> <br /> I only hope that this film will be released in the United States. The more people who see this film, the better.
