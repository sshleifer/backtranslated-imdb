If you are a fan of Crispin Glover, you must see it. If you are a fan of Sean Penn, you have to see it. If you are a movie fan in general, you must see it. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover and Sean Penn are, this movie will probably still have a lot of value, but the more you've seen the work you've seen with Crispin or Sean, the better. <Br /> <br /> This movie is so funny, but it's also pure genius. I do not know anything that looks like this movie. It's his own kind. I doubt that something like that will ever be done again. I can not say more about the exact reason without scratching it in part, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job in this regard. <br /> <br /> In response to critics who criticized it, please see the film again. In fact, there is no time when this film can be described as "boring". It's probably the funniest, most entertaining and least boring movie ever made. And it only gets better with age and repeated viewing. A timeless classic that, unfortunately, very few people can claim to have seen. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, which Crispin Glover also stars in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this film are rare and hard to find. However, I managed to find a VHS version after a diligent search, and there are many ways to find it as far as I know. But I really want someone to put it on a DVD.
