In Carmen, Saura seeks once again to establish a dynamic relationship between reality and fiction, between the current passions of personalities in a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance parties of the Carmen opera and the written passions of the story of the fictitious Carmen, the famous mixture of a free spirit (read in disregard of fidelity) and its ability to make people mad with desire. Saura used this same fiction / reality vehicle in a previous black and white film, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But, while the tensions between the dancers repeating Blood Wedding showed how they had evolved to become the fictional characters of the story to interpret by directing their emotions in their roles, in Carmen, the parallel between the small libidinal desires of the dancers of the troop during rehearsals and the spirit that forges the mythical Carmen are never so credible. It remains a gadget and, for this reason, a distracting distraction. You really have to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to enjoy the comparison. However, it hardly matters, the melodrama that Saura tries to impose on his Carmen, because the dance of flamenco and the music of repetition of the guitar, which represent 95% of the film, count among the best known dancers and musicians of flamenco , Entrance. A faulty movie and a wonder: perfect for doing an exercise in the "negative ability" of Keats, perhaps?
