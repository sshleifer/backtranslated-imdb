I saw this film in preview at the festival Imagina in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago and, from that moment, I was waiting for the final result. I was not deceived. <br /> <br /> This is a complete 3D movie with a very contrasting black and white rendering. Clearly inspired by some comics, such as those of F. Miller. In this perspective, it goes even further than the excellent adaptation of "R. Sin City" of R. Rodriguez. This time, (almost) no gray or average color, but a graphic style never before seen in a realistic animated film. (I can not wait for the dark scanner.) <br /> <br /> The massive use of Motion Capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we quickly forget the technical aspect to focus on elements more classic, such as direction or plot. The management remains sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and it is a very good surprise. <br /> <br /> The futuristic history (Paris 2053) makes it a classic science fiction film and keeps the viewer interested. until the end. Despite a classic basic plot (a survey that far exceeds the initial expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of some firms ...) give this film a great interest. <br /> <br /> In spite of it's an animated film, this one is obviously not made for the children. You will not find any funny pets or silly family morals here, only the cold reality. It's much closer to a good movie noir. <br /> <br /> I found that the frame is one of the best aspects of the film: you always feel the famous Paris, but it is transformed into a futurism. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I regret some mistakes. The editing is sometimes a bit flat, one or two effects of idle very clich√©s and dialogues mediocre. Although the technique is excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like the "final fantasy"). These little things make a 7/10. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into the potential pitfalls (fortunately, they did not ask John Woo to do the work!). <br /> <br /> To conclude, it's a film with vivid images, an intelligent story and a wonderful artistic direction. Look at it if you can! <br /> <br /> Please excuse me for spelling mistakes.
