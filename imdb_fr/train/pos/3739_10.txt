I really like this movie. Bozz is an ultra-cool soldier, not to be intimidated, who does not want to go to war. His character is similar to Yossarian's in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. This film, however, does not take place in a war zone, but in pre-war pre-combat training. This wonderful film tells with amazement that the war in Vietnam was a mistake and that these men condemned to be sacrificed in the service of a lost cause. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who has a lot of genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier as he did with disdain and disrespect for the establishment that was trying to kill him . Bozz is totally cool and no more, testing and tweaking his military superiors, getting their goat on every occasion. He is a character of Jesus Christ who graduated in psychology, "saving" his fellow soldiers and showing to those who really need, the way out of the army of this man. <br /> <br /> The actors' game is realistic and credible. As a "sleeper", Tigerland falls with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the top three Vietnamese films, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS, a first choice.
