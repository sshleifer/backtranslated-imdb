This film was an interesting Hollywood shoot about the novel of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. Although some may think that racial stereotypes exist today, the very idea of ​​the Chinese protagonists was progressive in itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese were not as bad as expected, that it was not the Asian equivalent of blackface. At the time, there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei playing) and Rainer did a good job with her. It was not the most beautiful performance I have ever seen, but it was good for the pre-method actors at the old school. The locust scene was very well filmed and contained compelling special effects. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the timing of the release of the Great Depression makes this movie an allegory. Especially the political upheaval that has puzzled the peasants and seems to have been left behind. <br /> <br /> The film had some parallels with John Ford's style, but I think the Eastern influence has also affected it. . If it had been a Western family, the grasshoppers would eventually prevail, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust and greed. However here he learns his lesson and then wins.
