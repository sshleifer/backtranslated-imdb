I can not really condemn the film because it works. There are enough elements of black film to consider it a black film, but I think it's only in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing sinister in this room, and this is where the black elements fail. Of course, the disease could be considered sinister, but I have trouble seeing that. The film hints at a darker side: Blackie may be a human trafficker, New Orleans police are all too willing to arrest a journalist, the specter of plague hangs over everyone of the movie ... tips. <br /> <br /> No attempt has been made to question Reed's motives, such as with Marlowe or Spade, nor any attempt to bring a human side to Blackie, which would make it even more contemptuous if the trafficking of human beings has actually been played. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is what ultimately misses the film. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and the realization are well done ... but there is nothing that makes this film a film on which you should come back again and again. It's worth a look once, maybe twice if you do not remember, and put it away.
