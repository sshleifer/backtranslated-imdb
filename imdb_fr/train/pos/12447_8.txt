The comics and novels of Modesty Blaise contain many elements that would be interesting in a film. Unfortunately, several attempts were made and they missed the huge potential of the character. So, no, it's not the modesty you know about comics (currently reproduced in beautiful editions of Titan Books). It's Modesty about 5 or 6 years before the first band, and from what you can reconstruct from its history, that's exactly right. <br /> <br /> Miramax had the rights to the character, with Quentin Tarantino acting as a lawyer and technical advisor. The first versions of the Miramax project have tried to adapt one of the best novels, but have always managed to leave out a crucial element. Tarantino was not satisfied with any of them and offered to withdraw his name from the project so that they could continue. At the studio's merit, they wanted to keep him in the process because they knew he "had" the character and his world. The rights of films expiring, they decided to try a very different approach. The result was "My Name is Modesty", a short direct film that presents the character. <br /> <br /> The film does not feature Willie Garvin nor Sir Gerald. These characters are important to Blaise's adventures in most published stories. What this film does is show the strength of the character. She never loses her temper, and you never doubt that she is responsible even unarmed in a room full of gangsters armed with rifles. The bulk of the film takes place in a casino, which has undoubtedly saved money on production. It does not matter. The movie does not seem so cheap. Instead, it gives a fairly complete (and believable) story to the character and shows how much she thinks about the future. If Miramax adapts stories or comic novels now, they will have well described the context of the character and will not have to spend a lot of time on his "origin". I realize that the words "Direct-to-Video" do not inspire confidence, but this film is really worth a look.
