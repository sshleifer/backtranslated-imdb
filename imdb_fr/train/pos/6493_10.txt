I remember seeing her as a British child in the UK, fascinated by the story and story of Laurence Olivier. We would not talk about anything else at school the next day. I guess the odds for the first screening were huge. It's simply the best and most complete documentary series, despite the fact that they had to reduce the story to the bone they managed to capture. What is interesting is that the battles of Britain and North Africa have been crucial and yet largely ignored as such by the Americans. The series illustrates the rivalry between Mountbatten and the American generals, the suffering of the German troops on the Eastern Front, the mistreatment inflicted on Japanese prisoners of war by American troops. The images of the holocaust led me, as a non-Jewish European, to feel guilty for ever of the treatment of the Jewish people. I do not know why this is not the number one in the IMDb ranking. Perhaps they show their bias against documentaries. Spoiler - we win.
