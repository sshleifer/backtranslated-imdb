A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of those blacks who did not survive apartheid and who died long before normal time. The old film does not show how important Biko was, what he really was. His life and his teaching are reduced to little, at best to some spiritual remarks. The film was 1987, the goal was to push South Africa beyond the edge that would lead to liberation. The film therefore aims to show how South African partisans of apartheid are irrational in 1987. To show this, the film must look beyond the death of Biko, thus centering his speech not on Biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escape from the absurd. system in which he lives. His escape is made necessary by the victimization of his family, and because he wants to publish the first book on Biko, after his death, and this can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. So, do not expect it to be realistic and true. It could not be. But the film has aged enormously because it does not show South Africa with a historical distancing, the very distanciation that took place under Nelson Mandela's presidency and that is called forgiveness, provided that those who want to be forgiven express. The film is strong and emotional, but this very historical limit makes it rather weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. Panegyric books or films all have this flaw: they look at the person they are supposed to photograph from a single point of view. This explains why the film has aged so much, seems to come from so long ago, as if nothing had changed. A remake is necessary. <br /> <br /> Doctor Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris 1 Panth√©on Sorbonne University, Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines, CEGID
