We saw it at one of the local art cinemas in the Montrose area of ​​Houston, Texas. It was a total surprise to write the theater newsletter, but we were blown away by the artistry. It was beautifully done and photographed (apparently) in a schloss (German name of the castle) somewhere in the Munich area. This is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relations of a group of men and women in their twenties isolated from daily constraints. It's fantastic at more levels than I can remember. After the movie, we went home and talked until about 4 am the next morning. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mainly). There must be at least two versions since the first film in (probably its original version) German. I searched and searched for a video tape version but I never found anything. I would really like to have a VHS or DVD version of that. It explores relationships at a fundamental level and is also an excellent tutorial on the relationship with your partner. If someone knows the scriptwriter / director, please convince him to take it out again, preferably on DVD these days. I can not even imagine getting tired of watching the frank performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties. Please, bring it back.
