I have just watched this movie again and I am appalled by the number of cynics who consider him a mere New Age dad. A great film that takes its time to develop, it borders on the edge, but never does and eventually meditative, touching and more alive than most people who forget their "coincidences". I was angry at the time films like "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (although I liked it) were nominated for best picture that year (even less than "Silence of the Lambs "was won!), Which was completely ignored. except an appointment for the best screenplay. Looking back, I think history supports my first reaction!
