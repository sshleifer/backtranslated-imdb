a film about the cruelty of this world. I found him liberator, as only the truth can be. It also contains quite fun elements. Some actors are extraordinary, see Maria Hofstätter for example. The director has tried to portray life in the most realistic way possible, by succeeding. Consistently, the sex scenes are explicit and no more false than those of a hard-core movie. Although I hardly understand a sentence, I found the vision of the film in the original language with the subtitles much more rewarding, because with the dubbing, half of the remarkable work of the actors is lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly difficult to reproduce by a doubler. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
