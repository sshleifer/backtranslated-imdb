During the first viewing of this film, it is difficult to know exactly what happened, but during a later viewing, it becomes clearer. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was excellent as Bob. The character of Lexa Doig was confusing to understand. At first she was ready to trap Bob, but I really think she ended up loving him, although she broke her heart at that time. Dean Cain's performance was an excellent one. He gets better with every movie he makes. My only question at the end of the movie was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was up to the viewer to decide
