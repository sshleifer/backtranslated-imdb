Historical drama and the story of the arrival in adulthood involving people of color free in New Orleans, before the Civil War Begins slowly, but picks up speed once you've learned about the main characters and that real action can begin. It's not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because they were free people. They may not have all the rights of whites, but they certainly had more control over their destiny than their slave ancestors. The young men and women of this story must each choose their own way of life, whether to give in to the depravity of the system or to live with optimism and contribute to their community. I enjoyed all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
