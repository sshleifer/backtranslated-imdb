In the colonies, we are not so familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost missed this movie (which TCM preview was recently published) because of the negative comments his appearance had on his appearance in "Ghost Train" - what I expected to be. really annoying. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and its timing when airing a line suggest what you would get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. It can not be compared to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual comic book suppliers that appear in such films. We can also feel the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later; at least, it is clear from the American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with his counterparts here. As for the rest of the movie, the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll be guessing the end, but it's still entertaining and atmospheric and well worth the wait.
