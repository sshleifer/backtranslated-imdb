As winter approaches, our state broadcaster, ABC, has decided, for whatever reason, to hold a partial Jane Austen festival on Sunday night. It started with a twelve-year long version of "Emma" last Sunday; More recent versions of three other novels, "Persuasion", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" are coming up. <br /> <br /> The curious thing about this production of A & E Television Networks, with the scenario of According to Andrew Davies, it appeared almost simultaneously with two versions of much bigger budget movie, one with Gwyneth Paltrow, and "Clueless", a "modernized" version with Alicia Silverstone, who carried the plot to Beverly Hills. As a result, even with Kate Beckinsale in the lead, this production flowed without a trace. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, there is still much to lose when novels are reduced to the length of the feature film. The adaptations that we appreciate and remember are those that have enough space to develop both a story and characters. "Brideshead Revisited" is a remarkable example. In 1982, he had 13 episodes of 50 minutes. It is enough to compare the very ordinary version of "Pride and Prejudice", in 2005, with the brilliant television mini-series of 1995, 1995.. It's not that a novel has to be filmed page by page, and some novels (often very bad) fit the film perfectly ("Atonement" is a recent example), but the novels of the genre Jane Austen have need time and space to practice. all their charm. <br /> <br /> Given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation, this production is OK. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right balance between self-confidence and vulnerability, and Mark Strong is a frank Mr. Knightly (he reminded me that Jane had a tendency to retrain characters.) Knightly is a more articulate version of Mr. Darcy, P & P, who is sullen, Samantha Morton was a rather soft Harriet, but Prunella Scales did a perfect job of blabbermouth Miss Bates Sybil Fawlty on speed, Bernard Hepton as Emma's weak father was also excellent. the muddy countryside, mud and poverty, and chic interiors, in case someone thinks this age is particularly idyllic for everyone. <br /> <br /> Even though it was "a condensed adaptation, it was strangely slow, in some places, some of the conversations were rather scalded, allowing even the formalities of time.I would have to watch the film again, but it may be because underutilization of reaction plans. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage films filmed, this is a very good example, and compares well with the Paltrow version. Anyway, there is more to come!
