If I did not know better, it would almost sound like a staging, but it was not. It was perfectly organized, and the way they got all these pictures is amazing! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are well staged in this documentary and the classic images they have obtained make it an unfortunate classic. Nothing but the story contained in the film should make it a must event for any American or person affected by the tragedy of September 11.
