Curiously, this film was never screened in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video to come out. My expectations were high, but they were not disappointing. As always with Ang Lee, there is a fantastic acting, a clever and exciting plot to guess until the end and a great shoot. With Unforgiven, it's easily one of the two best westerns of the 90s. <br /> <br /> People who expect something like Mel Gibson in The Patriot (nerdy) or Braveheart (acceptable ) will be bitterly disappointed, all others who appreciate the above qualities will have a fantastic time watching it. 9 out of 10
