Excellent game from Gretchen Mol. This film is one of the best biopics to appear on screen in a while. Although this covers most of Bettie's youth, he also manages to stay on a rather focused path, which seems to be lacking in most biographical films. There is a charming and curiously funny subtext in the dialogue and the acting game. This film is an excellent break from the Dir. from "American Psycho", and I think this will prove to be his best work to date. Oh, and as a cinematographer, I give this movie 100% in the film department. It was amazing how well they managed to get a 50s look with modern movies. Braces at the D.O.P. All around very nice. I recommend to anyone interested to see it: 8/10.
