The villain in this movie is a nasty sob and he seems to appreciate what he's doing, that's what I suppose that makes him so mean. I do not think most men will like this movie, especially if they are cheating on their wives. This is one of those movies that is pretty nasty until the end. But then, that's it, a bar of chocolate ending that makes me look back and say, "HOKIE AS HELL". A very good movie until the end. The end is the end we would like to see but not the end of such an average beginning. And then there are the consequences of what happened. I guess you can make up your own mind of the real end. I am convinced that only one character should have survived at the end.
