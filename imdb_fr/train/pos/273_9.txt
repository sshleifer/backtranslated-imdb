It's hard for me to criticize anything that Mitzi Kapture does. She simply radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. Despite that, yes, the plot was predictable. I think if Jill HAD had slept with Richard, it could have made him a little more crazy than he already was, which would have added more suspense. It would also have been nice to see Jill and her husband discover Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, maybe a little more in the past. I was a little disappointed with the end of the movie. I would have liked to see more closures with Zack's death and possibly closure with her husband. I must say, however, that I will never be able to look at a flare gun and not see it standing there. It was a very fitting end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi rocked! I am so impatient to see his future plans.
