"Can contain spoilers * <br /> <br />" All dogs go to paradise "is a fantastic movie I saw it in 1989, at the age of 2. I did not understand it very well but as I've seen more and more times I've started to like it, I love the songs in this movie, my favorite songs are "Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon You're Come Home" These are beautiful songs, the only thing that bothers me about the movie is Charlie dying.When I was little, my sister could not even watch this part, otherwise this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie are flying everywhere, the sky is beautiful in the movie and the "clocks" are very smart I also like Itchy, I actually have 3 dachshunds They're so cute. <br /> <br /> All in all, I like this movie and suggest everyone to see it.I give 10/10 stars to this movie.
