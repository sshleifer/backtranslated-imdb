This film is obviously small budget and shot in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that had to be overcome to make this film compelling (taking place in California and the late 1960s-1980s) were well-designed. I believe this is the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac murders that took place in the city of Vallejo & the Bay from 1968-19? Edward James Olmos (Det. Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac, then suspected of being Arthur Leigh Allen, since erased by DNA and fingerprints) play a game of cat and mouse that revisit crime scenes together, everyone trying to trigger each other in an emotional revelation.Olmos dies of some kind of terminal illness and knowing that Dzundza did it, still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family and becoming a full alcoholic the Along the way.Dzundza totally unconscious and egocentric (like all serial killers) to the carnage left in its wake.The only disappointment was the "cul-de-sac" ending otherwise quite accurate. If you are tired of the typical Hollywood fluff or if you have an interest in the Zodiac affair, check it out.
