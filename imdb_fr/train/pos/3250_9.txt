Another for the crowd Babes & Bullets. The story is much more complex than any other musical I've seen: cannons hidden in women's missing legs and generously locating them in the other in a way closer to a clever comment than what one would expect for the place. More effective than the contemporary "drama". It is difficult to identify with a woman who is holding a cannon, pants in place. Quite remarkable considering the context. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that 90% of the surprises remain in fashion, this film also tells how greed replaces all the other considerations of the life of a group of yakuza who pursue a woman who keeps her leg a concealed cannon / rocket launcher (so no group shower scenes or strings) The hidden projectile that is removed from behind the protagonists, seemingly out of nowhere, in Miike's Dead or Alive (1999), The torch released from nowhere by the heroine towards the end of the original Tomie (2000), or the heartbreaking scene of the flame throwing in Sunny Gets Blue (1992), bears witness to the quasi-third-planet Cantinflas-esquire influence in the contemporary Japanese cinema, which I am unable to explain, but I can not complain. <br /> <br /> You will not see good quality movies of this essence made in Hollywood, it is almost extinct and with cheap shit, they pump for a cheap thrill, is anything but laughable. It's a real movie and, although it's great in its entirety, its end is a brilliant, if not flagrant, scam of some images of Sergio Leon, featuring cannons where the legs should be, and who is certainly appropriate!
