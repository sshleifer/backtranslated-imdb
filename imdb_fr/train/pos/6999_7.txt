Will Smith embodies Ben Thomas, an IRS collection officer who has an ulterior motive to meet those who are behind in their tax payments. Thomas killed seven people while driving on the phone. The film follows his attempt to try to repair his unforgivable crime. Frankly, the story is as subtle as a brick. a greenhouse window. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the end of Titanic was more surprising than that of Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no twist, there is never any confusion or doubt about what is happening. <br /> <br /> Normally, I only like Will Smith when he's in the hot Bad Boys mode. The guy is at his best when he carries a rifle, drives a Ford GT and says "Aw Hell Nah", because every time he tries to act seriously, it's just a pathetic attempt to get an Oscar, which he is so desperate. for. This is probably the main reason why I was not looking forward to seeing the movie, even if it is very underrated. There are bursts of comedy but they are subtle. In fact, it was the most unobtrusive performance I have ever seen. That's why he was fantastic and, ironically, he should be nominated for a major prize. <br /> <br /> The support troop was just as great - Rosario Dawson was rather looking at the door of the dead all the movie and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were good like all the other players. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a weeper - but it's not about throwing all the usual clich√©s and sentimental violins to give you any other choice than to cry. Sometimes, even my hardened heart nearly broke. You will have a hard time not finding one of the situations that do not relate to your own life, which makes it even more real. <br /> <br /> I would give it 8/10. The Will Smith show goes to the drama without all the despair of the pursuit of happiness and is doing all the better.
