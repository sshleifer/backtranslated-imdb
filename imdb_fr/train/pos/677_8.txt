Sydney. <br /> <br /> After arresting five Aboriginal compatriots for Billy Cormans, Athol Compton, the police coroner found that he had died before he died of drowning and not violence, even though he had blues on the neck and shoulders. Still, the court decided to prosecute the five people sentenced to death for their deaths, accusing them of manslaughter instead of murder. <br /> <br /> David who defended them receives no help from them to defend himself. The accused assailants chose to remain silent and to keep what happened to Billy for themselves and take what happens to them from the yard. One of the accused Chris, David Gulpili, begins to invade David's dreams as if to tell him what really caused Billy's death. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, David does not take his dreams seriously, begins to seriously feel that their real when he meets him in court. Chris confirms David's dreams by showing him a strange black rock that David saw in his dreams. Later, when he met Chris and, what turns out to be an Aboriginal shaman, Charlie (Nandjiwarna Amagula), who came to his house that night, tells David that, like Charlie, he has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother's grandfather. These powers will reveal to him the future linked to the strange weather conditions that flood the Australian continent. Chris explains to David that the Earth is going through a massive cleaning cycle, the old world being about to be swept away and the new world ready to replace it. <br /> <br /> David is confused about what Chris and Charlie have at the same time. tell him, but as the rains continue to rise and the waves of the ocean begin to rise, he feels that something terrible is going to happen.

That alone can get Chris, along with his four friends, for Billy's murder. Since the Australian government will not pursue tribal aborigines, the tribes themselves will only do justice. Chris still refuses to admit that he is a member of an aboriginal tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter upon Billy's death. The convictions will be pronounced by the judge in a few days. <br /> <br /> David is now determined to find out why Chris kept quiet and why Billy had to die is taken away by Chris to the crime scene. It is there that David discovers that Billy betrayed the members of the tribe of Chris by going there, Billy not being member of the aboriginal tribe of Chris. It is also revealed to David that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the Austrailan Aborigines, as Charlie and his father-in-law, Reverend Burton, David Parslow, told him. <br /> <br /> The stage is now ready for the great and last cleansing cycle that David has observed in his nocturnal dreams and diurnal visions. It takes the form of a massive tidal wave spreading from the Pacific Ocean to the Australian coastal city of Sydney, then submerging the entire continent.
