I thought it was a wonderful way to spend time on a hot summer weekend, sitting in the air-conditioned theater and watching a light comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is spiritual and the characters are friendly (even the serial killer suspected of fortune bread). Some may be disappointed when they realize that this is not Match 2: risk addiction, but I thought it was proof that Woody Allen still had control of the style that many of us have learned to love. <br /> <br /> It was the most I've been laughing at in one of Woody's comedies for years (dare I say a decade?). Even though Scarlet Johanson has never impressed me, she has managed to soften her "sexy" image and dive directly into a mean but spirited young woman. <br /> <br /> This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but he was more spiritual than "Devil Wears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman" a great comedy to do with friends.
