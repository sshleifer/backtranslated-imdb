I really enjoyed this movie. The acting of adult actors was great, although I found the main kid a little stiff. But he did very well to be a new talent. The humor is very sublime and not in your face, like most other Hollywood comedies. That is to say. The nutty teacher. If you have a short period of attention and are used to typical Hollywood things, you probably would not want that because the pace is a little slower. I took it on Blu-ray and I must say that the picture quality is excellent. Probably one of the most beautiful Blu-ray discs I've seen so far. The extras were cool too. They removed a bit, but that's probably a good thing, because most deleted scenes did not add anything.
