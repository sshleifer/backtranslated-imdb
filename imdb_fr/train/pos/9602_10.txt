Darius Goes West is a film depicting the American belief that anything is possible if enough effort is made. This very amusing and sometimes heartbreaking movie shows a young man who did not expect, but was anxious to see what was outside his beautiful city of Athens, Georgia. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His longtime friends, Logan, Ben and many other good friends have decided to fulfill Darius' wish. They started modestly - Ben & Logan's mother launched an e-mail campaign to raise awareness about Darius' disease: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and to raise money so friends could take Darius not only to see ocean, but also to discover these great United States. To say that young college buddies have been able to bring hope and awareness of this dreaded disease would be an understatement. They realized the dream of Darius, then some. They put their lives on hold while showing love, care and fun to Darius while helping him understand how he can show the same characteristics to other people with DMD. Darius then volunteered for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair, collecting money (with his friends) in front of a local grocery store. Her beautiful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no one else deserves it anymore. Martha Sweeney.
