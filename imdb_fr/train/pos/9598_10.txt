I followed the trip two years ago on the Internet - now I saw the movie !! What a race! And what a journey to finally know Darius Weems! Such a brave, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a crew! To hear Darius laughing at his presence in the water in Panama City, see his concern about being too close to alligators in Louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he climbed into a hot air balloon, the exhilaration of rafting in some bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and phone calls at home, and as always - the boys will be boys. This film must be seen by everyone, young and old. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. And the crew members are testimonials to the heart of the younger generation. They gave Darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility issues; they took Darius on his journey of life; and they touched many, many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research, this film will contribute to the end goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
