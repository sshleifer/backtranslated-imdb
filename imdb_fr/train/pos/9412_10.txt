When I saw this movie in the 50s, I also wanted to be a scientist. There was something magical and useful in science. I took a girlfriend to see her a second time. I do not think she was as impressed as me! This film was both funny and serious, at a time when synthetic fibers were rather new. The lessons learned from this film could be applied to the problems of today's GMO experimentation.
