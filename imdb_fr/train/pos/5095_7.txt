King's Solomon's Mines presents Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain) who has spent a lot of time in Africa but decides it's time to return to England and become a father for his son. He finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting it with a lot of money for legal action. Then comes Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth) whose father is in Africa and is held by an African tribe for ransom for the card Elizabeth's father sent her. Elizabeth seeks Quatermain to bring her back to Africa in search of her father. <br /> <br /> There are many secondary characters that accompany Quatermain and Elizabeth and, of course, some enemies (Russians) want the card too. <br /> <br /> The film holds your attention until the end. Patrick plays again an honorable man, robust and beautiful, who comes to the rescue of the girl in distress. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily describe passion, loss and despair, the good, quiet good man, anger and strength. In the thoughts of King Solomon, his character smiled a few times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze again in a relaxed and loving life story, in which he does not have to shake his mouth and be so strong. Maybe a little dance would help. But it's a good movie for the whole family and it's worth the time to watch it.
