This is one of the best music concerts we can ever see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was all new and to hear it again today by the original artist is a measure of Sir P Mc's power to fascinate all crowds, regardless of their age. This doc goes behind the scenes to show us life on the road, not only for the group but also for all roadies. I saw this guy live in Australia in 1975 and I can assure you that his performance on this DVD is not inferior to the one he gave almost 30 years ago. I have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that makes this justice and would recommend it to everyone, especially Beatles fans. This is closest to a Beatles concert today. Singer, composer, vocals / rhythmic / bass, piano, ukulele, pure genius. There are few artists who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd in their hands. If you want perfect music, buy a CD recorded in the studio. If you want to hear raw music as it is intended and spontaneous to the crowd, with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd, this DVD is for you.
