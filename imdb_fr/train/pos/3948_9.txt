So, finally, I know that it exists. With the other British contributors here, I saw this on what must have been done, there is only the British projection in the 70's. I remembered the title but I have nowhere when I I mentioned it to people. It's marked me (it's 2 years old), but when you go to bed with the misfortune of your brain and listen to terror, is not that what a TRULY CLASSIC horror movie is? ? I hardly remember the subtleties of the film, but what I remember is my shivering flesh and my high senses. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that it's black and white? Again, if anyone has information on how to get a copy of this information, please contact us ...
