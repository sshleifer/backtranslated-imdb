Although I'm not the biggest fan of martial arts movies based on wirework, when a movie goes fantasy rather than fight, I have a lot more fun and this movie is one of the best in terms Fantastic plot and crazy flight. shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has created an enchanting treat with beautiful performances and a lot of ethereal beauty. The great and tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collecting hero who spends the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a superb fox spirit and a far-fetched Taoist. Cheungs' performance is filled with a naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasantly removed from the role of the Taoist monk, who shows off swordplay and even gets a musical number. Perhaps the best of all is Joey Wang as a fox spirit, really a pleasure to contemplate with every movement and alluring gesture. The film features elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all in a constantly entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung, the direction and handling of the choreography provides sharp wire sensations, and fills the film with mists, shadows and strangely captivating forest colors, giving each forest scene a wonderfully mesmerizing atmosphere. It should also be noted the elaborate hairstyles and beautiful flowing clothes of female characters, with, if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang with hair styled like fox ears at times, a wonderful touch. Although the film has relatively little action and some cheesy pop songs may be misguided, this is a beautiful piece of entertainment, with heroic characters and plotters, even a strange arcade of characters, an almost constant reserve of treats and a dream atmosphere. An ethereal treasure, highly recommended.
