It's a good movie if you look at it in the right context - it was supposed to be a travesty of horror, devilish teen movies (and the 80s saw a lot)! I saw this movie when it came out and I liked it instantly. Being a big fan of KISS, it was great to see Gene in the movie. And nothing with OZZY as a hating preacher can not be quite bad! Plus, Fastway was already one of my favorites and so it was great to hear it on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS cover (pre-DVD) of Trick Or Treat featured an illustration of Sammi kneeling, playing the guitar in a circle of fire under the gaze of a "demon". It was a special order and the price of the VHS copy at the time (around 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the film, but not at this ridiculous price. The 'OZZY-Gene' clutch was created for the $ 5 reissue only. The company that published it probably thought that Gene and OZZY were the only people recognizable in the film, so it was better to put them on the cover! Same thing with the original "Little Shop Of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson stayed there for five minutes, but now they have it on the cover as if he were the main star. <br /> <br /> I have a "Trick Or Treat", and it's amazing how many people think that Sammi Curr is a real person! Fastway helped perpetuate this myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to "Sammi Curr". <br /> <br /> In short, it was just a good rock'n'roll movie. Certainly not to take it too seriously, but just appreciated!
