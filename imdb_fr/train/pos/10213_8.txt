This whimsical film had the misfortune to leave at the same time the very popular "Amelie", both in which the wonderful Audrey Tautou plays the central role. Laurent Firode, the talented director, recently directed one of the most interesting films released in France. <br /> <br /> The film speaks of chance, as its title in English indicates. The French title refers to how butterfly wings can create chaos over the Atlantic when they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something not to believe looking at these colorful insects. From the beginning, the director intertwines all the characters that we see in the film and their link between them, something difficult to imagine, but in the context of the film, it seems to work well. <br /> <br /> A chance meeting at the subway sets the tone for the film. The woman sitting in front of her asks Irene to tell her what her zodiac sign is and starts reading her diary. Irene, it seems, will cross and find his soul mate the same day. After Irene leaves the train, the discreet young man sitting next to the woman tells him that he has the same date of birth as Irene. It seems that they are destined for each other from the beginning, but alas, they will not reconnect before the last image of the film. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou is wonderful like Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have much to do until the end, but he shows that he is present and plays his role well. Young talents make a valuable contribution to the film's success, as light as butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We are looking forward to Laurent Firode's next films because he seems to be a director with the heart in the right place and listening to the way humans are connected.
