There has never been anything like that, for sure. This episodic and seemingly redundant trilogy only makes sense as a whole, and so is not a film about Groovin 'Gary, a transvestite sensation. It is very consciously a film about the director's reaction to Groovin 'Gary. For Harris, the project as a whole is clearly a prolonged and dramatic contortion of guilt and repentance. He tries to redeem his sins - yes, Gary attempted to kill himself after the original document was released - through corrections, comments and conventions, claiming such Hollywood narrative stories as the best friend and the provocative happy ending (two different, with a speaking fit in the Glover version) and use them for one's own purposes. Thus, even if, in thematic terms, there is still a film about gender and difference, its structure makes it a film about MOVIES - but at a level of complexity almost unprecedented. There are so many things going on; by telling and telling this story, Harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row and he does not miss an opportunity to do something about it. Immensely moving and as deep as the camp becomes.
