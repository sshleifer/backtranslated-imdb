Now I had the pleasure of watching Contaminated Man for the first time during his first television appearance in December 2000. <br /> <br /> An infectious disease specialist (William Hurt) loses his family when he an unknown disease settles in him and kills her. . A few years later, he is now in Russia or elsewhere. I do not know exactly where, all I know is that it's happening somewhere in this area. In any case, because of budget cuts in an infectious disease laboratory, they are forced to fire most of their employees. One of them, a dissatisfied security guard named Joseph Muller (played by Peter Weller, better known for his role as indestructible Robocop), goes there and demands that they return his work. He needs this job because he is divorced and needs it to pay child support. So it goes, a fight breaks out and some things are reversed, dangerous things. It was soon discovered that Muller had been infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it's so deadly that a drop of his blood will kill a person in seconds. Soon, the news spreads and the disease expert (Hurt) is called in to investigate and then teams up with an American journalist. Now, Muller is determined to return home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing, even if he must infect the entire Russian population. Now, as I said before, this movie is very much like Falling Down. We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down) who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal even if he has to kill a few people during the process. We then have a character-type hero (Robert Duvall in Falling Down, wounded), both sympathetic and determined to put an end to the antagonist. <br /> <br /> The Tainted Man is actually a very good movie with a good story line and very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
