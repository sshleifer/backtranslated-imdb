It's really a Hollywood Golden Age film, the kind they do not make anymore. It's a unique and fun film that lets you guess what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All actors are perfectly melted and are excellent support actors. It's the first movie I've seen with Ronald Colman and I've been a fan of him ever since. Reginald Gardiner has always been one of my favorite actors and adds a particular quality to every film in which he finds himself. Even though he played a different character here, he still added something that another actor in this character would not have. added.
