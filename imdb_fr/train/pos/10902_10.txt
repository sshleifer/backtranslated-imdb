I was very moved when I watched the movie. How Jonny was able to keep such hope and faith was incredible. so many people only care about what they want and embarrass themselves with everything they do not have. and it's such small things, like chothes, money, a new car. I saw people in tears because of a defect. this film brings everything back to basics. Love, hope for the beauty of the simple but important things in life. This makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really unimportant. you observe this boy and you realize that as long as you have the chance to find food, a roof over your head and dear ones around you. you are truly blessed, and the stop-and-smell saying is truly meaningful. And know that jonny will see it and I want to thank him very much for sharing with me that faith, that strength and that humor. thank you, jonny, i know you're rising above the heavens and bringing a lot of love and laughter over it.
