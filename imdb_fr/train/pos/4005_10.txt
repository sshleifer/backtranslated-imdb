Although, at some point, I thought it was going to turn into The Graduate, I must say that The Mother explains very well the sexual desires of an older woman. <br /> <br /> I am delighted with this result. is a British movie because Hollywood would never have done it, and even if they did, they would have spoiled it by not taking the time to develop the characters. <br /> <br /> The story is revealed slowly and realistically. The acting is superb, the characters are probably imperfect and the dialogue is sensitive. I tried several times to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so the story intrigued me a lot. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And I must admit that I will always look at my mother in a different light!
