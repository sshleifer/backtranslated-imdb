Level one, Horror. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie for the first time at 10, I knew it would give me nightmares. It made. Surprisingly, if I remember correctly, it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that was causing them. <br /> <br /> Level two, psychoanalytic theory. <br /> <br /> Later, in adulthood, I saw the story of what it was: And if the wild and unbridled instincts we repress all would become manifest. <br /> <br /> Third level, pure science fiction. <br /> <br /> the plot "What if" is through the genre of science fiction. It's pure science fiction, not the "cowboys of space" that make the genre today. <br /> <br /> After 43 years, Forbidden Planet remains the biggest sci-fi movie. If you are planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, be careful!
