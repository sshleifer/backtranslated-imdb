Late in the night, on a deserted road, in an empty room, Martin Sheen films a thread for Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and friends in search of a group of murderous cattle thieves who killed some men and kidnapped the girl from Cassidy. <br /> <writer / director Christopher Coppola Perhaps he has suffered the wrath of William Boyd's purists by daring to make a modern, low-budget film starring their beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad that he did it! No character should be so tied to an actor that no one else is allowed to play it again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was fun and it was interesting to update the classic programmers of the thirties and forties. Even if he is guilty of bad behavior, it is quite serious and unpretentious, which makes me hard not to love. <br /> <br /> The whole production is a little strange, but I really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we are looking at a story in a story makes quirks and exaggerations more acceptable.
