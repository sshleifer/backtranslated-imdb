Titanic must be one of my favorite movies of all time. This has its problems (what movies do not do) but still, it's nice. <br /> <br /> When I come across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I guess my first reaction is "wait a minute, do not you?" I know so many people who do not like this film and I'm not saying that I do not see why. "The love story is too old-fashioned" and well, yes but is not it nice and moving? Okay, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that such love does not really exist. But this is a movie, does not everyone like watching a beautiful story that allows us to slip into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Okay, in this movie, I agree that they do not work at their potential. However, I think it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors. Personally, I think they are two very talented actors who are unfortunately very famous for a film in which they are not incredible. But the roles that are assigned to them are simple and the characters seem real enough so that you can worry about them a little, but I agree with a lot of people that they did not do as well as expected. <br /> <br /> And finally, if we complain about not loving this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry but why on earth did they go to see a movie that is so clearly all these things. It's like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Just to be a movie, not because you do not like the genre, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> He deserves his Oscars, especially the Best Photography, which I think is the best I've ever seen. seen in a movie except perhaps the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br /> <br /> I know that some of the scriptures fail, such as the incessant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie. The flashback part of the story can sometimes be quite weak, but overall, it's an incredible achievement to make the Titanic so real, and the sinking is so epic. <br /> <br /> I understand why many people do not like this film, but most of the time, it's up to them not to like the basic idea, such as it's a love story, rather than thinking that the film itself is poorly constructed. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I have read more than five books on the Titanic, including memoirs of the day it happened, and that this film is extremely accurate historically, except for a few errors. The only main thing I can find is that the pipework must be threaded copper, not steel, and that the iceberg seems pretty unrealistic, just like the scene where they hit it. <br /> <br /> I give this film 10/10, not because I love love films, but simply because it is an exceptional film production, which leaves horror of the realistic adaptation of events.
