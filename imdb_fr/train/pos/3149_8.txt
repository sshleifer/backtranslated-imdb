Not since The Simpsons debuted, there was a sitcom that I did not want to shoot in less than 2 minutes. It was of course said that the Simpsons killed the sitcom. Not that one though. <br /> <br /> The first season was so dark that the teenage characters were not as outrageous as they later became. They even went to school sometimes. The following seasons, the character flew away. Eric, the sarcastic jerk, Donna, his girlfriend, Kelso, the dimmed bulb, Hyde, the conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, Fez, the perverse exchange student and finally Jackie, the rich babe. As for the adult characters, there was Eric's mother, the suburban mom, Eric's dad, the right arrow who, of course, was not a donkey as hard as he was. Donna's clumsy dad and his silly blonde. mum. Everyone is loyal to his characters, but special congratulations to Kurtwood Smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and makes his Red Forman quite likeable without making us vomit with unexpected kindness. <br /> Topher Grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good. This is a difficult character to play because it does not allow the actor to engage in a wild over-action as the character of Kelso, skillfully played by Ashton Kutcher. I liked to see the two characters interact because they are very different from each other. <br /> <br /> The character of Hyde is a bit more difficult to appreciate because it is more realistic and we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time, Although I will say that the scriptwriters have concocted a brilliant story in recent seasons. <br /> <br /> Jackie, sung by Family Guy, Mila Kunis, is hilarious and has nails on a blackboard. voice, which really corresponds to his character. The only sad thing is that we did not see more scenes with her and Eric because they were ...... hilarious together. Too many stories have been lost about her relationship problems since we already had with Eric and Donna. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will say that the cast of guest actors has always been excellent. Some favorites: the gigantic girlfriend of Fez in mid-season, pastor Dan, the all-powerful brilliant Leo interpreted by the equally great Thomas Chong, another friend of Fez totally certifiable and a special appearance of the teenage witch Sabrina as a slutty Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> Coming up next on Fox, whatever.
