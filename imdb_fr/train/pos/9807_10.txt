I remember so well from this series. It was excellent - characters so strong and fascinating, elegant and sexy ... and so different from all the rest of the offer at the time - and now ... I'm sure that inspired the great drama Canadian "Traders". <br /> <br /> Seasons 1 and 2 are available on DVD Region 2 in the UK. It's a treat to see the show again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 counts 13 episodes and season 2 seems to count 10. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to have ended after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was very funny. <br /> <br /> You can sometimes get it on Amazon.co.uk
