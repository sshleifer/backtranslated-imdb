Ahh, Talespin! What can I say that has not already been said about this great show? Nothing! This is without a doubt one of the best written shows I have ever seen, live-action or animation. The novelties are far too stupid for me and some of the "mature" things that I have to chase children out of the room. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> The stories are engaging and very plausible. Some of them could even be lying down for an hour or two for a movie. Episodes like Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream are very dramatic while still being fun for kids and adults. Then there are episodes of pure comedy such as The Blue of Baloo Bloods and Stuck on You, where the emphasis is on hilarity. I can laugh at tears in a few choices. <br /> <br /> The dramatic aspect is very insufficient in most series (at least, those that are not especially), especially in cartoons. In the Stormy Weather episode, for example, Kit Cloudkicker decides to join an air circus, but Baloo thinks it would be too dangerous. In the biggest fight of the episode, Baloo yells at Kit to stay away from Daring Dan, which Kit screams, "NO, you can not tell me what to do!" YOUR'RE * NOT * * MY * * DAD *!" and buries his face in his pillow. The next day, he leaves for the circus air. This kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon and would be welcome in those created today. <br /> <br /> The characters have a lot of depth. Baloo is pretty much what it is in The Jungle Book, more or less a few degrees of laziness. Rebecca is a sneaky businesswoman whose ideas for making money, although theoretically good, are rarely good in practice. Molly is a cute little girl, but you can not be fooled. It can be a real hell sometimes. Cloudkicker Kit is a darker character than others. He does not trust adults much unless they attract him, and he tends to break off relations. Observe his expression in Plunder and Lightning when he grabs the hook: he seems to be ready to make him look like a pirate. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that make this show the number 1 of my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost father and son. This is well demonstrated in All Whale That Ends Whale when Kit Baloo considers that Seymour is abusing animals in his aquarium instead of siding with other adults. The relationship between Baloo and Becky is also realistic because Baloo is motivated by wanting to buy the old Sea Duck, but not necessarily by wanting to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he recovered the duck, he would continue to work for Rebecca. <br /> <br /> The Sea Duck, not to mention all the other aircraft in the series, is rather realistic. The functions of the plane do not change once in the series (continuity is difficult to find as well), and unlike most "super planes" other cartoons, there is not a single weapon to board (unless you count mangoes!), and relies instead on the great skill of the cunning pilot to get out of trouble. It's hard to think of a hero's vehicle that does not have a turret, a laser cannon, or even a handgun somewhere on board. And the fact that they use their head to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays. Plus, it's such a cool design! <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best cartoon. Already. Period. Really worth the ten stars!
