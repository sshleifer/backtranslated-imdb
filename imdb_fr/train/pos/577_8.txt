This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The video is extraordinary, fascinating sometimes. He also received an Oscar for Best Photography, and rightly so. There are a lot of movies in my collection of movies and many others that I've seen apart, and few of them are as beautiful and as well shot as this one. <br /> <br /> It's unique and awesome. movie. The casting is great and does a great job in describing their characters. We follow their destinies with devotion and we attach a lot of emotion. Along the way, we also learn about ourselves and our lives. I think a lot about this film for what it represents and how it presents it. I highly recommend it
