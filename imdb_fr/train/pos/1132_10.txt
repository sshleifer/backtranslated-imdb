His Hollywood imitating the soap operas Daytiem to perfection! This is the pleasure we never see. Great characters and big lines. Whoopi is hilarious ..... Sally Field is so extraordinary .... Gary Marshall's lines are a riot .... that's what I like in good comedies. Never afraid to make fun of themselves !!!!!! The decorations were great ... wardrobe was on point and the dagger "Montana Morehead" was a diabolical delight. Terri Hatcher in the role of "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but it was still beautiful and funny on the screen. I would like to know how the idea of ​​this film was born. I have never seen a group of people having so much fun doing comedy! Soapdish is a must have and I'm waiting for the DVD !!!
