Not sure that we can call it an anti-war film, it shows the war at an elite level. They are elite troops who know what they are doing and take great pride in it. Even when they are pacifists, they still appreciate the level of skill and defeat their enemies, even if it goes against the fact that he is pacifist. The films are slow and rather simple, and in many ways they are more tamed than war films, as the current norm is, no part of the body flying away like in modern movies. It's brutal in other ways while you see killing on a personal level. It's more a movie of thinking man. Once you start watching, you do not want to miss anything. It is the thoughts of the film's men and their interactions that make up the film, not the fight itself or an exciting storyline. This may be what is called a war witness. <br /> <br /> If you like war, if you like to read or see programs on the SAS, etc., YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS FILM! <br /> <br /> Similar films are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941) with a cast of stars, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. All are unusual and show the war on a personal level. Enjoy!
