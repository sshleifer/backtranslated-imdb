I just realized that I've been using IMDb for years and never saw my favorite movie again. By favorite, I do not want to say something that I like for the moment, I mean that this film is so supernaturally perfect that there will be no more animated experience that can touch it. This is obvious because I will never be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 years old, that is, the age group that this film is for. I am also a man, the genre for which this film is intended (the overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's protagonists are women). As a result, this film has indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and I am indebted to Carl Macek (Spanish?) For producing the English dubbing of this film, which is far superior to the production of Di nyyy, this who is not even funny. able to watch this one - of course, the only way to caption it is finally Macek's version is SO GOOD (the voices almost exactly match the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It is not available on any distribution in an English speaking country. Go understand. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of competent critics, so I will ask you a few anecdotes here, without me being the definitive archive of information on this film. <br /> <br /> First, I agree with the reviewer who said it took 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films. They are so much in their own league that they make almost the entire catalog on IMDb, which makes it insignificant. <br /> <br /> The fascinating story of this film is that Miyazaki based the countryside around the Slag ravine (Pazu urban area) on Welsh mining communities. He went to Wales for a few months in the early 1980s (perhaps in the late 1970s) just after one of the big mining strikes. As a fervent supporter of the socialist student movements of the sixties, he felt the fate. The fight between city-dwellers and pirates at first serves to illustrate this empathy with the worker. The campaign and the clouds, especially in this film, remind me of where I grew up, his film portraying a fantasy version of the rolling hills of the west-central British Isles. <br /> <br /> The island is of course the satirical genius of Swift. eighteenth century novel - the story of Swift's book is deliberately ridiculous. In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel. I also think that the architecture is based on Peruvian ruins although I'm not sure, someone told me. <br /> <br /> All those who express themselves in reading this review and who love this film will REALLY want to discover Miyazaki's epic series, Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the short novel of science- 'The Incredible Tide' fiction by Alexander key (novel available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Pazu and Shita of Laputa. Plus, you may not know his previous work for Masterpiece Theater - some of his keyframe animations. He also made keyframes for Sherlock Hound, which has some of the best backgrounds I've ever seen. Also take a look at Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature, Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) - amazing by today's standards. What else ... Left cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - though they are rather rare. <br /> <br /> This film is such a gift that I do not know what we would do without it this other shit that tells stories, it's like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!
