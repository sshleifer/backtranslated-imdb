I thought the children in the series were doing a great job. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Emma's character. Good game! The waterfalls were pretty good for a low-budget show. I was able to follow the film and enjoy it without having to watch my watch every 5 minutes. I enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and its fire. The ghostly appearances of the souls of the liberated children were equally good. Another positive point of the film is that it has continued to advance. There were not many slow scenes. The main roles of adults were also credible and therefore helped to entertain the show. All in all, a nice night of watching movies
