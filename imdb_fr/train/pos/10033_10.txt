The Titanic movie is much more than just a "memorable night". This is a tragic historical event that will always be talked about and never forgotten. Why so criticized? I have no idea. Could they / could they ever make a movie like Titanic so moving and touching every time you look at it? Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director probably had a major impact on the film. A simple disaster movie (boring to watch) converted into an incredible romance. Yes, I'm not Romance either, but that should not bother you, because you'll never see such romance. Guaranteed! Everything with amazing effects, music, sublime game. <br /> <br /> The film creates an incredible visual and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and live. The legend itself "TITANIC" is brilliantly represented in all classes, also looks, also accommodation. The acting game was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best to play their roles. Nobody could have done better. They are partly why the movie is so big. <br /> <br /> I guess that's not talking too much. The plot is simple, the acting is brilliant, based on a true story, probably more than half of the consumers who watch the film will share tears, thanks to an unimaginable end that can never be forgotten. Well, if you have not seen this movie, you've forgotten something about Hesterical, and a movie that idolizes Hollywood. Could he get better? Not at all. The most moving film of all time, do not listen to people, see for yourself, then you will understand. A landmark. (do not be surprised if you cry too)
