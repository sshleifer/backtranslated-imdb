8 Simple Rules is a fun program, but it also contains some life lessons, including a mature lesson about moving on after a loss, namely the episode of Paul's death, first episode I never seen in the series broadcast on ABC. The Hennessy-Cate Clan (Katey Sagal), her daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and her son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - consult for advice and support after Paul's death (John Ritter ). ), the patriarch of the family. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) lend a helping hand. I'm happy that later in the second season of this show, they decided to put David Spade on this show since he had finished the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But this whole show is pretty good. This show reminds me a lot of the classic sitcoms of the 80s and 90s family that were on ABC.
