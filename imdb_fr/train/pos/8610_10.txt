Diane Keaton gave a remarkable performance in this rather sad but amusing story that involved a lot of young people and their very dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "The Family Stone", 05, who had a unique daughter and loved her beyond words can describe. She always called him and said, "Rendez-vous Dorothy", an expression used in the "Wizard of Oz" of 1939. A car accident occurs suddenly and Natalie gets deeply involved with friends and lovers of her daughter . As Natalie investigates, she discovers more truths about herself and her real relationship with her daughter. Excellent film to see and appreciate, especially all the good actors of all actors.
