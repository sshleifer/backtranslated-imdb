After growing up in the steep alleys of Detroit, Michigan, and having friends traveling to New York for dances, I fell into the lifestyle of a member of the House of Representatives. I joined the House of Theieves. We adapted the same rules as most houses, but we were professional crooks who stimulated and committed credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewelry and clothing we wanted. I even learned how to make checks and a driver's license and cash them in more than seventeen states, until a jealous queen calls the secret service and sends me to a federal prison. But, I learned a lot from these queens in this film and I highly recommend you watch it yourself. You can even read how I grew up in Detroit homes and the criminal activity we did. My book, Identity Schemes, is available for sale on Amazon dot com or Identity Schemes dot com. But believe me, it's a lot better than Paris is Burning because it's a 2005 brand.
