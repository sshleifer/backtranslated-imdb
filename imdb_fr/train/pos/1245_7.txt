Every time I see most critics, it's called "a firefight for Eddie Murphy." These critics want to take a look at some of his current projects and perhaps soften their attitude retrospectively ... "The Golden Child" is not a state-of-the-art entertainment, but thanks to some actors, it breathes new life into old clich√©s and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I do not understand at all the general lack of love for his efforts. Perhaps it was published at a time when the establishment was fed up with frenzied, thrilling adventures? Steven Spielberg started with Indiana Jones; it is unfair to make him a scapegoat when what is probably his greatest sin is also totally harmless. There is nothing wrong with wanting to capitalize on trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, but even a casual observer should be able to understand that "ridiculous" is the beginning of Hollywood's conception of mysticism. What is more important than credibility with a story like this is that the public has fun guides on hand to show them the mysteries of the scene. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy performed well for this ability. I advise you to buy the ticket and make the trip.
