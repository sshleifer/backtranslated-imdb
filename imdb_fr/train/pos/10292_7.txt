Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Carrey. Although I admit that I have not seen all his movies * cough * magic cough *. Bruce Almighty was nice. None of the other critics really explained how bad it gets to the end, I do not know what the writers thought. Somehow, I could not help thinking that this movie was a bad attempt to recreate Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> Positive, Steve Correl of The Daily Show is HILAIRE, as is the rest of the cast. See Bruce Almighty if you are a big fan of Jim Carrey or if you just want to see a funny comedy (that the piano is sweet).
