CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" type kittens who embark on a strange journey in life after death, where anything can happen and happen. This astonishing Asian short film does not use dialogue and replaces the word balloon. There is no way to describe this cartoon except tell you to see it for yourself. And make sure there is no less than 10 years in the room. Mutilations, cannibalism, cruelty, savagery, sudden death and total disregard for others are recurring themes. Honest. The most striking image is perhaps that of an elephant composed of water in which the kittens swim and which overlaps it. But like most of the rest of the film, this picaresque and ridiculous interlude is drawing to a close.
