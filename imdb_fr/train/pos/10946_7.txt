Do not listen to critical critics who are probably bitter players and still have the headache of Silverman's torrefaction at the Spike TV Video Awards Awards a few months ago. fits pretty well in an adult swimming line. If Silverman dims the doody juicy jokes and focuses on the darker, darker current on which the show is so far, we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancellation of "Strangers" With Candy ". But just watching the pilot is a dark comedy / comedy shifted, solid, without exception, but with huge potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman has created a hilarious child-woman of a character - a prettier, younger version of the late Jewish American princess Jerri Blank, and the show features one of the most the most unconventional and non-stereotypical of a gay couple I've ever seen on television. Early critics suggest that the next episodes outperform the pilot, so I can not wait to see how this show unfolds.
