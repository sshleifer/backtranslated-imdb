Me of Irish origin, I love this film. Not only was the guy funny and funny, but he was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl he had fallen in love with too, she was pretty. They were such a cute couple. The end was so sad. I love that movie! Although it's a little dirty, it's reminiscent of a British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie, you should watch premium. Same story as young men like older women, older women younger. Many paths intersect, in the end, the best decision is made or the task is over. I have nothing else to say, without ruining the whole movie, but I thought French was ugly, less attractive to me. Uh ... if you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Circle of Friends", this movie is so good. Quick quote, you might not have to unless you look "well, it's my ruined dinner." LOL
