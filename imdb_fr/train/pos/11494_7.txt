The Unborn is a production of Roger Corman and as such is nasty and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, watch this movie because it is full of preggo murders and abortion failures. Brooke Adams plays the role of Virginia. She and her husband go to a sophisticated fertilization clinic because they can not have children alone. They meet Dr. Meyerling (James Karen of ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr. Meyerling had a very high success rate with regard to couple pregnancy. (Insert a joke here.) Is it because he's creating supermutant genetic killer babies? That's what Virginia starts to think when she starts having strange side effects and an extreme mood of treatment. That's when she starts to take things in hand. <br /> <br /> On this one, you will have to get the rest of the details elsewhere because, if I told you all the benefits that this one has caused you could hurt you put it too quickly on your queue. Waiting Netflix. It's a little slow for a moment, but once the system is recovering in the last third, all systems are running! Very strongly recommended by me about the strengths of his non PC fetal violence. 33 1/2 out of seventeen stars.
