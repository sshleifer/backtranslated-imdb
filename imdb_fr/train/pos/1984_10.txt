One of the most beautiful musicals, timeless and worth seeing. Delicious! The cast of actors, including Ron Moody as Fagin, is superb. The costumes are exquisite .... even the shabby ones. <br /> <br /> The two young boys who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are incredibly talented. Oliver Reed does a great job in describing Bill Sykes to a place where you can not help but hope he comes to a terrible end ... what he does. <br /> <br /> The dance is intelligently choreographed and hypnotizing. Oliver can cope with My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. A movie for the whole family.
