One of the smartest serial killer movies in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative vision of the past and the story of one of the most notorious serial killers. The filmmakers create an unexpected glimpse into the pathology of this mysterious murderer and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to know more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not crazy at all but very methodical and self-promoting. The director plays here the expectations of the viewer and achieves it. The film is built as a mystery of murder, or a thriller in the "cold breaks". This is an intelligent horror film inspired by investigations and procedures that will deter hunting dogs in search of thrills. <br /> <br /> Some people do not like movies shot on video. This attitude is very old and provincial. It is an attitude and vision of the film that places technical issues above the value of entertainment or artistic value. These attitudes are disappearing. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget movie, no doubt, but insightful viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully crafted gem.
