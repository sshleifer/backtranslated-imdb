"I did not want it to get complicated, Leese, I have to assume she's going to read that." Fear takes flight at 30,000 feet in this tense action thriller. A night flight to Miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her mate (Cillian Murphy) is planning to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot. As the minutes pass, she is in a race against time to warn potential victims before it's too late. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons I love this film is the chemistry that separates the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my favorite actors. For example, the first scenes at the airport look more like a romantic comedy: two people meet constantly ... I must give it to him also for making a film like this one. In particular, the character of Murphy ... Jackson who seems really complicated in his manner of acting in a charming and innocent way, and yet he tries to do his job and make sure that Lisa feels trapped physically and mentally . I mean, in some areas, he really seems to be worried about Lisa. <br /> <br /> A sensational journey all along. I would hate a lot of movies seeing a pre-sequence or a sequel, but in reality, I would not mind a pre-sequence of it, which would take place under Jackson's control. The favorite scene is probably this scene, because it was so unexpected. There was also this beautiful accumulation at the famous "pen" scene. When will she move it? There was also this beautiful change in Lisa from McAdam, where she went from a victim to a riposte. I also loved the scene where she sits in the food court and pretends to ask ladies for a food court survey. What was Murphy's strength with all his blood .....
