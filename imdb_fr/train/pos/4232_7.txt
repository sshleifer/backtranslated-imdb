During my 60s, I learned that when we watch a movie, there is an identification (whether we like it or not) implicit with a specific character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the character performs certain gestures. , sometimes because the character speaks determined word, or phrase ?? we use or would like to use? in a given situation. <br /> <br /> The film in question must be considered from this point of view. Who now finds a parking space? in a mall, in the city center or in the street - taken by a car whose driver does not remember to think that he is not the only driver in the world? <br /> <br /> Who does not want to "rubber" the poorly bred fang? <br /> <br /> Haven says I ask: - Did you identify yourself with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)? If your answer is: YES !, then try not to find absurd details ?? compared to the reality of life? in the movie, because you will certainly find the movie ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The abstractions done, you will see that the film has moments of surprise, such as: 1- In the sequence in which Della grabs the box of tools in the trunk (does this box contain a firearm and she has the courage to use it?); 2- In the sequence in which Terry dies while falling; 3- In the sequence in which Della is attracted by Chuckie's "siren call". <br /> <br /> If you have ever seen the film, or if you plan to see it, keep in mind that there are "realistic" films, "fiction films", "political" films and movies in which you can "wash your soul" ?? To illustrate this last example, we can quote: "Tropa de Elite". <br /> <br /> According to the newspaper, applause was unanimous when BOPE officials adopted certain attitudes. (As I saw the movie on DVD, I could not know the reaction of the audience) ?? <br /> <br /> Regarding the staged part (Susan Monford), the interpretations (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc.) Edition (William M. Anderson's Society of Dead Poets) ',' Green Card 'is an exceptional edition,' Robocop 2 ', etc. It is well placed in context and on a scale of 1 (Awful) to 10 (Master Piece), I note "When she was outside" a 7 (regular).
