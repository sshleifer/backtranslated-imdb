This film is a wonderfully simplistic work. Pleasant from beginning to end, it is both sad and edifying. Miranda Otto's interpretations (oh, how much she deserves more recognition!) And George del Hoya are beautiful and almost painful to watch, while the two tortured souls understand each other. The support distribution of the Dead Letter Office workers is wonderful, as is Alice's boyfriend, who has been suffering for a long time and for whom I could not help being a little sorry. There is one scene in particular that I could watch over and over again (and I have!), It's such a shame that films like these are not recognized and so they are more seen by the public. so that more people can enjoy it. I cried, I laughed and I sighed. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
