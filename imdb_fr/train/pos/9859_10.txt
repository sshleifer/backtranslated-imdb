The Ice Age is not just the animation of the year (to me), it's also the best animated feature I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The teaser excited me last year and I spent many happy hours at the website. Scrat it's cool! And the rest of Sub Zero's heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is superb. Your heart really goes to the characters in this movie. They have good lines of dialogue and are well developed. It's hard to say which one really steals the photo. <br /> <br /> I lived their journey with bursts of laughter, tears and wonder. Nothing was forced or finished. The emotion was real, especially in the dramatic second semester. Anastasia, in 1997, is also a production of Fox. And before that, it was The Land Before Time 1988. All have a real charm and seek to entertain all the public, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
