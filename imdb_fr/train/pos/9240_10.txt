Found this movie in a video store, it cost $ 2 to buy. All the movie stinks really bad! The so-called colonel, who would be the hero here if we could have trusted the cover, must be in his eighties and barely able to walk. He manages to shoot some of the stupidest ninjas in the world. Then the story leaves the colonel, which makes sense given the old man's inability to do something worth mentioning. Two terribly old guys from the 80s take over, in what must be a kind of story. I lost myself a hundred times but it did not bother me, because the film is so bad that it's really fun to watch. Zero budget trash with actors not deserving that name. Go check it out!
