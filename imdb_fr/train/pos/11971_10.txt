I think the comments on the nerdy show are a little too exaggerated. When a person comes to watch a television show, what is she looking for? It is for fun that he watches a show, unless he is a critic or a person who analyzes a story. But most of us are not, and we watch shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is a great show to watch after a busy day at the office / school. That makes you laugh and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If such a family existed in the real world, it would be a model to follow. But this is a TV show and not a real family. There is nothing wrong with portraying a hypothetical family on television. The fact that the series lasted so long shows that people liked to watch it, no matter what comments we will make later. <br /> <br /> Another positive point of the series is that anyone, regardless of their age, would not only enjoy watching it, but would pick up a message as childish as this message is. Jesse's discussions with Michelle are extremely touching. If you do not consider them children, <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say that, after watching every show of Full House, there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.
