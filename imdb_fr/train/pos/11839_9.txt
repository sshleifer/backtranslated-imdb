This movie was very funny. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive, Brian Adams also composed all the songs in French. The score is equally uplifting and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The film is composed of a mixture of traditional animation, associated with computer-generated images. The result is really beautiful. I watch this film at least once a week with my children and we do not get tired. The story is compelling and well told. <br /> <br /> I do not understand anyone who would classify this film in the under 7 category. Definitely a caretaker in my home.
