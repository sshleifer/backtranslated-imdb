This video is so much fun that it makes all the rest <br /> <br /> of Eddie Murphy very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, who will show you how good it is). To be honest, I do not think I've ever <br /> <br /> laughed at anything so much, including Naked Gun and Bargearse, which is rarely seen. This show is amazing, although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word starting with F, four letters long (plus its extended version starting with M), but that did not bother me. See, it's the funniest thing I've ever seen and probably the funniest thing you've ever had too.
