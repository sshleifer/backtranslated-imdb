In the 1940s, when films covered topics that were not yet accepted in a "polite" society, they resorted to codes supposed to float above most viewers while warning those who knew about them. what was happening. Probably no film of the decade has been as rich in innuendo as the strangely obscure Desert Fury Desert, located in a small game oasis called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert. The surprising Mary Astor, in pants and carrying a cigarette holder, is the owner of the Purple Sage Room and Casino. In town, his granddaughter, Lizabeth Scott, has $ 20 million in Technicolor. But listen to the dialogue between them, which suggests an older lesbian and her restless young companion (one can only wonder if the original scenario of A.I. Bezzerides made this relationship explicit). John Hodiak gangster and Wendell Corey incredibly jealous torpedo are even more blatant. Add Burt Lancaster as Sheriff of the city, shuffle and sit down. Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fall in love with Scott. It seems, however, that Hodiak not only has a past with Astor, but also a woman who died in suspicious circumstances. The desert sun warms these ingredients to full boiling, with many slaps in the face and empurpled exchanges. Do not miss this greenhouse melodrama, full of frightening exotic flowers, if that happens to you; it's a remarkable film.
