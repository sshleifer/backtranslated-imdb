THE CONVEYORS WAIT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt that I will see a better one this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage takes place in the industrial wastelands of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) For him. To do this, the son must break the record opening doors. What the father really wants his son to be someone, because he himself never did it later as a local news reporter for a newspaper ironically called L'Espoir. Of course, nothing is going as planned. This film can be compared to Aki Kaurismäki's film DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and the humor is darker. As in this film, however, the tone is more melancholy than depressing and the ending optimistic without being unrealistic. The humor is absurd, without making the plot incredible, and Marriage finds breathtaking images in empty sets that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is Poelvoorde's comedy. This actor became famous with the brilliant cult classic THIS IS ARRIVING NEAR YOU, in which he played the charismatic hitman Ben. Since then, he has only played two small roles in films that did not come out in the Netherlands because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his acting abilities and all the roles that were offered to him were covers of Ben's character. With his return to a leading role in LCA, there should be no doubt about his role. He is simply brilliant as a man stupid enough and unkind to put his family in misery, but smart enough to realize what he did and be torn by remorse about it. A must see.
