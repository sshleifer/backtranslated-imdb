The film tells the story of teenage girls who tried to sneak into the stadium to attend the last qualifying match for the World Cup in Tehran, which could lead Iran to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The law prohibits Iranian women from going to the stadium, although many of them dress like boys and sneak into it. Stadium guards search each person at the entrance to make sure no one is wearing fireworks and of course; No girl comes in. <br /> <br /> Like most of Panahi's works, the performance of his frame is superb. You actually think that you are watching a documentary. The dialogues between the girls and the soldiers were executed delicately and surprisingly credible. The film describes the interactions between captives and police guards who are themselves obligatorily serving away from family and friends in a fun way. In the end, the public realizes that there is no such difference between girls and guards who just follow orders.
