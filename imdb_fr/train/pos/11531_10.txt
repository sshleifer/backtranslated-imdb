I remember being a kid when I first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's why I still remember some parts). I do not remember much acting, nude scenes, or anything else, but I remember a man with his head exploded with a grenade, a dismembered man on a tree, and a man crushed by a truck and shot with a head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene where Jennifer McAllister tore up the murderous stomach to get the keys of the truck. It's a movie that gives you creep and it's worth a look. But where do I find it? How can I download it?
