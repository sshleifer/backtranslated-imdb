If there ever was an inspiring story that could lead anyone, handicapped or not, to persevere despite the difficulties and to do it (even when "doing it" as an appropriate expression can have a wide margin that is a personal ultimate truth), It's my left foot. It's a hard-to-see film at times: seeing the less placid aspects of Christy Brown's personality emerge in two key scenes - one when her sister declares herself pregnant and about to be married when her father reacts badly, and when dinner when the woman who extended her hand, made her able to communicate effectively, announced at a key moment (the inauguration of Brown's art) that she was on the verge of to marry another man - is difficult. Very, very difficult. Especially since he is a man who can not react to these events and can only express himself in the way he knows how to do it: through cries, screams and profanations to hurt himself . However, it is not a story of heartbreak and family dysfunction, even when there is a part that provides the autobiographical story, but that of a man overcoming his serious disability, becoming a functional human being and a partisan force in the world. world of art. Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful and unforgettable performance as Christy Brown, an imperfect but tenacious woman, and Brenda Fricker also for her supportive role as a strong mother of Brown.
