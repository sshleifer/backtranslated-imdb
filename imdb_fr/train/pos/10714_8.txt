The Scots excel in storytelling. The traditional genre. Several years after the event, I can still see in my mind an elderly lady, my friend's mother, recounting the Battle of Culloden. She gives life to the characters. His passion is that of an eyewitness. One of the events on the soggy swell one kilometer from her home. <br /> <br /> Of course, it happened many years before her birth, but you can not guess how she tells it. The same story is told in the bars of Scotland. As I discussed with a friend one evening in Mallaig, a local went out of their way to give his version. The discussion continued until the closing time. <br /> <br /> The stories thus transmitted become an integral part of our being. Who does not remember the stories our parents told us when we were kids? They become our invisible world. And, as they age, they may still serve as inspiration or as a reservoir of emotions. Facts and fiction mingle with aspiration, with models. Warning stories. Archetypes. Magic and mystery. <br /> <br /> "My name is Aonghas, like my grandfather and his grandfather before him." Our protagonist introduces himself to us. And also introduces the story that goes back through the generations. He produces stories in the stories. Stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of Scotland, its rugged mountains shrouded in mists. The substance of the legend. Yet Seach'd is rooted in reality. That's what gives it its special charm. Its beauty and authenticity are tempered by the most beautiful Gaelic songs ever heard. <br /> <br /> Aonghas (Angus) visits his grandfather at the hospital shortly before his death. He is burning with frustration. Part of him aspires to be in the 21st century, hanging out in Glasgow. But it is high on the west coast in a Gaelic-speaking community. <br /> <br /> Yet there is a deeper conflict in him. He longs to know the truth. The truth behind the old stories of his grandfather. Where does the fiction end? And he wants to know the truth about the death of his parents. <br /> <br /> He is brought to make one last fateful trip, at the top of one of the most inaccessible mountains of Scotland. Can we tell the truth? Or is everything in the stories? <br /> <br /> In this history of stories, we revisit the bloody battles, the poisoned lovers, the old folklore and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth. In doing so, we are all in touch with Angus, who lives the story of his own life. <br /> <br /> Seachd: The Inaccessible Pinnacle is probably the most honest, unpretentious and beautiful film ever made in Scotland. Like Angus, I am a little annoyed by the pretext of hanging stories on other stories. But, like Angus too, I forgave that once I saw the "bigger picture". Forget the pastiche at the box office of Braveheart and his ilk. You could even give up the rightfully famous dramatization of The Wicker Man. To see a movie true to Scotland, this one is probably unique. If you think about it enough, you could even re-evaluate the power of storytelling and the age-old question of whether there are truths that can not be said but only experienced.
