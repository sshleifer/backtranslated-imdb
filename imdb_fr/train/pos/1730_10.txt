This discreet and unknown jewel tells the true story of a prisoner of war escape during the Second World War. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works at different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literal. The dialogue is ingenious and sounds very real. In fact, an unusual authenticity as a whole places this one above most epics of war.
