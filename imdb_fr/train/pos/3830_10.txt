The first time my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie, we watched it for Alex Winter's "Bill & Ted's" fame. We did not know what to expect except to know who and what it was. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, we knew it was love at first sight. This film, although not quite accurate historically, was and remains the best of its kind. I have seen other films describing the history of this famous summer and, in my opinion, no other can compare. There was some detail on certain points, but these parts did not take away the elegance and romance of the story. I have seen other movies on this summer and I find that most of them are good, but none as captivating as this one. <br /> <br /> "Haunted summer" has the qualities of a painting. The colors and decorations seem to be what one could find on a framed canvas and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's house. The costumes were beautiful and, although not the most comfortable clothes in the world, I wanted to find a seamstress to create such a garment. The entire film was shot on the picturesque Lake Geneva (where I hope to see this film one day) and the serenity that these historical figures found there. <br /> <br /> This film shows, in addition to the tranquility found by all escaped severe judgments of England, the strangeness that also surrounded this adventure. Yes, there were drugs. It was a fairly common practice at that time, a time when drugs were not illegal. And taking laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was both medicinal and recreational. Shelley suffered from consumption. Lord Byron suffered pains of a clubbed foot. It was not surprising that there were powerful drug prescriptions that were in their possession this summer. And they were poets at a time when experience was the key. There was no time for prudish prudence. Passion and experience have been a big part of the romantic era. And thoughts and discussions on science, religion and philosophy came about creating a legend: "Frankenstein". <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (not married to Shelley at this time) played by the beautiful and talented Alice Krige. She is the controlling factor of everything that happens until she also gives in to experience. But she stays firm and does things her way. Like the strength she inherited from her father and mother. <br /> <br /> Actors and actresses were perfect for the roles they played. The editing of the music. Management has captured the essence of the summer, as I read about it. This film was based on a wonderful book "Haunted Summer" by Anne Edwards. If you like this movie, read the book. The author draws the story of what she was able to put together in the diaries of Mary Godwin Shelley and other participants in this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves history (even small inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and gothic, then this is a movie for you. It shows the birth of the monster's birth, which still teaches us today the morality of "playing God." <br /> <br /> A movie to see absolutely!
