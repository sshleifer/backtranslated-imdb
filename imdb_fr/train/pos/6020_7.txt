A new beautiful copy of "Zabriskie Point" is underway in Paris and seems to be well worn in the Latin Quarter. It's time to do a full evaluation of the film. Let's hope the new print means that a DVD containing insightful "extras" will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember watching ZP when he came out and I thought it was a boring thing. This time, I was totally amazed and would classify it as a "near-miss" masterpiece. The first part of the film is a time capsule from the late 60's in Los Angeles. I lived there at the time and Antonioni perfectly managed to capture the essence of the place. Congratulations to the production designer, Dean Tavoularis, who discovered incredible places and did a great job. <br /> <br /> The print I saw turns at half-past one. It is forbidden to under 16 years (or 18, I do not remember). I suppose there is a lot of footage restored in this copy. SPOILER - I wonder what proportion of the desert sex scene was originally cut off. What appears today seems rather tame according to the standards in force. <br /> <br /> There is no music soundtrack for almost 1 hour in the film. Before we hear noises such as radio broadcasts, etc. Antonioni was very daring. I remember how the lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin was done at the time. This time, Fréchette did not bother me. Halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continues. <br /> <br /> Most student riot sequences look like archival footage. A shot is in a different aspect ratio and distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there are actually staged sequences, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to understand how Antonioni made some of the photos of Fréchette flying the plane. It looks like he really flew. There is no blue screen or double in some shots. <br /> <br /> I hope to come back to see the film a second time. Recommended to all Antonioni fans.
