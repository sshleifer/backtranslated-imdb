This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's movie is certainly a classic. A true Hollywood epic, it has all the qualities of a great Hollywood film: birth, death, happiness, sadness, exaltation, despair, etc. There is only one thing that annoys me. I know it was a sign of the times, but neither of the two main characters are portrayed by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor and he does an admirable job as Wang Lung, owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. She does not even look Chinese! I think she tried to get the role, but they should have put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they did not do it and Mrs. Rainier is very good in the film, but they have barely tried to give it an "authentic" look. Stillm is a very good movie, especially if you read the book (I did it in high school decades ago). It's a must, look beyond the cast. I think you can.
