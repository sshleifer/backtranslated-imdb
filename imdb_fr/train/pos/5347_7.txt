Another Spanish film about the civil war of 1936. This time, we are told the story of Carol (adorable played by the beginner Clara Lago), a little girl who comes to settle in a small Spanish village of New York. It is such an initiatory journey and it will soon discover the injustices of the human race, their stupid battles and conflicts, their contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe makes her best film since "Días Contados" (1994) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photograph and a beautiful screenplay. He tries not to take part in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and lets us decide (ok, the facts are sufficiently explicit to make us decide in which group we are) and he benefits enormously from the presence and the freshness of the star couple: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> A neat production. <br /> <br /> My rate: 7/10
