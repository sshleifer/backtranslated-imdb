No, it's not a fairy tale Alice my friends! This "Wonderland" fable is based on the true story of the bloody and bloody murders of Wonderland that took place in the 80s in California. In the center of this bloodbath, there was only Johnny Wad himself. Yes, John Holmes! Papa Ding-dong used other rifles than his famous 13-inch milk machine. In addition to being a legendary actor of adult films, Holmes was also a hardcore addict who became friends with various Hollywood addicts. Val Kilmer was sometimes as majestic as Holmes, but for once, this Holmes character did not treat him completely. The film has a "who's who" support of the players: Josh Lucas and Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffraff, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow as women in Holmes, and Eric Bogosian as a menacing entrepreneur of Tinsletown . These characters are integral, directly or indirectly, murders of the "Wonderland". Outside of this support group, it was Josh Lucas who was the fiercest and most impressive as the ardent Ron Launius. Lucas is gradually becoming a major player in Hollywood with such charismatic twists in A Beautiful Mind and Sweet Home Alabama. Director James Cox has sometimes proved to be a little misleading by displaying a large amount of over-extended scenes, just like the famous Holmes organ. Holmes was finally acquitted of the murders of Wonderland. He died as a result of the AIDS virus. "Wonderland" will make you wonder what really happened that bloody night and if Holmes really exposed his weapon. Oops! Bad movie Holmes! Okay! It's enough before being penalized, I mean penalized. Goodbye Holmies! *** Average
