What a beautiful jewel it is. It's an unusual story and fun to watch. Yes, it sang, but it's very well written in the story and it's very melodic to hear. It was so nice to watch. I enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in England during the Second World War. She is an apprentice witch looking for a missing part of a spell she needs. She uses her rudimentary "magic" to transport her with three children. They are joined by his correspondence teacher, who is surprised to learn that the lessons of his school really work! <br /> <br /> Although the special effects may seem a little dated at first, once used, they are part of the charm of this film. In fact, the film won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The film is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like melodious songs. The characters are wonderfully interesting to watch. I think anyone, no matter how old, can find something to like in this film.
