I have never seen a Barbara Steele film that I did not like, and I've always been fond of a good haunted house story (especially for such wonderful pictures as "The Legend of Hell House" and the original versions of "The Haunting" and "House on Haunted Hill"), so I felt like "Castle of Blood" would be right for me, and boy, was it ever! This Franco-Italian co-production, although perhaps not the classic of Steele's first horror film, "Black Sunday", remains to this day, yet it is an extremely atmospheric and frightening entry into the Spook genre. Shot in black and white, he manages to transmit a truly terrifying miasma.The film is about a journalist who bet a lord Blackwood and an author named Edgar Allen Poe that he can spend the night in the castle of Blackwood on All Saints' night, when the spirits of the people killed at the castle restore The viewer is fortunate enough to see these deaths, and they are rather horrible, for the most part. The film indeed gives chills in the back of the viewer, and in the uncut DVD I just watched - thanks to people at Synapse - there is even an amazing scene of topless and a slight lesbianism! And Barbara is wonderful in this film. its supernatural beauty is used to play a sympathetic spectrum. Its mere presence turns a scary ghost story into something truly memorable. It's not for nothing that she was nicknamed "the queen of horror".
