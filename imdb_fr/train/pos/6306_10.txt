Silly rogue pirate, a baby, a safe, a plan and a baby. Add them all and you get the best comedy you've ever heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with a few stars (at least one ...), this film has very little ad. <br /> <br /> But it's true. not to diminish his genius. <br /> <br /> Terrible writing, solid delivery and a credible group of characters. Some really classic lines and a fun touch at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a diluted comedy of "Nutty Professor". They are low-life villains. They speak a language of low life villain and they do things of low life villain. But they do it for your entertainment and your entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
