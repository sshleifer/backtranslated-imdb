My brother and I have Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. We watched it as a couple of times and it was the best. Too bad, a new Pokemon did not talk this time. I will get used to it. <br /> <br /> The iron masked marauder was pretty mean when he caught Celebi with his dark ball. Good Thing Ash and Sam managed to get him out of his control. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the end credits called Cele-BRATE played by Russell Velazquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever Become a success since the previous three movies and people will always love this movie.
