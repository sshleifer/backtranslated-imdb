I did not read the novel, although I understand that it's a little different from this one; the fact that I rather like it, coupled with the fact that it's not really my genre, leads me to the decision not to continue reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can not compare that to any of his works. What I can say is that almost all dialogues are intelligent, witty and well executed, as is the greatest source of comedy. It made me laugh a lot, with perfect English and verbal material. Each actor's performance is perfect and Paltrow perfectly fulfills the role of a matchmaker. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. I found some extremely irritating, however, and although I thought that at least some of that was supposed to be funny, it tended to be overly repetitive and, honestly, it was not fun the first time. The editing and cinematography are wonderful and everything looks really beautiful. The layout and rhythm are excellent, you never get bored. It ends in a * really * obvious way, but maybe that's what the public prefers. I can not pretend that it did not amused me, he did it from start to finish, and I would watch it again. There is a short language in this. I recommend it to all fans of love stories. 7/10
