Oh, come on, learn to have a little fun. When I was a child, this movie was worthy of an Oscar. I thought it was absolutely hysterical. One of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Now, it's a bit silly, but go. If you liked "Excellent Adventure", you should probably have fun with "Bogus Journey". It was the movie before "Dude, where's my car?" Only this one is really fun. As I said, it's just a good time. This should not be taken seriously and if you liked the first one, you should like "Bogus Journey". It's just a funny movie with memorable characters. For your enjoyment, watch it, let yourself go, and remember it's silly comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
