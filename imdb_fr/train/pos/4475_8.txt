The United States was still fighting the Second World War (the film came out between Victory Day and Victory Day). Any studio worthy of the name was making fight movies in which fearless American soldiers beat the enemy, or the Americans sang and danced in general. America flourished thanks to Technicolor Musicals in the depressing days when everything was rationed. Most of the musicals of the day were simply a group of musical numbers chained with the best available storyline inserted to fill the time until the next musical number! I now have the feeling that all the critics of this movie are all born after 1970. Depressing, we quickly forget. <br /> <br /> This film could have been called "The Search of Jose Iturbi", but everyone wonders why. . Let me explain. From 1929 to his arrival in America, until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the best pianists to perform on a concert stage. He agreed to shoot a few films in 1942, but Hollywood had been looking for him for almost ten years at that time. An excellent pianist, but also a successful conductor, Iturbi was a household word for over 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies was planned very early - and did not anyone ever notice that the other pianists were all children? Joe Pasternak, who produced this film and many other MGM musicals, gave Iturbi an interesting American youth in classical music. Grayson wanted an audition with Iturbi in the movie was not so different from the real life of the time. Everyone wanted Iturbi at the time. The joke among the soldiers was that "GI" meant "Get Iturbi" (he did a lot of gigs at military bases). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra was an excellent singer. Since this film was shot, Sinatra was barely 30 years old and had only signed a contract with Columbia Records for four years. Kelly was already well known as a dancer, but Iturbi was a global sensation for over 20 years. <br /> <br /> And as for the absence of conspiracy, the Americans did not need any conspiracy. They were tired of the war, they feared for their loved ones and feared for the future. They needed happiness and hope and the assurance that everything would be fine. They needed music, smiles, joy and romance. This film and other similar films provided what was needed. <br /> <br /> Enough talk. Smile apart, the best scene in the film runs between Sinatra and Iturbi, each of which "ignorantly" completes each other's music. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in Jose Iturbi, the Spaniard who has beaten more America than De Soto, Cortez and De Leon combined, please visit my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where You will find a summary of the plot, excerpts of reviews of "the day" movies and photos of it and some other MGMs. musicals from the 1940s, as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Trout
