Screenwriter / director Henry Brommel did a great job with his movie "Panic" from the year 2000, which includes his cast selection: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain. David Dorfman. Brommel has interpreted Ullman and Ritter in decidedly derisory roles, and the offbeat cast is a welcome change from what we normally see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" is the story of a successful man, Alex (Macy). who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his real job by doing mail order work; Obviously, he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Unhappy with his life, Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist (Ritter), telling only his mother (Bath). In the waiting room, he meets a young woman (Campbell) to which he is immediately attracted, which further complicates his situation. Her mother breaks her promise and talks about her psychiatrist to her father. When he gets his next job Alex will find out he has to kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> This is the deep story of a sweet and good man turned into an assassin by a father's monster, with his mother's monster. know, who kills to please his father but can not support him or leave him. His rage is so deep that he has lost the emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and it is ultimately his son who awakens him from a repression that lasts most of his life. life. When the time has come for "panic" to move, this is the case - quickly. <br /> <br /> "Panic" does not seem panicked at all. In fact, it's moving very slowly. But it's moving slowly, not because it's badly done - the slowness is deliberate, reflecting Alex's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog. In making a decision about Sara, Campbell's character, and seeing his brand, his own psychiatrist, as a living and breathing human being, Alex begins to make the connection between what he does and who he is, and how they do not do it. swing. And the difference between the two could result in the loss of another psyche, Sammy. <br /> <br /> William Macy gives another brilliant performance, as a loving father, distant husband and murderer, the two-year-old child of monsters who never cared about his feelings or desires, a man who finally realizes that he must take the lead or have the cycle repeated. <br /> <br /> This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. It's too adult, too small, too subtle, too focused on the characters and too beautiful.
