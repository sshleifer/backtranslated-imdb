I am the opposite of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think it was a sequel to the movie "The Jerk". I mean, it's not titled "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too", which leads me to believe that even though many of the character names are identical, it revolves around a completely different person. <Br /> <br /> Think about it: virtually no connection to the previous movie, other than the character names; a totally different story; different cast iron; and the fact that it is a partial musical comedy. <br /> <br /> I say we have to give credit to this film. There are a lot of laughs in it. Mark Blankfield at its peak.
