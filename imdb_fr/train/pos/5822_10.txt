The Three Stooges have always been one of the many actors I have loved. I love just about every shorts they've made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and are also featured by many other actors and actresses, many of whom were in many short films! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors of all time and is the funniest comic team of all time! <br /> <br /> It's a good short film Three Stooges. It's funny and her cast includes Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flowers. The Stooges played very well in this short film! I recommend this one!
