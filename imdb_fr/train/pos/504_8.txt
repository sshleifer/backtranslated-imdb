Okay, the recent history of Star Trek has not been good. The next generation faded in its last seasons, DS9 remained where no one had stopped before. Traveling started very badly and never really kept its promises. So when they announced a new Star Trek series, I did not have high expectations. And, the first episode, Broken Bow, had some problems. But all in all, it was solid Trek gear and a good performance. <br /> <br /> I will start by solving the problems. The opening theme is monotonous and I can not wait to read it regularly, but that's what remote controls do. What was really bad was the totally free lotion rubbing scene that almost drove my wife out of the room. They must eliminate this nonsense. <br /> <br /> But the plot was solid and went well. The characters, though always new, seem well rounded and do not always match what you expect. The Vulcans are clearly presented in a very different way from before, with a slightly sinister theme. I especially liked the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character not to be proud in the face of death, but to face his phobias and fears. They seemed to stay true to the Trek tradition, which was a major problem in previous series, although they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields, the present invention of technology that can do anything repair, and the inevitable plethora of time travel stories. Does anyone wish to create a reserve how long before the arrival of the Borg? <br /> <br /> In total, the series has enormous potential. They see the universe with new eyes. We are lucky to learn how things went as they were in the last series. How did the Klingons go from insulting to war? How did we meet the Romulans? How was the Federation formed and who entrusted the responsibility for the Earth? Why is the main directive so important? If they are dealing with these things rather than spitting episodes of time travel, it will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite phrase: the Zephram Cochran saying "where no man has gone before" (no "person")
