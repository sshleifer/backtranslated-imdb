I rented Zero Day at the local video store last week. I had never heard of the film and had reservations about it. Looking at the box, I knew that the film was an independent film and that, as a result, its quality would be lower than that of a mainstream film. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after watching Zero Day, I immediately started again from the beginning. The film clearly followed what had happened at Columbine High School in April 1999, but what struck me was how credible the two main actors were. My first time watching this movie, I did not know if what I was looking at were real tapes left by the Columbine shooters. In the back of my mind, I knew that what I was looking at could not be real, but at the same time, the acting was so convincing that I had to keep shaking my head. <br /> <br /> Is the film disturbing? Absolutely! Are you going to see things that make you doubt the merit of the film? Probably. I think what most people will find disturbing is that they will have feelings for the two main characters, Calvin and Andrew (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is it problematic for some people? Calvin and Andrew plan a massacre at their high school. I know that I felt a great sadness for Andr√© and Calvin. I had empathy for them because their lives had become so horrible. They had fallen so deep into the cracks that they had embarked on a road trip that could have been stopped if only their surroundings had become aware of their fate. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. This gives you a personal and personal overview of events that most of us will never see the conclusion as in the news. This lets you think about the lives involved. And it puzzles you to see how people get to this point. A week after watching this movie, I still think about it. <br /> <br /> Those of you who have not seen Zero Day must keep in mind the following points: The film is a freelancer with minimal or no budget, and the film. is shot on the camcorders. The content of the film is disturbing. It's not traditional Hollywood and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put all this aside, Zero Day is a film that will stick to you and maybe help you open your eyes a little.
