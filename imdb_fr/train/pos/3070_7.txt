"Panic" is a captivating and fuzzy film about the reconciliation between an elderly hitman and a mature man, a craze for a young and uninhibited hairdresser, his love of the woman and his son, his duty to his employer / father with his own identity. Although the film has a nebulous purpose and an ambiguous ending, it is a superb production in almost every aspect. The clarity and sincerity of the characters in such an unlikely story can both fascinate and disturb the audience.
