Orson Welles manages to hit me on the ass with every picture of hers that I see. Lady of Shanghai is at the same level as her other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Touch of Evil, The Trial and Chimes at Midnight. The plot can sometimes be confusing, and sometimes it seems to move a little too fast (about an hour was removed when the screening tests went wrong). It does not matter, though. You can not watch Welles's films and manage to focus too much on the plot. His direction defines what a great direction is. Almost every scene in this movie can fit with any other scene he has made. Discover the scene of the courtroom. Usually these are stock scenes that I can not stand. For example, try reading Welles' speech towards the end of Compulsion. In Lady from Shanghai, pay attention to the level of detail of this scene. Look at this juror who sneezes and constantly interrupts the procedure. Or just look at the lighting of this scene. I know it's just a Venetian blind and has been used consistently in the black films and crime movies of the day, but Welles gives it a beauty all its own. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the skill, a skill no one else seemed to have, to make a detective film containing examples of the greatest poetry. Whether he's talking Shakespeare or spitting cooked lines, he had the power to move the soul. 10/10.
