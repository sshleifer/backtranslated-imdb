"Zu: The Magic Mountain warriors" was and remains an impressive classic! You would never have guessed that this was done in 1983. Tsui Hark used special effects with a lot of creativity and inventiveness. (He continued to do so in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and in later productions.) Even now, he can compete with other films of this genre. "Legend of Zu" is connected to "Zu" Magic Mountain Warriors "! It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of it.The plot is a bit difficult to follow. To be honest, he does not 'I always wondered what Tsui Hark would do if he put his hand on CGI, we now know he made this film, maybe it's too much, but the final result is so it's nice that I'm not critical about it.It's happening so much on the screen that you can not believe it! I think it's a shame that this movie has not not shown in movie theaters here in Holland The movie takes time on the screen in cinemas! This film can easily beat big-budget Hollywood productions like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3. The only thing I must mention is the lack of humor! In most of Tsui Harks's films, it combines drama, fantasy, arts martial and humor.It is missing somehow in this movie. Again, I'm not going to be hard on these little things. "Legend of Zu" book on the front of the action with the most beautiful special effects you will see. A real classic!
