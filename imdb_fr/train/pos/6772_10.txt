Unlike another user who said that this movie was bad (and that Olivia Hussey was terrible), I disagree. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is great in everything she is! Yes, she may be older now, because many remember her from Romeo and Juliet, but she is wonderful! <br /> <br /> This story can be used quite often, but it's a unique film and I will fight against those who disagree! I enjoyed it as much as any other Olivia Hussey film. Olivia is "my daughter" and I love her job. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time Saturday (14/04/07) and I fell in love with it. Not only because it's an Olivia film, but because of its unique story and wonderful direction.
