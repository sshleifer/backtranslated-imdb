The premise of this animated series is about bread, all the things on which to base a plot! I really laughed. The main character has a special baker power with which he was born and he goes to the bakery. I wish it were available on DVD, and it does not matter whether it is subtitled or dubbed, it's also good. Even the theme song is funny. At one point in the theme song, there is an Afro-Japanese man with an afro on horseback, brandishing a French baguette as if it were a samurai sword. These images will only make sense if you see the anime. You will laugh until your sides hurt. It's certainly the most unique anime I've seen so far.
