One of John Ford's best films, The Informer, has no great landscape in the American West. Instead, the intense Ford drama was known to play on the no less rugged terrain of the face of British actor Victor McLaglen. The former recipient, who has already faced Joe Louis in the ring, delivers an award-winning portrayal of an Oscar for the distraught IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. <br /> The plot is graciously simple: in 1922 Dublin, a hungry and humiliated man who was expelled from the IRA for being unable to kill a cold-blooded informant, himself becomes an informant. For Â£ 20, he betrays a friend "The Tans" and, for the rest of the night, he drinks and gives his money alternately alternating spasms of guilt, denial, self-pity and a desperate desire to escape consequences of his actions. acts. <br /> <br /> The remarkable complexity of Gypo's seemingly simple character is the film's most impressive achievement. In most movies, a scathing guy like Gypo would be presented as heavy, he would have at best two or three lines and be eliminated quickly so that the hero and the villain can have their confrontation. In "The Informer", Gypo is both hero and villain, while the confrontation unfolds in its inner turmoil, each detail being explicitly shared with the audience. <br /> <br /> Liam O'Flaherty's novel having already been published Filmed in 1929, RKO has endowed Ford with a very modest budget. The director and his associates, especially the director of photography Joseph H. August, have used this advantage by creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself. In addition to the McLaglen Oscar, "The Informer" also won the John Ford First Prize, Best Screenplay and Best Score.
