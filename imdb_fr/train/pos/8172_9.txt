I remember being terrified by the blood of cinema when I was younger and becoming less so, until I became quite jaded, like many other viewers, so that the flood of blood films produced in recent years entertained me, but did not scare me or make me feel uncomfortable. "The Dentist" has returned the problem. <br /> <br /> The installation seems simple: a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc in the mouth, and perhaps in the body as well. An interesting tip, however, is that the dentist is the protagonist of the film. Thus, instead of being a one-dimensional villain without clear motivation, his development is the most complete of all the characters and he is very human and credible. The viewer therefore feels sympathy for him and his victims, and instead of hoping for justice, I found myself hoping he could find a way to hide his tracks and return to a normal life. <br /> <br /> What really makes a horror movie is violence. And "The Dentist" does it better than any other movie I can think of. First of all, the film has tons of tension, which is missing in modern movies gore. In a scene (), the dentist is emotionally distraught and must see a young patient for the first time. When it reaches the child's mouth, you hope that for the dentist and for the child, the encounter ends without injury. I will not mess up what's going on. Second, when the blood comes in, it strikes all the worst, tortuous nerves. Once again, I will not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a film you've never heard of, it has flaws. More importantly, it's exclusively for horror fans. In addition, as mentioned by another speaker, which takes place over a period of just a few days, we do not really know the characters. And the tension falls a little in the end. But, in fact, the fact that we even wanted to know the background of the characters testifies to its quality, and most of the film is strong enough to forgive small voltage failures. <br /> <br /> It is strange, after years of habit, to want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood. "The Dentist" made me frightened and very uncomfortable, and for that he deserves my full approval.
