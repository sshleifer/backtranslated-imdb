I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation, because romantic comedies present secular clich√©s that make a film uninteresting. Typically, in a romantic comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy who falls in love with each other, then has trouble and then gets into trouble getting married or whatever. But, this film is a different story, it's really different from the romantic comedies I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> There is a widowed guy (Dan), there is a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookstore and discusses for a while, after which Mary has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when that something starts to become significant, we get a twist. Marie is his brother's girlfriend. Ignoring the circumstances, Dan flirts with Mary and realizes that he loves her, and even Mary loves him, but their love would not be just possible. How this is made possible is the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell behaves well, Juliette Binoche is doing well like Marie. And everything else is well done. It's a good movie, look at it.
