Haunted by a secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he does not know. Once his plan is established, nothing will stop him. At least that's what he thinks. But Ben did not expect to fall in love with one of these people and she will eventually transform it. Will Smith is back with director Gabriele Muccino, after the movie "The pursuit of happiness", which inspired life. "Seven Pounds" is yet another life-changing cinematic experience that not only reminds you of their previous collaboration in tears, but also inspires you with joy in the end. Will Smith, is also the producer again with some of the others. These films are very realistic, describing the life of an ordinary man and his struggles throughout life. It may have taken some time for Seven Pounds to regain momentum, but just after half an hour of film, the film is ready to reign. In addition, this film has some twists that allow viewers to guess. The director Gabriele Muccino is once again the winner, with his message both emotional and inspiring. It makes all the characters in the movie very real, that people would find themselves somewhere in the movie. With the director, Will Smith is another winner, with his acting skills. Once again, the duo of the director and the actor works perfectly. In addition, other talented actors in the film played their role very well. Rosario Dawson, beauty with the brain, that's how she can be called. She looks beautiful and does her part extremely well. Barry Pepper brings a lot of support to the film and Woody Harrelson does the same, although Woody did not have a lot of timing on the screen (it would have been good if he had had more). You will not forget this movie easily. Watch this movie and change your life. First class cinema!
