I noticed in the movie guide of the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I went when I was in Hollywood, that this film was in projection. Basically, the new chairman of the Triads Wo Sing Society of Hong Kong must be elected. So you can imagine how much violence will occur during this time. The fight is between the "candidates" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) for the control of the oldest and most powerful parts of the society of the Triad. Also starring Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are good themes and moments of realistic corruption, pretty much enough action, except maybe when the cops get involved, but a sequel follows, so it's a pretty interesting crime thriller. Very well!
