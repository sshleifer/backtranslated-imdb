This movie has some pretty amazing things. First, it is supposed to be based on a true story. In itself, it's amazing that several tornadoes hit the same city at night in Nebraska in the fall. I wonder if the name of the actual city was close to "Blainsworth" (which is the name of the city in the movie). There is a Ainsworth in Nebraska, but there is also a city that starts with Blains, something. <br /> <br /> It shows the slowest tornadoes recorded in the movie where the boys are at home. On the other hand, the scene where television becomes blurred is based on facts. Before the Doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you turn on your TV on a particular channel (not on the cable) and adjust the brightness to perfection, you could know if a tornado was getting ready. The problem was that by then you would be able to hear it. <br /> <br /> Since I know something about Midwest tornadoes, it has made this movie fun for me. I appreciate it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break - there is no way to get through and F5 by chaining you to a pipe in a well house.
