Well, there are many ways to spoil a political thriller. Usually they are derivative or overly ambitious and often involve a totally paranoid and incredible plot. But the town hall does nothing of what is mentioned above. The plot is cleverly crafted, the story is believable. As for the characters, I would say that this film is a solid average. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrait of a charismatic mayor of New York is superb and proves once again that Al Pacino belongs today to the absolute top of American actors.
