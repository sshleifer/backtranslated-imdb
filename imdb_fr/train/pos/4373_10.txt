I question anyone who says they do not care about this movie. Some critics said there was not enough action, others said it was too long, and so on. Do not listen to them !!! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> Actor performances are superb! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are both great and Liam Neeson does a great job and is a very big character because of his size. The cinemaphotographie was brilliant and breathtaking. It's one of the few movies I've ever seen in my life (with Shawshank) that's pretty irreproachable about casting, staging, writing, acting, and so on. !!! <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find that this was not the case. t in the first 50 or 100 films examined. I felt so passionate about the fact that I had just signed up for IMDB to tell everyone the real scoop. I saw this movie about 10 times (each time with a different person) and everyone loved it! You must be awake and be very careful during the first 30 minutes because they introduce a lot of characters at the beginning. If you have the attention span longer than most of these kids who write reviews for movies on this site, you'll love this movie! Come on ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix at # 32?!?! This should show you the age range of most reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is a movie of the top 50 !!!
