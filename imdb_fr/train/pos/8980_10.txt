I must first admit that I'm a big fan of The Dandy Warhols, and that's why I came to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film, compared to other modern rock documentaries, is that it's not just about a page in the history of a band (like "J"). 'try to break your heart', about Wilco), but rather covers a long period of the group's history. In this film, director / producer Ondi Timoner closely followed friends and rivals The Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for over 8 years (1995 - 2003) and made an incredible video of 1 500 hours 1:45 (the future DVD version will contain much more material than the original film). The result is amazing - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and authentic, which gives you the impression that you live with bands, all these years. <br /> <br /> The two groups at the beginning of their career, they promised to "make a revolution" in making music and not sell their soul to the devil of "the record industry". However, their paths separate quickly - the Dandy Warhols sign a contract with Capitol Records and become relatively popular (especially in Europe) after a single album, while The Brian Jonestown Massacre (with his self-destructive leader Anton Newcombe) dissolves in the forgetfulness (at least how it is described in the film). And the film follows the descent of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, contrasting with the rise of the Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> First, the film and its approach to the story of Anton Newcombe (eg Courtney Taylor - the leader of the band The Dandy Warhols - tells), but after some reflections, I I realized that something was wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Anton Newcombe is treated as a missing person. The project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging bands, in which Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were equal partners (this is why Ondi Timoner had all these years unmediated access to both groups) . Anton Newcombe integrated the Dandy Warhols into the project. In the end, he was completely ignored, as if he had been kicked out of the project. Everyone is talking about BJM, but he does not participate in the discussion. I guess he was not even informed when the group started the final assembly process. There are always two sides to the story, and here we only have one ... Of course, as you might expect, Anton does not approve of the final result and sees in this film a betrayal of his old friends. <br /> <Second, the film is very biased by Dandy Warhols. Of course, the winner takes everything, but the fact that Courtney Taylor (leader of DW) tells (although it seems like a good choice - it gives a sense of involvement apparently closer) and the recent history of the group is represented in a non-proportional way (BJM is covered until 1997 and DW - until 2003) does not add objectivity to the film. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is (a little) superficial. What does he want to teach us? As one critic puts it: "... the film examines old questions: where does genius fit into a merchantable world, can it prosper and obtain what is due to it or should it self-destruct to preserve its integrity? " No, HE DOES NOT EXAMINE these questions! It simply describes the story of a brilliant but unsuccessful musician, told by another less brilliant, but successful, one who surrenders himself to self-assurance and the eternal cold of an ego bigger than the mountain. <br /> <br /> The movie was fun - it's raw, it's cool, it's stylish, it's ... just interesting god, at least for fans of DW or BJM. For the rest of the crowd - I do not know ...
