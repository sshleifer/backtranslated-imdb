As a kid, I remember being nine or ten years old and loving this movie. It was Bollywood's full action / comedy movie. It's an imitation of Bad Boys of course! All the exchange of identities but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out the window, then the arrival of colorful villains who dance and sing! The action scenes of the film are not revolutionary but remain astonishing scenes. The film is really funny and was the big comeback for Amitabh Bachan. Govinda is a jewel as always and it's probably his best work to date. He shines in the leading role and offers the best comedy scenes available in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The songs .... The songs are both funny and catchy .............. proving to laugh when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan is surprisingly very funny and will make you laugh like "Bade Miah" ... his accent ... body language ... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> "Assi chutki naab re daal" is the best song .............. Hilarious.
