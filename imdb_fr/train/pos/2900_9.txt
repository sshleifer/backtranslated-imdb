If this were an American film, I would evaluate it 7: we have seen it before. Being an Argentine film and being Argentinian myself, I would like to give it a 10, because it's the kind of quality I hoped for rather than hope. It's a superb quality that's amazing, given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd World ... <br /> <br /> I can not forget the scene when Díaz forces Silverstein's fiance to confess -you know what am I talking about if you saw the movie? I think this is the key moment of the film, not surprising perhaps, but original. That's when the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before watching a movie, I always try to gather previous information. Being a general public, satyric and commercial, I press "Play" and make a suspension of the reality and the logic, I would say the best state of mind to appreciate films like this one. It is impossible to discuss the plausibility of the entire conspiracy, yet it is credible in some way. As for me, I could not help but laugh at every joke and every comment - "sos malo" ("you're mean") ... in the mouth of Díaz, the biggest. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty tired of seeing movies "designed for" Peretti. I know he's a superb actor, but I sometimes feel that his roles are unfairly opaque, the role of Luis Luque in this case. I do not really like Argentinean television, so I did not see much of Luque's work, but it's obvious he's an excellent performer. His physical role, his looks and his content in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role should be improved, just to let him show us how great he can be! <br /> <br /> I do not know if Szifrón is considering doing a sequel or not. I know he will not do it if it's to follow the rule that "the second games are never good", so if he succeeds, I'll surely see him. And I hope that, in the future, it will be necessary to take into account the possibility of giving his Peretti counterparts the same opportunities to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> An excellent film, great performances and lots of laughs!
