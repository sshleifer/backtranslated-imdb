Frailty - 8/10 - This is a sensual title and the title of "Bill Paxton Direct" apart, it's a very good old biblical horror thriller torn to the old. In the end, it could only become the cousin of Kubrick's "Southern Shining" Gothic - but hey, that's a pretty amusing notion. It also has a sleight of hand and a very ambiguous moral message. This is the kind of movie that, in a few years, people will see late at night with a basic cable and will scare the bees by themselves. Too bad the director Bill Paxton was forced to go to work in the main roles.
