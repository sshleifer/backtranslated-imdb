Director Sam Fuller has something to worship, especially in Europe. Yet most of his films are more than forgettable. He did, however, make a really great movie in "Pickup on South Street". Realized quite early in his career, the films that followed were considerably lower. <br /> <br /> From the first to the last image, "Pickup" works on all levels. It is filmed with flawless fluidity and offers great performances. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter, both players with a great performance record, are at their peak. Widmark, who was no stranger to the game of villains, while being really mean, always succeeds in revealing the least humanity that makes his character fascinating and makes the character of Jean Peters even more credible. <br /> <Fuller makes no noise in this really difficult film. There is a scene in which Jean Peters gets hurt by Widmark. It's really shocking in its reality. This is not a case of carefully choreographed photography. <br /> <br /> Less self-aware than many black films from this period, it remains an excellent example of the genre.
