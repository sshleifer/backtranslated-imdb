I've always loved watching this movie when it was on prime time television every year in the '60s. It's a typical Hollywood epic, dramatized, stylized, and full of inaccuracies, but then what? It's an entertaining film and a beautiful film. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. His son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn, who was Beluche in the 1938 film, is the director of his directorial debut. scene and his swan song, having never made a film before and never again. DeMille assembled a team that had recently worked on his 10 commands to help Quinn achieve this, including DeMille's long-time associate producer / actor, Henry Wilcoxon, who oversaw the project. Screenwriter Jesse Lasky, Director of Photography Loyalk Griggs, Assistant Director Francisco Day, Secondary Director Arthur Rosson, Artistic Directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, Directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, Costume Designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester who as a costume design team received the only Oscar nomination for the Buccaneer. An excellent cast of the DeMille team led by Yul Brynner in the role of pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future president, General Andrew Jackson. Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. At a little over two hours, it trails in some places, but is compensated by excellent scenes of battle. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.
