Well it was a nice surprise after all. his trailer does not predict a good movie at all, it was even a little misleading. Most importantly, the role of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardonic and funny. Less real, however, I do not think a guy who has arrived where he arrived would show signs of such irreverence toward everything his current society represents. One does not become a perfect costume just to suddenly doubt it. The end of the film, during the screening of Dolce Vita, was too old-fashioned, clich√© and rather disappointing. And of course, a guy like Pegg's character would not spend his first week in a blitz magazine like this. I hope someday I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox. She looked like a poor actress playing a bimbo. And by the way, I do not see why she's the "sex symbol" of the year, I see hot girls on almost every cover of every magazine.
