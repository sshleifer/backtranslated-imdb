Remember that any film (without speaking documentary) that affirms any kind of truth generates a negative and proportional cynicism on the part of those to whom any suggestion of and / or search for truths is already meaningless Those of you who are already masters of psychology, film, and captains of the soul will probably find this film superfluous, after all, you already know everything there is to know. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For those of us who are minority like me, I found "The guide of the perverts of Cinmea" ... rather brilliant, and interesting to watch for those who are interested in cinema , psychology and modern philosophy. <br /> <br /> A bit like Scott Mclouds' "Understanding Comics", director Sophie Fiennes, a Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic, Slavoj Zizek, in many films and scenes that specify that he discusses. The cover is an image of "The birds" (Zizek takes a boat to recreate the clich√©). <br /> <br /> Lacanian psychoanalysis does not necessarily scream, a very funny evening ... but it is! If you like movies, it's ... Having a knowledge of Lacanian psychoanalysis aids (Symbolic, Real and Imaginary) are terms that are thrown a bit at first, but the scenes that Zizek selects and analyzes are remarkably clear which has always been a very abstract subject for me. In fact, it is probably better to know the films he is discussing than the terms he uses, which becomes more and more clear as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> Why I love this film, it's not because chooses great films to analyze or reveals great truths about Lacan, but shows in a very practical and skillful way, where film and psychology (and by default philosophy) meet. <br /> <br /> Why is "The sound of music" a little fascist, why "Short Cuts" is more than class and alienation, why do birds attack in "The birds "What is there to learn from the spirit of" Alien Resurrection ", what does the planet" Solaris "" What "Psycho" and "The Marx Brothers" have to do with the other, and what is David Lynch doing, film after film ... Well, Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of the voice in "The Excorcist "and" Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith "is perhaps the strongest and most lucid moment of the film, when it enters the feminine sexual sex .. subjectivity, I begin to wonder ... to a At this point, Zizek admits that the flowers are a kind of decorative dentin vagina, that they are disgusting and that they should be hidden from the children (jokingly, it seems, but ...). /> <br /> Anyway, it's t a fascinating documentary, that anyone who has ever seen a film and thinks it means something more than what was literally stated, should try to see. <br /> <br /> And all those who are interested in Slavoj Zizek, it's also a must, much less dry than "Reality Of The Virtual", and more direct than "Zizek!", Two other pseudo-docs on "The Elvis of Contemporary Cultural Criticism", as it is nicknamed, in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> "The Perverts Guide to the Cinema" is NOT about the role of sex in the cinema. Zizek argues that cinema is the ultimate evil art because it teaches "how to desire, not what you want," and that it is the only form of contemporary art that can express desires. It's not a film about the discovery of reality in the cinema, but about finding the cinema in reality and how it can be important and exciting. Hard to find, and a bit long, but worth it, one of the most "stimulating" movie viewing experiences I've ever experienced.
