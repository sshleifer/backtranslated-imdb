A friend lent me this DVD, which he received from the director of a festival, I think. I entered the room and warned me that some technical aspects of the movie were a bit fragile and the writing was good but not great. So maybe that marked my judgment, but I must admit that I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> The standout characters where the actors are. Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the main character, rather pathetic and friendly. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as roommates who make Ernie crazy. The character of Bill (Justin Lane), who spends much of the movie dressed in panda, was by far my favorite. it seemed the least unidimensional and reminded me so much of an old college mate that I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind and very funny. Some of the other actors were good, others not, but nothing bad. I also really liked the duo of vigilantes. Ridiculous and funny. <br /> <br /> I give it a high score, even if that poses some problems, because you can see by watching that these people were interested and decided to make their film in their own way. Congratulations to Adam Jones and his crew.
