The best of Sam Fuller's seven films I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten !, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One and this film), Pickup on South Street is one of the best best black movies. He represents Fuller at his most controlled. I like it when it's out of control, of course, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark plays the role of a pickpocket that steals a microfilm intended for communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who wore the film for his boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and recover it. She finds him in a pigeon stool played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes their loyalty (and the fact that she learns that she works for communists, the content of the cold war is really interesting). The love story is a little fast and not entirely believable, but it does not matter if it hurts the movie (unlike Fuller's previous movie, Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. It must be one of his best roles, but I do not know his career so well that I can say it with certainty. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. His role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance and his final scene in this film is as touching as the one you find in the movies. I will never forget that. 10/10.
