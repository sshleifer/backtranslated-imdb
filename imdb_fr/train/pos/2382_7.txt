For a long time, "The Menagerie" was my favorite episode of "Star Trek" although in recent years it has been overshadowed by "City on the Edge of Forever". Previously, what I liked about "Menagerie" is that it's a harder film, Star Trek, with this fascinating story that goes back to the plot of Trek. I still think that the way Gene Roddenberry integrated the original driver into a two-part episode is pretty ingenious. Although the "new" part of the story serves largely as a pretext for Kirk and a few others (and ourselves) to monitor the pilot, the idea that Spock is being tried in a military court is intelligent. You can make holes in the plot if you want. For example, given the Talosian mental control abilities and Captain Pike's condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to their planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... better not to think too much about the details and just enjoy ST's two-tracks.
