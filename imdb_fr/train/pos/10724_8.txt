This is one of those who feel good, Saturday afternoon movies. It's right up there with other retro movies like Flight of the Navigator. Just a cute movie with a subtle comedy to lighten things up. And it's fun to see how 20-year-olds have changed stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> Personally, I really like such films from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice story. And I would never have known Mr. Phoenix if I had not read the credits recently. He was just a baby when he made this movie. <br /> <br /> At the time, Kelly Preston was also a budding young actress. She and Lea did a great job in this movie. I agree that it is not an Oscar-winning film. But very interesting to watch. Especially if you have children in the range, say, 8 to 11 years old. Or those who are interested in the space program.
