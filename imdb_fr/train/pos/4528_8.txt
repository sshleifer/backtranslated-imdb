Although the film is clearly dated, the public can still easily identify with the tragic fate of the unfortunate Buster in this timeless and very entertaining story of intuition. Buster fights against unpleasant odds at three different ages: Stone Age, Roman Age and Moden Age, playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different "ages". In this film, we see one of the first comic representations of the "caveman" stereotype, which gains its love not by love but by brute force, as well as by a funny variant of the Roman gladiatorial fight, two previous humorous sketches to lies such as Mel Brooks' "History of the World: First Part". The underlying theme of the film is simple but compelling: even though the era may have changed, we are still struggling with the same difficulties, even in the modern era, that we had known in prehistoric times for "Win the Girl" (keep in mind is the theme of America in 1923, a time when chauvinism was still in vogue). It's interesting to watch this movie more than eighty years later and to see how things have changed dramatically since the "modern times" of this movie until now.
