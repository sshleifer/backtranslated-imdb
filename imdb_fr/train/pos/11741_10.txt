This tender and beautifully crafted production has deeply plunged into my sweet and bitter being. The irreverent students, the embittered bus driver and the teacher's personalities present a subliminal debate at the time of the revelation of the story. The adult characters seem to me all familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each of their opinions so plausible and known. When a key incident occurs on the bus, we are sent to a circuit of viewpoints. All the time, the hubbub of teenage energy is controlled only by the organizers of the trip. Mr. Harvey is having a lot of pain all the way through. He reminds me of teachers who were wounded by the war that I did not understand when I was an irreverent student. <br /> <br /> Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve to be hailed by this well-trained British film. The game of actors without stain, the appropriate scenes, it should be widely available but does not seem to have had the right opportunity.
