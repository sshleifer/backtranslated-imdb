I really enjoyed this film. The animation was well done and the romance was cute. I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and Hans Zimmer's score was excellent. What many people do not realize is how it relates to the theme "In the Darkness / Apocalypse Now" (what happens when the so-called "civilization" invades someone other at home, what does it mean to be "civilized", etc.) The opening set and the music were very moving, the film is a complaint for an America that was once beautiful.
