I loved this Republican series! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even hard, the image quality was not the best, but OK. The fence in this series is also a little bad, but not terrible. They should have only practiced a little more. As I said, the story is great! You just wait to know who Don Del Oro is! The theme of music is excellent! This is the same guy who made the music of Zorro in the Walt Disney version, which made the music of Fightin Legion. The costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and legionaries too! I highly recommend this series. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I like Reed Hadley to play Zorro! He is funny, intelligent and brave! Mark: 6.
