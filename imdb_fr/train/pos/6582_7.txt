Well, so there is a front view of a Taxi Checker, probably a model from the late 1930s. It has large triangular shaped headlights. There's also a DeSoto taxi in this black-and-white, character-driven and almost musical film that went wrong. <br /> <br /> The real pleasure is to look at the interiors, fashions and lifts of hotels from the 1940s. The hair styles, men and women are gorgeous. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature's hair, she could have made a big one. There is an artist loft that would be the envy of all Andy Warhol's aspirants. <br /> <br /> If you look at this in anticipation of a beautiful Casablanca history or Sound of Music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. There is a nice little story under the approach of the track model in this movie. <br /> <br /> My copy on DVD with another $ 1 film was very visible. The title sequence was cute but not Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Pink Panther. It was an RKO movie, but he did not have the nice airplane logo that she used. <br /> <br /> I loved Victor Mature in One Million, BC, and Sampson and Dalila, especially in Violent Saturday. See if you can find that one. He has been great in comedy with Peter Sellers titled Caccia Alla Volpe or After The Fox. <br /> <br /> Richard Carlson then directed I led Three Lives on television in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> Vic Mature was offered the role of Sampson's father in the remake of Sampson and Dalila. He was supposedly asked if he would have a hard time playing the role of the father since he was so well known as Sampson. Victor replied, "If the money is good, I will play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
