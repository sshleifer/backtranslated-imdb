I do not know under what circumstances the director Visconti decided to shoot the novel "The postman still rings twice" James Cain (I'm not even sure that Viscounti acquired the rights of the book), but the resulting film is really interesting. This is not the best version of Cain's story (I prefer the 1981 version), but thanks to the excellent direction of Visconti and the cast of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it's a must for black fans. Visconti is a perfect mix of neorealism and black sensibilities. The movie is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story goes very slowly (I do not think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think black film works best with a short run time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that always interest the viewer. Anyway, as much as I like this film and its remakes, I think nobody has yet realized the final version of Cain's popular book.
