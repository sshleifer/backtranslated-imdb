In reviewing this film, he appeared to me infinitely superior this time to the previous ones. The acting is incredibly wonderful. The characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply superb as the wandering son who rebels. The other actors and actresses are also good in all respects. Robert Redford creates a wonderful period piece from the 1920s era of speakeasies. The landscape is incredibly beautiful in the mountains and streams of western Montana. This is one of the best movies made in the 90s. <br /> <br /> You must see this movie! <br /> <br />
