This is a fantastic children's movie based on the legend of Boggy Creek, although I do not know why they called it Return to Boggy Creek as if it were a sequel. Dawn Wells is the mother of 3 children who get lost in the marsh around Boggy Creek with 2 other men and the monster helps them. Yes it's very stupid and the plot is corny but this kind of film is perfect for the group of 8 to 12 years of age targeted. It's harmless for kids with a G-class fare, and at least you do not have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it. Strictly for 8-12 year olds, older children will get bored and think it's bad.
