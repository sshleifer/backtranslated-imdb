A very atmospheric cheapie, showing a great ingenuity in the use of accessories, scenery and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create a disturbing and moody texture. The story is far-fetched, the acting is simply functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop a complete visual narrative. This film is recommended for its mood and texture, not for its story.
