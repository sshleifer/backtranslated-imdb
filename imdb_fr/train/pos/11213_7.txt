This second film is just as interesting as the previous one, except that there is no suspense. We know what he's going to do and what's going to happen even before it's alluded to the screen. Then, the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks and their succession take place. We know there will be dynamite in the car, that it will lose a wheel, that the car will have an accident, just to talk about the car. And that's what happens. Now details and details are for you to discover them in the movie. That he may be baited by a silly woman is obvious and must come, but we know that he has already seen her through it and that he knows he is trapped in a trap. Now, how is he going to cope? This is what you must discover for yourself. And do not worry, he will have the main trafficker, but how is another story going? A speed boat is not a match against our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he will be hurt. They did not know what the bullet-proof vests were at that time. It is true that recently, it was discovered that some GIs did not have this type of equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a film? This insistence on chasing the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration of the fact that there is no value that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not simply legalize these assets so that they can be properly observed and monitored? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way, it's even less fun to use, to do it. It is the forbidden or the restricted which is attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
