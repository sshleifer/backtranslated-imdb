This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you'll like it. Think "Dave" has gone to South America while Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, an actor between two posts, who is hand-picked by the country's secret police chief, Parador, to replace the drunken dictator of a dictator, Alfonse Simms, after his resignation. a heart attack and died. Noah buzzes, helped in her role by the mistress of the former dictator, who tries to thwart Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also appears as a generous American émigré who turns out to be the CIA. Also with Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are some absurd moments such as the body of the old dictator is frozen for a year and the final scene where Sonia Braga, who rocked the bloody body and riddled with balls of Dreyfus is seen a few moments later all in pristine white, with no trace on it. But overall, it's a big party.
