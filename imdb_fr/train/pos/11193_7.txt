I liked the Lonely Lady a bit. Give Pia a break. She looks great and she really has beautiful eyes. What does not love? The scene where she was raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was rather crude and cruel. In fact, many things that happen in this movie are rude and cruel. But it's a trashy movie. Many trashy movies are not all bad. I liked it better than Valley of the Dolls, which was not just trashy but boring. At least, that was not boring. <br /> <br /> Pia undresses a lot and seems to be a bad idea writer. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a man three times older than her age is absolutely incredible. I'm sure Pia is a nice person in real life, she just does not project the writer's mood. She looked a lot happier when she was working as a hostess for the Saturday Night Fever guy and wearing a sparkling disco dress. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are fun. The one where she tells the actor at two paces that she is pregnant and he looks up to the sky and reprimands him for "stop dragging!", While watching closely any bimbo that passes at full speed. <br /> <br /> Pia's nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably a mistake to have such a supernova (the whirlwind of floating faces and an icy scream - that!) And her subsequent catatonic stupor is a bit exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The acceptance speech is a joke, though. I want to see someone give this speech in a drama class. <br /> <br /> But, again, we are talking about waste. You could find worse on any movie of the week of the eighties.
