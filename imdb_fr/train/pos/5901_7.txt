It is a return on many recent movies, but this one has fewer stars, fewer complications and a more fuzzy feeling. Abhay and Ritika (played respectively by Fardeen Khan and Esha Deol) meet at a friend's wedding where their own (unbeknownst) marriage begins its process of arrangement. In a short time, the two strangers get married and are sent to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples who follow movements similar to yours. As they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and / or repaired and flowers of love. <br /> <br /> If you saw Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you saw this movie. The twists are the same, there is not a single element of surprise in the two and a half hours of the film. Everything is predictable. I only liked it because I had seen 'Darling' (with the stars of Deol & Khan) earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry. So I said 'why not' when my sister suggested renting 'Just Married' too. <br /> <br /> See: because Kirron Kher is his usual partner. <br /> <br /> Ignore it: because you're tired of all the nonsense of the couple's party! <br /> <br /> C +
