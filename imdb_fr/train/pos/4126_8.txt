What a night. Perry Mason then has Have Gun, Will Travel, followed by Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour) and finally at 10:30 pm, Sea Hunt with his wonderful opening theme and Mike's boat leaving for a new adventure. Terrific .. No matter the story, it was the main character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. A man and a boy. This sparked an interest in boats that lasted for years. Why they do not show on the cable or make it available on video, no idea .. Too bad.
