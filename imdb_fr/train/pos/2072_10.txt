I was about thirteen when this movie was released on television. It is far superior in action than most movies since. Martin Sheen is excellent and, although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also provides excellent support. Vic Morrow as a villain is superb. <br /> <br /> When Sheen "tests the water" in her Ford '34 (COOL) along the mountainous road, the situation is spectacular! <br /> <br /> Great. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed by the low vote this has received. I think younger generations are more interested in most of the waste that comes out these days. <br /> <br /> Good taste escapes the masses!
