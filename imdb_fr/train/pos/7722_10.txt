It is a film that has everything to please: the dashing hero, the beautiful young lady in distress, the noble figure with the tragic fault and a really wonderful robot. Forbidden Planet has maintained this special magic over the years and does not lose its flavor through repeated viewing (although the sex appeal of the young Anne Francis helps considerably in this regard). <br /> <br /> Movie fans will recognize the young Leslie Nielsen portraying the handsome and heroic Commander Adams, though those of us who love him so much for comic roles may be a little surprised by his appearance in a serious role. Walter Pidgeon, a distinguished and noble man, is also a star actor as a scientist with a secret (Id). The other actors deserve a nod, especially Warren Stevens as an ingenious and resourceful "Doc" and, of course, Miss Francis's charms, as noted above. <br /> <br /> This film was one of the pioneers of the use of electronic music, in the 1950s, no less. The credits call them "tones", but those of us who have tried to tinker together the first versions of the device "Theremin" will recognize the wheezing and cries sinister and spooky sometimes used in the soundtrack. This nevertheless gives the image of the exotic and strange landscape of the mysterious and threatening world of Krell. <br /> <br /> The special effects are also striking. I remember my fear as a youth waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible monster "Id", and when it is finally visualized in a battle scene, it literally shakes me on my feet, marveling and marveling. The magic of dull art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the Krell Science Complex, as the characters weave their way through the various labyrinths and passages, guided by the enigmatic Dr. Morbius. <br /> <br /> Jealously, Dr. Morbius would have such a cool Robby-shaped toy robot. Robby's character is quite charming and, in some ways, he seems more human than some of the other characters. Watchers of upcoming shows such as Twilight Zone and Lost In Space will recognize Robby's recycled accessories in some of these episodes, although I remember he never had the "personality" of the original Robby. <br /> <br /> I must admit to not fully understanding the intricacies of the plot until I am old enough to understand the various references to Freudian psychology and the danger of releasing fears and rabies hidden and normally contained that we carry within us but we trained, by the force of the will, to: submerge and control by the respect of the codes of the society. Although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed, it remains unknown (or perhaps deliberately neglected) by Dr. Morbius until it is flagged by the clairvoyant commander Adams, who forces Dr. Morbius to to face evil in himself. It still gives me goosebumps when Commander Adams pushes Dr. Morbius in front of Krell's machine that gave him a superior intellect that opened the doors of his subconscious to the power of the Krell machine: "Here, here's where your The mind was artificially enlarged.Consciously, there was still no power to make the Great Machine work, but your subconscious had been strengthened enough. "Zowee! <br /> <br /> Forbidden Planet is probably my favorite sci-fi movie, and remains timeless and classic for its neat story, beautiful visualization and onscreen realization.
