I have just seen this movie again after thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old and I caught this film on South Beach at the Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought where he is! It was a very good movie. Now, however, after almost forty years, it's not as good as it was. Times have changed, and this film is now an old fuss tired of the war between the generations. He has, however, taken a place in time which is only a memory. It's really interesting to see modern fashion, old Vegas, a thin Don Rickles, smoking in the chain and a hip opening song. The acting was ok, the scenario somewhat outdated, but the memories were still fresh. This may not be the place for you, but for me it was a fun and entertaining trip in the past.
