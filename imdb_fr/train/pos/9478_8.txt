It's a nice little movie with a beautiful story, which plays the most important role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's a rather intriguing dramatic story, with a romance too. The story is told slowly, but it works too well for its construction. The characters are nice and well portrayed by his actors. Normally, I'm not a big fan of Asian acting style, but the role in this movie was just good. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is quite different in its approach and style from the other genre films produced in the west. In a way, this film is already more advanced with its approach than Western films made at the same time. <br /> <br /> I only wanted the style of his film to be a little better. For a film that is considered a sort of artist's film, this film certainly lacks pretty sequences. It was obviously a pretty cheap movie to do and it was done in a generic way. Not that it's a bad thing, it just prevents this film from really distinguishing itself and rising above the genre. <br /> <br /> But hey, this movie talks about his well-built story and the characters that are in it. In this respect, this film certainly does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
