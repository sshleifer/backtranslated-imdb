I have not seen all of Chan's films, but it's certainly the best movie I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The story itself is nothing special, so I will have won. do not go further in that. What makes him special are the stunts, the fighting, the good acting, the sense of humor. The film has a tempo raging from the beginning and you are amazed to see it. All the cool stunts (of course made by Jackie himself) make you want to jump on the couch and scream. It's just great! Even my mother was impressed by this awesome movie when she saw it. <br /> <br /> I know this police story can be a bit difficult to understand, at least it's here in Sweden. But I can assure you that it is worth trying.
