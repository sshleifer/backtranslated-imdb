Sitting, typing ?? Nothing is the last "and if?" festival offered by Vincenzio Natali and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One of them has relationship problems, has been canned (because of relationship problems) and the police are looking for him (because of his work and his relationship problems). The other is an agoraphobic who refuses to leave his home, is met by an annoying guide who calls his mother to say that she was assaulted while he does not buy biscuits. Oh yes, the police are also suing him after the mother of the scout called them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Man, what a day. <br /> <br /> And if you could do it all disappear? This is the premise behind "Nothing". The two fools realize, the cops, the scout, the cars, the lawn, the road, all? disappear. There is only white space! It's an interesting concept, I thought. I also watched the time of this film, 30 minutes had passed in the film and I still had an hour. Could both actors do this work and entertain us for 60 minutes? Although the actors have tried, 60 minutes is long, and there is clearly a dead air in the scene of this film. But the two actors, who have always been friends and the director, have such a large repertoire that it was fun to watch the dialogue and improve the blunders around the stage. There are many supernatural elements, but it is especially their response to these elements that finally makes this film worthy of interest.
