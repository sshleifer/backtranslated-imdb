The realization of this film was fantastic for a comedy. Many scenes seem to come out of a comic and much darker (visually - not from the point of view of stories) than I expected. Admittedly, this may not be the funniest movie ever, especially if you like very crude sexist jokes, because it has very little (compared to other movies like Something About Mary or American Pie) . As you revisit, several jokes stand out and become more funny. If you've ever read a comic or watched a comic-type movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and loved them, you'll probably enjoy the subtle humor that lingers throughout the movie. If you did not like them, you might like the respectful ridicule this film has for those. If you liked this movie, the DVD contains interesting extras. (8/10)
