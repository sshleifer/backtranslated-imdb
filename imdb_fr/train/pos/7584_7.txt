This PM Entertainment production contains enough balls for John Woo to say, "Enough already!" Of course, it's not as beautiful as what Woo can offer, but the work is done in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover police officer in the near future. When his wife is accused of murdering the governor by a team using a similar cyborg, it is up to Eric to clarify his name. Wilson draws the homework of Van Damme as he plays the heroic main role and his demonic cyborg, Doppelganger. Why the Academy did not take notice, it is beyond me. Being a particle production, there are tons of car chases, cars exploding (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shots on goal. I particularly liked the van that swings through the air before even touching a truck exploding. My other favorite game involved a local girl who came to perfect her karate in Don's simulator. It's just a chance to show some cheap LAWNMOWER MAN effects around 1995.
