Mitchell Leisen's fifth feature film as director, he shows his versatility in directing a musical, his previous films being heavy dramas. He also plays a role of conductor. <br /> <br /> You can see that this is a pre-code movie, and nothing looks like it was produced in the US for a long time ( as over 30 years old). Leisen pulled the musical numbers to look like what the audience would see - no big screen shots or top shots, for example, Busby Berkeley. What I find funny or interesting is that you never see the audience. <br /> <br /> As others have already mentioned, the lead roles are relatively devoid of character, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie characters. Gertrude Michael, however, provides a little spark. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are interesting and some good (the Rape of the Rhapsody in particular is fun) but the drama is unconvincing and factitious - three murders are too numerous and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could have been a lot better.
