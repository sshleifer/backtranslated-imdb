The story and the music (George Gershwin!) Are wonderful, just like the Levant, Guetary, Foch and, of course, Kelly. One thing is missing, and this thing is a good main woman. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron bothers me. Anyway, despite it, the plot goes well with the famous Ballet (and rightly). Oh colors, bright reds, blues, greens and yellows. Do not forget the beiges too. ; I love the contrast between the ball of Fine Arts (costumes entirely in black and white) and the very brilliant Ballet. <br /> <br /> So I guess what I'm trying to say is this: certainly, see it and enjoy it, because even if it's not the best, it's WONDERFUL. But do not forget to remember Gene Kelly's other musical with the 20-year-old girl who was propelled to celebrity status just after.
