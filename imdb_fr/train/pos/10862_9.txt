Election is a Chinese crowd movie, or triads in this case. Every two years, an election is held to appoint a new leader. At first, there seems to be a clash between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai or, as I know, "The Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam, who was a judge in full contact!). Although once Lok wins, Big D refuses to accept this choice and does everything in his power to be recognized as a new leader. Unlike all the other Asian movies I watch with gangsters, this one is not an action movie. It has its bloody moments, when necessary, as in Goodfellas, but it's basically a really effective drama. There are a lot of characters, which is really hard to follow, but I think it plays a bit in the madness of it all. A 100-year-old stick, which is the symbol of power I mentioned earlier, changes hands several times before things happen. And although it may seem like the film ends at 65 or 70 minutes, there are still some surprises. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and somehow anchored the image. <br /> <br /> The election was quite a winner at the Hong Kong Film Awards, winning the award for Best Actor (Tony Leung), Best Picture, Best Director (Johnny To, who made Heroic Trio !! ), and best scenario. There were also nominations for cinematography, editing, film music (which I liked a lot) and three other acting performances (including Yam).
