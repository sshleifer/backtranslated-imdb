It's the best image of baseball since Redford bombed The Natural. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths brighten up the screen with a beautiful story and cast that seemed real enough to draw you into their lives. <br /> <br /> Dream Dreams: In reality, the American Dream resumes after 9 November with a true story about the middle-aged rookie of Devil Ray, Jimmy Morris. Australian-born actress Rachel Griffiths plays Western Texas better than many Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection ?? interprets as the winner, the gonnabe and the humble winner, with as much psychological baggage as the average spectator. It is true. On-screen chemistry works. If you like baseball warming, you'll love this movie. The ingredients for Americana and the apple pie were all there. My popcorn has become "fashionable". <br /> <br /> And hey: buy the CD! The music rocks and bears the story beautifully! The synchronization of words and music advances the story exactly as it should, a field that most often disappoints me. <br /> <br /> Criticism: I would have given baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us about the character and the heart. St. Rita and the nuns were a beautiful decoration, but they never really found their place in history to open and close around them. A bit long Value every minute in the last analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
