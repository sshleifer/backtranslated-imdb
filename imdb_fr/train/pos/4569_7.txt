DANIEL DAY-LEWIS plays a remarkable role in the interpretation of Christy Brown, the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy, but managed to lead a productive life, successfully manage his disability and become an artist and a writer respected. <br /> <br /> The film, however, is very difficult to revisit - or even watch. Fortunately, I had the caption function to capture every word uttered that would have been impossible if I had seen the movie in the theater. Although I respect it as a courageous work dealing with difficult topics, I can not say that this is the kind of film I would like to see more than once. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, my attention was retained. by the narrative device, a flashback framed by the present, in which we see Christy being honored for her achievements before seeing the flashback of her youth and her difficulties in communicating with those around her, who certainly took him with love. DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is certainly remarkable as a troubled man who falls in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), much to the fear of his mother to fear that her heart will not break. There is a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love before others, then enters a furious fury after drinking too much. <br /> <br /> BRENDA FRICKER does a great job as a caring mother. , his father and a sibling sibling, struggling to keep a roof over their heads until Day-Lewis begins to be successful with his work. She complements Day-Lewis's performance as a warm-hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him. <br /> <br /> The richly detailed story of a family who stayed together in the most unusual circumstances, with special attention to period details. each image of the film. Fricker and Day-Lewis both won the Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor is Christy as a boy and McAnally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but who loves the boy. <br /> <br /> In summary: Elmer Bernstein's music is one more factor. Very useful, but certainly not a movie for everyone.
