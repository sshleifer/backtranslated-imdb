A haunting piece on which the discerning movie buff will fall with gratitude. Keep your Freddys and Jasons - this film is in the same company as "The Haunting" (the original). Lyrical and truthful, he stays with you until late in the night, like the terrifying shows of CBS Radio Mystery Theater. Smart rent.
