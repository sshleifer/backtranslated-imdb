people claim that his editing is funny, but they had to reduce it considerably in post-production. I currently have harry as a teacher at ucsd and, honestly, this is one of the best classes I've had, it's kind of funny to tell here what happened when you created the movie because Harry is so animated. Originally, I watched "Joy of Life" during another class, where Harry had made a voice in the movie and started watching this movie after starting the class. Harry originally did a performance job, and he's really sincere about creating moments that affect you, especially when you have to re-edit things until you hit that moment, but that's something that you see in this movie.
