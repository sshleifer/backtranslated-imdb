The film was like a presentation of "Immoral Study". Most likely, I have never really been involved in the burning need of the female artist to immortalize the male nudes and therefore, all that fuss around "Now who drew this penis ?!" sounded a little free. The dialogues in this film are rather awful, even if visually, this film has its moments. I almost dug it out when Tassi started painting a mental picture, but the film was then sent back to the penis. Highly recommended for those who have not seen it for a long time.
