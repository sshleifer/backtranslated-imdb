Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out at about the same time as the Challenger explosion. Which really put a brake on when to take it out or even if they should, to take it out. I'm glad they did it. I first watched SpaceCamp at a drive-in movie. Which has greatly improved the viewing. <br /> <br /> While I had heard about Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I had never heard of others in the film. So, it was a shock for me to find all these young people who play and who act really well! Of course, Kate Capshaw was excellent too. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the scenes where these children were shown how to play as a team. Children's preparation scenes for a trip they could only hope for. The launch of a spaceship is of course an old news for us. However, this one was different. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of my most precious films. Escapist maybe, but it was fantastic for a space maniac like me. After probably renting it 30 to 40 times. I finally found it available in a certain store and bought it. Now, if it only comes out on DVD. I will probably have it forever. This film receives a 9 out of 10 of me.
