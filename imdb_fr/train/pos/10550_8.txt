I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it puzzles me not to have a distributor in the UK. In fact, this is not the case, because this film is all that a Hollywood film is not original, creative, offbeat and humorous. It seems that today, no one really wants to see this type of film because, in the simplest terms, it does not conform to the generic conventions that most young viewers look for in a movie. <br /> <br /> I did not write a review for the IMDb for a long time, but I wanted to give a special mention to this movie, even if it's during my 30-minute break between lessons! It is essentially nothing, the two main characters being immersed in their own world of nothingness through a hatred of the world. The interest here is in the way the director maintains interest for most of the run time with only two characters and when the only staging consists of a half-house and a vast empty white space. This is largely due to the stellar performances of the actors, both of which offer very good laughs while being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles. <br /> <br /> I would like to write a little more but I am on a time limit. However, I encourage everyone to try this movie. A very unique concept is presented on the screen in a coherent and well executed way, with the combination of good performances, a strong script, a nice sound design and (quite) impressive visuals to create a very beautiful film. entertaining. <br /> <br /> It's just a pity that few people know anything ...
