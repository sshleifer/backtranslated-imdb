I saw this film at the Brussels International Film Festival. I also met the director of the film. I heard that Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thought it would be his masterpiece - his triumph. <br /> <br /> Well, if you take the film seriously (as Mr. Wood did), it's really one of the worst movies you'll ever see. And it's cool. The big joke I woke up early the day of my death is that he does not even try to be a decent movie. <br /> <br /> This makes the movie very, very good. The screenplay is filled with nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. The role of Billy Zane is absolutely excellent. You see, it's either great art ... or hogwash. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
