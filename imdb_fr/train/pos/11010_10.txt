When The Matrix first appeared in 1999 and challenged existence and identity, it was expected that many films would be inspired by it. Surprisingly, this did not happen and it was not until 2002 that a film on the same theme appeared. But to say that Cypher is a clone would be a discredit. <br /> <br /> The story is that of Morgan Sullivan, who is applying for a position in a high-tech techno company called Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and obtain information about a competing business, under a supposed and false identity. His family life is perfectly normal, but he has to lie to his wife about what he does. However, things start to turn conspiracy and, before knowing what is happening, he begins to wonder who he really is. It does not help a strange woman who shows up ... <br /> <br /> Twists in all directions fascinate you and nothing ever seems artificial or incredible. <br /> <It's an exciting journey through a future not too far away, and with good action you'll keep on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
