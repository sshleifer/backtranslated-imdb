I still love her 17 years or more after the first time I saw her. In fact, I discovered that I had lost my copy and that I was very upset. Despite his non-association with the original (which I had never noticed as a child and I did not care about the adult), this is what the cartoon should look like. Just dark enough to be interesting and light enough for everyone to enjoy. I am more than happy that my parents raised me with this kind of thing rather than with the caricatures we see today that teach nothing to our children. The music is great and stays stuck in your head forever ... I downloaded the whole soundtrack at one time or another.
