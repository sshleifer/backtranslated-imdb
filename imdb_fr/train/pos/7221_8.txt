Whenever you think of mastering Deathtrap, another plot comes up. The best is to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this one. Best known for his on-screen kiss between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (which was unfortunately cut from the TV version I saw), this movie has many other things to recommend. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine)) is a very unhappy man. Once a successful playwright, his last plays on Broadway failed. And although his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) only provides support, both financially and emotionally, it does little to make Sidney feel better. Young playwright Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) has just sent a play to watch. This is Anderson's first, and Sidney can see that the young man is a talented writer. He jokes to his wife that he should invite Anderson, kill him and submit the piece as his. She laughs with him at first, but when Sidney actually invites Anderson to dinner, she fears that he will really put his plan into action. And his fears may be justified ... <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant scenario. There are twists and turns throughout the plot, and they come faster and more furious as you get closer to the end. This is the kind of film that puts you right from the start on the edge of your seat and keeps you there all the time. An absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery. <br /> <br /> The acting game is excellent. Caine gives his excellent usual performance, and he shows a talent for playing cultured, refined and intellectual men. Reeve also gives an excellent rendering of a man who is not as innocent as he seems. Cannon's frenzy works well for Myra. And Irene Worth gives a great performance as a nosy neighbor who is also psychic. <br /> <br /> It's a movie with an unexpected end, and repeated viewing helps find things that have been missed before. visits. An unrecognized classic that we unfortunately remember only for a scene that shook some sensibilities at the time - and it's a shame.
