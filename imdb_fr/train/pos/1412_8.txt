Why on earth should you explore the fascinating documentary about nature "Earth"? How long do you have on earth for me to explain this to you? OK, I'm not going to extend my exploration of the "Earth" to infinity, but I have to stay firm about why it's a must. The documentary makes a natural round-trip on the migratory paths of three animal families: a polar bear woman and her cubs with the real sub-plot of the father bear, daring to hunt him in his isolated path, a whale mum with his baby whale making the trip of a migration like a whale, and an elephant mum with her little offspring (maybe not so small, they are elephants) migrating to Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill and Mark Linfield did an "extravagant" job, capturing the survival skills of many other animal species as well as the magnetic plans of our three protagonists in the animal family. Richard Brooks Burton, Adam Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer, both cinematographically talented, were animals in camera and filmed the wonderful natural sites and instinctive behaviors of animals; not to mention, Slo-mo animals' prey shots were ablaze. "Earth" is also a lesson on the effect of global warming on animals; The polar bear dad in the doc is the animal boy of the poster on this consequence. So fellow citizens, it's time to make the documentary trip to visit "Earth" today! **** Well
