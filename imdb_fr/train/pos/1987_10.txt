This movie was great! I can not finish with his songs. I think I'm a bit too old for musicals, but this movie deserves credit here, guys! My particular favorite was Jack Wild. I, being a lover of the British actor, you can not restrain me from all these beautiful young men with fresh faces. I never knew that when Jack was doing this movie, he was sixteen! He looks like a man of eleven. He's small, that's what helps. Try to post your answers, colleagues, so that I can tell you about your experiences. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, this guy, Bill Sikes, I think this drone is really familiar. An idea of ​​where he played before? If so, post it, I would really like to know.
