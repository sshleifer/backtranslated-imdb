I thought it was necessary to respond to the comments posted on the first page of the page of this film because some were slightly wrong. <br /> <br /> Originally, I posted quotes from the original poster, but I was not sure if it was appropriate since it is the index "comments" and not a bulletin board (although we used it in this way before IMDb added the movie's billboards), so I'm going to edit it to make it useless. <br /> <br /> First of all, you may not know it, but Gene Kelly became famous for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a "panorama" film of Gershwin, he wanted Kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the "goody two shoes" roles he had played in most of his films (with the exception of "For Me and My Gal"). . Alan Jay Lerner was commissioned to build a new scenario in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey". This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous Broadway role even though Warners outbid MGM for the rights of "Pal Joey". In my opinion, WB's "Pal Joey" is a wreck, although Sinatra is suitable for the role, but other problems have shattered the film (script changes and poor direction.) ======== ===== ==================================== <br /> <br /> You you complain Kelly's photos are not well done, even quoting your art education to prove the point.But you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad, and it is necessary for the story The images are so bad that the public knows that Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, even though he knows it, although Milo has almost softened it until he almost believes it. But it's important that the audience does not sit there and say, "But he's a great artist, if he had the chance!" You want the public to be fully aware of its shortcomings. <br /> < Then you complain that he sabo his interest in the show; you do not yet understand the structure of the story, he refuses because he does not want to feel like a gigolo, and because he knows he is not really ready for the show. His enthusiasm for the show is certainly not as big as that of "Joey" for "starting a disco". But that fulfills the same function in the plot. Remember that it's essential in "Pal Joey" (the game) that Joey abandons his nightclub after realizing he does not deserve it. Same with the art exhibition. If Kelly's paintings were really good, it would undermine all of the above. ================================================ /> <br /> Then you complain that Caron and Kelly have no "chemistry". I guess it's in the viewer's eye. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was good. Compare that to worse "forced" romances like the one between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "The Pride and the Passion". ================================================= When you say that the grand finale of the dance has nothing to do with this film, it simply shows that you did not dive under the surface of the film to make it a symbol. Many elements of the dance sequence relate to the story and the characters, and the plot is resolved through images and symbols. It's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks around and his love is gone). The movements of the symphony are constructed in such a way that a part of each dance scene reflects a distinct phase of Parisian art and a distinct phase of their relationships. If you have not seen it, it's not the film's fault. It's certainly not a "crappy load". ===============================================
