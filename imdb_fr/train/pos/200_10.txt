Updated from a previous comment. The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her works in this 1928 mute comedy that also features the marvelous William Haines. Davies is a giant from Georgia who crushes Hollywood with the help of Haines, a little player of coarse comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great drama star. <br /> <br /> A big sieve on Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a great team, and guests include Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Murray Mae, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian and Estelle Taylor. Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (it must be seen) are funny. A must for any serious moviegoer or anyone interested in Marion Davies, always criticized! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is the most sticky man. <br /> <br /> It has been said that SHOW PEOPLE was inspired by Gloria Swanson's career (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film parallels Swanson's rise of comedies to a Mack Sennett reel with Charlie Chaplin in STAR in Cecil B. DeMille. Movies from the late teens and early 20s. Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. Weird that MGM never associated them in a talkie. They are great together! A sweet romance and a charming parody of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear.
