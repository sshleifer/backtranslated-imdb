Fortunately for us, fans of Real McCoy (probably all baby boomers who grew up in the late '50s and' 60s), three of the adult actors / actresses appeared at the meeting in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna are died. shortly thereafter. As pleasant as it was to see Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepino again, was it also mysterious not to mention Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? I understand that Little Luke died in 1999, but I do not know how. I can not find any information about Hassie on the Internet. Very curious to know why they were not even mentioned? It was so blatant, their absence from the Reunion show, that I suspect that Michael's and Lydia's own family (if she is still alive), 1) asked to be left out of the discussion and that their desire was was granted, or 2) TNN found no trace of Michael or Lydia (like all of us), they seemed to have disappeared. Therefore, the safest policy would be to leave them out of the conversation all together. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the retrospective on Walter Brennen was wonderfully successful. They did not make fun of it ... it's Grandpa who made the series so successful. I remember, in my childhood, imitating the march of my grandfather and my parents laughing (as a million other children had done at the time). One inconvenience that bothered me a bit was Richard Crenna's tendency to dominate the discussion ... sometimes interrupting Tony and Kathleen to make a point. In fact, even though Tony Martinez seemed perfectly capable of contributing to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak and say too much during the Reunion show. Too bad, because I wanted to hear all three as well. Overall, the Salon de la RÃ©union was a real treat for me. I watched it several times on DVD and I enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
