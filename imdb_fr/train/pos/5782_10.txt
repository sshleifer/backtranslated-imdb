The Internet database lists this as a television show. And yes, it was a MTV series presented in the "Oddities" program, after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux", if I remember correctly. But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes put together in one movie, with no boring credits or waiting a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. The Maxx is a superhero or a guy, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen less to The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who does not seem to be able to keep his head. And then there are the other strange creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "or" with Maxx and Julie, because a fun part is trying to understand which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. Maybe they are all real or dreams. Maybe one of the characters does not exist. Maybe only one exists and dreams of others. You will have to wait to find out. <br /> <br /> I had the comics before the broadcast of the series and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the story original - unlike anything you find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind and have a strong adult connotation without being obscene or offensive. And the show used essentially the same illustrations (at the moment it moves) and the same story ... guaranteeing that the intrinsic beauty of the comic strip would be faithfully reproduced. It was the best show to appear on "Oddities", hands down. <br /> <br /> If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mental excursion, it's a show to discover. It's "Donnie Darko" before that happens. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is that it never became another movie or TV show, but I do not say that with disappointment. Keeping it simple, they sealed this film in gold and preserved it from imperfections caused by successive failures.
