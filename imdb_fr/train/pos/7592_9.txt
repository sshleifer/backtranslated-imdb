I just watched the movie and wanted to give my own opinion (and justice) to the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, to make things clear, this film does not pretend to be anything but a concrete action. comedy movie. It does not aim to revolutionize the film industry and garner critical acclaim, nor does it want to be considered as such. If you really want to enjoy this movie to the full, I suggest you get rid of your critical thinking and your aspiration to a good plot, because you will not find it here. That being established, let's go further in the film. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a lot of this film, simply because he had no strong plot (yes, moviegoers, I underestimated this film), but I'm not I never expected that I appreciate this movie so much. I even enjoyed it more than Stephen Chow's films (for which I think Kung Fu Hustle is his best effort and I would have rated it 9). The action is tight and epic while comedy chokes in the right places. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS alert, I think the action might be unreal, but why would I still want to watch a serious movie about basketball? There are many other (dramatic) sports films that have already done it well, why create another one? SPOILERS end <br /> <br /> I do not even know why you are reading this. Go ahead and watch it. Remember, do not think - look, enjoy, smile, laugh and <br /> From time to time, they (the film industry) create masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction or The Godfather , and sometimes they create movies that are better in the dump heap. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves recognition from the previous examples. Again, if we talk about Stephen Chow-ish's comedy, this one is one of the top 10. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you love: -No intelligence movie with a very good action -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy -How damn, look at this. you will have a great time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you the distribution of Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
