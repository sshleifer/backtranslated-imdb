I saw this film for the first time when it was released in the United States in 1984. I have seen it many times since. What strikes me in the film is the incorporation of the art of repetition into the lives of the characters and vice versa. Throughout the film, the two intermingle and sometimes we are never too sure whether we look at the lives of the characters or a scene of a rehearsal. This continues until the climax of the film. All these years later, my friends and I still love to discuss the question of whether "Carmen" is really stabbed in the end. From the reactions of other characters to stylized murder, the debate is open. The passion of dance, the quality of the acting, the love of art and the brilliance of the performances combine to create a superb film that, once again, merges and diverts the line of demarcation between life and art.
