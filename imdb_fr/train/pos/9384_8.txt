An excellent example of "black cowboy", in which it is called, in which Michael (Nicolas Cage), unemployed, loses a job because he insists to be honest (his leg is dirty). Having nothing else to do, he decides that for once, he will lie. When he enters a bar and his owner, Wayne (the late, the great JT Walsh), takes him for a hitman that Wayne engaged in his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in great shape), Michael continues to play and accept Waynes money. * Then * he goes to Suzanne and informs her of her husband's intentions and accepts * her * money to get rid of Wayne! If that was not enough to complicate things enough, the big hit, "Lyle from Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, in a perfect role for him), appears and Michael is even more in trouble than before. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" makes the most of the place. Director John Dahl, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Rick, was clever in realizing the potential of a scenario in a small, truly isolated town that may have seen better days and where Residents could be involved in any system. . It's also a fun idea of ​​the kind of problem an honest person might have if she decided to give up her principles and give in to any level of temptation. It's a pretty dark and loaded story, with an assortment of main characters who are otherwise corrupt, at least morally compromised, like Michael. Marc Reshovsky, director of photography, has superb lighting. even the highest point located in a cemetery confers a pleasant morbid quality to the whole. Even if the writing is not particularly "logical or credible", the film is a good way to intrigue the viewer and simply attract attention. <br /> <br /> Cage does a good job in mind, but its co-stars have a great age thrusting their teeth into their fleshy characters and motivated by greed. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are all fun to watch in these areas. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are very good with Walsh's MPs (Walsh is also the local sheriff), and the lead role is played by country and western star Dwight Yoakam, with a great late-night melody. <br /> <br /> This is a good little movie that is worth watching. It is moving at an impressive pace, and nothing else is certainly ever boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
