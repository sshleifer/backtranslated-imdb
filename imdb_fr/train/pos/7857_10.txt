This film does not fail to engage and be moved, even in 2008, in front of an audience only familiar with the modern techniques of modern sound and overmodulation. <br /> <br /> The spectator's experience in 1922 that could only see him. in a cinema with others on the big screen, it had to be really deep and a fully satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> It is necessary to ask a filmmaker to realize today a silent film of two hours, to make it interesting and Same structure and balance as this film. The making of silent films was a pure art, you had to pay attention by its structure, its direction and its acting - there was no way to add words or distractions generated by computer. A silent film that is poorly made or uninteresting is unassailable. <br /> <br /> This film must be put in context for those who might be baffled by the mention of Christian themes. It's not a Christiany movie, it does not sell anything. These themes, as well as the reference to current moral standards, often appear at this time. In addition, Sunday was a national pastime, Christianity was a common sight in most homes, so the film only describes the normal life as it was at the time. The themes would have sounded true and profound at that time. <br /> <br /> It's very strange, given the strong support for the good Christian thought of this particular film (and not to preach religion to anyone, but to emphasize the difference between hypocrites and honest) that in 1922, a pastor, in a public debate with a representative of the film industry and a large crowd, denounced Pickford as an example of immorality, as well as others he named. NY Times 1922. <br /> <br /> Perhaps they should have watched this film also released in 1922 and draw some lessons. <br /> <br /> The pastor complained that the church had started since the movie industry had started attendance had dropped by 500,000 people. The representative of the film in the debate, however, made the following observations: that the attendance at the salons has also decreased, that there are many more pastors in prison than actors and that the choice of some examples among many others was not representative of the whole. <br /> <br /> battle between the church and the film industry during the film's debut. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film about honesty and loyalty to family friends and the desire to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, brave, full of joy and joy, faithful, humorous and sacrificing in silence - though poor and uneducated, she was the perfect character. This is not imposed on us, but we discover it little by little through the film. <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of some modern Chinese movies where the characters are revealed slowly, languorously over the film. tempo that creates a stronger bond with the character. <br /> <br /> It has a smooth tempo for the first half that builds all the elements of the last section. The last 30 minutes are an excellent cinematic realization and we must understand that it was made without sound, without dialogue - it was performed by a skilful staging and an excellent staging. It is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the movie you have not heard of it, but you feel like you have heard everything. <br /> <br /> The support cast played great performances, including Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last minutes are typical of Pickford's sober humor coming out under the pretext of sweeping the snow, balancing and ending almost perfect. It's a special kind of touching humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin often used this device and copied some of it from Pickford. <br /> <br /> Another special observation to make about silent films and especially Pickford is that the star must often hold the camera for most of the film without a public become jaded or bored, with overexposure of the actors. The fact that Pickford is usually the center of attention in most of his films, but that people do not have enough, is a proof of his acting skills.
