As another IMDB critic has noted, the film starts a little slowly, but improves dramatically as you go along. Yes, it is published by Roger Corman, and it addresses some of the same themes as much more ambitious predecessors, such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the juxtaposition of the woman's career as a rising blues singer in the face of the growing loneliness of the husband and her almost Freudian need to fill the "void" or the "hole" physically and emotionally when she is absent and Well done. Using a very small number of places and characters, and using water in almost every scene at once as a purifying and drowning metaphorical symbol, the film, while having a tiny budget, reminds me in many ways of more fully realized and more recent scenario, namely the French film "SWIMMING POOL" which, it seems to me at least, could borrow generously useful ideas to "UP AGAINST AMANDA". With a smaller set of tools, UP AGAINST AMANDA maintains its suspense with a rudimentary and fatalistic view of submission to occasional lustful temptations, but achieves it as well or better than other films of this kind. The turn of abuse by Amanda's stepfather in the past (again, very Freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic response to Amanda's fate sparked by this aspect of the story. The casting is excellent I think. <br /> <br />
