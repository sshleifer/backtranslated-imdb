Well "Wayne's World" has long since disappeared and the past few years have been difficult for filmed films. From movie subscriptions like "It's Pat" to the recent 80-minute yawn, "A Night at the Roxbury", many have undoubtedly lost the conviction that another snl skit would never make the transition to the big screen. Well, do not worry, because Tim Meadows shovels. the well-written plot keeps the interest of the audience until the very end and if it remains faithful to the character of Leon Phelps presented in the skit of five minutes, the scenario allows the character to develop. the humor (composed largely of sexual jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh louder than in any recent memory movie. it's just a good time if you do not want to take yourself too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen, of the fame "Saved by the Bell", makes an appearance in the film and seems incredible. Finally, Billy Dee Williams, reliving his 45-day Colt, gives the movie a touch of class. and for those who are brainwashed moviegoers like me, you'll find this film eminently legible: "Oh, she's a lady!"
