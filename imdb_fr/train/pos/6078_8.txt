I was particularly pleased that in this film, Othello has dark skin and Desdemona does not have blond hair, as always. The actors also played very well and I liked the script that follows the original text of Shakespeare with such fidelity. But I must say that some scenes have been played too erotic for a character such as Desdemona. I always thought she was very modest, and that's why it's not at all appropriate to show her in bed with Cassio, although this only happens in Othello's imagination. At first, I was even a little surprised that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But overall, I liked the movie and especially Desdemona crying in the scene of death.
