I sat down to watch this film with a lot of apprehension and little hope. I did not think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject. But that's quite the case, and then some. First, I must say that Jared Harris did an amazing job as John Lennon. Sometimes it seemed that Harris was channeling Lennon. The resemblance was often strange, and he clearly studied Lennon's vocal manners and inflections. Aiden Quinn was good enough as McCartney, also very much like Macca, even though he stumbled from time to time on his Scouse accent. <br /> <br /> This fictional work was well written and well directed. It was pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole during this reunion. The rooftop scene was particularly moving, as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard in childhood - that he was dignified and important, and that nothing could be his fault if his parents had given up. I also enjoyed the stage in the park where they both danced with absolute surrender to the reggae band! <br /> <br /> My only complaint would be that: I'm not so sure that John is as caustic as him. portrayed in the film at this stage of his life. He had adapted quite well to his family situation and he was actually known to be quite sympathetic to the approach of the fans. Only a few years later, he was very friendly when his assassin approached him for an autograph on the day of his assassination. <br /> <br /> This film was mainly used to stir up these feelings again about what could have been John had lived a little longer. I'm sure the Beatles would be back together at one point. And I'm sure Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done, VH1. I will watch it again and again. <br /> <br />
