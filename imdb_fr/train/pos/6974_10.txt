I recently saw Caprica and thought I could write a review as well! I saw it for the first time just after watching the finale of the Battlestar Galactica series (being a big fan talkative fan of the series left me hooked to all I could from the universe of the series) then I did not know what to expect ... but I came out with a smile even if I have to admit it ... <br /> <br /> The story begins dramatically on the planet Caprica and we presents a variety of interesting characters ... I will not give too much, but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of history, but I suggest you look at this. <br /> <br /> Must say ... Esai Morales is a hell of an actor, he kidnapped a young Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral's father at Battlestar Galactica) I found his acting job and I could believe he was the father of William Adama of BSG ... <br /> <br /> Also Eric Stoltz is perfect for his role. ..! Special note, it was good to see Polly Walker outside of Rome! Do not sit down and do not look at Caprica with the expectation that it looks like Battlestar Galactica because the storyline is pretty simple and anyone can watch it ... without having to see BSG! <br /> <br /> This show is a well written drama for those who love their drama with a sci-fi kick!
