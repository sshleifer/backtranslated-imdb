A very high level story in Columbo which was actually the first episode of the long series, but which was originally transmitted second (after "Murder By The Book"). <br /> <br /> Robert Culp realizes his first of three appearances as a guest murderer in the series and embodies the owner of a private detective agency, which blackmails the wife (Patricia Crowley) of a rich and influential businessman (played with great sympathy by Ray Milland) after he falsified a report in his favor after it was discovered that she had an affair. The wife later rebels against the blackmail system but is killed in a fit of rage .... <br /> <br /> An episode very satisfying in many ways, especially since the plot is so strongly put in place, then developed and also because of the rare ingredient Columbo that the crime is an unpremeditated murder. Everything is further strengthened when the widowed husband uses the assassin to assist Columbo in his investigations: an element that facilitates many good quality scenes, especially in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and the crucial qualities of Columbo are wonderfully highlighted. <br /> <br /> Led brilliantly by Bernard L. Kowalski and reached an appropriate level, this really sets the tone for the whole series (since "Murder By the Book" was abandoned by a mediocre end). The storyline of Richard Levinson and William Link, creators of Columbo, is precise, well structured and thoughtful. It is based on a sustained and productive rhythm and on significant sequences that testify to the unpredictability of history. In the end, the final rightly embodies the fact that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the killer. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a very nice detective work for Columbo, and strongly suggests that the production team had worked positively and constructively to make a polished history of Columbo .
