It was without a doubt the most disturbing film I have ever seen. The first part of the film, although strange, has a light and amusing quality. The journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and highlighting the beauty of the Appalachian Hills. But it's misleading beyond belief. The obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the inhabitants of the countryside are only the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby moan with pain and I shudder at this thought. Lewis's leg made me wince. However, while the film was generally very disturbing and painful, it posed some interesting questions. When is it moral or just to take another person's life? What does morality cause us to do or not to do in some cases? And are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever the conclusions that can be drawn from the film, it is a feat in itself (despite some frighteningly real and macabre aspects).
