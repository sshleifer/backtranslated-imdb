This film, although apparently based on a film of the same title released in 1951 by MGM and starring Janet Leigh, is still an excellent film. Danny Glover, in one of his best performances, brings to life George Knox, a lucky baseball coach. When it comes to "superimposing" this film, how about adding Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience works and shines through on-screen performances, a great actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Sun Rock) ), Brenda Fricker (a charming and seasoned Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes even though he is good in this movie), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may be not so crucial in this film, but he had publicity), Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthew McConaughey is the same for Adrien, with the exception of Dazed and Confused), big players like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Wilder Ranch), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and a seasoned veteran in one of his last performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, owner of the California Angels ), and the rest of the cast do an excellent job, as well as a beautiful rio I do not care what period of depression you are in. I loved it. filming like a kid, and it reminds me of memories when I watch it today. I need this on DVD. I recommend it to all parents who are looking for something that their children have not seen, and to all the others for that matter.
