I'll give it to you right away ... this movie is amazing. Foreign gay films so quickly surpass American gay films as quality actors and films. While so many American homosexual films are grainy, bad sound, amateur actors, trivial intrigues and a surprising lack of nudity or eroticism, gay movies of high quality are multiplying like this one in France . the cinematography is beautiful, thought, meaningful. the story is mature and complex (but it's not difficult for anyone to follow), the acting is intense and professional. the two main roles are fantastic, as well as all the actors. the boys are more than beautiful and there is a lot of frontal nudity. you follow the whole year of these boys, from their meeting to the end. all the little nuances of a relationship, the details of the fall and fall of love are magnificently interpreted. it left me wanting more. Check it out!
