I am disappointed by the lack of comments on this amazing and effective little movie. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role as Diego in Ted Demme's "Blow", writes, directs and stars. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal any point of the plot, as the movie (at least for me) was very exciting to know nothing about it .. If you have a netflix account, or if you have access to a video store that would wear it ... I highly recommend it. It's a crazy, fun and sometimes inspiring creation. <br /> <br /> The orientation of Mollà is * pretty * impressive and promising. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with amazing images and a "no somos nadie" (God is in the air) is an amazing movie that you can show to your friends. <br /> <br /> TO SEE.
