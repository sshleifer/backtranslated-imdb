Six degrees had hung me up. I was anxiously waiting for this to happen and was totally disappointed when Men in Trees replaced his time station. I thought it was just a break and that I would be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised that it ended. We could relate to characters who had real problems. We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters. There was no one in the series I did not like and who thought the acting was superb. I still like seeing programs recorded in cities where you can identify local areas. For my part, I would like to protest the cancellation of this program and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give him a good time slot, do not move him from today to date, and advertise so people know he's active.
