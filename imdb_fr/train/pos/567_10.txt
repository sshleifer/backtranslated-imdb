Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann have teamed up to create some of the best westerns ever made, making it one of the best. <br /> <br /> The real star of the film, however, is the spectacular Canadian Rockies that serve as a backdrop to the story. Some of the best cinematography ever made in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> In the five Westerns that Stewart and Mann did together, the side roles were perfectly blended. There is no exception here, even in passages where there are only a few lines, the characters are firmly engraved. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a cynical and tough loner in this movie whose only real friend is his sidekick Walter Brennan. It is Brennan's death in the hands of the wicked that drives him to finally want to free the gold from the wicked and redeem himself at the same time. <br /> <br /> John McIntire is the main villain of the play and he was an underrated actor with a wide range. He could play with delicious old codgers, authority figures and in this case a particularly naughty and cunning villain. <br /> <br /> One of the best westerns of all time.
