It's my favorite movie EVER. I watched it at least 10 times and I cry every time. My family begs me not to look at it so that I do not cry. I think I like the fact that it's a true story written by Antwone himself, just as much as I like the movie. The acting is great, and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie he has done so far. I took care of a little boy who was also born in prison. He was the most precious little boy I have ever met. He has now been adopted by a wonderful family who has fought for him for almost two years. I saw this film as the fight continued and its future was uncertain and I am so happy that it is safe and loved. And I'm so happy that Antwone is happy and has found his family. <br /> <br /> I would like to know more about him and the situation since his meeting with his family. I can not say enough good things about it!
