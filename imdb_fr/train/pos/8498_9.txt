It is a wonderful film with a funny and intelligent story, the dynamics of cultural differences and the recurring theme of what is important in life, make it a very underrated film. Do not let the cynics of the world dissuade you from seeing him. Keaton has wonderful moments and I wonder about the fact that comedy is never appreciated, because actors like Keaton make the passage of humor seriously. Great movie all around!
