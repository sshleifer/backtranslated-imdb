The third and last film of this trilogy is finally clear. It's a political film more than just entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures inflicted on him to kill his former identity: he really killed someone who became his corpse. But the film finally reveals that all this had been planned and planned by the CIA as part of a Blackfriars program, also revealed in this film as aimed at eliminating all American citizens who tried to prevent control of the entire society by a limited group of people. Who was a key CIA officer until 1980, when he became vice-president? It goes with what is being said on the Internet. Then the truth will come through Jason Bourne himself, but the main person who will be able to convey this truth to the public and the only authority that can make a decision about the CIA is a woman and this woman gets the Senate involved in a General investigation. A woman and the senate; read on my lips. In the United States, politics is fought in the media and two media are essential to any presidential campaign: music and cinema. Right now, in Hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia, academics and intellectuals are using film in general, and this film in particular, to convey to the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the Senate . So go see the movie. It's quite funny and it has the sweet smell of the end of a period and the big change that some are waiting for and others are waiting for, but no one can claim that it will not come: the only point is how Deep and serious, he will be. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
