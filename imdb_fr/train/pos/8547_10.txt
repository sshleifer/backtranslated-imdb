Many people have hated this movie, but I blame it on two facts - 1 - They want it to be too much like the first movies of American Pie. and 2 - they try to take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> This one I found was the best of six, and I love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I'll say it, but what a comedy for teenagers is not it? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds, etc., they are all incredibly predictable, but still funny! I say it's worth watching, I love it, I find it hilarious. Just do not look at it by comparing it to the first because it's not the same. <br /> <br /> After watching Naked Mile and this one, it became clear that all American Pie movies were about, and pretty much, the stiflers. Which is good by me. <br /> <br /> Look. Enjoy. Love. xD
