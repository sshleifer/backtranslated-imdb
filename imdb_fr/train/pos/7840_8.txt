BORN TO BOOGIE is a real "find". Although I've been a fan of rock for almost thirty years, I saw it for the first time a few days ago and I rank it among the best rock movies of all time. the music is fantastic (T. Rex's cream) and the visuals are always exciting and unusual, leaving the viewer lacking the efforts of the previous director, Ringo Starr, who did an excellent job here. If you like music, you'll be in T. Rextasy, because Marc Bolan is really the star of the play, front and center. Even the fact that some songs are repeated does not matter: different locations, costumes, musical arrangements and weird visual concepts are all used to impart different textures and a lot of optimistic humor to what could have become 'a film of concert in other hands. As rich and well packaged as BORN TO BOOGIE, the film only lasts about an hour, but the result is quite satisfactory. That's where my only criticism lies: the video says something like 71 minutes and at least one online source says the movie lasts 67 minutes, but apparently it's more like 61 minutes of fun.
