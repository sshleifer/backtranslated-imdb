It's about the same league as `The Black Cat ', although I give it a 9 rather than a 9+. It is a praise for a film so little known that it is incredible! <br /> <br /> "The Invisible Ray" is both a horror film, a dramatic film and, on the other hand, a science fiction play. For a film made in 1936, the elements of science fiction had a considerable advance on their time. The mixture of horror, drama and science fiction is a perfect mix, while the actor role of Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer sums up many of the things that James Whale does so often. What I'm saying is that this film is strange and well shot. The scene with the gargoyles outside Lugosi's room is a perfect example of the atmosphere. This is a highlight in the film, which is sorely lacking in the movies of the genre. <br /> <br /> As with `The Black Cat 'and' Island of Lost Souls', I do not understand why the movie is not released on DVD yet. If you consider that some of the garbage that has already been transferred to DVD is even more disconcerting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this movie if you have the opportunity. Once released on DVD, grab it quickly and place it in a privileged location in your DVD library.
