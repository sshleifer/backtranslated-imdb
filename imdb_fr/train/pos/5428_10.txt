My favorite movie "Imperialism" and one of the best action-adventure movies of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with daring and judicious gaps to satisfy all moviegoers, with the exception of the more "PC". Memorable scenes abound - the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting hundreds of thugs; MacChesney & Cutter giving Bobby Coote the enriched punch ("keep it for the elephant"); Cutter to MacChesney - "I am an expedition"; Din Breeze Prison Cutter with a Fork ("What do you think I want to break up? A bloody pudding ?!) And the incredible scene of the temple with Cutter singing and then announcing, bold as brazen -" Okay, you are all under arrest! "<br /> <br /> I could go on, but suffice it to say that I try to catch this movie at any time." For armchair adventurers and generals, it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours .
