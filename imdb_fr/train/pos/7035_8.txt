Cusack does his best David Niven in this one, although I do not know if anyone other than me has noticed. <br /> <br /> When you see it this way, it's deliciously too saturated, it wants to be taken more seriously. that the powers of Austin, but that it is still pretty, resume with humor the reinterpretation of a classic of the underrated comedy. <br /> <br /> Hillary Duff makes a more sexualized version of Britney Spears in the lap dance version of Mata Bond. The writers have built a small Oedipus overturn in the plot - an interesting choice. <br /> <br /> I did not know how soothing Montel's voice was before this movie ... I think he found a new call by doing voiceover with the navigation system!
