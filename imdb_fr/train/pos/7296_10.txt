There is no relationship between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both are police series on violent crimes. Profiler looks crisp, Fortier looks classic. The profiler charts are pretty simple. The plot of Fortier is much more complicated ... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we must spot similarities ... The main character is weak and weird, but has a "clairvoyance". People like to compare, judge, evaluate. Why not just enjoy? It's funny too, people who write Fortier have an American look, but on the other hand, they prefer the American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The acting is not superficial at all ...
