I waited and waited for this film to come out, the trailers seemed to be on for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies again and again, but I'm looking forward to this so that all buy! He's not a big fan of Jim, but it suited him perfectly, there was so much to see and the "feel good" factor is out of the ordinary, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron did a fabulous job of turning that into a movie. If you have not seen it, do it, if you have already seen it, I know you want it!
