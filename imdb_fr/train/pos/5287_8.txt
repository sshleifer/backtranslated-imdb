This is one of the many caricatures with Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian - and a space dog called K-9 is also included. This episode of Looney Tunes is very funny, with a pretty good cartoon animation (the animation of Marvin is very well done) and the plot is well done. The end is rather strange, so be prepared, it's a little boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin the Martian was sent to Earth to capture a terrestrial creature and bring it back to Mars. With his faithful K-9 dog, Marvin leaves and soon finds no trace of another rabbit, with the exception of Bugs Bunny! He greets them with treats, thinking they are clever or evil in their costumes. He hardly realizes they are getting ready to take this rabbit to Mars ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode to anyone who loves Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Looney Tunes in general. As for the beginning and the middle of the episode, you will probably like that. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
