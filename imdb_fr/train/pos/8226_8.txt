We are talking about a low budget movie, and it is understandable that there are weaknesses (no spoilers: a sudden explosive expert and a meaningless alcoholic); but in general, the story holds your interest, most of the characters are nice and there are original situations. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that surprise you with people who are not the ones they want you to believe, then who twist and turn the plot ... I applaud that one . <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens), an Argentinean film.
