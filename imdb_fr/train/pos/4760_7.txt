Well, I gave a 7 to this movie. It was better than "Thirdspace" but not as good as "In the beginning" when it comes to B5 movies. I really think that the television series has done a much better job overall with the special effects and the representation of the characters. Hopefully the producers and actors will have the next series "Crusade" to meet the standards of B5.
