THE MATADOR is a blockbuster movie, if you can say the same about a blockbuster movie. Violence is never really shown but often introduced. At first, I was afraid to find myself in a new black comedy of the mid-90s, but he was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a sweet and funny story of friendship. Nothing very exciting happens in this film, but every detail makes me smile. All three films showcase the best chemistry on the big screen in recent years and it looks like they had a lot of fun doing this movie together. The writing is clear, but sometimes it felt like the script had been adapted from a play because of the defined dialogue scenes. It's a good movie that I probably will not remember too long, but at the time it was a total joy. Good movie.
