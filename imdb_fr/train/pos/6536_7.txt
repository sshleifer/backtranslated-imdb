Let's face it; Nancy Drew has never been a great literature. It's in the same category as the babysitter club, the Magic Tree House, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original stories of the formula. Nancy is perfect, pretty, thoughtful, "nice", never has internal conflicts! and never change. Ned is pretty much the same. The film was true to this style and I must say that I liked it. It will never be a good movie, but it has the same nostalgic flavor as the books. There was enough suspense for my kids (8 and 10 years old). There was almost no vulgar language. I liked the efforts for a more conservative outfit. <br /> <br /> Corky was a bit embarrassing. He was a little out of place on a high school campus. I never really understood why he was there in the first place.
