Although I have not seen this mini-series for more than twenty years, I can always remember how the balance between the character, the plot and the story of wonderful adventures has succeeded. The use of special effects has been restricted to allow a more poetic than literal narrative of the story. The two versions I saw were dubbed (English and French), but the actors seem to speak their own language and not only Italian, which poses a problem of synchronization. It does not spoil the story. Among the actors, Irene Pappas as Penelope is the most recognizable for North Americans. Recommended to all Ulysses followers.
