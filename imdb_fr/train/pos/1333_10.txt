I really like this movie, I watched it again and again. I do not see why anyone would think this movie was not good. Maybe you have seen better or anything, I personally like it. This is one of my favorite movies and I am not Hindi at all but I really like it. It may be a bit like "Pretty Woman" but I have not seen it and I do not think it's better than that. I do not know why you're making fun of all this but maybe you have a good reason but I think I've said it enough but I absolutely love this movie, and to those who say it's not good at all so looked and what movies you consider good. As for all the other people I watched, they enjoyed it too, so it surprises me that so many people do not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think that's how you spell her last name), she is very beautiful and my favorite actress to date!
