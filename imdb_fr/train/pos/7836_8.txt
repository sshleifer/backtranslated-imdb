Song 1: How Kriemhild cried Siegfried and how King Attila treats it through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlarn: Kriemhild (Margarete Schön) insists that his brother, Hagen Tronje (Hans Adalbert Schlettow), be the murderer's head King Gunther (Theodor Loos) refuses his request. When King Attila des Huns seeks Kriemhild through his ambassador, Rüdiger von Bechlar, she makes him promise by oath in the name of his king that no man will ever offend him. Hagen Tronje hides the treasure of the Nibelungen at the bottom of a lake. <br /> <br /> Song 2: How Kriemhild takes leave of her homeland and how she was received by King Attila: Kriemhild brings earth from where Siegfried died goes to the Huns court, where she is welcomed by Attila himself, who also promises to defend her. <br /> <br /> Song 3: How King Attila besieged Rome and how Kriemhild invoked her brothers: when Kriemhild Attila returns to her kingdom and asks Kriemhild what she would like most to please him. She asks him to invite his brothers to come to his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Song 4: How Kriemhild receives his brothers: Kriemhild insists on having the head of Hagen Tronje, but his brothers remain faithful to their friend does not accept his request. <br /> <br /> Song 5: How the Huns celebrated the summer solstice with the Nibelungen: Kriemhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Tronje, but he refuses since, according to the laws of the desert, a guest is considered sacred. Kriemhild offers gold to the Hums for the head of Hagen Tronje. There is a fight and Hagen Tronje kills Attila's son. <br /> <br /> Song 6: Nibelungen Distress: The Huns lose the battle against the Nibelungen, but keep them under the siege of Attila Castle. Kriemhild promises to spare their lives as long as they deliver Hagen Tronje, but his brother Gunther says the Germans are loyal to their friends. <br /> <br /> Song 7: The end of the Nibelungen: after the death of Rüdiger von Bechlarn, Giselher and Gernot, Hagen Tronje and Guhther are finally captured. Kriemhild eliminates Hagen Tronje and puts an end to his vengeance by destroying the Nibelungen. <br /> <br /> The poetic saga of Siegfried through "The Revenge of Kriemhild" ends with seven dramatic songs. The nature of the first part is a magnificent story of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; the second part is a dramatic story of hatred, vengeance and loyalty. The solid storyline with a perfect character development, the excellent performance of the cast and the brilliant direction of Fritz Lang produced another epic in advance. Margarete Schön is impressive with a totally different woman, obsessed and inflexible in her wish for revenge. The costumes that Kriemhild wears are also very impressive, and his game is based on his face and appearance. I was a little disappointed with Attila's reaction after the death of her only son, because I found her too passive. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Nibelungos parte II: A Vingança of Kriemshild" ("The Nibelungen, Part II: The revenge of Kriemhild")
