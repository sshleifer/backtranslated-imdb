I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 13 years old. That blew me away and, in many ways, it still is. But I am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now. There is little precious effort to examine and interact with racism - and therefore fails to recognize that the most powerful weapon against racism is to understand it in the very heart of those who commit it. Instead, we get a dichotomy - on one side, beko and woods in 3D rainbow panoramic vision - on the other, two-dimensional characters are described as unthinking and thoughtless. <br /> <br /> movie story, but it worries me that people see the performance as "accurate".
