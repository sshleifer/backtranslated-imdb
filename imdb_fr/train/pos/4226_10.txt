I have plenty of time for all Columbo films, but this one in particular was extremely well written and the final solution very effective. However, the main memory of this is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film, between Columbo and the murderer (I apologize if I do not remember exactly every detail). This is the most striking picture of Columbo I've seen: the view is seen from the darkness of the closet where the victim was murdered and in the room beyond lit by the day. Columbo sits in a high-backed armchair facing the door (and we), gazing at the closet, and almost in silhouette because of the contrast of the light. There is no sound. The camera slowly comes out of the room and walks towards him. He is immersed in meditation, breathing gently on a cigar, whirling cigar smoke slowly turning upward as he reflects. Then the dialogue begins. Superb.
