I watched Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing it at the theater. I've been waiting for this since the beginning of the shoot. I was not deceived. <br /> <br /> Minor damage below <br /> <br /> All in all, it's good, but it also lacks the continuity of the first two. Identity and supremacy both flowed gracefully between the precipitate action of adrenaline and the introspective drama. This film was sometimes agitated. The downtime for the construction of the plot was a bit too long. This made the next action too hectic. <br /> <br /> Camera: Speaking of frenzy, the trademark of Greengrass was fragile and very annoying for me. I know we talked about nausea on the bulletin board, but that does not mean it's irrelevant. All the martial arts trained by the actors have been totally lost. The ridiculous camera cuts and camera shake spoiled most of the fights in the movie. It's a cheap student director trick to make the movie feel unstable. I would expect these techniques to be used in some horror movies for high school students, but not in this sleek, mature action series. Too much closeup too. Do a little framing. Get interesting shots. A constant close-up makes me think of a lazy direction. <br /> <br /> History: The story was VERY confusing at first. They gave you new names and new faces from the start. This gave me the feeling that you have when you arrive late in a movie and that you know that you missed crucial information. Feeling squeezed or compressed for time reasons. Once you catch up, the story is pretty good. It's nice to follow tracks with Bourne. HOWEVER, I did not care about the last scene of Supremacy (Landy / Bourne on the phone) taking place in the middle of Ultimatum. Basically, the film is a half-prequel. I thought it was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Cast / Characters: The star of the movie is action. Obviously, only two originals remain. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. Their team was a bit strange to me. I think they just wanted to give Bourne a person to protect and to confide in. Unless I miss something, they will never tell you why they teamed up. The other assassins of the movie were rather calm. It looked like Gilroy / Greengrass / anyone who wanted to leave no bare ends. It's understandable but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas in Supremacy. These scenes were phenomenal. These assassins are as uninteresting as Castel (the first Bourne fella fights in Identity). The casting in general has deteriorated over the course of the series. Clive Owen was practically an afterthought. This is a measure of strength for this first distribution. The second, they basically trade Chris Cooper against Joan Allen ... Not exactly equal. This one exchanges Brian Cox and Franka Potente so that 3 actors are named later. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but these are not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series. Apart from a few breaks that seemed too long, the acting was going according to plan. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a success. They had the impression of wanting to finish the series. If they had cut or rearranged the slower parts, eliminated the part of Scott Glenn, zoomed out and removed the victim's camera from the seizure, that would have been perfect. <br /> <br /> END OF THE SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not see why they leave Bourne alive at the end. It was my understanding that it was the conclusion. They clearly referred to the very beginning of the series with its still floating figure. I thought it was going to be that. A type of complete end of circle. I liked Nicky's reaction to the story, though. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPECIFIC WARNING - FILM QUOTE UNDER <br /> <br /> The last line of Bourne at the end "Look at this .. Look what they are giving you." the first assassin he killed, I loved that. The final scene was great. (Except it was Vosen {Strathairn} who shot Bourne.) Why would he do that? Just for revenge? If he was angry enough to murder, why not shoot Pamela Landy after she faxed his top secret file? make sense.)
