Home Room is about a high school shootout at the Columbine, but the film describes the after-effects and fate of the survivors, their trauma, their guilt and their denial. Rather than tackle the very misfortune of the event. <br /> <br /> * The shooting itself is processed in advance, with no other action footage than the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT commando after shooting down the high school killer. The film has three protagonists; the detective investigating the crime of which there are no more culprits to be sentenced and two teenage girls who survived the incident, played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. <br /> <br /> The two girls having nothing in common except the filming is organized because of that and the drama ensues. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, although only 24 have been in the corner to the point where spectators know about her solid and reliable playing style. Busy Philipps, who's three years older than Christensen and totally unknown to me, blew me away with his dramatic force and on-screen presence. This girl was the party. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that puts you in touch with her intimate focus on the fragile but growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. Gus van Sant's (2003) elephant, although good, seems almost superficial and derisory compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting. What I can see in this film has had very little time in front of the screen and little exposure - an even greater loss for an equally traumatized America. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
