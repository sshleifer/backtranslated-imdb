DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit movies - but remains an interesting movie about suicide, its reasons and ramifications. Those looking for a gore-fest or a film-style exploitation of NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely a "art house" style movie, so those who need linear and explainable narratives do not need to apply ... <br /> <br /> The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an "episode" every day of the week that revolves around a strange chain of letters that, it seems, causes suicide, interspersed with scenes of a slow-decaying corpse ... <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very well done and provoke reflection, including the man who talks about "problems" with his wife and the concert massacre (which unfortunately lost part of his "power" over me, because I was too busy laughing at the group of SCORPIONS look-alikes on stage ...). But seriously - it is sometimes a beautiful scene (the scene showing different angles of this huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the meaning of the scene and the names shown are those of people who committed suicide by jumping from the bridge ...), sometimes confusing, sometimes silly (the scam SHE WOLF is quite fun), sometimes heartbreaking (I found the scene of the guy talking to his daughter in the park of his wife particularly effective) movie that is more of a "experience" that just an entertainment, as many of these "art" movies are supposed to be. However, I did not find DER TODESKING as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM and would probably put it on a par with NEKROMANTIK 2 as far as my personal "level of pleasure" is concerned. Really have a look at any buttgereit movie lover or "art". If you like this type of movie - take a look at SUBCONSCIO CRUELTY - in my opinion, the best art-house / horror movie I've seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
