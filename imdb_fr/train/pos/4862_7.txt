This musical is definitely mixed and none of the elements fit together perfectly, but it manages to be rather pleasant. The plot contains some of the elements of Wodehouse's novel, but none of his virtues, although he co-wrote the script. The songs, although charming, have nothing to do with this particular movie, and are roughly inserted into the plot, even by pre-Oklahoma criteria. Burns and Allen make their usual shtick with a lot of skill, but the tone of the rest of the film misses him about forty points. <br /> <br /> There are some strong points. Reginald Gardiner does a good job when he remembers a walkie-talkie and stops being attacked as a silent actor. And there are some pieces of writing that could only have been written by Wodehouse, although most of the film resembles the production of one of the Hollywood meetings he later parodied.
