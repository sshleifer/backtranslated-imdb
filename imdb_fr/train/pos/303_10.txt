Since the day I saw this movie when it was released in 1981, it's one of my 3 favorites. The introductory text I wrote for Amazon is presented below, and I am delighted that it is finally published on DVD on 17/10/06 - 25th anniversary of the film. <br /> <br /> The last credit of this movie explains his Call - "Thanks to the people of Manhattan on the island on which the film was shot." A charming and witty romantic comedy, it's a love story written for New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) able to identify every place (West 12th Street, Ansonia, the former FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits, which was a country and western club). You get the impression that all the actors in the ensemble have clicked on the screen as well as on the screen, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last appearance (she had a cameo after this movie) and her inner beauty was on screen. Buy it, make a big tub of popcorn and relax with someone you love.
