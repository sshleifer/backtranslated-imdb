I saw the original English version in video. The choice of Disney voice actors seems very promising. I can not believe I'm saying that. The story tells the story of a boy who meets a girl whose story is closely related to his. Both are screened in one of the most entertaining and intriguing scenarios of any animated film. The quality of the animation is excellent! If you've seen the work of Kiki delivery service at Disney, you can see the quality of their production. He bought them almost for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion. (but not quite!) Finally, the films of Miyazaki are well out! I can not wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa!
