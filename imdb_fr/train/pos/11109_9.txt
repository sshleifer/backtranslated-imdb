The Sopranos are a hermetic and dynamic exploration of American life and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. By placing history in the underworld, David Chase eliminates all the barriers to a grunt, low on the ground and outright means a deconstruction of the postmodern era. <br /> <br /> Each character represents a facet of American industry. Tony Soprano is an example of this hard work struggling with stress, shared between family duty and the need to maintain his "business" on an equal footing. The convergence of these two things is the imperative that advances the story. The characters of Christopher, Paulie and Bobby are the reflection of loyal subcontractors, but interested, present in each company, who are trusted by necessity rather than merit. Joe Pantoliano brilliantly interprets the charismatic psychopath of Ralph's character. A crooked and violent businessman is tragically outweighed by his incredible buying power. And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of the old, obsolete guard who maintains power through established relationships and the need for newcomers to avoid blame. <br /> <br /> Although they are abrasive and sometimes disturbing, the Sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate television series. <br /> <br /> PS Another good companion in Chase's series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest characters interesting.
