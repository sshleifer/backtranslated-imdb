This film is a must for anyone who loves football as an art. The first thing that strikes in this movie about a football world cup is the way it is filmed. In addition to following the play as a television show, there are numerous sequences for following individual players in games. It highlights the emotions and situations that live these men who are trying to achieve glory. The current television broadcasting style, so different from that of 1986, is still of inferior quality to that of this film. <br /> <br /> Actors are not the only stars. The public, the referees, the journalists covering the matches and the environment all play a central role in the development of today's history. In this film, you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way. In this respect, the current television style of broadcasting has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer to it. <br /> <br /> Several actors are in the spotlight: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague # o (Spain), Socrates (Brazil) and Sanchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This film is not a collection of the best football movements in Mexico City in 1986, although most of them are well covered. Throughout the film, the presentation of several aspects of the game and the competition itself depends on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping relevant games from the games themselves. That's what makes this film so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Because of what happened because of the referees in Mexico in 1986, most of the comments on this film and the World Cup are extremely biased by Maradona. Many of these comments do not take into account the fact that there is one referee and two touch judges, that they are as human as the players and that all the aforementioned players make mistakes in one way or another. Football rules do not allow referees to use TV rebroadcasts to make decisions, so most referees have to decide what they perceive. As a result, referees play an active role in the development of a game. Their influence is visible in many parts of this film. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film about the 1990 World Cup, compared to this one, is only a source of bitter disappointment. This is largely due to the fact that he has become too involved in the game, as this film tells the story from a more distant and impartial point of view.
