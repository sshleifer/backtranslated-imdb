As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a prolific guy. Hes has shot hundreds of hundreds of movies, many of which are shit. However, he has succeeded in occasionally inserting quality work among all the operations in the assembly line. "Succubus" is not his best work (it's either "The Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but it has many brands that make it a must-have for those wishing to dive into its grand catalog . It combines eroticism (alternating between showing total nudity and leaving something to the imagination) and the surreal in a transparent way. It is a very dreamlike film, full of good atmosphere. I particularly liked the constant namedropping. Although incredibly pretentious, it's fun to hear all the influences of Franco. <br /> <br /> Yet many users do not like "Succubus" and I can see where they come from. His quiet pace, but I can cope with that. Inconsistency is more problematic. The script here was obviously in a hurry, and after five minutes in the movie, I did not know what was going on (and he never really got together from that moment on). Those who want a little substance with their style, look elsewhere. Also, if it's a horror movie, it never gets really scary or even suspensive. Still, I was stunned by all this psychedelic foolishness that did not pay too much attention to these major flaws. (7/10)
