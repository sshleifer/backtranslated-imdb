OK, so FX is not a high budget. But this story is based on real events. Not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors, even richer !! Like most book-based movies, there are things that simply do not fit. Only a few people said that this film was based on real events, not shock, as most people think! This film is in no way related to TWISTER! Both films are about tornadoes. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have problems with the science of tornadoes and storms in the movie, you have to remember some things ... "Night of the Twisters" was June 3, 1980 This film was released 16 years after the events. Try to think about how much storm research has progressed during this period. It happened in a big city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Even if the film calls the city differently, and says it's a small town.
