A grandfather cares for an angry boy who tragically lost his parents. Together, they find common ground in Gaelic folk tales, which have been passed on orally from generation to generation. Although the stories contain tragic episodes, such as the glades of the Highlands, they contain a surprising amount of humor and cheerfulness. Everything is filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking and it's a rare opportunity to hear Scottish Gaelic speak. I am English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is still beautiful. Performances are exactly what you expect from carefully selected non-actors - in other words, you're watching what's really going on - people who are deeply interested in Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially in Skye, has done countless minor miracles to make this film. Anyone with the least interest in Gaelic, folk history, traditional music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism or social justice should go and see movie.
