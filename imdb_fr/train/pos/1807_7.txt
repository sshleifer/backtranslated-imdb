It's one of the first films I can remember, or maybe the first. It is exactly the kind of film that gently introduces a child into the world of violence and addictions where we live. A little Babe, Casino and Constantine, all this is well mixed in a box, and we have that. I do not know if this is really suitable for children, but I think it was very cool, very funny and interesting. I hate when a movie (especially a box) can have a good ending and ruin because each character must have a happy ending, even if it sounds strange (I'm not a bitter person) .But it was good, he everything goes so they leave it. <br /> <br /> All this is only a criticism, it's a good movie, something new. very touching and I have to go
