I thought this movie would be ok and maybe clich√©, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I had never heard of him until now) played an incredibly good lead role; he was really serious and romantic, me and my friend who saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, whom I loved before (LOVED in Romeo and Juliet), to me appreciates it even more. Her game was fantastic, I could not even say she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good, the cast was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were just as well melted; DeNiro as a gay pirate ... priceless, priceless. I laughed so much in this scene where Septimus arrives on the boat ... oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I loved him as the snippy mother in Hairspray. But she had the right amount of melodrama and sneaky comments throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was funny (but not at all!), romantic, the special effects are not quite common but when they are, they are excellent; the cameos of Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well placed. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fantastic movies such as Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings. This kept me interested all the time and I will buy the DVD when it comes out!
