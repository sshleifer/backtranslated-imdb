I would say that this film gives an idea of ​​the trauma that a young spirit may experience when a family is divided by a divorce or other disaster. I highly recommend this movie, especially to parents or people planning to start a family. <br /> <br /> I found the characters attractive and extremely friendly, from a multitude of dimensions. <br /> <br /> scary monster although probably not scary for most adults, has a very real suspicion of what the hyperactive imagination of a child facing unknown terrors could create. <br /> <br /> I found the film ravishing!
