the fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. this film is like a beautiful painting to appreciate. the museum scene is like a beautiful music video. The post-sex scene is a far too familiar scene in all our adult lives. but the film would not interest me without Keith Gordon. Keith Gordon is perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our time. almost everything I know about acting has come to study especially his eyes. he had the most convincing face. his character has the qualities that I look for in a guy, his sensitivity and dedication. Keith Gordon is beautiful. BTW, I wish he could shave his beard now that his lips, jaw and Adam's apple were his most beautiful set beside his eyes.
