I would recommend this movie to everyone. Not only fans of the rocker Luciano Ligabue, but to all moviegoers. Because it's sincere, moving, funny and true. Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a movie lover, and every image of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. Because most of the first Italian films are lousy and this one, made by a stranger, is a real pleasure to watch and listen to. Because Stefano Accorsi is beautiful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza who was, like Freccia, beautiful, talented and good and who lost her life because of the heroine, that Ligabue shows as it is, little glorious and ugly, without to indulge in easy moralisms. Because it's a film that speaks to our heart, to our ears, to our soul. And because I lived the experience of FM radio and it was exactly like that. Thank you Luciano!
