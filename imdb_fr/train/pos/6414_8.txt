I was curious how critics reacted to this exciting and inspiring film. So I turned to Rotten Tomatoes and was shocked to discover that the pompous gallery of peanut, the film critic of our country, had awarded the film an average of 43% (or "Rotten"). ) note. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if this movie does not move you, you do not have a heart. (It's worth noting that the same movie on the same website was rated at 74% by viewers). <br /> <br /> The opinion of the critics is not quite important for me. After all, I can not think of a more useless and overpaid job. Some schmo are paid to go to the movies (what a difficult life) and do the same thing that everyone on the planet: form an opinion. But these people have a way of giving the impression that their opinion matters more than yours, and even worse, they love hatred. <br /> <br /> I concede that this movie is out of date (well, except for f-bombs), syrupy and a little predictable ... after all, you know from the beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr., representing the real hero of the Navy, Carl Brashear, will triumph (in the end) at every turn simply by the way he presents himself: determined and courageous; voluntary and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But his performance and that of De Niro (as Billy Sunday, a composite character composed of several real characters) are so strong, so inspiring, that you will be at the rendezvous your feet cheering many scenes of the film, especially the culmination of the courtroom. It would be necessary to be a real stick in the mud not to be touched by these scenes. Like the movie critics of our country. Michael Rappaport is an excellent stuttering dive student with a sweet character who befriends Gooding's Brashear. If anyone has seen "Higher Education", this character completely redeems this character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that confirms what I've always felt: do not listen to the critics. Watch this movie and get inspired.
