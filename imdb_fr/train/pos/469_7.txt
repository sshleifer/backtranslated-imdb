The scenario was rather interesting, but the characters were rather flat and sometimes too extreme in their thoughts / behaviors. More extreme than necessary. In addition, I think something went wrong during the casting. John Turtorro does not really satisfy me by playing a semi-autistic chess player, let alone the Italian player. The reasons were not very explained either. <br /> <br />
