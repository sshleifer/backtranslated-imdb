Midnight Cowboy made a lot of noise when he was released in 1969, getting an X rating. Under current standards, it would be difficult to draw a rating from R. Jon Voight, who was better, is competent in his role as Joe Buck , an idiot out of town who wants to make a difference with the women of New York. He meets a street scammer, Ratso Rizzo, who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes. Both end up creating a link that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant, but never as much as in this representation. He is so much in the character that everything else around him pales in comparison. Losing John Wayne's Oscar is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The director Schlessinger is skilled with his production, but this film has a dirty belly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. See for the only performance of Hoffman.
