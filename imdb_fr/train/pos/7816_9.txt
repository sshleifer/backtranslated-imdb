Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with "Gandhi", winner of an Academy Award, in 1983. I did not know any of his works until I discovered recently Cry Freedom, released in 1987. Even he may not have been as popular as his Gandhi, he is just as exciting, if not more so, and was released when South Africa still had not gotten rid of the apartheid chains. Although most movies about social issues come out after the event, I guess this one came out during this time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real characters and events. The book on which the film is based was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who worked in South Africa until the late seventies. It traces the origins of Woods' friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, wonderfully portrayed by Denzel Washington. I can not imagine a better choice for the role. Washington has a natural charm and a presence on the screen, essential to the character of Biko. <br /> <br /> While Woods initially opposed what he thought was black racism conveyed by Biko, after meeting the man, he could not help being drawn into his struggles and his ideas. The bond that binds them strengthens and Woods and his family realize the distress of the people Biko represents and become more sensitive to his fate. <br /> <br /> However, finally, the tragedy strikes, and Woods must now concentrate to flee the South. Africa, with his book, so he can get it published and let the outside world know what's going on. The second part of the film tells about his escape from South Africa with his family. It will keep you going. <br /> <br /> There are also delightfully humorous dialogues. The scene between Biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you advocate for violence? Biko: I advocate a confrontation. Lawyer: Well, is not it violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. The confrontation occurs between you and me, but I see no violence. <br /> <br /> However, certain moments bring you back to the horrors that reigned in the country before the best sense prevailed. The scene where the army opens fire on a demonstration of schoolchildren is heartbreaking and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is not to be missed. I would suggest to those who are unfamiliar with Attenborough's work to take the time to do so. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are movies that make lives. I would prefer any day this last.
