yes I have a copy on VHS uncut in very good condition that I transferred to DVD and if someone wants to bring back the memories of a classic Christmas, thank you for contacting me at dmd2222 @ verizon. net.i searched everywhere and i did not find anything and i thought i could not be the only one on this planet to record this classic on tape, there had to be other people and if they did, i would have their place in the category of the very few who owns this classic, so I consider myself lucky and I have all the muppets Christmas except one that John Denver did with the muppets again I think it's called a Smokey Mountain holidays im not sure but it's close.
