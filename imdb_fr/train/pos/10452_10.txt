I want CÃ©line and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they were made for each other, that in many moments in the film, we want them to die one for the 'other. Their story is what we have always wanted and probably most of us have never achieved. It's about love, but not stupid things like in "Notting Hills" or that kind of movie. That's life and I believed in them, I thought they were falling ... It was so smart and touching. I just finished watching it a minute ago and I'm still here ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them again as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was becoming misanthropic now and that I felt like love was just a fake, a concept, but with this film, I realized that maybe somewhere, somewhere and when, something could really happen. <br /> <br /> I'm French and I did not know very well that July Delpy despite Kieslowski "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see her another works because she looks like an angel and that she has a perfect acting game. <br /> <br /> I saw "before sunset" (the sequel in Paris) a few days before seeing "before sunrise" and whatever. These are two masterpieces. the proof that it is not necessary to impress the technology with the eyes to have pure feelings. I am sorry for my english that I try better. <br /> <br /> Franck in France
