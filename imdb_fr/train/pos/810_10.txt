It's probably the best of all Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The starting point of the film was almost like episode IV: spacious cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret venue, where the severity of gangster Jabba the Hutt became even more serious. He ordered Luke to die in an underground pit against Bantha's teeth, which looked a lot like a bone, almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. Luke's Jedi powers end up finishing the monster. Adding to the sneaky rescue of Han Solo, who was frozen alive at the end of episode V, Jabba was very sorry to know that Luke had been sentenced to death in the Sarlacc pit, outside. <br /> <br /> But all Star Wars "good guys", especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... and those other ideas thwarted Luke's execution; in the end, most of Jabba's soldiers died and Princess Leia was able to use this force to smother Jabba. <br /> <br /> As in episode IV, the death star in episode VI appears. When I analyzed the rebel fleet attacking Imperial fighters around the Death Star, the staff of Star Destroyer, I guessed, accelerated the arming of the main laser, using Imperial fighters as a diversion. The 20-25 Star Destroyers who were lined up were ready to attack but were canceled and the Stargazer's laser gun was fired by surprise. Once the fire was fired, the only hope of the rebel fleet was that the Death Star's deflector shield was knocked out, which affected Lando so much because he wanted to destroy the Death Star, but he did not could not until the shield was removed. And he was released with the growing impatience of Lando. <br /> <br /> As in Episode V, the Imperial Walkers make their threatening appearance with their twin cannons, killing at least one of the Ewoks ... but the Ewoks find the former still unusual to deal with them. For example, Chewbacca, along with another Ewok, was able to requisition one of the marchers (and used it to destroy behind one of the walkers), while the other Ewoks used logs to knock out two others. walkers. <Br /> <br /> It's amazing what Luke could do with his Jedi powers on his Light Saber, like, for example, the scene on Endor where Luke deviates the incoming laser shots from a storm cyclone Storm Trooper and use the Saber to knock out some of the bike. Or, at its height, use the sword to separate the arm of his own father in the final fight against the Sith Vader. <br /> <br /> You probably know the celebration of the Ewoks after the Death Star blast, accompanied by a short fireworks, beating the spoils of victory (for example, the masks of Storm Trooper), and Luke finally meeting Leia after his own nemesis --- Darth Vader, now dead, is burned at a stake. The celebration includes the singing of the Ewoks, but I think Lucas did not buy it, even with the deep respect of composer John Williams. <br /> <br /> For the home movie version, I think Lucas himself wanted a different ending. In addition to the celebration on Endor, he wanted celebratory scenes on several surviving rebellious planets, including a laser shot celebrating the destruction of the Sith statue. The song of the Ewoks has been replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. He probably wanted the extra material to prove that with the destruction of the Death Star, balance had been restored in rebel galaxies.
