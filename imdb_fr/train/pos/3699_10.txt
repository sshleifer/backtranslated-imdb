"Who Loves The Sun" paves the way in some thorny topics with enough wit and grace to make the story not only captivating, but often hilarious. It's been a while since I have not found a film so touching, so nice. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful and attracts the eye with beautiful landscapes and peaceful landscapes. The peaceful images contrast perfectly with the tension between very human characters, very imperfect and yet very nice. Because of the excellent casting, the five main actors are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who loves the sun" This is a really funny movie that takes a moving look at the wounds we can inflict on each other and the incredibly difficult process of forgiveness but just as rewarding.
