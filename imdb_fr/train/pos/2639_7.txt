As a fan of the first Lion King, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but I knew it was impossible for this film to be as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans are wary of live movies because I share them too. <br /> <br /> Watching The Lion King 1½, I was trying to understand what I had in mind about this movie. Will I be so pious about the Lion King that I'm begging for a few scenes, or am I just going to accept this film as a mere look at the Lion King's story? Most of the time, I found myself kissing him. <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1½ definitely has his cute and fun moments. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first film and certainly deserved a film centered on them. People love these characters! My favorite parts of the film include Timon & Pumbaa's montage of the young Simba and the surprise ending with beautiful cameos. <br /> <br /> I could have done without many jokes on the bathroom, like the real reason that everyone was bowing down to baby Simba at the beginning of Lion King 1. I guess that kind of Jokes are aimed at the youngest (who, after all, is the target audience.) I do not think many kids really care about Disney's direct profit margin of movies on video.) <br /> <br /> > However, I will say that I was a little annoyed when they directly linked scenes from the original film to this film. I know the original so well that these scenes are close to my heart. Something would be different with the music or the voices, it would only distract me. <br /> <br /> As for the music, it was not so bad, but do not expect any classic to come from this movie. At least LK2 had the beautiful ballad, "Love Will Find a Way". As for the vocal work, it is well done in this film. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job, as always, and even new cast members, classic comic actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (better known as Marge Simpson), also did a great job . You can even enjoy even more of these vocal talents by consulting Virtual Safari on Disc 2 of the DVD. This feature is really fun! <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1½ is not a perfect movie, but it's cute and fun. I think many Lion King fans will appreciate it and appreciate it for what it is: a fun and light look at the Lion King's masterpiece from the point of view of our fun friends. <br /> <br /> Note from my IMDb: 7/10. My yahoo! Grade: B (Good)
