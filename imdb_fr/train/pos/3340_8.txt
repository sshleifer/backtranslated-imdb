"Fever Pitch" is a charming and charming addition to the little genre of sports novels, such as a movie to date or a film that a son might want to visit with his mother (although the guys in the audience have become visibly agitated during the romantic scenes ). <I experienced a softer version of such a story, as my first exposure to baseball was going out with my husband in the spring following the Mets' first World Series win, and then watching the Mets clinch their win. next was the one who was still standing in the early hours of the morning with our two grandchildren, who grew up to teach me more about baseball thanks to the heartbreaking failures of the home team of the National League of Canada to win it again (And it was I who took our son's only game to Fenway Park where I caught some Red Sox fever as a graduate student in Boston). <br /> <br /> The scenario, compared to the reality, creates in a credible way the presence of two people with real jobs. It is particularly impressive to see that Drew Barrymore's character is an important workhorse with anti-barbie skills, although she only sees three gentle girlfriends during the training sessions, which allows her to to move a lot and the minor stories with his parents do not do it completely. his work. <br /> <br /> It's even possible to understand credibly how she meets Jimmy Fallon's math teacher and how she falls in love with her "winter guy" - although it's amazing that her apartment filled with items from the Red Sox brand did not tip him to his Jekyll-and-Hyde "summer guy". Their relational crisis during the baseball season also runs refreshingly, efforts to find a compromise to its candid challenges, centered on the fact that they are both 30 years old and older. Fallon is astonished at the progressive emotional maturity of his character. <br /> <br /> While the end borrows heavily from O. Henry, the writers have done a remarkable job by quickly integrating the incredible 2004 Sox season into a new story (with He cooperated extensively with the organization of the Red Sox while shooting in the stadium.) <br /> <br /> The storyline explains in detail why Fallon does not have a Boston accent, as a New Jersey immigrant, but this does not explain not why his motley friends do not do it. Boston's most authentic sounds come from most of his "summer family" of other season ticket holders, who have kindly kibitzed the basics of the Sox tradition for neophyte Barrymore (and all members of the audience ). <br /> <br /> The song The selection includes the favorites of many Red Sox fans, ranging from the opening notes of the classic "Dirty Water", although most are meant to be heard in the end credits, as if you listened to the local radio and were worth hearing.
