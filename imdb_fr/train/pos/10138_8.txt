Well, it's about time. I had really given up hope that there would be a remarkable episode among this season's entries. Although there are still too many dull entries to make, this episode has at least gone well. It's rather funny that the director Rob Schmidt who has only the not bad Wrong Turn to his credit and to the writer John Esposito, whose only tasks of script to date included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should allow us to give ourselves the best writing and the most thought provoking episode of the season. In "Right To Die", we discuss the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the beginning of the episode, the couple has a conversation. Abbey has caught Cliff cheating and is desperately trying to win her back. While they talk, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff has only scratches and bruises, but Abbey is ejected from the car and ignites when a spark ignites and the gasoline flowing on it ignites him. And these are just installation people. Once in the hospital, Cliff must decide whether or not Abbey should live in this skinless state and only with nervous reflexes. There is also a side effect. Every time she goes to bed, Abbey walks like a ghost and causes trouble for all kinds of people. Without a doubt, this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks among the best of all time. From horrible effects to the tense scenario that has thrown some twists that I've never seen coming and to a suspense so palpable that you can almost touch it, Right To Die should have the right to live forever.
