Here's the very first episode of Friends, where we discover Control Freak, Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), new divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actor and man for women (Matt Le Blanc and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), very sarcastic: this is how the scene unfolds until we present the 6th and last friend, Spoiled kid Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> The episode is better than in any new sitcom, the first episode is not always fantastic, but the cast in this episode is not great, because the actors can not identify and are not really credible in their new characters (Except Kudrow and Perry - who shine) <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blanc-Man, his game was horrible because later he becomes more confident, but I think he tries to to be funny but fail at most. <br /> <br /> David Schim sea ​​- Why does not he pronounce EVERY word, he can not speak normally! But he has become one of the funniest characters in the following seasons, but he is not confident. and I can not sympathize with him Jennifer Aniston - Looks good, and does a good job as Rachel Green, but we only see the real Rachel later in the first season, Courtney Cox - Looks like anorexic in this episode, it's worrying, she looks totally different now (healthier), her game is a bit blurry but everyone is in this 20-minute driver! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I do these two things together because their timing and acting quality were excellent. For Lisa, it was one of her first roles. She is so natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry is only Matthew Perry. to play fundamentally! The quality of the episodes will improve later, such as Sets, they look dark and scary in this episode and gives them the impression of being unpleasant, the acting is OK, the characters are gaining confidence at each new scene and I'm proud that it's the pilot! I hope we will see friends get together! because they will always be here for us!
