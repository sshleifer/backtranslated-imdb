After several very good reviews to the point of SUPERB, I was extremely satisfied with the film. The film was dark, moving, anger, pain, guilt and an extremely convincing demon. <br /> <br /> I initially expected to see many special effects and, like a caress in love, that won me over. with the subtlety and accuracy of it. Brian, I'm blown away by your artistic talent to tell the story and your concern for special effects. You will go far, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari, Best Actor Award, was the first choice. You made Jr. Lopez look like a child in relation to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> Overall, the acting, the story, the quality of the shooting and the impressive effects, it was fantastic. I just wish it was longer. I'm waiting for The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
