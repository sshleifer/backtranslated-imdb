In the first week of May, each year brings back memories of the Holocaust through movies on TVs. Among the many films they showed, it was the one I had never seen. <br /> <br /> The story tells of Hilter's life and his rise to power. It starts with his childhood and ends with the highest position of power in Germany. <br /> <br /> The film was previously presented as a television series and then converted to a film format. The Scottish actor Robert Carlyle interprets Adolf Hitler with a lot of courage, conviction and brilliance to give a true portrait of this man. <br /> <br /> It's a good storyline and story telling the public about Hitler's main events. in power, and also tries to show the likely psychological composition of Hitler. The film is a biased point of view of the director Christian Duguay ?? which shows Hitler as a person at a track, threatening, angry and shouting ?? who had such a hold on the Germans and his entourage. Hitler is not presented as someone who has charishma and attraction, and the film fails to convince Hitler's portrait. <br /> <br /> Even if the project was intended for television, all the ingredients of the production are first class and on par with all the others. main flow film. The value of production, sets, costumes, etc. were perfect. <br /> <br /> The authenticity of the historical events presented raises many criticisms. But the film is always captivating, captivating and entertaining. Robert Carlyle masters and dominates the screen like no other. He is incredibly good ?? brilliant! I would have liked to have a more balanced view of Hitler's life, because I think Hitler was able to bring out the sleepy feelings of millions of Germans and it's not just him who should be held responsible of the holocaust. As I said many times, that ?? very sadly, our society likes to garland or sue a person as a representative of good or bad society, respectively.
