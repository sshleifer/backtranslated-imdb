This film has a constant and haunting look, supported by an excellent interpretation (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story that is revealed to us over time. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, the music fully sets the mood and helps maintain a worried, cautious and dark tone. <br /> <br /> Weir's story is enriched by the use of Aborigines, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a disturbing spooky story. <br /> <br /> Although they are not linked in terms of history or genre, it has kept me in the same mood as Ursula Le Guin's "Lathe of Heaven" (1980) . <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with shocking moments. Remember that "hacking and slicing" does not make a movie a horror movie, it's the psychological element of fear and apprehension that resides in each of us.
