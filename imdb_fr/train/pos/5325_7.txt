The idea of ​​making a film about the Beatles seems doomed to failure because no production can capture the idea of ​​the historical Beatles. Then it may be better not to try to recreate the past, but to produce an illustration that works best with other available Beatles media. That's exactly what "Birth of the Beatles" offers us, the simple story we know without extravagance. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here on *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that not everything was as accurate as some Beatles graduates would expect. We see the Beatles playing songs that were not even composed at that time. The Beatles interpret "Ask me why", "P.S. I love you" and even "Do not bother me". Beatles graduates should understand that if the Beatles of the movie were just singing in Hamburg, the youngest viewers might not recognize the Beatles they came to know. From this original Hamburg repertoire, only "Johnny B. Goode" and "Love Me Tender" by Stu Sutcliffe are preserved. <br /> <br /> The guys who play the Beatles in this production hardly look like the originals, but the rest the film is always a good viewing because the film is accurate enough for the rest. The guy who plays Lennon does it well and the rest of the group are not bad either. Brian Epstein is awesome and the moment he fires Pete Best from the band is probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie. As a bonus, you will also see the original Cavern club in the movie.
