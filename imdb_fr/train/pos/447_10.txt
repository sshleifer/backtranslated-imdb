It's one of the best movies. This is one of my favorites. A movie with a good acting game. The story is very sensitive and touching. Good camera work too. <br /> <br /> The names of actresses and actors do not appear at the top of the list of American stars. However, they give equal or even better performance than the top of the list. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to watch a movie about true love, romance and friendship without having to endure watching someone who has to be kick-boxing their way to save the world. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this movie, you have neither heart nor feelings. Then go watch a sports movie. There is no murder or horror here. Watch the movie. It's a must. TH
