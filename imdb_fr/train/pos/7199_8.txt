Playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) had a series of games on the flop after a huge success. He receives a play from his pupil, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who is fantastic. That's so good Sidney said he would kill for that. Is he going? <br /> <br /> The thriller of a thinking man. It was originally a play ... and it shows. It's mostly about a game and everyone is talking but I never got bored. It's very well written with lots of twists and good distribution working at full speed. Caine is just awesome like Bruhl - another of his great performances. Reeve is, surprisingly, very good. I never thought much about him as an actor, but he's really good at it. Dyan Cannon does wonders with a role as a Bruhls wife. Irene Worth is also good (and funny enough) like Helga ten Drop, a clairvoyant. However, his accent pissed me off. Director Sidney Lumet does very well with his only set. The camera is always moving and holds your attention. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER DEATH AHEAD !!!!! My only complaint is that two homosexual characters in this film turn out to be raging sociopaths and that this one also contains one of the most unusual kisses I've ever seen, but these are minor complaints . <br /> <br /> good thriller. Critics hate this movie (for whatever reason) and it seems to have completely disappeared since its premiere in 1982. Too bad, it deserves better.
