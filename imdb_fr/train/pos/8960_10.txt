It may not be War & Peace, but the two names of the Academy would not have been known without the genius of James Wong Howe ... <br /> <br /> it's one the few movies I fell in love with child and returned without discontent. Whether you are interested in what it offers fictitiously or not, BB & C is a visual feast. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's his best job, I'm certainly not an expert. but the look of this movie is amazing. I like everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, the cat, the crazy hoo-doo, the retro-downtown; but the way it was filmed is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I even like the inconsistencies highlighted on this page above, as well as the "special effects" that seem late. All of this creates a truly coherent world.
