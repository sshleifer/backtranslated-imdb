An insomniac nightmare tells the story of a man plunged into madness. Having chronic insomnia, Jack is in the hallucinations; causing him to try to determine what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> We discover interesting things about Jack towards the end of the film and think that at the end of the film, we will have one always after "Hollywood ending." False. the place where nobody sleeps. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (screenwriter and director) has herself made a good film in "An Insomniac Nightmare", a talented filmmaker and writer (she did film right after graduation in high school), she has real potential and will be watching in the future to come. <br /> <br /> While watching this short film, I was constantly uncomfortable; the dark landscapes and the realistic portrayal of Dominic Monaghan's insomniac (as Jack), I desperately wanted to turn off that feature at times, just to escape it.
