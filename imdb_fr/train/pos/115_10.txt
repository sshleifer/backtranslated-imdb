Piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. No doubt a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Tale in the Kafka style about the impossibility of victory or survival in a strange and perpetual world. In this film, life is only an adaptation exercise. Lesson on limits and original sin, on the fragility of innocence and the error of its ways. <br /> <br /> Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and the same ambiguous woman. And Europa is the symbol of the fundamental crisis that has many aspects such as chimerical wars or the inevitable quest for truth / essence / golden age. <br /> <br /> MÃ©thaphore or parable, the film is a story of the evolution of disappointed. War, peace, business or lies are just details of the gelatin time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love - a convention. The only method of sacrifice to hope to understand a painful reality.
