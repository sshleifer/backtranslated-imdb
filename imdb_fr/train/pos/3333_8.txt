I had the opportunity to see this on the plane for New Zealand last week and wondered how it could be compared to the British film and the book. I must say that I was impressed favorably. The fanatical attachment of the Red Sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC, which has been successful over the years. As a Brit, I was also interested in the fact that it was not necessary to understand baseball to understand what was going on. A question comes to my mind: was the script written using the Sox as a team even before they broke the curse of the Bambino? Or was another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan (myself, I know, a Brit who understands baseball), I have to say that it added to the fun.
