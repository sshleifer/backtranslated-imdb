The film is a fantasy. The screenplay is thin but serves as a structure on which wonderful songs are sung and beautifully sung. (I still can not believe that such beautiful and attractive people can sing so well.) Some dialogues are wonderfully intelligent. The costumes made me feel like I was watching a fashion show of 1942. <br /> <br /> The films are designed to serve a variety of purposes. This one is designed to entertain and it certainly does. If I have a negative comment, it would be that Nelson Eddy was a bit too old to be the handsome good count. Some of the close-ups made me feel uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing beautifully. However, Jeanette MacDonald was still dazzling. She makes a spectacular angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is well before my time, and I'm new to Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy's movies and related conversation. The music in this movie is beautiful. Although I love classical rock music that fills most modern movies, there is no doubt in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable, more charming, better constructed. The stars of this film have more talent than those I see today in movie theaters. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefits of plastic surgeons in Beverly Hills, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I do not see why many other posters apologized for loving this film and more generally this group of films. They say it's dated and try to explain why it's like that. And those who do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what? I think this movie will undoubtedly entertain people when so many other movies are long forgotten. There is simply too much quality in this film so that it is not retained and appreciated. I recommend this film without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent, beauty and music.
