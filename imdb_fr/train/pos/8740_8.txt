There are many details in the life of an insect. Everything is covered. The film looks great and the animation is sometimes breathtaking. The film is not too original, it is a modern version of Kurosawa's film Seven Samurai, which contains only insects. However, I enjoyed the interaction between the characters and the villains of this movie seemed really bad. It seems that Disney usually makes his criminals cuts in carbon copy. Locusts are menacing and Hopper, the main villain, has been a brilliant creation. Check this one.
