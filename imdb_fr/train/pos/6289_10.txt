This movie took a lot of sticks. It was announced by critics at its publication and accused of having destroyed the career of Nicolas Cage. What I do not think people understand is that it's not supposed to be an epic movie, an Oscar nominee, it's just a brilliant "Bruck-buster" action at its best. Fast cars, fast editing and an excellent soundtrack - it does exactly what is written. Also, for all those who love cars, it's a real treat. He has everything: Ferrari, Mercs, Hummer and let's not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better action movie and, personally, a better movie at all !! Again, maybe it's just me!
