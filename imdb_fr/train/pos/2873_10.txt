In my opinion, this is one of Disney's five most popular animated films. Cinderella was a perfect return to animated feature film (unlike the 1940's compilation movies), and the expensive depth via the multi-camera camera just returned to the movie. Although Disney adapts the story in a slightly liberal way, you collect the idea of ​​the time through the stylization of the dress and sets - a clear period of time where the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multidimensional character. In fact, all the characters are a little developed, with the exception of the Prince, who remains the flatter, we know he has a sense of humor and a big smile, but that's about it. Like Snow White, Disney has a permanent impact on the history of popular culture: in most versions of Cinderella, the half-sisters are attractive, but not as pretty as Cinderella, and their character removes their appearance a beautiful appearance. <Br /> <br /> Disney's favorite additions: mice! Also, enjoyed the continuity - Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film. The addition of the robe and the subsequent assault on the half-sisters have always been horrible as a kid - I remember View Master showing this with a black background and a big red light on it! The broken slipper shows Lady Tremaine's reluctance to give up her grip on Cinderella and admit her defeat - Audley will describe the meanest of all the villains of Disney, the Satanic witch Maleficent, in The Sleeping Beauty.
