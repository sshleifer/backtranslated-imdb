I really enjoyed this film. Many Koreans will feel familiar with this film because many of them have guardians when they go to school. The cinematography was average. The film would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular. The editing was however very neat and unusual. <br /> <br /> The acting game was also very good. Kim Ha Neul generally played an innocent and weak girl in Korean soap operas. But this time, she plays very well a cute tomboy. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his role very likely. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this film is that the emotion of the characters is not too exaggerated. There are a lot of Korean love movies where the characters cry river in front of the audience and I always thought it was very bland. There was no such bullshit in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well played.
