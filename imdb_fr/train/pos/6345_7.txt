The costumes and makeup were superb, there were some exceptionally funny lines, and the role was created for Jim Carrey. Carrey did the best job possible considering the rather disappointing script writing. Of course, it was mostly a children's movie, but if you spend so much money making a movie, you must at least give the body enough story to go beyond Dr. Seuss. I was expecting more from Ron Howard. This is worth the detour, but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a classic in every way.
