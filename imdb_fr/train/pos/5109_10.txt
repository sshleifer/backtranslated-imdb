I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie was released. As a result, I do not remember anything about the film. But I remember how it felt like Gilley's and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's 'Looking for Love' hit song, which still reminds me of childhood memories every time I hear it. <br /> <br /> However, a few years I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is that I was blown away. Few movies hit me harder. This film is as raw and real as possible. From Uncle Bob's Ranch, Texas City Chemical Plant, Gilley's Dancehall and Bud and Sissy. And perhaps for this reason his call is not wider. But no matter what you think of country music (for my part, I do not support it despite my roots in Houston), Urban Cowboy is a unique piece of American pie. For this reason I love it!
