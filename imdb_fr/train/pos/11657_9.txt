The surprise candidate of this year's Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars. It is an Irish film by heart, but it was co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, with, I suppose, animators working in the three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films of recent memory. The design of the characters is reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis of a few years ago, with very simple characters with thick and black contours. This film is not black and white. Oh no. What makes this movie awesome is its use of color, simply one of the most outrageous and surprising uses I've ever seen. The general design of the images is also much more geometric, with characters that are essentially rectangles or ovals. Much of the film can be spent playing to find the circle - a major aspect of visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All these geometric designs have a purpose - the story tells the story of a young boy who is learning to become an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (the Book of Kells is a veritable illuminated Bible, the art of the film is based on the drawings it contains.). The story of the film is not particularly deep, but it is a very good fantasy tale. Brendan is a young boy from Kells, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle to keep the Vikings away. Brother Aiden, newcomer to Kells, inspires Brendan to embark on drawing. He also inspires him to leave Kells and explore the nearby forest, where a nymph lives. Bruno Coulais provides a fantastic score, almost as good as he did for Coraline, which I consider the best of the year.
