This film now appears on digital television at least once a month. I've watched it a dozen or more times and it keeps getting thrilled. If it were tomorrow, I would watch it again. This is the artistic talent that can be created by Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great wizards of the profession, assisted by the superb trio of support composed of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Do not forget the other minor roles. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, simply said, of an ex-convict, an adorable money-lender, who fights and succeeds with the "technology of the new era", namely computers, and affection in the process. Even if it's a bit implausible, even incredible, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no vulgar language and, above all, no terrible method, which prevails today. A real lesson for modern filmmakers on how to make a great show with, and with, virtually nothing ... except an exceptional talent.
