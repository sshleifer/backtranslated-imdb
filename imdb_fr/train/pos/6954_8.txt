This film is one of the funniest movies I have seen in years and the laughter of the public supports me. It's not since My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) that laughter has been so spontaneous and intense. Like last year, Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) were complicated to use parody (espionage at Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex in My Super Ex-Girlfriend). The Director Ivan Reitman of the director, it's great, between comedy and drama, between crazy and completely ridiculous. Never the shock and serious drama break the rule of comedy. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements, even if the ending is broadcast in advance. In some ways, it's so obvious that it's great to see how it goes. As in real life, the truth is sometimes so obvious that we do not really see it. Easily eight stars out of ten ranking up there with Tootsie (1982). Maybe a new one (depends on how it appears in a second view).
