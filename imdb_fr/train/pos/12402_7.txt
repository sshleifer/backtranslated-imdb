**Warning! Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> This short film is the first part that exposes the brief part of "The Matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the matrix was created. Because we already know the story, the plot itself is not a surprise. and the short film is not as entertaining as it is informative. But that's how it looks like a file in the historical archive. Visuals are better than average and generally cold colors contribute to the purpose of the short film. <br /> <br /> Some problems. The violence of the tale is a little gratuitous and, combined with an occasional dose of politically correct (UN scenes), undermines the narrative of the short film. Moreover, it must be seen with the second part to be complete. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix concept is brilliant, and despite some problems, this short film still fulfills its purpose. It would not have matched the style, content or flow of the original movie. This is the ideal method to reveal the story. <br /> <br /> Final result: Good information. Could have been said a little better, but still a solid 7 out of 10.
