This resumes approximately one year after the events of "Basic Instinct". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a football player while driving at a speed of 110 miles an hour (do not ask her), she leaves the road and ends up on the Thames. She survives - he does not. The police hired psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if she was mentally fit to stand trial. Naturally, she begins to play with her mind and many murders and sexual intercourse ensue. <br /> <br /> This film was sentenced before even opening. It took forever to get a casting and a director, the scripting problems were constant and the actors were not happy (Morrissey often complained about the film). That's not important. It looks a lot like the first - there is a score of lush music, beautiful places, a lot of sex and nudity (it had to be edited for an R), a nicely complicated plot and a good acting - but there is there is no impact. It looks like a retreading of the first. People are being killed here with a collar leash (I think) ... just as people were killed by an early ice pick. In a cute moment, Stone picks up an ice ax and looks at him with envy. She also plays psychological games with a man and could involve him in murders. The similarities are too obvious. <br /> <br /> It's also VERY R rated - there's a lot of explicit sex talk, male nudity (Morrissey looks much better naked than Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone is always superb) and some bloody murders. The acting is good at all levels. The stone is just fantastic here; Morrissey looks miserable but is fine; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis play well in support roles. <br /> <br /> So, it's not bad at all, but it looks like a remake of the first one. I recommend it anyway. People have tackled this because Stone was not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to "Basic ..." 14 years after it was created.
