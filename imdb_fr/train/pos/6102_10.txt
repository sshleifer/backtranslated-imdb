I had to give this movie a 10 just because it did what so many movies cast on a black audience nearly failed. This movie was devoid of all the cliches of video whore, and it also avoided gangsters, rappers and foul language. He examined several relationships between doctors, African American and African-American dating relationships between men and women at a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed by the judicious mix of light humor with quite difficult and heavy problems. The film will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. I also saw him at the Boston Film Festival. The premiere took place at AMC Loews Boston and I really hope this film will be presented to a much larger audience. Blacks (and ALL others) would love a movie like this, if only the industry was SMART enough to broadcast it! <br /> <br /> In addition, if your doctor, your resident, your medical student, premedical student, married to a doctor, having a doctor, a brother in the family or a good doctor, they would also like a lot this film. He described the residency and practice in a realistic way, which was greatly appreciated by the doctors, residents and medical students who viewed the film. Dennis Cooper has completed his residency in Internal Medicine. So he clearly applied his knowledge and experience to the film, which is very obvious.
