This one is distinguished by its originality. I am seriously tired of seeing Hindi films that bring together a lot of Hollywood and British films. Some flaws were inevitable, however, this film is a must. Surya's portrayal of the conscientious and conscientious cop (as opposed to those with a hot belly and looking for the money we normally see) was great. He has come a long way since his work at Nerukku Ner. I liked the movie so much that I had to own it. I am not usually in the genre of nonviolent films, but I really felt for each character and so I can not really bring myself to call it "spiritless" violence. I do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go with most Hindi and Tamil films. I absolutely loved this movie for its lack of the same thing. The reaction of ACP Anbuselvan to the loss of his wife is not exaggerated, it tears the heart and makes me want to bawl the eyes. There are times when I watch a movie when I want to press the FF button. Many times I wanted to do that in a movie theater. I never wanted to do it by watching this movie. I really hope that Ghajini will be available soon.
