A truly touching story of a recruiting camp in America, where young men are prepared for the Vietnam War. Human study has always seduced me when it comes to war films, because it conveys personal and subjective opinions about the war, opposing war films in which action and technical data are analyzed to the detriment of human factor. <br /> <br /> The film manages to give a new twist to an already old subject and manages to stand out from the usual war films, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the point of view of the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who cleverly avoids being sucked by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control of his destiny and fight for something he does not believe in, he He spends his energy searching for ways to avoid being sent overseas, both for himself and his comrades, and ends up ironically finding his own reason for going to war. Perfect irony <br /> <br /> The acting is really exceptional and the shooting of documentary style almost gives you the impression of being transposed in the film. In addition, the film will provide food for thought to enthusiasts of the usual activities of war movies or war games lovers, awakening, hopefully, the spirit of a generation that has fortunately escaped the terror of the writing.
