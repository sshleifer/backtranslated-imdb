I just saw The Drugs Years on VH1 and I love it. I think this reflects very well the antecedents of the drug and especially, IT HAS A STRONG MESSAGE FOR ALL GENERATIONS. There is Woodstock, there are the deaths of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there are many examples of drug use and abuse. It completely covers the chronology and evolution of drug use in America, positively or negatively. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I want to congratulate its creators, because that's exactly what it takes to get on television these days. I'm waiting for the release of the DVD. You should definitely see it !!! This film is beautiful-- BIG TIME!
