It was a wonderful movie. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought the performances of the actors were excellent. I had to think about the movie for a very long time. I think every student should watch this film so they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the film because it told me and showed how much love can be strong. I wish I could be so strong as a woman. I really liked that because it told me something about relationships and that's what I like to see in a movie. I think you can compare the film with Der Untergang, the pianist. If you go up these three movies, you will have a wonderful view of what happened during the war. We should remember something like war forever.
