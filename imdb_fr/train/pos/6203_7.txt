A wonderfully original movie with enough twists for a bag of pretzels. Parker Posey portrays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable and loving mother, who looks and does not look like what she is. The story is very arrogant and the dialogue skillfully understated. Notes of humor and intrigue, which do not dominate so well the characterization of Posey. The support cast is stellar. The wrong side? This film needs all your attention, almost to the point of stopping it and taking notes. Posey has more sex appeal in lifting eyebrows than most actresses throughout their body. It's worth your time, even if you do not understand the outcome.
