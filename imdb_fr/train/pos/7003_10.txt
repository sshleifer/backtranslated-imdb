The emotional impact of this film defies the words. It's elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic all in two hours. It is Will Smith while it evolves towards its capacity of actor, its complete range. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought it must be a stroke of luck for the successful super-actor, Smith. His performances in both films describe a whole other dimension for Smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of scripts, I'm not sure, but I see it differently now. Seven Pounds is one of those films that, to take full advantage of its essence, must suspend its convictions. Do not look at the plot, watch the fragile state of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It's a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice.
