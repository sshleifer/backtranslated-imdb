I saw this movie in a shop in the cheap section. In fact, I remembered very well seeing the commercials and the trailer of this film years ago. I thought "What the Hey" and I bought it, basically because the plot seemed interesting and Claire Danes was always talented to me (it was also before I became a big fan of Kate Beckinsale). <br /> <br /> They are two girls who go on holiday in Bangkok, are caught for narcotics (which they are innocent) and are then sent to a prison in Thailand. The film tells what will happen to them and sometimes questions their innocence. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give excellent performances. The plot of this film ends unconventionally and raises good questions of moral discussion. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good solid film, but there could have been some improvements, it could have been longer ... it would have helped to consolidate these characters and a better understanding of the policy of the Thai judicial system would have been helpful. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, apart from that, it's a good movie with great performances. <br /> <br /> PS So that all pop culture junkies are looking for a two-minute role of Paul Walker. I did not even notice the first time I saw the movie.
