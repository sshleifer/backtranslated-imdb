It's really an incredible movie. Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised peoples to obtain the legitimate voice, but it also shows the United States for dishonesty, subterfuge and flagrant disregard for human rights and self-determination. . We see that Chavez is a very courageous and charismatic leader who fights against what can only be described as despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers recorded a unique coup d'etat. <br /> <br /> And in the viewfinder, we see the United States, once again pull the strings and blur any sense of reality. It is heartbreaking to watch the early stages of the revolt, knowing full well that the subversion of democracy we are witnessing is a tool long used by successive US governments and their seemingly blinded citizens. The images clearly show that this is not a manipulation of television or generic sequences but an active documentation of a people and their government struggling for its future. Truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long live Chavez. <br /> <br /> We must enshrine the notion that each country must be able to choose its government and develop in the way that the majority deems it appropriate. The first phase of this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are and this documentary does a remarkable job.
