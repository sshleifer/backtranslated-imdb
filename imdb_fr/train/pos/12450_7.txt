Praise and watched this short work (<90 minutes). This is by far the best treatment that Modesty has received in a movie - and its creator, Peter O'Donnell, accepts, participating as a "creative consultant". The character and we who love him are treated with respect. The direction of Spiegel is the best he has done so far and the cast was very well done. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as it corresponds to Jim Holdaway's original illustrations of Modesty. A fantastic find by the person who threw it! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also excellent. I hope Tarantino & co. will continue to do more in the series - I'm especially interested to see who they would choose to be the incomparable Willie Garvin!
