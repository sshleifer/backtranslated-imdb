I'm not a big fan of most cartoons, but Gundam Wing is really something else. Gundam Wing lacks all that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of an anime, because the number of jokes made during the 17 hours would be only in the double digits, Gundam Wing gets value for money. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is as much a political thriller as a series of actions. The big parties focus on the diplomatic relations of war, not just battles. Although combat animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would be difficult to animate, individual duels between gundams are almost works of art considering the animated use of complex mechanisms and fast movements. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge, this series of 49 episodes plus a movie was taken over by the cartoon network in 2000 and professionally dubbed by them. the dubbing is simply impeccable. not only does every word say match, but the voices used really make the characters much more believable. many think it's better to watch cartoons with English subtitles, but I just do not have the determination to do so. <br /> <br /> Not only are the voices good, but the score used during the series is quite impressive. I will simply say that it allowed me to search the net in vain to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is what will really catch the viewers, and no, do not hang on to a drama in prime time like Lost that was only designed to attract you . Explaining the intrigue in depth would lead to a lot of spoilers, since many characters do not even have names up to a few episodes of the series. The rough idea of ​​this series is that Earth and its now independent space colonies are struggling to keep the peace. Thus, a war is unleashed, leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations. I think more details would start to give information, which is crucial for the plot. <br /> <br /> I will end here by saying that this series is ideal for all those who love anime, those who think that ALL the anime are stupid (they have good reasons to think it) and those who seek to enter the animes. a serious tone to that.
