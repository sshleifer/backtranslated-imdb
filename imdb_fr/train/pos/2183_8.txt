Billy Wilder is co-credited for the story, and his casual flair is noticeable in this rather original tale of ghost songwriters who both work for music legend Oliver Courtney. The obvious misunderstandings disappear quite quickly, thank God, and it remains a spiritual and light blend with some beautiful songs (and more unforgettable ones), Crosby at its most charming, a grand tour of Broadway legend, Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant providing most of the cynical comments (the Levant is in a rare form and his nonsense is not dated at all). A delicious surprise, recommended to all fans of the genre.
