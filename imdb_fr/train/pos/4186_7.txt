I watched this movie yesterday and I must say it's the best horror film I made for $ 36,000 I've ever seen (sorry Steckler). The movie is definitely worth discovering if you are a fan of zombies. This film breathes the soul and the atmosphere. Some of the zombies' plans are the best ever in the cinema. Dusty, dusty corpses, looking VERY scary, are slowly dragging their screaming victims. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hungry and sexy Canadian women with sexy accents will occupy you before HORROR raises his head eating. This film has entertained from beginning to end. I could not ask for more than that. The only complaint I would make is that it was too short.
