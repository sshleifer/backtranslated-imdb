Super Speedway makes an excellent demonstration of your new DVD / Bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. The IMAX camera puts you in the race car, where you sail at high speed around different tracks, reminiscent of the driving sequences of the Grand Prix (if only it appeared on a DVD!). I like watching it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only drawback, and why I did not give him a 10, is that some of the driving sequences seem to suspect that the movie has been sped up. The soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear any noise when you pass under bridges.
