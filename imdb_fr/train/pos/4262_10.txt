I saw him as many times as I could before he left the stage. A delicious and entertaining movie with some of my favorite stars. I only wish I could find it! Would definitely buy / see if I could. Please, someone, bring him back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his patriotic role during the Second World War and his main ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver, were beautiful and charming. It was a musical, but also romantic, funny and intelligent. It was my favorite film with June Haver, although I have always loved it. Her bright smile lit up the screen, and her beauty and talent were an asset to any movie. Secondary actors lent credit to their respective roles. A well balanced and light film; I only wish we had more like this!
