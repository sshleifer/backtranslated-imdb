I hate reading reviews that say something like: "Do not waste your time, this movie stinks on the ice." For the critic, however, it has a naive charm. If you like other movies in the "Whistler" series, this one will be viewable. If you like black movies of the 40s, this one will be viewable. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good, in my opinion, as any of the previous entries in the series starring Richard Dix as the protagonist. It's much slower and the plot is trivial. You've seen the same narrative device used in many other movies, and generally better. <br /> <br /> But the acting is good, as well as the lighting and the dialogue. It just lacks energy and you will probably understand exactly what is going on and how everything will be at the end, no more than a quarter of the way. <br /> <br /> The "Whistler" series is semi-black, and its character, mood, lighting, camera movements and angles are more important than the story itself. But this film is not black. It's too light and Hollywood innocent for that. Neither the character of Richard Dix nor those of any of his ladies in previous films have to end properly. You just did not know until the end. <br /> <br /> But I will recommend this one for at least one viewing. I watched it at least twice and got a reasonable amount of pleasure both times.
