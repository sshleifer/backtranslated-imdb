This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to play the performance he has given in this movie. Duchovny was first-rate, as were Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters embark on a panoramic tour of historic murder scenes, in one of the coolest cars ever made, the Lincoln Continental model of the 1960s. Early Grace is a simple fool who loves dry toothbrushes and the carnage. He likes that his wives do not curse and do not smoke, and wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a pair of artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are caravan trailers from the rural suburbs. Even if the tone of the majority of the film is dark, there are many fun scenes to have. Writing, staging and acting are brilliant. If you like road movies, murder, humor and narration, watch this movie. Everyone delivers, and you will want more when the credits go. One of my favorites of all time. "Hey ... shave this dog n teach him to hunt!"
