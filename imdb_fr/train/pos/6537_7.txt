The children I watched in this movie loved it (four children aged 9 to 12, and 10 stars). Emma Roberts was adorable in the lead role. (Expect to see more next-generation Roberts in the future.) After being over exposed to Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who did not seem to have worked on the streets. Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (with a Bruce Willis cameo) also enjoyed the cast. Take away food: a cute movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I have not read the book series, so my comments are based solely on the merits of the film.)
