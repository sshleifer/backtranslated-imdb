R rated for strong language, violent content and some nudity. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> Fear Of A Black Hat is one of the funniest and most original comedies I have ever seen. This is essentially a gangsta rap version of the movie This Is Spinal It's a shame that few people have heard of this jewel of a film. If you manage to find this film anywhere, do not hesitate to buy even if you do not like rap. There are not many humor movies I give a perfect 10/10. The only ones I can think of right now are this movie, Clerks, The World According to Garp, The Virgin of 40 and Chasing Amy. This film is a hilarious stereotype of gangsta rap. The film tells the story of a woman named Nina Blackburn who makes a documentary about the fictional rap group NWH (N **** z with hats). This is basically the stereotype of a rap group making many controversial songs about being a gangsta.Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedy film and I recommend it even if you're not a fan of the gangsta scene rap. It's a pity that this film is not in the Top 250. <br /> <br /> Duration: 88min <br /> <br /> 10/10
