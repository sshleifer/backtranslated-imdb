I saw the film for the first time at the BBC on July 27, 2005. For me, it was a good interpretation of the person, Conan Doyle, and I really wonder what the Sherlock fans think about it. I also think it's a movie for these fans, whether they agree or not with what is mentioned. You may wonder whether A.C. Doyle was a strong person or had questioned himself. However, he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how was it a sort of semi-biography? Nevertheless, I strongly emphasize this adaptation, it is a film that you must see - even if the films or books of Sherlock Holmes do not interest you - look at it, have fun and give your own opinion.
