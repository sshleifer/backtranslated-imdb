First of all, I would like to point out that the critics of the film were committed by people who made blatant mistakes. Anything with a score below 6/10 is clearly an absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> Creep is an absolutely fantastic movie with incredible movie effects. The actors are very credible, the narrative provoking the reflection and the horror and graphic content extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mysticism in this film. Many questions arise as the audience reveals itself to the weird and bizarre creature that creates the habitat in the tunnels traveled by dark rats. How was Craig created and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> A fantastic movie with a significant cooling factor. A movie with so many unanswered questions and a film that must be enjoyed with others like 28 Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. <br /> <br /> Expect more fantastic movies !!
