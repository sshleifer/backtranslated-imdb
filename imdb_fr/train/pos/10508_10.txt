Mario is invited to Princess Peach Castle for a cake. When Mario gets there, he discovers that Bowser has kidnapped him! Mario must save the day again. Unlike 2D games, Mario can explore anything he wants. He can simply wander around, climb trees, try to look for "1-Ups", find secrets in levels, etc. You can spend four hours in a level. No time limit. There are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and star gates in which you need a certain number of stars to enter. Once you enter these star gates, you must cross a stage and fight Bowser at the end of the stage. To access certain worlds, you need a certain number of stars. You enter the world through a painting. There are so many things to do and so many hours of play, I do not see how someone might not like this game. That's good. This title of launch is the game which assured the players that the N64 would have a good life. Every 3D platform game we know has something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are commonly used examples. Super Mario 64 is one of the biggest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have an N64, buy this game. It's hard to find used, because no one is selling that baby for 5 bucks to the pawnshop. A perfect 10.
