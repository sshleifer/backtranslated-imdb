This film is up there with the classics of all time. The music, the shots and the acting are excellent. Showing the film in black and white gave it a much better appearance and complemented the music perfectly, like Psycho. It is surprising how few people commented on this film. I guess it's a difficult film to find. I gave a 9 to the movie. Watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.
