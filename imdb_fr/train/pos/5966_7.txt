In fact, I never bought in the metal, it was satanic, but this film has somehow played on this idea. Although it is certainly not a film to be taken seriously or to give a very high score, it serves its purpose in that it entertains during the reading. The story goes that a metal band was burned to death in their hotel, one of their fans dreamed about it and said that the band was starting to get killed from the other grave. So yes, a little plot "Nightmare on Elm Street" is happening here. Admittedly, Freddy has never assaulted a girl in a car. There was another movie starring a heavy metal band, but the way it was done was very different, a band sort of taking a town for kids and driving them crazy. This one simply has the group fan who helps the killer spirit at first, then tries to stop it. Nothing to say in it because I do not remember so many bloody deaths. Frankly, the scene that I remember most is the one where the girl wears a helmet and is then molested by an incarnation of the group by a creature. Nothing good, but a good filling time.
