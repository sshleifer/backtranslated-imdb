This film will not go down in the annals of big cinema, but it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. The film is finally on video and should debut. <br /> <br /> The film is about an eclectic group of friends coming together for a dinner they named "The Hungry Bachelors Club". . Jorja Fox plays a woman who acts as surrogate mother to receive a deposit for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a mysterious lover of Cadillac who becomes his lover. Fox gives a discreet and touching performance and Nunn is reliable, as always. Micheal des Barres is a fucking prosecutor. The set features characters - familiar faces - works well together to give life to this group of zany characters. It's a good rental and one of the few that you can watch with the whole family.
