This episode introduced the Holodeck to the TNG world. The Jarada must be contacted and a specific greeting must be delivered otherwise it would insult them a lot. A tired Picard decides to take a trip to the Holodeck and a great adventure begins. The settings are great and look almost like movie. Alas, the Jarada probe sent shortly after damages the holodeck and all its safety devices stop working. Picard and now, customers must thwart the gangsters of 1940s America and return to Jarada's appointment. Picard greets the Jarada properly and a new day rises between humanity and the Jarada. This jewel of an episode of the first season has been the scene of many interesting and unusual adventures.
