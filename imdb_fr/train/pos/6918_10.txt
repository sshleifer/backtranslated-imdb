A very enjoyable film that features characters who do silly things and let emotions such as anger and the desire for revenge dissipate. The cast is very good, there is a lot of action, and Stewart gets the girl and her revenge (with a twist) at the end. I have seen this movie many times and I always watch it when it is on AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
