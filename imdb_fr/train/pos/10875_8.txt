The first Australian slasher film is on the front of the stage. And a stab. And a slice. And a shout or two. And a lot of blood, frights, red herrings and lots of laughs. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are a lot of firsts around Cut - this is Dave Warner's first scenario to be produced, although there are several others in option or negotiation; this is the director's first major film and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; and it is also the first film of the producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a group of guys who are doing this kind for the first time, they know their job. <br /> <br /> Cut tells the story of a group of Australian film students who have heard of a slasher movie, Hot Blooded, it's never been over because director, Hilary ( Kylie Minogue), was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite their speaker (who was assistant director the night Hilary died)) warning them that every time someone tries to revive the production of Hot Blooded, someone dies, director Raffy (Jessica Napier) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decide to go ahead and finish the film. They form a team and manage to bring back the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), Australia - in fact, to its original location - to complete Hot Blooded ?? 14 years after the end of the shoot. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a slasher film, it follows a lot of bleeding ?? long with lots of laughs, some good scares and an Australian soundtrack rocking. Cut shows that Australia can make a good mainstream horror film as well as Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's a carefully crafted feature film, with great special effects, a complicated scenario and a killer - Scarman - it's a welcome addition to Michael, Jason and Freddy.
