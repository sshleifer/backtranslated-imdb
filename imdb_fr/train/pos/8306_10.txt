In reality, they could not have chosen a better-diversified actor to represent Little Richard than Leon. He captures Little Richard in a most credible essence. The outfits were wonderful and anyone watching this film will definitely keep a smile on the face throughout the film. Although the film is a bit long, it keeps your attention on the personality and outfits of Little Richard. The end should have taken the direction of moving Little Richard over into the present where you could see him as he grew older in this new millennium. As far as I am concerned, he will always be the king of rock-roll, no matter what the other media say.
