Genre: Dinosaur, animation, New York, Time travel, circus.? <br /> <br /> Main characters: Rex the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Elsa the Pterodactyl, Dweeb the Parasarolophus, Ooo the Triceratops, a boy named Louis, a girl named Cecilia and Captain New-eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yearlley Smith (Cecilia), Short Martin (Stubbs the clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa), etc.? <br /> <br /> What's going on: Four dinosaurs (see above) are fed "grain cereal" and are now cuddles, friendly dinosaurs that will be kind to children. They go to New York, with big plans ?? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: It's a cute animated film. The animation of dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and not very good, but they still have a nice appearance. I love dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly, they are kind, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the featured characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I like others too. Overall, I really like this movie! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended for: Those who love good animated movies for children, those who love dinosaurs, John Goodman and those who think that circuses are not always what they seem ?? Enjoy! :-)
