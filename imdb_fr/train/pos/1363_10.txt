A great movie of the 90s! Parker Posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan, which requires so much money. Posey gives incredible performance as a librarian and night robot. It's a good light film for Saturday night before going out. The soundtrack is great, the outfits are out of this world, the story is funny and the actors are doing a great job. Cash value: you can do it in this world if you try, just find your niche. I think Parker Posey is the PERFECT actress for this kind of character: young, fabulous and broke. (You need to search for the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you watch Party Girl, you are forced to have a good time. Enjoy!
