Halloween is a movie that I have to go out and watch every time it's this DAY of the year. I even look at it sometimes when it's not the holidays !!! This film is SO AWESOME.Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress that I will never stop loving. This film may be old, but the plot always gives me the same thing, and the acting was absolutely fantastic !!! Although I did not see the remake, I already think it was TOTALLY useless. I think Rob Zombie should NEVER redo such a classic. What kills me however is knowing that there are people who have seen the remake without even hearing about the original. I'm getting angry thinking about it !!!!!! was great and we will always remember the story as a classic.
