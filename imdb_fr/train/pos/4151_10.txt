A convict serving his sentence reports to the Cold Case Unit about the murder of a police officer committed years ago. The assassination of Sean Cooper, a good cop, has never been resolved. Naturally, the detectives think that the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that have frustrated their colleagues. <br /> <br /> In the flashbacks, we are taken to the baptism of the baby of James Bruno. Sean and Jimmy were partners. There is tension when Sean, the godfather, arrives disheveled and late for the rite. Eileen Bruno does not seem to be happy to be here. The true mystery is revealed by her. She surprised Sean, who was drinking with Jimmy in the yard, kissing her husband, and more shocking again, Jimmy willingly answering. <br /> <br /> In one way or another, at the station, partners become the center of gossip. Sean did not love his boss because he discovered the involvement of a criminal in his area who controlled the drug trade. Sean realizes that this man is related to drugs, because he always finds an excuse to free the bags of waste. Sean and Jimmy arrive all the time in the station. The pressure is too much on Jimmy. Sean is comfortable with his homosexuality and wants to be honest about it. Cooper's father does not want to have anything to do with a queer son. Even his superior McCree wants to put him out of his jurisdiction, but the case is complicated because Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men in police positions. Sean is killed because of his homosexual state and his excessive knowledge about the involvement of his peers in the collection of dirty money. <br /> <br /> Tom Petit wrote this honest picture of a policeman's life in the closet and his secret. love with another friend. We thought it was an honest account of a serious business that no one had talked about at the time. Sometimes, those involved in the show, fearing reprisals from sponsors or networks, do not dare to present these real situations. Jeannot Szwarc, shows a sensitive approach to this thorny issue, which is treated without sensationalism, the case could have been shown with a different team. <br /> <br /> There is a rare appearance of Chad Everett as an older Jimmy Bruno. His catch is perfectly at the rendezvous with a touch of sentimentality that does not degenerate. Shane Johnson brings an excellent contribution to the show as Sean Cooper. The casting is wonderful and includes good overall performances from all those under the direction of Mr. Szwarc. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Nick Vera gets closer to his neighbor, the basketball player's mother that the detective took his ball away. Nick goes to romance with the woman!
