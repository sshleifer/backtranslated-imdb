The first criticism I saw on page 3 said "What does madhur bhandarkar finally want to say?" Should he say something so decisive? <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing on page 3 is that it does not take sides. No propaganda whatsoever. It's the film that captures so many aspects of a problem (I do not know what I call a "problem" here) and yet, as any mediocre film does not offer a solution. I was so intrigued when I realized that the film ended almost in the same scenario, exactly as it started. <br /> <br /> The film defines so many characters who have completely different priorities and different ideologies, but which part of the system is all the more apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there would be more spoilers to come. So, look if you want to see one of the most successful movies of the recent period.
