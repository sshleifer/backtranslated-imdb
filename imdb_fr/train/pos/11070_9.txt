I just watched this movie and I can honestly say it is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating of 5.2. <br /> <br /> Guy not only brings together a cast of films ab list (ish) and makes it so glorious characters, he has offered us a film with a fantastic A diversified story that leaves much to the imagination . <br /> <br /> Far too many people want movies with a plot that can be understood and transmitted on a set ... Yet, these are the movies that become poor. critical because they are far too predictable. <br /> <br /> This film is special. Get it now!
