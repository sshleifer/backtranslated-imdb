Like other people who commented "Fr√§ulein Doktor", I stumbled upon this gem on TV late in the evening without having heard of it before. The strange mix of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand, and a realistic and well-documented portrayal of trench warfare, on the other hand, told me fascinated from the start. <br /> <br /> For me, it's one of the five best films about the First World War (the others are "All Quiet on the Western Front", "Paths Of Glory", "Gallipoli" and " Life and nothing else "). And the scene of the poison gas attack is really scary; horses and men appear as horsemen of the apocalypse with their gas masks. <br /> <br /> I only wish I had recorded the film.
