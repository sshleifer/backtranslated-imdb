Well ... easily my favorite TV show. Call me a street clich√©, but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. during a show and you already earn points in my book. Combine all this with a game that goes beyond anything you've ever seen on a small screen, add a staging that matches vintage cinema and especially a writing that blows the mind (and some brains far from the way) and you get a series with which it will be difficult to compete. <br /> <br /> Two actors, James Gandolfini in the role of Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco in the role of his wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini, his role a way that words can not express, if you have not seen it yet as Tony sees it now! <br /> <br /> I can go on and on all the characters in the series, the psychological brilliance, gripping scenes etc. but you could not stop me so all I can say is that this is the only show with Seinfeld, that I'm able to watch again and again from beginning to end and that ends to enjoy it, even more.
