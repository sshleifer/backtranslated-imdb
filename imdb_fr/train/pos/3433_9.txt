I first saw this at a foreign film festival. This is a biting plot about a plot to release the Estonian treasure of about one billion gold. Everything is filmed in a grainy and granular style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it restores wonderfully the atmosphere of the emancipated Baltic States (note: Tallin was actually much less dark in 2003 when I was there). <Br /> <br /> There is also a lot of humor and romance. I do not want to spoil a number of surprises that are both surprising and logical, so I'll simply say that this film of a heist starts with a good script, and that the staging and the performances are top notch. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most challenging example of its kind. I would have opposed RAFIFI, TOPKAPI. RENT OR BUY NOW.
