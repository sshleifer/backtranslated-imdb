Curiously interesting, Western is a director who has had few peers in the genre. Like the other images of Anthony Mann, The Far Country combines a muddy story with a hot water bottle with a skilful knowledge of striking landscapes. The two that appear among the peccadilloes of Mann like honor, integrity, treason and of course death! According to the story, Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan}, two partners in the hunt for fortune, travel to Oregon with a herd of cattle. Aware of the booming gold boom, they plan to make a net profit by selling livestock in a Klondike city. Arrived at Skagway, they find the self-appointed judge, Mr. Gannon {John McIntire}, ready to do justice to Webster on the grounds that Webster broke the law, all with an honest cause. As a punishment, Gannon takes the flock of partners away from them, but they steal them back and cross the Canadian border to get to Dawson - Gannon and his men chase down. Here, beautiful women and a soft, lawless city will fulfill the destinies of all those involved. <br /> <br /> Interesting from start to finish, The Far Country greatly benefits from James Stewart's iconic {anti} hero and Mann's cunning direction from the tight Borden Chase script. The cinematography of William H. Daniels is superlative, even if it has not been favored by the current DVDs, and the film has some surprises and a "Will not he want to do it?" It's still a lot of fun for beginners venturing into the wonderful and dark western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
