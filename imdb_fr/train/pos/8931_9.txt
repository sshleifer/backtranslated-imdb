The intruder (The Intruder), a film directed by the French director Clair Denis, is the release of the film. He follows his own spirit through time, space and character. There may be a conspiracy, but I understood what I learned from the description on the Netflix DVD sleeve. Honestly, it's probably best not to know anything about the film before watching it, because the viewer can then put all his expectations aside. The film requires the viewer to reflect, but he also denies that he or she will not achieve complete understanding. <br /> <br /> The human heart is the enigma of the film. Each image questions its role, its nature and its form. The heart is the intruder, that of the spectator and that of Louis. The character of Louis is interpreted by Michel Subor with the peace and the mystery required by such a character. Honestly, anyone could have played Louis' character if he had a wandering, willing and comfortable heart. Yet, Subor is the one presented here. it becomes the film, its identity is inseparable. Most of the film's images that run through my head revolve around his vocal, but mostly physical expressions. <br /> <br /> The Intruder is poetic in his ability to capture the calm and fullness of movement, but more fluid than any literature in the form he refuses to take. "Surrealist" is a term used to describe this film, but perhaps "quasi-realistic" is a better term. Nothing in the film exists outside the possibilities of reality; the simple, ubiquitous partition confirms that by imagining in music the connection between the heart rhythm and the faint light. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer a few times if you are attracted by the visual image; see the movie to see the consequences of combining worms and seizure for freedom.
