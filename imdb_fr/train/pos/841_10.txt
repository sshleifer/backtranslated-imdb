I thought it was a deeply fun black comedy. Brosnan is a genius; as everyone will say now, it should not be cataloged as the link. Kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role. I do not know if I laughed so much in a movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite phrase would be "I feel like a bitch from Bangkok one Sunday after the departure of the Navy from the city". Brosnan delivered this line without links with such unexpected comic finesse. I was also very impressed by the performance of Hope Davis. It seems that everyone in this film has separated from his previous work to such an extent that he really improved the comedy. If you like the dark and hilarious movie 'The Weather Man', you will definitely like this. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
