I can not accept the negative comments of other critics. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I left the cinema happy not to have been influenced by critics of IMDb. Fourteen hours later, I'm still trying to find flaws in the plot, but I do not see anything serious. My advice to everyone is to see it for yourself and make up your own mind. <br /> <br /> The same goes for Basic Instinct 1, but the plot is less confusing. This left me still wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and perverse as before and is very well at 48; this remains his determining role. David Morrisey was satisfied even though he was not Michael Douglas. I particularly liked David Thewlis in the secondary cast as a police detective.
