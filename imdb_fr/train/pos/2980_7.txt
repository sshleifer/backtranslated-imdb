This movie is just funny. stupid, but funny. to enjoy this movie completely, you can not get an idea of ​​how a movie like this is going and just enjoy all the jokes and word games that are involved in the movie. I always find the begining funny when he says "want a beer ........ cock". funny stuff. but what makes the film decent is the fact that it is not difficult to give a serious twist to the film, too many comedies try to have serious aspects that we do not believe. But this is different and focuses only on being funny. I must say however that Yasmin bleeds is terrible in the movie and adds nothing but the 3 main characters, coop, remer and squeak are very fun to watch and make the movie super to watch
