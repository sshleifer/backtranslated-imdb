I saw this film before joining the British army. I followed my basic training, difficult at first, then much easier. My time was spent at the height of the NI troubles and the cold war. I have sometimes wondered what I had immersed myself in, not for a long time, because training always took over and you always reacted instinctively. The voice-over showed what the soldiers thought was perfect, although I would have added extra breathing and heart rate, which would seem to pound your eardrums in given situations. A few years later, I was in Canada for a family reunion. One of my aunts living in the United States and lecturer at Columbus Uni Ohio had written an article about the effects of the British army at NI. She spent time researching. Although she was expatriated, she was very anti-British. She made a bee line for me and sentenced me to be a British soldier. My only response was to see the movie "A long day dying." It is the closest a civilian can understand why a soldier does what he does. The answer is right at the end.
