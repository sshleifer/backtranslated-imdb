That's what one of the girls said in the end. <br /> <br /> Is the football match a metaphor for a qualifying match between girls (or, more broadly, a free-thinking group) and authority? "In Germany" means a promising future? <br /> <br /> It's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experiences I've ever experienced - despite a crude cinematography and plot, and a slight over-action (though I like the actors - they are adorable and well above the expectation for hobbyists). The ridiculous situation is well captured. I can feel the deep frustration of being denied a game (being a woman and a football fan) and I can not help but think of how to make a convincing disguise. I wonder why there is no women's section offering protection against vulgar language and bad behavior - elimination of imperfect reasons for denial. <br /> <br /> The film is very well done - the incredible title, the filming during the match, the spontaneity and various methods to put the viewers in the skin of the characters - the game is so important but inaccessible (not shown ), the light and the cheering sound of the stadium, the confinement of the van, and its uselessness when those inside connect with the crowds celebrating on the outside. I can feel the comfort of radio, drinks and food, and of course the kindness and consideration of each character towards others. During the closing credits, I am amused by the fact that no character has a name - he is just a "soldier" and she is a "girl" or a "sister".
