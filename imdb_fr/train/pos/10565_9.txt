In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced in three Warner Brother musicals that offered the public of the Depression era a momentary distraction from their woes. The Gold Diggers of 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade all took place in the world of Broadway Theater with essentially the same theme of the show. In addition to Keeler and Powell, these films feature Buske Berkeley's kaleidiscopic choreography, theatrics and many other musicians. <br /> <br /> All are indisputably classics of the genre, but I must admit a clear preference for Footlight thanks to its energy of rhythm and the head of James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter in 42nd Street perform admirably of their responsibilities in the production of shows, especially Baxter in the exhausted Julian Marsh in search of a last box-office success. Both do not have the contagious energy of Cagney, which perfectly complements the frenetic rhythm of the production of a Broadway musical. It is an absolute whirlwind as it deals with production figures, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic he is. The scenario crackles with sharp double senses delivered by a cast of superlatives including Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell, which reduces everyone to the size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surrealistic, evocative and daring, almost before the arrival of the Hollywood code in '34. Unfortunately, the '30s and beyond would never have seen such a rich musical with verve and Footlight's pellet again. Kindness and morality have ensured.
