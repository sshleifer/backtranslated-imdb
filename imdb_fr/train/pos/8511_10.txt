This film reinvents the term "Spring Breakumentary". Hans, the bulk of the group, deploys his talents in this generation, Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "the king of the $ 1 bet," shows he's no longer in Kansas by steadily increasing bets. Kyle's laughter is really contagious and also gives the ladies a little fun (just like Matt). The dwarves, while having their moments, did not do justice to the Mexican hat dance as it deserves. And finally, we have our protagonist, Ed. He gives hope to all of us who bounce, stumble, gangly, pale people who are always looking for someone special. And this hope, is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. This blockbuster has just missed the rooms, but it's a must-see, because we can all relate to one of these spring tours.
