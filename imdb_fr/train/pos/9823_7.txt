I really thought it was not so bad. This is not a great work of art, but Dermot M was by far the most powerful. Patricia Arquette worked far too often. In fact, he played the cello, which was very impressive and his lines were never forced. Besides, he's an incredibly handsome man. Really sexy. Add that to talent, and most of the things he's gone to are much more tolerable. He always gives everything, even if some of the projects in which he was hired did not really reach the highest mark. Not the fault of the actor in most cases. He has unfortunately been in strange movies that have not resonated at the box office. Always with first-rate actors, but not always "successful". But it's "worth every penny" of any DVD rented or bought. See the wedding date with Debra Messing - one of his best global films. WORTH EVERY CENTIM! ; ) (if you have not seen it yet, then you will understand this quote!)
