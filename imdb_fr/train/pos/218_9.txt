Taking over the roles played by Jack Albertson and Sam Levene on Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns play some old vaudeville comics, a team inspired by the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who seem to have a different view of life. <Br /> <br /> Walter Matthau can not stop working, the man has never learned to relax, take time and smell roses. He's an old moron whose best days are behind him. His nephew and agent, Richard Benjamin, finds less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What hurt him a lot was that 15 years ago his partner George Burns decided to retire and spend time with his family. A workaholic like Matthau can not understand it and make Burns' decision personally. <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits on a brain storm, reunites guys and does it on a national TV show. What is happening here is quite hilarious. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys is also a sad and bitter-sweet story about old age. Matthau is on screen for most of the film, but Burns received the award as an Oscar at the age of 79. <br /> <br /> Burns brought a personal touch to this movie. well. As we all know, he was the man of nothing of the wonderful Burns & Allen comedy team, to whom the Monty Python troupe borrowed a lot. In 1958, for health reasons, Gracie Allen retired and George continued until the age of 100. Or at least, he's almost an active artist. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys is based on the Smith & Dale team, however, and if you like The Sunshine Boys, I highly recommend going to Two Tickets to Broadway to watch two guys entertaining the audience. American at the turn of the last century. The doctor's sketch that Matthau and Burns make directly from their material. <br /> <br /> And I really think you'll like the Sunshine Boys.
