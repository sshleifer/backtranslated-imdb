Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gives everyone the ability to love the whole world, but since the heart of a human being is very small, every human being has that special place that he loves more than other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of today's most prominent directors when they decided to profess eternal love for this privileged place and to describe the situations lived by its inhabitants and its visitors. The result is a magnificent collection of short films, Paris I love you, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a breathtaking walk in the Parisian districts, human feelings , aspirations and expectations. <BR /> <br /> Always another neighborhood, always a moving story about ordinary people looking for love, whether in a parking lot, an art studio, a subway station. And Paris I love you speaks of a wide range of loves - love for his partner, his child, his parent, for those who counted for us for the world but are no longer there, a love that needs to be reborn, a chance love for this stranger to meet your eyes, or a love that is not supposed to be ... today, but tomorrow - who knows? Nevertheless, this film is not only about love, but about life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion. , daily ups and downs. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all, but rather warm and hopeful. <br /> <br /> I give this film the note 9 because the last part of this film suggests how some stories might develop later, but not all and that's what I missed, and by "Further development", I do not mean a specific reference to the future of the characters. As for everything else, I can only say - captivating. Make you want to leave everything behind you, flee to Paris and live these little love stories yourself.
