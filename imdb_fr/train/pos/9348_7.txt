What we have here is a situation. A man is in distress and people want to help him - in a contrasting way. In the end, they are forced to give up. You can not repair people. And although under various aspects, Reign Over Me is conventionally Hollywood, this message is not the case. <br /> <br /> This story does not concern Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 plane that has entered an almost psychotic state of PTSS since. This is what Charlie does with Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a dentist in New York who was his roommate at the dental school and who, knowing his tragedy, sees him in the street and reconnects him. Charlie walks on a small motorized scooter - a fancy device to negotiate traffic in Manhattan - with big headphones on a mass of unruly hair. The hair is Sandler's main accessory to show that he is disturbed. And the use of music as an escape must hit all subway users who use an iPod at home. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a disaster, but paradoxically, Alan, stuck with a woman mistress (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon begins to envy. Charlie lives as a nutty teenager with a huge trust fund (tragedy money) and starts dragging Alan to "hang out", "eat Chinese", buy records or attend a Mel Brooks marathon at a rep. Charlie lives in a beautiful apartment protected by a cursed hostess, redo the kitchen again and again, picking up the old Springsteen vinyl, the Who, etc., and playing a video game called Shadow of the Collosus on a giant screen in a big living room. <br /> <br /> Charlie's in-laws worries a lot for him, but also with resentment, as we will see later. Alan has a new patient who offers him. Charlie's desperation makes us see Alan's. Trying to help Charlie allows Alan to partly escape his own stifling realities, but partly to make him more aware of his reality. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Sandler are a strange couple, but that does not matter, because it's convincing that they might need each other. Charlie is desperate for the company of a friend who has never known his family, because to escape his loss, he pretends to have never had one. And what if, as a roommate, Charlie slept naked and slept walking and had a terrible musical taste (without Motown)? Alan wants to escape his own life and emasculating. He is under the control not only of his wife, but of his dental partners, who control it even though it was he who set up the firm. They are white, by the way, and he is black. <br /> <br /> There is also the lascivious patient of hell, who seriously upsets things in dentists' offices, but begins to be different when Charlie passes by and notices that she is a baby. His libido seems to be ready to revive at any time. He is also attracted to the breasts of Liv Tyler, a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists, who try to treat Charlie while admitting he may need help. <br /> <br /> The crazy scenes of Sandler are a little too theatrical, as are many plots (in fact, this film looks like a play in more ways than one), but it has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in a deeply touching way. <br /> <br /> Charlie's not just delusional and sad, but dangerous and violent, and all those efforts to help him turn against him. The film is admirable in that it gives the impression that people can not be treated properly. It's an interesting film - sometimes touching - and this is the first time September 11th has been treated in terms of the suffering of the survivors. But there is an element of comedy that sometimes seems insipid, many people are too attracted and the too big interiors of Hollywood have a terrible decor. only the streets of Manhattan seem real. There is a courtroom scene that is absurd, and Donald Sutherland is a judge who is too good to be true. Alan's family problem is solved too easily by a phone call. And yet, it's worth looking for the acting - the control and subtlety of Cheadle, and Sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in PT's 2002 Punch-Drunk Love. Anderson, although it's clearly a better movie, actually a much better one.
