In his Hollywood debut, Henry Brommell produced a captivating story that presented pervasive marital problems that could be recounted with a melancholy authenticity, and such intrigue with an equally absorbing plot of a successful father-to-son business. The film is artfully crafted and consists of a wonderfully assembled cast and a fast, family-conscious (also Brommell) script that brings an otherwise tired genre to life. As a bonus, "Panic" offers a subtle and bitter humor - an unexpected surprise, undeniably charming and very welcome - thanks to its chaotic, insecure and unobtrusive star, whose always-cool state is attractive, especially given its field of activity. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy, forever eternal, again captivates our heart as Alex, a husband and father unhappy, torn, middle-aged who finds solace in the most dubious people: Sarah (Neve Campbell), a 23-year-old girl, seductive and just as ill-tempered as she meets in the waiting room of a psychologist's office, where she is waiting for therapy from Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) to discuss his growing eagerness to leave the family business built by his father (Donald Sutherland). Alex, whose desire to lead a new life is thwarted by the fear of disappointing his dictator father, arouses a senseless fantasy for Sarah, which eventually leads him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being a husband for his wife and More importantly, he is the good father of his six-year-old son Sammy (played with enthusiasm by the endearing David Dorfman). <br /> <br /> The brilliant 'Panic' by Henry Brommell is a rarity in Hollywood rarely seen (with the exception of 'Road to Perdition' from 2002) since its conception in 2000, it mixes two conflicting genres (organized crime, family drama) into a fascinating and warm piece of movie watching that is also powerful in both directions ?? it is the one that will maintain its extraordinary and rare caliber and its brilliant sincerity for centuries to come.
