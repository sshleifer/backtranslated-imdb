<br /> <br /> Filmed just after the war, this story was designed to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war. He ended up receiving the honor of being the first royal premier after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> It is remarkable that the film embraces the Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud Psychology, the founding fathers of America and various other staircases (special effects in its infancy) and beyond the heavenly gates without nothing to lose its integrity. <br /> <br /> Although this may seem absurd, this astute scenario entails and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the address of a mountain goat and a spectacle of a charming ease rarely equaled in cinema since. <br /> <br /> Get ready to warm your heart with this sweet, innocent and charming love story. Roger Livesey acts as a man possessed to steal the show !!!! <br /> <br /> British cinema should cry when it remembers its quality at the beginning of the post-war period. <br /> <br />
