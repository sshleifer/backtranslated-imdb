When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) stands precariously at the edge of a balcony above the city, seemingly hypnotized and about to die, it immediately reminded me of an almost identical scene from another nine-year-old film later, "The Woman in Green" in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is about to throw himself into space while being hypnotized. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes survive these attempted murders by unscrupulous criminals. Exciting cinematic thriller in these two scenes. When will they learn that you can not blur the minds of the great fictional detectives?
