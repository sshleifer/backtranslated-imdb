Okay, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone here says it's the worst! But it's not!!! Did not you see Freddy's revenge ??? WTF! It was the worst of all !!! Now this movie is pretty decent and sticks to Freddy's story and it's cool that he has a girl, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> And then I discovered that it was in 3D! I was so excited that I remember when I saw it on the DVD box, I immediately jumped to 3D footage. There were a lot of things in 3D but like Lisa Zanes, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean holding a knife, Lisa Zane with a baseball bat, Doc's hand, Freddy's head exploding . <br /> <I really loved this movie because it was in 3D, but I would like the whole movie to be in 3D, not just the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's 15 minutes. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
