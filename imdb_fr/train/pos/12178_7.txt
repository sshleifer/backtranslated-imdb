I think this movie got a bad rating because it was judged by its worst moments. There's a joke about diarrhea and an embarrassing scene that scratches the nuts, but other than that, there are actually many moments that made me laugh out loud. Jason Lee plays a wonderfully subtle comedy in this film and Julia Stiles manages to be very funny herself. Apart from this, this film behaves like most romantic comedies. After about 40 minutes, you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know it after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, better movies to watch, but certainly not the worst choice ...
