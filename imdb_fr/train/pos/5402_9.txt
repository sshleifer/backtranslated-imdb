Hitokiri (roughly translated as "assassination"), a kuk / a "Tenchu" which roughly translates as "divine punishment") presents Hideo Gosha at the top of his form. Do not miss this one, or the other classic Gosha, Goyokin! Hitokiri is not only one of Gosha's best films, it's one of the best "samurai / chambara" movies of all time, and perhaps one of the best Japanese films ever exported. <br /> <br /> Be warned, all these intricate elements The details of the plot in Hitokiri can be a bit difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with Japanese history of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers. As is the norm for Gosha, Hitokiri proposes another variant of his traditional theme "loyalty to his lord" and "do what is right". However, Gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication, that it's really the movie to see (with Goyokin, of course). <br /> <br /> I guess it breaks down like this: If you want a simpler game, more action-oriented story, you might want to see Goyokin. However, if you want a more thoughtful and multi-layered drama (albeit ominous), check out this one. <br /> <br /> (Okay, well, the bottom line is that the historical context is a huge power deal between many different samurai clans either (1) working to reform, while retaining, the Tokugawa shogunate, and (2) Those trying to install Emperor Meiji as supreme ruler of Japan Of course, clans working "for" Emperor Meiji were often less interested in "reforming" Japan rather than giving their own clan more of power in the "new world order." Ironically, the entire feudal system was officially abolished, making it one of the first reforms of the Meiji government on irony - this makes the plot all the sweeter -am√®re.) <br /> <br /> What distinguishes "Hitokiri" from Gosha's other films is the mature sense of Gosha's cinematography. Each shot is carefully composed, and (just like Kubrick's Barry Lyndon), every image in the film can retain its compositional character. Of course, this is typical of Gosha. Hitokiri really stands out with breathtaking scenery, including (as with Goyokin) many fascinating seascapes. Just watch the opening sequence and you're hooked! Make no mistake, this is not an English coin: Hitokiri is extremely violent (do not say you have not been warned). <br /> <br /> What else, apart from a nice camera work, allows Hitokiri to stand out? The performances seem a little more subtle in this one. Katsu Shintaro (from Zatoichi / Hanzo the Razor) is starring as the protagonist / anti-hero in conflict, Okada Izo. Katsu manages to instill in humanity a character who seems almost wilder than wicked. Throughout the film, you are never really sure whether you are engaged or revolted by the character of Okada. At the same time, Katsu's portrayal of Okada's voracious thirst for respect and subsequent pathetic attempts at redemption seem so human that you can not help but feel empathy / sympathy. Of course, after watching Nakadai Tatsuya play the tortured hero in "Goyokin", it's a pleasure to see him play such a ruthless villain in "Hitokiri". It's just perfect, there is nothing more to say! <br /> <br /> Finally, perhaps more interesting for fans than for casual fans, do not miss the last appearance on the screen of Mishima Yukio (yes, the ultranationalist gay novelist right who 's was killed by seppuku in front of the crowd of Japanese soldiers who were making fun of him, whom he had "kidnapped" in 1970, and who had made a film about his life and his work by Paul Schrader), who does a pretty solid job (for an assassin) Shinbei Tanaka.
