Drama / Action classic western with an incredible cinematography which is well ahead of its time (1954). The production is very good and we can say that it was done with pride and love.A unique look at the American pioneers of NORTHT WEST is very educational and entertaining.This movie is very underrated because most people do not like not see the reality "the lawyers" at this time and place were very distorted / corrupt, like most developing countries today. The action sequences might have been more realistic, but the film still covers most of the essential elements. Not for a public who wants The testosterone westerns of this film are more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
