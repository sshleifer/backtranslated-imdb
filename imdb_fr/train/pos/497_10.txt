Call me teenager, but I really think it's an excellent series. If you have not had the opportunity to watch a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely watch this one. Perhaps more convincing than Voyager's Caretaker, who launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely different, but strangely familiar ... The music is catchy too. No real science fiction fan can live without seeing at least one episode of Star Trek - and these payments are worth it.
