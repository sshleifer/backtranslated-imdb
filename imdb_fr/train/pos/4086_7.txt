Sensational. Uh ... well ... wow! I guess I'll start with the plot. A fiancee woman (Lucy) arrives at her house and is her husband (Mathurin) in France, where she waits for the arrival of the bishop or the cardinal or someone from the Catholic Church to marry her (to satisfy a In the meantime, young Lucy discovers the legend of a beast that roamed the earth centuries ago. In bed that night, she begins to fantasize about the Beast and her violated and consensual meeting with the old lady of the house. This is where it gets interesting! The plot is really very thin (and it seems to last a long time in the middle of the film), but the filmmaker rewards (?) Those who resist it with a shocking and hilarious finale. /> This movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for a good cinema, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an extravagant movie about bestiality (which almost casts a sympathetic look on the subject), this movie is for you! (If your stomach is weak, do not be afraid of it.In addition to a horse action at the beginning, the "actions" are rather caricaturists, IMO)
