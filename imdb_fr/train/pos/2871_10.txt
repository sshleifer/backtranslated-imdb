Comment? As my comment is necessary? We speak of masterpiece of all time, for all seasons and all generations. This is just the type of movies I still have patience to watch. In this, as in other Disney movies, there is a kind of magic. All the characters are in a way "alive" and "real", so it's easy to understand the message, even if you do not understand the language (as if I did not understand the first time I watched a movie, I was about six years old). Maybe my English is not very good, but I especially learned what I know about this type of film, and that's another extra dimension of this type of film, which is rare on time current. But there is a great shame. In my country, it's now impossible to watch this, or any other Disney movie! We do not have copyright and our children are handicapped to take advantage of this type of film and learn from it. So, let's see this movie "Once Upon a Dream" or ...?
