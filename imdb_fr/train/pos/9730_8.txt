British press reviews seem to have focused on the fact that critics tend to know Toby Young, the journalist on whom the story of this film is based. The key word here is "based". How To Lose Friends is a fictional romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York City, where he then blundered after blundering before finally succeeding. This involves its sale, and the film has serious arguments to make about journalistic integrity. However, they are not exaggerated: the main substance remains a comedy centered on the misadventures of Sidney. The scenario has its cake and eats it in the sense that Sidney is a stupid and well-intentioned jester, while being a skilled writer, deft and moderately obnoxious. This contradiction is never really a problem, as Simon Pegg (as Sidney) anticipates sympathy too well. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges underutilizes Sidney's editor a little too effectively, and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous as the future conflict And Sidney's Affections And, as far as Megan Fox (who plays a bimbo starhead), I can only say this: just say the word, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, I will sell all my possessions and buy me a plane ticket to take my place at your side as your wife. Of course, since I'm a big English accountant aged 56, my offer may not appeal to you, but it's still on the table. Given the brevity of her career, one might think that it's a bit too early for Megan Fox to take on a role that ruthlessly embodies the kind of actress she might be supposed to become: however, she does it nicely, competently, and extremely sexily. This girl will go far. <br /> <br /> Experienced performers, Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the United Kingdom, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the United States, lend their unwavering support. <br /> <br /> There are many moments of laughter and I smiled almost all the time. As always, the word F appears when it does not really need it, even if at least two of them are very funny.
