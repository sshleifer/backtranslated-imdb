When I went to The Shining for the first time, I was expecting a movie worthy of what I had heard, and I really liked Stanley Kubrick's work, but when I started to look at him, he was so much better than I thought. Sometimes I felt ridiculously uncomfortable and I could not leave the eyes of the screen but there is always something very disturbing throughout the film. Now, some people do not like Kubrick's The Shining version since it does not completely follow Stephen King's book, but in my opinion, the Kubrick version, the miniseries and the book are all excellent. Nicholson gives an impressive performance. If you are looking for a good original movie that will make you think even after movies, then watch The Shining.
