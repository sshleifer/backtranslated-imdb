Many critics here explain in detail the story and characters of 'Opening Night', so I will not do it. I just want to add my comment that I think the film is a wonderful statement of life. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Myrtle Gordon remembered how "easy" it was to act at age 17. youth and energy and felt that she knew the truth. The experience left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life was and even if she can continue to live. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour, she rediscovers the power of her art and reaffirms herself ("I'm going to bury this bastard," she tells another actor Maurice as she goes on stage). It sounds almost sadistic when Myrtle's director stops people from helping her when she gets drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she must have the courage to do it herself if she wants to do it at all. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder if this triumph is only a temporary break in Myrtle's downward trajectory. I think it's really her "opening night" - she opens up like a flower to new possibilities of life and action, she sees a way forward. It's extremely moving. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is superb. The movie is superb. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
