Shinjuku Triad Society: It is unlikely that the wars of the Chinese mafia will be distributed in the West outside of film festivals. Why? Could your censors support a movie in which police officers would violently rape male and female suspects to make them talk (and the victims would benefit) or see an old lady get her eyes torn from the skull? These are just some of the shocks that await viewers of this story of ultra-violent cops and gangsters. Clockwork Orange, banned in the UK for years, looks like a Disney cartoon. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie? YES This is a fantastic and essential viewing for fans of Asian cinema. The shocking moments are there to illustrate what happens in the world of these characters. If you like that, make sure to catch Dead or Alive, which is very similar (except for the insane ending in DOA of course). Great for Japan, they have a talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance to see this film apart from a retrospective Takashi Miike at a film festival is on DVD. If I did not delay you, try to find a Hong Kong version on the web, because I'm sure it will be released in this country.
