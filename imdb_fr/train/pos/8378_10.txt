What a beautiful film it is. The notion of nations sending people to fight with giant robots is insane. The end is not right, it's more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But the characters intrigue me. It is unfortunate that we never see the relationship between Achilles and Athena grow beyond a few kisses and Athena's fear for the safety of Achilles. Their romance is very nice. <br /> <br />
