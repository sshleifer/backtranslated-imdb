I have seen this movie many times and for my life, I do not understand why some people compare it to Babe. This film does not deal with the secret life of ALL animals that can speak in secret. Instead, this is a parrot who learns to speak to help his owner, a little girl who seriously mumbles, overcomes her speech disorder and separates from her in a heartbreaking scene at first. Then the big trip begins. Paulie le Perroquet goes in search of his great friend, Marie. <br /> <br /> On the way, he meets several fantastic people and many nasty people. He falls in love with a parrot and loses it. He gets scammed into a life of crime and is then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit it. <br /> <br /> He tells his story to a friendly guardian of the laboratory who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved. Married. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub shines like the kind concierge who has an open mind and a big heart and is determined to help little Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the parrot's voice AND one of the sordid characters he meets. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of suggestive language, but this film is suitable for most children, and even more so if parents are joining the fun and watching too. It's a story of epic, spiritual, spiritual and spiritual animal adventures and finally a great love story about a bird and its little daughter. Her search for Marie ends with a rather unexpected surprise for most people who are unfamiliar with parrots. <br /> <br /> The children who have seen the wild parrot tribes of Los Angeles and Pasadena will have every interest to see them this movie and understand that birds, especially parrots, are not pets disposable. All children around the world will see that pets are themselves deeply attached and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to cherish. <br /> <br /> So no BABE here, but an amazing journey with a twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to tear during sad moments.
