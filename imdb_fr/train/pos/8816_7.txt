Given the nature and origin of the eleven filmmakers, it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral against America. The most "anti" segment probably comes from Ken Loach, who certainly does not take advantage of the British New Labor party. Although the events that occurred a year ago are shocking and painful for most Americans and most of the viewers who have seen them happen on CNN, etc., the majority of writers and directors have chosen to show that the tragedy was not an American monopoly. Is it any wonder that these 3,000 dead are given the same weight elsewhere than the one the West gives to thousands of Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnian, Chilean and Kurdish victims? If it were an "awakening" for states, it is just as tragic that in the next 12 months the stalemate between Israel and Palestine is further from a solution as George Bush Jnr. would rather take revenge than make the world safer. I think many contributors are wondering where the idealism of the founding fathers has gone and why America, originally built as a bastion of freedom, justice and tolerance, now sees its interest as paramount , while the third world wonders where will the next drink, meal or ball come from.
