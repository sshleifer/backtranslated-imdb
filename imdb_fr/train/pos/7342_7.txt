I do not pretend to be a fan of Ralph Bakshi, because I am not. So far, I have watched only 5 of his animated films: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz the Cat and The Lord of the Rings and finally "Fire and Ice". What I can claim is that I found "Fire and Ice" as the most pleasant of terrains. This is an imaginary fantasy story of swords and witchcraft inspired by Conan the Barbarian, but the beauty of his works, his realistic animation and his animated film music lend a very classic charm to this film. <br /> <br /> First deserving mention, is the animation itself. I do not care what people say about rotoscoping but in my opinion, Ralph Bakshi used this technique very effectively here. I was surprised at how realistic the movements of the characters were. Photo-realistic style and photo-realistic designs have made "Fire and Ice" more like a big-budget blockbuster than a cartoon. Unfortunately, the level of detail of the art tends to become a bit incoherent, especially towards the end of the film. Some scenes really look really flat with little or no body contour, or folds and shadows on the characters. <br /> <br /> With realistic moving characters, a realistic action would naturally follow. Not only was the action well choreographed, but it was really brutal. I would be bold enough to compare the brutality of the action to action movies like Zack Snyder's 300. I noticed, however, that even though blood had been spilled, the splash of blood was reduced to a minimum. Again, it's a great choice from the creative team that only enhances the viewing experience by not taking things too far beyond reality. <br /> <br /> Although I do not recognize any "big name" in the cast, the voice actors manage to provide a satisfying performance; keep the delivery of each line realistically moderate and block it only in the case of bad guys. <br /> <br /> Did I say the bad guys? Yes I did it. Because that's exactly what we're talking about in history, a standard tale against good versus evil. Nothing really original in this story that seems to be just a mix of pre-existing fantasy movies that involve warriors and scantily dressed young ladies. Anyone looking for "depth" would be sorely disappointed. The characters are not very developed and some, like Nekron and Darkwolf, are at best only one dimension (I've heard of deleted scenes that would explain Darkwolf's obsession with killing Nekron and his mother.) deserved a complete restoration and should have been included in the final cup to add a level of depth to the show). In fact, I would not be surprised to find out that the whole movie was just a "tech demo" to showcase great animation and art, with the story paved and thrown afterwards to make it look like a real " movie". <br /> <br /> A true classic of a bygone era, "Fire and Ice" truly captures the flamboyant spirit of adventure and mysticism with its magnificent renditions of fantastic creatures and charming characters. It's a unique vision of a world created by Ralph Bakshi and the artist Frank Frazetta with a good measure of action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Will it meet the standards of today's animated film? Definitely not. But I encourage fans of animation in general to "get up from their big horse" and give this simple but beautiful film a chance to grow. It's really a jewel of the 80s to discover.
