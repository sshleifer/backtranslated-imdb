In all honesty, if someone told me that the director of The Unfortunate Events series by Lemony Snicket, City of Angels, and Caspers was going to make a pretty little independent film on a budget and that would be really good, I would say this no one has to joke. But that's what director Brad Siberling did. And it was really good. <br /> <br /> "10 Items or Less" has a claim similar to that of films like "Before Sunrise", "Lost in Translation" or, more recently, "Once". It is a chance meeting of two people who, if they were not, would probably never have crossed each other, or would never say so. Like these films, "10 Items or Less" focuses on the relationship that develops and how the characters manage to understand each other and exploit their strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of Morgan Freeman. An anonymous actor who looks for his role as a grocery employee in an upcoming independent film and ends up spending the day with the lady in one of the 10 or less movies played by Paz Vega. She has a rotten marriage and hopes to land a new secretary position. Initially, Freeman's character just needs a lift to get home. After spending time with her, however, he wants to meet her and maybe even offer her some advice. <br /> <br /> Brad Siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between Freeman and Vega. The plot is simply a configuration that allows these two characters to interact for most of the 80 minutes of the movie. Freeman has fun with his character, because he appears as an outsider in the lower classes that Scarlett, the character of Vega, lives. Vega, meanwhile, is not limited to the obstinate saleswoman, disconcerted by the situation of his life, which seeks to move forward. <br /> <br /> This film contains some elements that made the difference. First, Siberling probably took note of independent filmmaking to make sure the relationship is sincere and does not fall into Hollywood's trap. It is a very reciprocal friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film. It works, even if the situation itself seems a little inconceivable. <br /> <br /> I am also impressed by the performances. Although Freeman's presence gives this film credibility from the start, it shows a certain amount of charm and pleasure that is not usually seen from him. Paz Vega, meanwhile, is preparing for a breakthrough in American cinema in the future. I loved her in spanglish and she is as good here as the tough Scarlet. Towards the end of the film, she successfully translates the growth of her character. I can not wait to see her in more movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, 10 Items of Less works best as a character, well written and directed by Brad Siberling. He did not write much and his work in the cinema consisted mainly of big Hollywood movies. Still, there is certainly an artist at work here and I can not wait to see if he will take this road again.
