Next to "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz", it remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It's a shame that it's not as well known as the previous movies (maybe because it's a story based on legends rather than contemporary or science-fiction sets, and that it is a British film, which means a smaller market for films). Know that this reputation deserves to be deserved. <br /> <br /> Like all great family movies, you can enjoy this movie with a child, an adult or even a teenager (I'm currently 18), but you have to enjoy classic movies first. I love that movie. It has an extraordinary score of Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classical movie score) that rivals all of John Williams's "Star Wars" scores, a fast but not flashy rhythm, beautiful scenery, dialogue and use of the color (the decorations and the cinematography won at the Oscars) and the ultramodern special effects awarded at the Oscars (for the moment and some are still breathtaking). And of course, June Duprez's sultry airs like the princess rivals those of Catherine Zeta-Jones (she even looks like Jones somehow!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movie times (next to "The Adventures of Robin Hood") and it really deserves more attention. It's a real adventure of enchantment, and with Robin Hood, it's my film on a desert island that I could watch again and again without getting upset. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (excellent)
