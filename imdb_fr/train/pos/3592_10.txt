Another powerful chicks movie. This time, it revolves around Diana Gusman, who is still fighting at school. Instead of being evicted, she carries her anger elsewhere in the ring. She trains in boxing and meets Adrian, a featherweight, and begins to fall in love with it. This film contains a powerful message: realize your dreams and accompany them even if someone does not believe in you (in this case, his father does not believe in her). This alone is worth the movie worth the price. Enjoy
