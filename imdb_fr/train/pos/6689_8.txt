As a comic reader, who still considers me a total kid, I admit that I may have been a bit biased towards this film. I mean, there has not been a good movie of superheroes for a long time (NOTE: Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted this film to be good and, unlike most of my recent film trips (read Blair Witch Project), I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mystery Men was certainly not a tension, nor a tension-filled action movie, it was a comedy. And on that basis, it was a success. Everyone in the little theater laughed and was applauded and laughed throughout the final stage. Stiller and Garofolo are hilarious together, as always, and Azaria adds the right touch of craziness. William H. Macy plays a big hetero, while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens, with fart power, are added only for the happiness of the children. <br /> <br /> Although the sets are weird (and sometimes look like Batman and Blade Runner scams), and some of the jokes are obvious, it's still just funny. Some lines will even surprise the most jaded spectator and cry the most beautiful laughter of our belly. <br /> <br /> I really recommend this movie. Although not a classic all time, it's twice as funny as the last Austin Powers retread. The writing is good and the distribution is excellent. If you are worried, plan your morning and pay less, but in any case you will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who among us is not looking for losers from time to time?
