One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think I've seen this for a long time on the network or cable TV. Watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air in the middle of a TV show full of boring reality shows and reruns. <br /> <br /> I must say that I had my reservations. After all, critics were almost unanimous in calling out scandal and downgrading the show. But after half an hour (by the way, thank you, NBC, for organizing a show without advertising), I ended up with the feeling of instant love, love at first sight, the true love that the we feel in his guts. . Everything about this show shouted at EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> The graphics of this show were at least as good as those of Finding Nemo and Shrek. It was no mean feat if you took years to develop these films. <br /> <br /> The distribution was fantastic. I'm biased to the voice of John Goodman, but the rest of the team was certainly tied with John. Special mention: the appearance of Lisa Kudrow. She was at the top of the game by creating a neurotic, plump and adorable panda with a Jewish streak. (Brooklyn Panda? Only in this show.) <br /> <br /> The script was funny, with lots of jokes for adults and adults that were sharp, but not mocking. A note for all parents: it's not for kids. This show has never been announced as such, and there is a reason why it is scheduled for 9pm, not 8pm. So, if you want to complain about "unacceptable context", save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy made just for them, and it's Father of Pride. <br /> <br /> Everything was not perfect. The characters of Siegfried and Roy intrigued me a little. Do I feel the "stereotype" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are flamboyant. Yes, they speak with German accents. But that's the news of yesterday. Give us something new, fresh, funny. Putting old jokes in a new series is definitely a bad approach. I understand that the creators of this series wanted to use the "power of the stars" that these guys have. It's good for me. But please, do not dwell on something that everyone already knows by heart. Let's hope the rest of the series will not play the same disc again and again. <br /> <br /> In general, the show is unavoidable. Funny, witty, with some unexpected twists here and there - there has been no such good comedy since Seinfeld. I'm looking forward to the next episode.
