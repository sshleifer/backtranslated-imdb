"The mother" is this extraordinary film: it makes you think, it makes no noise - and finally lets you think. Very open about the fate of the main character. Anne Reid (whom I only knew briefly during her appearances on some projects directed by Victoria Wood and who thought she was an excellent actor) is really beautiful here. Not the stereotypical widow homemaker who was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all. And not all that free and adventurous spirit at the beginning. She plays her character just with the right note that sounds right (well, it was done to me). Powerful casting. Super script. Renaissance of European cinema indeed;)
