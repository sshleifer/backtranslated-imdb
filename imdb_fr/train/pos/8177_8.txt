I'm surprised no one thought of making a movie like this before. Horror is often more effective when using a theme of real life annoyance. And nobody (except Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors) likes to go to the dentist. Dental torture has already been practiced (see The Marathan Man, for example), but terror reigns in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who goes down the dementia. Now, our dear doctor was not playing with a complete game to begin with, but driven by jealousy and obsessive-compulsive disorder, he was beginning to wreak havoc on those around him. The growing psychic situation of the doctors is almost identical to that of Micheal Douglas's Falling Down character, but with a hint of horror. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by the pillars of horror Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, his mind and his a great flow. Ken Foree, always welcome, will also be part of the cops. <br /> <br /> I think now that this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance of Corbin Bernsen. After only really seeing him in Law, I was blown away by his acting. <br /> <br /> The Dentist 2 suite is also worth watching, but it is slightly lower than the original. <br /> <TTKK's Bottomline - A fun movie with scenes that will make you cringe, cappÃ© (pun intended) by a superb performance of Bernsen
