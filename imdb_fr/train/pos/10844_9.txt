It reminded me of Spinal Tap, on a more serious level. This is the story of a group doing a meeting tour, but things are not harmonious between them. I was particularly impressed by Bill Nighy's performance as Ray. You felt sorry for him, yet he had some goose bumps. This is a great movie to watch if you've ever seen your favorite band become wrinkled, old and pathetic. Bittersweet, highly recommended ..
