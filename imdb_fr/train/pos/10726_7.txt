To my surprise, I really liked Spacecamp, I remember seeing it about 13 years ago and recently re-engaged. I was very impressed. It is obvious that the special effects of today's space movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those of SpaceCamp. However, this film had a story - a very stereotypical story of the 80's where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it. But that's what I liked: they do not make movies like this anymore, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in the leading roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw adding substance to the light and fluffy scenario. Absolutely loved the robot named Jinx, he was very cute, but unfortunately he had more emotion than some of the main characters. The film was almost an inspiration in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was shot at NASA's Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
