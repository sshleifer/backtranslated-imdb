The 3rd and in my opinion the best of the Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that there is no Lord Percy who was the funniest character of the previous series, but Hugh Laurie's Prince Regent is a good laugh line. <br /> <br /> As a package, its quality is irreproachable with convincing regal decorations, beautiful taunting taunts and small pieces of wacky, actors "macbeth" standing out and a Prince George chicken impression and the missing words in Dr. Johnson's dictionary. <br /> <br /> Few comedies have been as smart as they are funny, all right. The observation or the weird phrase is sometimes ridiculous, but it's mostly a scream.
