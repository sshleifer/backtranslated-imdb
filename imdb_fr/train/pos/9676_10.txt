The film was very sweet and comforting! I cry almost every time I watch the movie. I would recommend this movie for everyone. The movie was so inspiring for me. The actors did a good job and the film was very well played and played. The film was about a little girl who owned a parrot she called Paulie. Paulie had been separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be better for her. <br /> <br /> After meeting so many people, Paulie found himself alone in a cage in a basement. Finally this Russian man who had found a job as a janitor. Had found Paulie in the basement and Paulie started talking to him by telling him the story of his life. In the end, the man helped Paulie meet with Marie (the little girl who raised Paulie). Love has overcome all obstacles.
