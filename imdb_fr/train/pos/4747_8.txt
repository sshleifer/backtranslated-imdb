Anyone who has never seen anything similar to Matrix's fight scenes has never seen this movie. The fight scenes were choreographed by the psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also participated in the fight in The Matrix. And the fight scenes are something. <br /> <br /> Li plays the role of a supersoldier who feels no pain and now leads a life of pacifist librarian (you got me). When other devilish supersoldiers start killing local drug lords to take control of the drug trade, Li teams up with his buddy cop to help stop them. <br /> <br /> badguy gets his arm cut with a glass and barely notices). Fighting scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches; the number of bodies is well up there. Li has rarely been better and he has surrounded himself with a crowd of pretty female costars (Yip kicks ass as supersoldier comrade). Anthony Wong even makes an appearance as a drug lord (no surprises here, he makes an appearance in every HK movie). It's a shame they do not do action movies like this in the United States; I would not have to deal with all those awful dubbing works to see the action I want so much. Recommended.
