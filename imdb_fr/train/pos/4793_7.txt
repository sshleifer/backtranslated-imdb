After seeing this movie, I feel like I know a little more about the United States. David Lynch is synonymous with shocking and weird value for strange reasons, and indeed these elements are not lacking in The Straight Story. However, it is in a light that I have not seen Lynch before. We start with a simple family living a quiet life, but we end up with a range of ridiculously interesting and deep characters in their lives that can not be obvious from their introduction. The bar scene with two World War II veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how it still affected their lives and emotions today was particularly moving. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, do not look here. But if you are looking for real people with real stories, this movie is for you.
