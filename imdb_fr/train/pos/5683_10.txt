Just saying that you have a movie about John Holmes is a guarantee of putting people in front of the screen, but writer / director James Cox gives even more. "Rashamon" from the hilarious Hollywood scene, the film divides the July 1981 Wonderland murder at Wonderland from various angles (and film stocks), but mainly through John Holmes' whipped brain filter. In a movie full of villains, Holmes is either the meanest, the most pathetic, or both. Several versions of the story emerge and merge when Cox flashes cuts and twisted title cards between effects and emotions. The dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never sounds once wrong. As the film unfolds two years after Holmes fell from porn to drug-crazed depravity, Kilmer relentlessly breathes such intense sexuality as to be measured in inches. This sexuality at its edges creates a feeling of apprehension that hovers over the entire film almost as heavily as the violence at its center. These murders are mocked throughout the film but are never clearly shown, not even at its peak, although their violence infuses the entire painting tirelessly and much blood splatters walls and photos of crime scenes. Once again, Val Kilmer as Holmes shows that he can behave better than anyone else at work. Strutting, grinding his teeth, boasting or begging, Kilmer is always in character and the character is always a fascinating car wreck. Ted Levine is the lead investigator and Lisa Kudrow, Holmes' wife. The trio of criminals in which Holmes intermingles includes the scary energy of Josh Lucas, the always interesting Timothy Blake Nelson and a Dylan McDermott absolutely unrecognizable in a central role as a narrator, another version of the murders. Cox suggests that no matter what we learn about Wonderland, there is always a worse version, but it is much more fascinating to look through the debauchery around it than to understand the truth.
