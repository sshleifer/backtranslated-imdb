I have this film on tape for years and I began to watch it this morning (waiting for my laundry - what irony!) Mainly because I wanted to hear the title of Benjamin Frankel again. I found myself sitting for about the first half hour, fascinated by the quality of direction, writing and performance. The film is like one that makes British stars of the 50s: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont and especially Ernest Thesiger, as big as the withered textile mill. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not actors of character as such, but charismatic charismatic heads. It's science fiction in its purest form and a funny comedy. A classic of all time, and I hope nobody will ever try to do it again!
