Care Bears Movie 2: A new generation is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I like it a lot. Yes, I admit that the dialogue is old and that the story is sometimes badly told. But Darkheart, though very very dark, is a pretty convincing villain, and Hadley Kay did a remarkable job in expressing it. Speaking of voices, it was great, nothing to complain about. The animation is colorful and some of the visuals, especially at first, were breathtaking. The songs and the score are charming, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter has always been my favorite of the two. The feathered bears, which I like, are adorable and the human children are well made. And the end is a real ripper. Overall, a harmless pleasure for children. 8/10 Bethany Cox
