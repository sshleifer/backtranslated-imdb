After setting fire to the sitcom world with father Ted, Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan's next creation were a forgotten jewel for the BBC called "Hippies". Although created by the couple, the six scenarios were written by Arthur Matthews alone. Established in London in 1969, Ray Purbs, a hippie, is the editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are his roommate, the very casual who smokes cannabis Alex, his "girlfriend" is the feminist Jill and the non-brilliant Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was superb as Ray, but he is superb in everything he does. This sitcom had an impression of 'Citizen Smith' about it. Ray looked a lot like Wolfie Smith, trying to beat society, but failing miserably. Finally, this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. As was the case in 1999 and has already been repeated on terrestrial television. My memories of the sitcom are not very good to me. Still, I remember very clearly two episodes, the first being the first film titled "Protesting Hippies", which I found very good beginning - where Ray is doing a protest against sandpaper and the other episode was "Hippy Dippy Hippies" Which was, I think, episode 4, a pretty clear reminder of the police. Unfortunately, the sitcom provoked a negative reaction from viewers (I do not see why). The BBC commissioned another series, but Arthur Matthews decided not to do so because of the negative reaction. Oh well, I can not wait for the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies - Episode 4 of Series 1.
