I was so happy to have met this short film. I'm still so disappointed that short films are hard to find, so when I saw that and saw that he was nominated for the Live Action short film at the Academy Awards, I was so happy to have had a movie that I was rooting for. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, the director, writer and star Nacho Vigalondo tried to find a reason why people would have fun as a song and a dance number as in musicals. The result is extremely entertaining and the song is really catchy. <br /> <br /> This is a short film well done, well mounted and the actors all do a great job. And the last picture of the movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
