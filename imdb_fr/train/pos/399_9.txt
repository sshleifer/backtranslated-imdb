This movie is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you should love it. This film is the Asian lord of the rings: an imaginary story inspired by Chinese mythology. (I realize that many critics have called this movie a plot, I think they probably have no knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you like Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, this one should you suit perfectly. This film is still very hard to find in the United States, even though it was purchased for distribution in the United States with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. It's worth the search !!! This DVD is also worthy of owning.
