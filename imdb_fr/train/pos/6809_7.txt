It was a very good movie. I do not know if this is considered a spoiler comment, but I did not want to take any chances. Be that as it may, near the end of the movie, the attorney reads one verse from the scriptures, then quotes another from memory. I do not remember the first passage he reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says it's Genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6. It's a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment. It is unfortunate that prosecutors do not dare to quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court justice in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. Too bad we lost this point of view in America.
