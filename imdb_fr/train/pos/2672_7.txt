"Journey of Hope" tells the story of a poor Turkish family and its hopeful odyssey that ends up sinking into despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this Oscar-winning film is quite well designed, it lacks substance and has many improbabilities. Most of the shooting time of the film is 1.7 hours: get on the bus, get off the boat, get on the boat, get off the boat, get in the van, get out of the van, and so on. time that could have been better spent or left completely. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who are sensitized to the crime of smuggling illegal immigrants. An interesting watch and quite entertaining but overestimated.
