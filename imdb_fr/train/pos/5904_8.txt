I was waiting to see this movie for a long time. His promos gave a fair idea of ​​the content and when I finally saw it, I really thought it was pretty good. Most classic romantic movies end with the marriage of lovers or the beginning of a happy life after marriage, but it takes a significant adjustment for this transition from an old life to a new relationship and life. This is the reason why this film deals with the period during which a newly married couple, Fardeen and Esha, get married through an arranged marriage and start their life with their honeymoon. The acting is really compelling, although I think that Esha was a little quiet and she could have used a few lines for herself. The story was well knit and the dialogues were more or less appropriate. The editing and the direction were also good, Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here. To summarize, I would say it's a good drama and a romance, a real combination of what Bollywood can offer to an outstanding artist.
