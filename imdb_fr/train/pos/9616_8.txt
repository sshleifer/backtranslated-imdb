It is worthwhile to watch twice because of the fast-paced causal changes of several fascinating stories. "Bug" appears as an entirely satisfactory work of art that plays an ever optimistic love of a myriad of examples of frustrating reality. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch) whose primary concern for life - from cockroach to air passengers for which he is partially responsible - frames the film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time creating surreal but tasty meals for her husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable TV technician with unlimited confidence in fortune cookie messages: "You will meet the girl of your dreams." <br /> <br /> Against such optimism, the forces of shifted reality are generated by the actions of the characters: parking tickets, siphon clogged in a Chinese pastry shop, disruption of television, automatic defense of cars, reservation of a canceled dinner leading to the cancellation of a Hawaiian vacation. <br /> <br /> The film is funny: Olive got drunk on a performance of Chippendale, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service representative trying to deal with an angry customer, Cyr (Brian Cox), obsessed by the germs, facing a restaurant inspector, Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) reacting to the treatment of his girlfriend refusing to have children by writing hostile fortunes to Chinese cookies: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and to the guy who sleep while holding a jackhammer because he spent the night looking for the missing cat of his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> A minor story with public cabl The access host (Darryl Theirse) and a local teacher who reads in "The Boy with the Bubble" expresses the main theme: love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "The insect" is about the same level as "trains, planes and cars" but with a reduced budget and a cooler eye.
