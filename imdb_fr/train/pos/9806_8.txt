I agree that the capital should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was a pleasure to see Americans working abroad in London in the financial sector to change. I loved Rolf in that role and I liked all the other roles he was in. I can not believe that the series lasted only 13 episodes. I loved William Armstrong as Hudson's charming flamboyant friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York area, it was always late at night or at off-hours. The show lasts less than an hour. I thought the series should have been longer, but the casting changes in the second season made it a bit less interesting. I did not care about Sylvia but I missed the actress Julia Phillips-Lane the previous season. I felt that this show took risks and often it worked. It showed the Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant nor tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they tried to internationalize the actors rather than make them all British. I liked watching Julia Ormond in a leading role. I felt that this show should have lasted longer. I sometimes felt that the glimpses lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York and that would have been a success in America.
