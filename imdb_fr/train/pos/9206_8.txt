We do not see films about brother-sister relationships in Indian cinema, nor in any other language or medium. This relationship has many aspects that have not been exploited in movies or novels. Typically, a sister is described as a stack that can be used to get ransomed at the climax. This film deals with the subject from a totally different angle. <br /> <br /> It is inspired by George Eliot's novel "The mill on the wire". The brother is very prosaic, everything is fine, the blue-eyed boy who is a good conventional son and a favorite with his mother. The sister is romantic, savage and rebels against the unwritten rules of society. Despite this, the love of brother and sister is the winner. <br /> <br /> This film talks about the love of two brothers and sisters separated in childhood and the awakening of the same feeling when they meet years later. . It is also the quest of the brother subjugated to find his sister who chose to be wild to challenge the world. <br /> <br /> Although the film and the novel are placed about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries, However, the feelings are the same and remain valid.
