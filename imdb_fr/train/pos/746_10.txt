When I reach the "behind" 35 years, I find myself more and more shaking my head in front of the crazy sex, the drug influenced by today's teens. It was great to remember that it was as crazy for me in my day as it is for today's teens. This film tells what is at the base. If you're a fan of the late '70s, you'll love the movie. KISS posters at the concert of an angel, this film rocks! <br /> <br /> Watch the young Laura Dern. Why do not they have more Runaway songs than I'll ever know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with the character of Randy Quaid deflowering a 16 year old girl. During her absence, she and her friends have a party that destroys this guy's house. The cops come and everything, but no mention of the minors' drinking and how these kids got their hands on that stuff. <br /> <br /> The Foxes are part of the lot with Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused and Kids. as one of the movies of all time with anxiety for teenagers. <br /> <br /> I say: buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about everything.
