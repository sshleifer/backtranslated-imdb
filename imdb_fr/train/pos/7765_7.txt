Douglas Sirk directs this exaggerated drama on the unfortunate fortunate. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are childhood friends with different looks on life. Kyle is the son of a female magnate of an oil tycoon; Mitch works for the Hadley Oil Company. The two fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; but it is Kyle who has the means to seduce her and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be the nymphomaniac of the city and carrying a torch for Mitch, who always seems to be the one who cleans the Hadley's damage. Ambitious with pretension; a little exaggerated, but the stars make it a movie to see. I was very impressed by Malone. Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke complete the cast.
