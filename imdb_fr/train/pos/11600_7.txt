William Hurt may no longer be an idol of American morning, but he still has a great taste in B-movie projects. He plays here a specialist in hazardous waste clean-up operations with a tragic past stalking a Perennial loser on the run - played by the very cute old boy Weller - who has been contaminated by a deadly poison. The handsome boy Hardy Kruger Jr - probably prettier than his father - is portrayed as the arrogant leader of Weller in a horrific sequence in a chemical manufacturing plant. Natasha McElhone is a slightly wacky government officer investigating the incident. She provides an inevitable love interest and highly blackheaded for the hero Hurt. Michael Brandon appears to play a hairless guy to take without prisoners whom you eagerly await the return of your life. The company Coca-Cola wins the Product Placement Award for the year 2000 because the non-alcoholic drink is present throughout the production, lovingly toured in a winter postcard hungarian.
