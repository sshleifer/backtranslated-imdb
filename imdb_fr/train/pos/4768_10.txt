I loved it and was so upset that there is not another season !!! I wish they would! it was the best show of my life !!!!!! there is probably no chance that they decide not to cancel the show, that's it! ha ha I wish there was! I would be so excited! I would really do it! I miss it! and was particularly upset not to know what's happening to Jason !! I think they should do another one ... he also thinks it's silly that you have to write ten lines to post a comment .. that makes your comment crawl ... and nobody will read it !! i really want to know what would have happened between jason and nicole ... maybe they could do a spin-off !!
