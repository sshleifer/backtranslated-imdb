To love this film at most, you must be a) strongly in love (without marriage) b) recognize the English humor that consists of admiring life situations gallant and witty and not just gags c) be quite clever enough because the authors have given the opportunity to laugh and cry every minute of this movie, and only if you meet the conditions "b" and "c", you can recognize and enjoy the contribution of the author. d) To fully appreciate the film, you must love women like Kirsted Dunst, who is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) you have to admire creative people, a bit melancholy and remarkable personalities <br /> <br /> If you meet all these requirements, you will likely rank this movie around 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never laughed half (!) as much as watching this masterpiece. And I even managed to cry with laughter at times (I'm always sensitive, whenever good things happen to Kirsten Dunst)
