The Rookie is based on the true story of a 40-year-old teacher in Big Lake, Texas, who joined the majors. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a science teacher and high school baseball coach in a small town. His team loses terribly until the team discovers that his coach has played in minor leagues and can perform a throw of 98 mph. <br /> <br /> After throwing stick training and betting, Jim agrees that if his team wins the regional, he will try for the major leagues. The film tells Jimmy's story of being a boy in his first game in the majors. It's a beautiful story of outsider and a very friendly family film. Dennis Quaid puts the film in the spotlight, offering emotional performance and excellent cast, which includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes a little time to develop and some scenes are a little slow but everything works well at the end. The baseball scenes are fun, well filmed and perfectly portrayed. The film does not really concern baseball but the quest for a man to reach his dream. It's inspiring, emotional and fun. I liked it, I hope you will like it. <br /> <br /> The rookie. Featuring: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars.
