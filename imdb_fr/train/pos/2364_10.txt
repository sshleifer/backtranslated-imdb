I must admit that I have not read the original story of Mr. James although I have read many of his other supernatural tales. I've also seen most of the BBC's previous Christmas ghost stories, and this one, in my opinion, surpasses most of them, is only equal to The Signalman. <br /> <br /> I can not really blame A View From a Hill - the direction and atmosphere are perfect, as is the actor, the lighting and of course the story and writing. I really enjoyed that and I can only hope more from this quality of the same director and the same production team. I understand that the BBC plans to produce more (not necessarily based on the stories of Mr. R James), which is promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
