I saw this film when Mystery Science Theater released it in 1993. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. So bad in fact that, by pure freakiness, this film must get a rating of ten, because you have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wrote this scenario thinking about children should be beaten. I mean, really, the devil against Santa Claus? Visions of hell? A scary reindeer who laughs? Forced child labor with racial stereotypes? It's not Sesame Street, for sure. As Crow exclaims during the screening of the MST3K, "It's a good old nightmare fuel!" <br /> <br /> There are a lot of weird innuendo and broken theology. Merlin (presumably the Arthurian Merlin) hangs out with Santa Claus in his crazy castle in the clouds (that is to say paradise). Santa Claus talks about the child Jesus and sends letters to "Mr. Stork" for children who ask for brothers and sisters. There are symbols around the castle that look like pentagrams or RAF stars. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have been watching it every year since 1993 and we are submitting anyone we can keep for 2 hours to watch with us.
