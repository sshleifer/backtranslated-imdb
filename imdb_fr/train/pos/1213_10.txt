This film contradicts the first regarding the origins of Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. I will not deny that. However, if you look at "Part II" as a separate film, then it's a very good movie. I remember seeing it in the early 80s (and integrating with its targeted audience at the time), and having it much more loved than the first movie (not that I did not like this one too, it's just a little something extra). Of course, it is also darker than the first, but maybe that's why it's so good. And it's dark in a subtle and subtle way (that kids may not understand perfectly, but may still be a bit scared because of the atmosphere it gives off, and the adults watching are surely go faster, as I've already seen this movie now in the mid-twenties) where you basically have a girl making a pact with a bad spirit / demon in exchange for something else. Get the picture? But just looking at it as a child, of course, as I said, it might have been a bit scary, but nothing traumatic. In fact, if anything gave me another fantastic game that I could play when I was that age. I can not tell you how many times I have claimed that Dark Heart wanted to imprison me, help him capture the Bisounours, tried to make me return to his dark side, and other things like that, etc. the film was also good for my imagination. And it also has great emotional depth. I used to watch it at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Hadley Kay was also the perfect choice for Dark Heart's voice (I've always thought about it and I'll always do it). <br /> <br /> It's a shame they have never made any movie music available. Sometimes I just want to hear Growing up without looking at the movie, as good as it is. <br /> <br /> What is love for and the worry of not being able to save it?
