I watched the film while giving me a major operation. Although I know it was only a movie "B", a western space, I liked it. He may have missed the flash of high-priced productions, he nevertheless held my imagination and provided a great escape. Unfortunately, our company has so many resources at our disposal, it is too easy to save small attempts. In the same way that I can enjoy a performance of Shakespeare even in primary school, I can enjoy many levels of achievement for the sake of art. I am a cop and have found an affinity with the LAPD in retirement. Dreams like this haunt me and tell me that I can not, at the moment of the crisis, react to save the life of another (or mine). while it was a romantic ending where Farnsworth eliminated the (predictable) villain, I needed some happy romance where good can triumph. My world is really too cynical.
