As a "rebuttle" on AFI's 100 most popular films, the British Film Institute made a documentary with Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now. I am a big fan of cinema and I am proud to have seen a lot of films. But, I am now in cahoots with my idol. In this fantastic documentary (though long), Scorsese guides the viewer through several stages of American film history. It is divided into several sections, including the West, the Gangster movie and the Black. Full of enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is both an excellent tour guide and a fantastic teacher.
