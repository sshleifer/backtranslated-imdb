Looking at the last 28 years (since my first exposure to the series), all I can say is: once you've had it, it will stay with you forever. I remember my initial reaction: 1) boringly exaggerated, 2) by-product 3) unpleasant characters <br /> <br /> Well, two years later, I was watching some episodes again and I could not find them not so boring. A year later, I was able to watch the entire series from the beginning and I quickly immersed myself in his bittersweet account of human fault and happiness perspectives. Yes, the show has a style that does not suit everyone, and I'm sure the dated production would be difficult to handle now. But, I'm still thinking about the show at least once a month with a vague tearful look at what seemed like a simpler time ... <br /> <br /> By the way, I'm a married man. .. (for all who think it's a show for women)
