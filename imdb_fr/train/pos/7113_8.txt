Originally from the suburbs of Philadelphia and extremely interested in local history, this film offers an excellent vintage vision of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes of downtown, a station that no longer exists, 30th Street Station - which still exists, as well as scenes of the northeastern part of the city. Good deals of old townhouses as they appeared at the time. The film sometimes becomes a bit "talkative", which causes a loss of interest on the part of the viewer ... but the general scenario is solid and very moving. Everyone who enjoyed the film should also try to see the movie "Bright Victory", which also features local footage of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. The army hospital has since become a university campus. None of these films came out on any format and I do not see why. I have them both on VHS from a home recording, as shown by the TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to all history buffs in my area!
