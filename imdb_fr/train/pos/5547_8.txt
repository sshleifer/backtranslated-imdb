Strangler of the Swamp was made by the PRC studio on a budget and is certainly one of their best films I've seen. <br /> <br /> A man hanged for a murder for which he did not commit revenge on the people who accused him. He uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp, he disappears. The granddaughter of the old man takes the ferry herself and falls in love with one of the local men. They decide to get married. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of foggy atmospheres, which makes it very scary too. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) in Strangler. <br /> <br /> The marsh strangler is a must for horror film fans like me. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5
