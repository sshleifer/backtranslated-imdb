Some guys think that the sniper is not good because the action part is not enough. Well, if you consider it as an action movie, this view could be quite true, because the action part of this movie is not really exciting. However, I think it's a psychological drama rather than action. <br /> <br /> The film mainly spoke to us about the inside of two snipers who had different personalities and experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 victories confirmed, seemed to have a cold heart. However, after Beccket has shown his dream of Montana, we can clearly see his sweetness inside. It was the cruel war and the sacrifice of its partners that pushed Beccket to become what is called the cold heart. Millar, on the other hand, was a newcomer, a green hand, and was not even qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did well to show Millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet in his heart" (as Beccket said). What he thought about the actual suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and he could then come back safely and receive the prize. <br /> <br /> These two guys were very different in their personality and I think the film had managed to show the difference and the impact they had between them because of the personality difference. These two snipers competed, suspected each other and finally understood each other through communication and what they had done to help save the other. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good action movie but a good psychological one.
