This Chinese film made me feel a lot of similarities with the members of a culture to which I do not belong and from which I am far away. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps everyone build relationships with each character and the joy of doing simple, routine things. <br /> <br /> All actors are brilliant and Xu Hzu exudes kindness and wisdom, but also vulnerable and naughty. Er Min, the retarded brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes from the most disparate people in this universe. A different China, far from Chinese realism, yet it has a lot of humanity and realism of another nature. <br /> <br /> Download it. You will not be disappointed.
