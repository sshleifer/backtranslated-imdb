I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before watching him, but I had a Shakespeare book with me and I could follow the dialogue through it. My point of view on the film is perhaps partially biased, because I had never read the piece before, but I found myself caught in the arms of this film. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers to ever have lived and Hamlet's story is without a doubt one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But let's move on to the film ... <br /> <br /> I found out that all the actors in the film understood what they were saying and were able to express it well . Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. What I liked was that it worked very well as "FILM" and not as a play you are studying. You do not have to be rich with Shakespeare to understand all that the hamlet of Misery has to go through. I would recommend this film to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> That's my two cents.
