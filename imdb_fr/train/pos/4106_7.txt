It's certainly not an intellectual film with a deep mission, so I really do not think there's too much to not understand if you're not Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. The humor is simple, quite funny and sometimes a bit morbid. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý), so the authors are. But no matter, the genre is really different and these two movies should not be compared that way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to teach you a lesson, she will try to make you laugh and chances are she will succeed. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad film, it's not the ingenious, but I appreciated. . Some scenes are really worth seeing.
