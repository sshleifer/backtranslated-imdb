He was released on dvd several years ago in France. I hope it will be reissued with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz who gets bad reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant to whom a fortune-teller says he will marry the king's daughter. He goes to join the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in a first film for her. I will not spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a great loss of power.
