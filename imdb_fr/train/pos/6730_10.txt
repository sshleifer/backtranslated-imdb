I used to write comments to IMDb, but I do not do it anymore. It turns out that IMDb has become massive and, as a result, subjectivity has ruined scores. What do I mean? That anyone who does not particularly like the cinema and has no expertise in the matter, look a little shit (or the opposite), and in case it would like, delivers a 10, and if it does not not like, he will go for 1. This, of course, can not measure anything correctly. Now for the movie. I sincerely regret that I have never delivered 10s to a few films, because I have to mark it with 12 or 13 years, which is not possible. This documentary has something that I would not expect to see again in my life in another movie. It's just hypnotic, and it's not just a way of saying; it really is. The last 25 minutes are filled with energy, visual joy and wisdom - the words spoken by the main characters - really ... there is no match possible. I do not keep movies, I rarely find it useful, but this is the kind of movie you should buy and keep, and watch from time to time, sometimes 10 or 20 times a year. I have nothing more to say. It is a genuine goal for me.
