Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" strikes all brands. The acting is beautiful, the cinematography in 70 mm is beautiful, the costumes and decorations nominated at the Oscars are breathtaking, and the score of Patrick Doyle (also nominated for the Oscars) is sensitive and moving. Oh yes, Will S.'s scenario is not that bad either. Film critics accused Branagh of receiving the film's fourth Oscar, which "adapted" the script, but his decision to use the entire text was a courageous decision. I can not think of better ways to fly four hours. <br /> <br /> Almost every decision made by Branagh is brilliant: the use of the Blenheim Palace in England for exteriors, the Edwardian dress and the staging of "To be or not to be" in a room of mirrors, to name a few. The cast of Hollywood personalities such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor roles can be embarrassing, but it's silly. The main cast excels: Derek Jacobi captures the confrontational character of Claude; Kate Winslet acutely describes the descent of Ophelia into madness; Julie Christie brings passion to her portrait of Gertrude; Richard Briers is perfect as the connivore Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of Horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is pronounced with passion and conviction; there is not a lost moment in the whole film. The final scenes magnify the magnitude of Shakespeare's tragedy in an impossible way with theatrical adaptations. <br /> <br /> Branagh's "Hamlet" is a bold, ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare's language to equally eloquent images. This is probably the greatest Shakespearean adaptation ever filmed ?? highly praised, but well deserved.
