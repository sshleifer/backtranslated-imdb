An uncensored original copy of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 at the Library of Congress and was shown in some specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to recent reviews I found online, the original contains all the most wicked dialogue and insinuations intact; they were either removed or completely re-released by the studio before the first release, to defeat the censorship of New York State. I also read that a DVD is "expected for 2006" and we can only hope! If we are really lucky, this will include comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the published censored version was initially available on Laserdisc, which I saw. Stanwyck reigns!
