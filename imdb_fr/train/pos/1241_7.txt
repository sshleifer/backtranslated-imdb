This film is very entertaining and any criticism is based on personal preferences - not on the quality of the film. In addition to the common desecration in some scenes of Murphy, the film is an excellent vehicle for his type of humor. It has very good special effects and exciting action scenes. <br /> <br /> As a discoverer of lost children, Murphy's character begins to search for a missing girl, which leads him on the path that others believe he was. "chosen" - - to protect the child from gold. The boy is born enlightened, destined to save the world from the forces of evil, but whose life is in danger, if not with the help of Murphy and his magnificent, mysterious and mystical help / guide / protector. <Br/> <br /> In addition, there are moments of philosophy lessons to engage members of the public interested in thinking. One of these scenes is where the golden child, whom Murphy's character is asked to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces at the choice of the child. The child is tested at his choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy comedy based on the idea that there are both good and evil forces in our world that most people are completely unaware of. By accepting this premise of the plot, we must abandon all contact with a perceived everyday reality, and prepare for the collapse of the earth and walls, and bring to light a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us. It's an excellent film, with a good plot, a good interpretation, and for the most part, a rather decent dialogue combining a serious subject with a healthy balance between the fight between martial arts and Eddie Murphy's humor.
