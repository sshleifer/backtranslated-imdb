GÃ©rard is a writer with a slightly hyperactive imagination. He is also homosexual and Catholic, inclined to Catholic guilt and a sort of clairvoyant, it seems. On a trip to Flushing, he is "seduced" by Christine. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is a bit of business he fears from a distance, he decides to stay. After all, forced heterosexuality has its compensations. Then he realizes that the three previous husbands of Christine have all died of violent death. Did Christine kill them and will he or her boyfriend, Herman, be "the fourth man"? Verhoeven's overheated and over-sized melodrama is a delightful blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious images and an incredible amount of red colors. Most of the time, it looks like a dream and we can never be sure what we see is real or the product of Gerard's imagination. The pleasure is to understand it. In addition, the fact that Christine is an infinitely more sympathetic character, whether Gerard or Herman, a bullish bull, means that we are not inclined to look for one or other of the men who run it. In fact, it is fair to say that Gerard's mail can not arrive soon enough. Super performances also from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and easily Verhoeven's best film to his subversive sci-fi piece "Starship Troopers".
