Victor Nunez imbues this non-sentimental narrative of a young woman's emotional journey with a sense of poetry rarely seen in the cinema. By poetry, I mean the meaning in which the literary and cinematic come into play. The film has something very literary, almost as if a novel had been adapted page by page on the screen. In this sense, the film reaches depths that many can not; but it is also rather slow at other times, reducing the depths it once reached in favor of boredom. Ashley Judd, the star of the movie, has not made a better movie than her debut here. She's perfect for Ruby's role, almost as if she did not have to act. She has a real movie star presence in the film and has not really managed to convey the same appeal in her subsequent films, although she was impressive in Normal Life.
