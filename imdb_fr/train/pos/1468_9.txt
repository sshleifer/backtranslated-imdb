The person who wrote the review "enough sweats and sputum" has no idea what cultures, letters or psycho-criticism are. He rejects Zizek's interpretations because they do not seem "in conformity" with what the director originally planned. So what? The importance of the director's (or author's) intention is not important in critical theory. This is known as the "intentional mistake" of the author and should be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy A text or film MAY be analyzed through a number of theories, many of which disagree with each other and completely ignore The intention of the author. This is the most basic idea of ​​critical theory. <br /> <br /> For this reason, the one who wrote this wall of text has lost a lot of time and effort to insult Zizek. In fact, anyone who studies the theory would immediately discredit the opinion of this type (I also suggest it to you) because it is completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> That being said ... If you're really interested in Freudian, Laconian or Kristevian Speech, this film is a must. He links these theories to popular movies, making them much more palpable and enjoyable than just reading or thinking about them.
