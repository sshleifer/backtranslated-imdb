This film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was delighted, should I say, and surprised how it was done. The casting, the sequence, the effects ... everything! Magnificent! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made it remarkable was that it was told in a fun and healthy way. <br /> <br /> For me, it's the representation of the modern fairy tale. . It's like the peter pan modern ... just amazing <br /> <br /> I would surely buy a copy from the moment it arrives on the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a double MUST a ... !!!! 10 stars for that!
