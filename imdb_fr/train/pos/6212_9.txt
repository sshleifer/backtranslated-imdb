I love this film, which seems less polished than the other films of Fred and Ginger, not to mention the cast slightly problematic Harriet Hillard in the lead role. <br /> <br /> Once again, with these films, the plot has a minor consequence: Astaire plays a rather improbable sailor (which happens to be a brilliant old shoe (of course!)) and Rogers an artist in grass in a shabby music room dime-a-dance. Although their relationship is brilliant and fun to watch, they are bogged down in a main story without implication that Hilliard and Randolph Scott can not seem to find any chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Although it was a last-minute decision, Hilliard was not enlightened enough because she does not have the presence on the screen to give this film which he needs despite his gentleness and kindness. The film may have benefited from the promotion of the character of Lucine Ball in the world of brass with a more important role, since it shone in all the small scenes and would have given a great coupling to that of Helen Broderick to Rogers in this kind of brilliant film (See "Stage Door", made the following year, for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses). That the one-dimensional Scottish Neandertal character ends up falling in love with Hilliard is even harder to believe than Aston in the Navy! <br /> <br /> Let's go now to singing and dancing: nothing is more to say about "Let's face music and dance" if not brilliant and moving, perfectly executed and that I often finished watching this scene with tears in my eyes. However, other songs in the film also deserve some recognition; "I put all my eggs in one basket" is a good example of the comical instincts of Astaire and Rogers. He almost makes fun of their reputation for bursting into a spontaneous and perfectly synchronized dance. The other highlights are "I would rather lead the band" and "Let you go", which show how these two talents could be as brilliantly alone as they are together. I almost forgot to say that this is one of the few (if not the only) times that Astaire plays brilliantly on the piano; It seems that this man's talents were endless! <br /> <br /> All in all, I actually prefer this to "Top Hat" and "Swing Time" (even if it's just right), because it's more earthy and interpreted with so much 'enthusiasm by all participants, it is hard not to like the fun factor.
