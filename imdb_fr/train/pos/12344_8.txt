The Sea Is Watching was made from an original screenplay by Akira Kurosawa. This is a lush and warm movie. Watching it will be a pleasure! <br /> <br /> Kei Kumai as a director is certainly not equal to the old but eternal master (especially the mass scenes of the beginning of the movie have a terrible game), and the scenery is very nice . Another thing that is missing here: Kurosawa has always managed to let the characters be so much more than they actually show and do. <br /> <br /> It was probably his magic on the set; and just maybe this script was not up to date yet. <br /> <br /> Maybe we miss the master's eye. <br /> <br /> It's a lovely and lovable film, but not Kurosawa. To expect that might be very stupid ...
