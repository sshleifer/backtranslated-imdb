Nasty, ugly, naughty, retro-action thriller on a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), The killers of the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott has no desire to apologize for the immorality inherent in the dramatic structure of the film. Scott does not know or care about social progress over the last 30 years. I really do not think we'll see a more violent movie anytime soon, so you'd better go see this one as you can. In spite of its hard work, I think the film is a powerful example of the most sinister, exploitative and efficient cinema ever. Scott has a difficult thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are too effective for me to ignore. Scott's directorial choices are simply amazing and he's getting a great performance from Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls must stay away from it, but I recommended it to viewers looking for a good action-packed movie.
