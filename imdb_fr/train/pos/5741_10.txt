One of my favorite movies that I saw in preview in Seattle. Tom Hulce was amazing, without words that could convey his feelings / thoughts. In fact, I sent donations to Mike Ferrell to help distribute the film. Its good. The system says I need more lines but I do not want to give intrigue stuff. I was in the audience in Seattle with Hulce and the director, a writer I think and Mike Ferrell. They talked for about an hour after. Not really a dry eye in the house. Why Hollywood continues to be stupid, I do not know. (Actually, I know, it's our fault, look what we're looking at) Well, you get what you pay for. Get this and see it with someone special. It's a little gem.
