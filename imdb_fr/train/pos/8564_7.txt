I do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers outside Romania. That says a lot about the value, or perhaps the lack of universality of the film, but also about the difference between the history and even the life of ordinary people in Romania compared to other countries, even in Europe from the east. <br /> <br /> The film is an adaptation of Marin Preda's novel, a controversial novelist who died during the communist regime shortly after the publication of the book. It tells the story of an intellectual, professor of philosophy, whose life is crushed after his imprisonment for false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era. Basically, the first part of the film tells the story of his struggle for survival in prison, the second describes his attempt to regain life after his release. His release is in fact only apparent, the Romania of the 60s asks him different types of compromises and crimes, but his fight for survival is as hard morally as in prison. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully performed by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a mega-star, we can have here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art. Although suffering from a hesitant narrative and sometimes falling into nonessential details or comics of characters, the film remains an important landmark for Romanian cinema, as well as for the process of recovery of moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society .
