The best Modesty Blaise movie I've seen so far. It's like a good driver for a TV show. I even think it's a little "cult", like with a touch of Quentin Tarantino magic, or something. They captured a good part of the Modesty character, but I admit that Willy Garwin is missing a bit. Although I have read many comics and a book by Peter O'donnell, I am not disappointed with this film, quite the contrary. Positive surprised by this story about modesty and his childhood. I did not put my expectations so high, because of the bad film of 1966. So, I may have overestimated a little film. But if you like comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should really see this one! I can not wait for a follow up ...
