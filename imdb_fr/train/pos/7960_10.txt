There have been countless talking animal films in the past, the majority of them featuring digitally animated animal mouths to almost match dubbing, or ridiculously amateurish. "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is neither one nor the other. <br /> <br /> This film does not need the pleasant addition to the baby of moving lips, canines or feline limbs gesturing. He has the ability to make you believe that animals speak authentically to one another and you can be emotionally attached to them (as all great boys 'and dogs' movies should be). <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is for me the embodiment of all pets and has a beautiful cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (of Bruce Broughton's genius) and an impressive cast ... <br /> <br /> Michael J. Fox ... luck <br /> <br /> Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Ameche ... Shadow <br /> <br /> Frank Welker (Voice God) ... Miscellaneous <br /> <br /> This is a modernized version of the classic children's fiction "The Incredible Journey", which has been turned into a semi-documentary film by Disney in 1963. The sequel (Lost in San Fransisco) is not such a successful film, it extends the adventure of my favorite hairy friends and is a fun urban variation of the theme of the great adventure outdoors. Do you want to entertain your children with a spiritual, pretty and comforting mini-epic without the silly and often ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy the three movies for your kids - now! Thank you, Disney, for bringing a tear to my eyes every time I look at this classic of the early 90s!
