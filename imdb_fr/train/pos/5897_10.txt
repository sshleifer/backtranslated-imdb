This film must be put on DVD. It was so funny and I loved it. Really, really cute and funny. Not realistic, but not supposed to be. The only thing I did not like about that was that the girl was relying too much on him. This, however, represents the way of thinking of the period. I have been trying to get this movie for so long and it is not available in American format only in the UK and can not be played on American DVD players. It is unfortunately a classic film too watched! Believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult favorite for all ages. Too bad, we do not legalize some things that could really save small countries or ours. Lindy is unsinkable, a positive character that makes lemonade from lemons. She is funny and charming. She stole the show!
