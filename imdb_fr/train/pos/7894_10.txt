It's a great show that will make you cry. This group of people really loved each other in real life and it shows again and again. Write to me and discuss. I went to Australia and they really talk like that. <br /> <br /> I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and share these beautiful stories of good and bad, and friendship with your children. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R that I have collected in the last 5 years. See my tribute to Five Mile Creek on www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to the extended musical theme. Let's talk about it. <br /> <br /> These people are so cool!
