The location of the shop around the corner is indicated precisely at the beginning of the film, Balta Street in Budapest, but it may be that it is really anywhere. The small number of sets reflects an average European design, but it could be a shop in any corner. The film does not deal with Budapest or retail leather goods, but the ups and downs of love, reflected in most of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are work-training partners, but their anonymous ones. the letters to each other are full of hope, aspiration and romance, and the story unfolds to bring these two aspects to perfection. Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the store, has problems with his wife, she has only one voice on the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur clothes. Mr. Pirovitch's life is centered on his wife and children. Pepi Katona "plays Santa Claus" to a girl at Christmas. You even feel that the calm Flora Katchuck, while staying at home with her mother, dreams of someone. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from one scene to another. It's one of those calm films that is worth revisiting, simple but profound. The dialogue reflects the character who speaks that is not common these days. <br /> <br /> All actors are beautiful. Even minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play perfectly. He was really starting to be an actor and gives a smooth and clean performance. Margaret Sullavan was a formidable actor and underrated nowadays. Some of his other films are worth seeing. As Mr. Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. His moment of truth is very moving. Golden stars everywhere for the performers. <br /> <br /> It's a well used phrase that they do not do it as before (the vague remix "You've Got Mail" was disastrous), but in this case it's true. The director Lubitsch is not at the farce luckily but delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity.
