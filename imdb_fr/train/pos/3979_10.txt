I would just like all the fans of this documentary to know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I am extremely proud of him. This mini-series featured on VH1 is a snapshot of the drug culture over the past 30 years and my uncle worked hard on it. The time and effort I have spent on this documentary and the book that started it all (Impossible to find my way home) make it much better to watch it on TV. I know he likes what he does and he does it well. His eloquence is shown in the interviews he has made himself and in the amazing additions he himself adds to the commentary. From music to videos, to everything else, it's an excellent documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of the person who lived it. I appreciate all the comments about those who liked (or not) and who would like to hear the fans! Three cheers for Uncle Martin !!!
