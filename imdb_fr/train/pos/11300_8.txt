Ossessione <br /> <br /> The first film by Luchino Visconti, this black Italian is generally credited with the launching of the neorealist movement - in fact, it is written on the back of the box - and constitutes a sometimes penetrating, sometimes gloomy portrait of lonely individuals in the moral flow. Located in Fascist Italy, an assortment of secondary characters, including a lost na√Øve who espouses communist virtues, embodies the distant despair of a country in search of its identity from the outside, drifting fantasies that yearn for a soul . Although Visconti's compassion for the poor and his ability to express their deplorable conditions are already well developed, the spider web of deception is tenuous - although a staple of black is that of positioning a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino is here so disturbed at first that you fear he deserves it. The cosmic irony is too didactic, the illicit relation tense with the bathos. Nevertheless, it is incisive and essential, even if its real impact on the history of the film is certainly debatable.
