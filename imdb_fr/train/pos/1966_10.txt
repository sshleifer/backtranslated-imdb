I am not a regular commentator on this site, but considering how much this film is underestimated, I try to write some comments and remarks about it. I had fun watching this movie, maybe because Cat is all I want, I'm not going to post revelations or reveal any conspiracies, but there are some things I've found really great. His way of manipulating people is so divine. it's a very underrated film, I'm lacking arguments here, I usually enjoy it, then I do not talk much about it, when we go to the cinema, it's to have fun, and I really Enjoyed the 1:53 where I stayed in the dark room. a must see and redo until the pleasure disappears. try not to be so critical about it. Thanks for the reading.
