May and her husband will visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is delicate because the grandchildren and the "children" do not really seem to know each other as one would expect. The heat that there should be is missing. After dinner, May's husband says he does not feel well, attributes this to his daughter's kitchen and says with irritation that he wants to go home. He died that night. <br /> <br /> May, now a widow, is lost. Obviously, she had not had a passionate or interesting marriage, but she had a purpose. She had someone who needed her, and even though her own needs had not been met for years, she had something to do with her days. <br /> <br /> She is depressed and unmotivated. She goes to her daughter, Paula, who, shortly after her mother arrives, informs her mother that she never felt that her mother had given herself much. She is furious with anger at her mother's lack of education. May seems unarmed and surprised, but she does not seem to have the energy or the desire to do things right either. "I am your mother and I love you." What does it really say? (I've heard that from my own mother too often and I still do not understand what it means.) Paula is a little (well, more than a little) neurotic. Both women are in need, even if they show it very differently. <br /> <br /> Paula was involved with a friend of her son, Darren, a handyman working in his son's house. While Paula works during the day, May begins having conversations and lunches with Darren. Darren is a married man who stayed with his wife because of their autistic son, Nicky, but who would not live in the house with his wife. <br /> <br /> Mai is attracted to Darren because he is virile and manly. she likes the connection they seem to have. Darren is attracted to May because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not receive from other women in his life. (He is also too interested in the money that May says he can give him to "get away from it all", although he is not clearly interested in his desire to join him in such a journey. to sleep together in the spare room, during the day, May loves to realize herself as a woman she had not known for years and did not expect her to know him again. is doing well. <br /> <br /> In a writing group directed by Paula, May is presented, rather forced to meet with a widower who does not attract him.There is a scene where she has sex with the old man, who can barely play, and it's really painful and disturbing to see the total disgust on May's face as she bears this awful bond. <br /> <br /> Finally, Paula discovers some very graphic sketches made by her mother, claiming that her mother and Darren have been having sex. <br /> <br /> This film will undoubtedly be seen by many people. Sympathies will be divided. At one point, during Paula's writing group, May reveals through a short essay that she felt like she hated her children at the end of the day and that she would leave for the cafes after their sleep, making sure to go home before. her husband. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a good mother does not think of leaving her children alone while she goes to the local pub. May, however, had also revealed earlier in the film that her husband did not like her to have friends, so she did not have any. She did what he wanted her to do. She was unhappy but she endured that because, as she said, "it was easier." Thus, although May is not the best mother, for those who are inclined to feel sympathy for her, one could see in May's actions the act of a woman simply wishing to be sexual and live "a few minutes" in his lifetime. . A woman who just wanted someone to listen to her, to know her as a human being, to have a friend and a lover. <br /> <br /> Paula, although neurotic and unhappy, may have become so because of the distant parents who raised her. Certainly, it is not difficult to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother. <br /> <br /> It's a well done film, with more complexity than I mentioned, and that will certainly leave the viewer many reactions, perhaps contradictory. It is a film that deserves to be discussed, to debate and, above all, to be seen. <br /> <br /> The film gives us a glimpse of the horror and fear of a solitary life. No matter who is judged "right" or who is considered "bad" by each spectator, this theme of old age and loneliness, which arouses a feeling of fear among most of us, is unavoidable.
