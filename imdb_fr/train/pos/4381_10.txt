This dramatic drama has it all: first-rate acting, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both films take place in a historic Scotland. Even though I like Braveheart, I think it's the best of both movies. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the lead role. Tim Roth plays one of the most perverse, most despicable characters in film history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another unpleasant character. I'm always amazed by the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play. This is the story of a money dispute between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that's basically what this story tells; honor of the common man against corruption of the nobility. This movie is very fun, it should please everyone. He has romance, action, beautiful landscapes and a fascinating plot. One of my favourite movies.
