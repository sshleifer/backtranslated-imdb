This film is light, funny and beautifully filmed. The lightning is absolutely superb and the colors are convincingly reminiscent of Vermeer's paintings. <br /> <br /> This is the sentimental comedy at its best, well above the American and French standards, and probably better than the English one. <br /> <br /> Each character is touching and the interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is beautiful, Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series, Stéphane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is awesome in his strange role, and Geneviève Laroche is the best friend ever! <br /> <br /> I was able to continue for hours before finding a negative comment on this movie, so give it a chance and add your own review.
