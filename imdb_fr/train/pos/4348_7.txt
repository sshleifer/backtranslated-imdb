Paul Reiser moves away from the stand-up comedy projector to write a story that is both warm and humorous about the family - what we see and what we do not see, what we expect and what surprises us. What there is to do with my compatriots does not set new standards for the film, but it is a beautiful little story well told that reminds us of the important links that represents the family. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) was a workaholic, sometimes pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) back plan. One day, Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage, she goes away! His daughters, along with Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately begin searching for his place of residence, leaving Sam confused, hurt and unhappy, to arrange things on a road trip with his son Ben . The car trip is a good time for the two men to know who they are and what they each represent for their status as father and son and as a family member. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces Ben, the workaholic, to the pleasures and the pleasure of living. The trip ends with a phone call about where Muriel is, about her departure, and the wiser family grouping, which explains the warm end of the story. Everything is not what it seemed: it's better and much different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser are playing like pros, but in many ways the film is one of the brief moments Olympia Dukakis is on the screen, reminding us that she is one of the strongest matriarchs on the film. Well worth a look. Grady Harp
