Yes, it's flawed - especially if you like Hollywood movies that require a lot of effects, a story or a purely entertaining or fantastic storyline, and you can not really think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films are for the cinephile intelligent, and Insignificance is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> The characters are brilliant, the story is great, but, like all of Nic Roeg's films, you have to think at every level of the aspects of a reality that you never thought before. His films always make you think, and personally, I like it in a film. <br /> <br /> Do not expect to watch this film and feel happy because it is likely that you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's great.
