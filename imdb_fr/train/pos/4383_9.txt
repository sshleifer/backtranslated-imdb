** Attention Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> First, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best movies of the 90s. It was an extraordinary feat for all participants, especially actors Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a beautiful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. But alas ... <br /> <br /> constantly, and unfairly compared to "Braveheart". These are two completely different films, probably only similar in the fact that they both deal with Scots in historic Scotland. However, this comparison often bothers me because we almost seem to believe that "Braveheart" is a better film than "Rob Roy". I really like "Braveheart", but the idea of ​​comparing it to "Rob Roy" insults me a little. In simple terms, I like "Braveheart", but it's a pale shade to what I like "Rob Roy". Here are my special reasons ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" talks about real people. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, William Wallace of "Braveheart" is not a real person. He is a legend, a martyr, a figurehead larger than life. Because of this representation, he is also a perfect person, never doing anything wrong and essentially showing his Scottish compatriots to the Promised Land. When he finally fails, it's not his fault. Like Jesus, he is betrayed by the people he trusted most. He even suffers the worst type of torture because he wants so much freedom. <br /> <br /> Wallace's performance is very well done and effective. But that does not really inspire me and does not intrigue me. I find human ambiguity far more fascinating than human perfection. That's why "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a better film than "King of Kings", and that's also one of the reasons I think "Rob Roy" is better than "Braveheart". Rob Roy may be heroic and courageous, but he is far from perfect. He made several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his relatives. Of course, not pretending to be wrong against the Duke of Argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but also an act of egoism and self-centeredness. Let's not forget that the family members he claimed to be protecting had become homeless at the end of the movie because of this act. But Rob did his best, and that's all you could ask him. <br /> <br /> Rob's wife, Mary, is also a normal and ambitious person. Let's start, however, with his appearance in this film. Of course, she is beautiful, but she does not wear makeup and she lets her natural beauty manifest itself. Compare that with William Wallace's two loves (or one, according to your point of view) in "Braveheart". Now, these two ladies are hot, but are hardly revealing the look that women had at the time (especially laymen). Maybe not a fair comparison, but just another example of how Rob Roy's attempts at precision are much more effective. <br /> <br /> Throughout "Rob Roy", Mary must live with her violent violin rape committed by Casterham, the crazy carrion,. She feels compelled to talk to Rob about her fight, but does not because she knows Rob has to take revenge for her rape. Such revenge would surely mean Rob's death, and Mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The villains of "Rob Roy" are equally convincing. Although the enemies in "Braveheart" are well written, they are hardly original. Robert the Bruce, a man at once brave and cowardly, is prey to moral decisions that are all familiar to the field of fiction. Should he accept his title of King of Scotland or betray Wallace to ensure the safety of his last name? Bruce is the most ambiguous character of "Braveheart", but from Brutus in "Julius Ceasar" to Fredo in "The Godfather Part II", these types of characters are hardly original. Longshanks, although an indisputable villain in itself, is very dimensional. He is the epidemic of evil and his tyrannical manners contrast directly with Wallace's heroism. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" has three bad guys who are wonderful in their magic. First, let's start with the Marquis de Montrose. It's a man so obsessed with his self-image that he is willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it. "Seeing that I'm not mocked" are his favorite words to his "factor". He is a man obsessed with power, upset that a man of great nobility like the Duke of Argyll could be considered more providential than him. He is shamefully obsessed with himself and unsure of himself. He is a diabolical aristocrat, but in a way that makes him unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are the conspirators of "Rob Roy", and are also Roy's direct assailants. Callarn is so sneaky in his coward that he's almost comical. He will do everything in his power to maintain the good will of the Marquis, including stabbing and cheating. Cunningham is a convincing character in that he seems to have been led to do everything in his power to obtain the status and affection of the Marquis. He needs a father, he does not know that the Marquis is his real father. Therefore, when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from Callarn, he grabs it without questioning it. He is very much like the evil of modern man, so egocentric and vain that he does not care about the consequences of his actions on others. <br /> <br /> Many people have criticized Tim Roth's performance in this film as being too practical. Bullshit I say. It is clear that Cunningham is not just mean, but also psychopathic throughout the film. In a world where a man and his son-in-law can walk around, drawing random characters for fun, is Cunningham too much of an incredible character? We live in a society where people seem to have diminished the value of human life. "Rob Roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decline in value have changed. Throughout the history of humanity, the vanity of the human heart does not allow the ability to be compassionate. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that good will prevail, but snakes will still exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman and his values ​​of honesty and courtesy contrast directly with the Marquis. He appreciates the bravery of Rob Roy and Mary and has a direct spite for the Marquis and his postman. He gives the world hope for the people of power. Let's hope that people like the Marquis are an exception and not the rule. <br /> <br /> - The final duel in "Rob Roy" is more exciting than 10 battle scenes in "Braveheart". <br /> <One thing that tires me is that people tell me that "Braveheart" is a better movie because of the battle scenes. First of all, the battle scenes are hardly original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", Hollywood has a long history of historical European battle scenes. "Braveheart" contains some of the best battle scenes ever filmed, but they suffer from a major problem. These battle scenes have no context, with the exception of the fight for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, duels are not original either. In fact, there are probably 10 times more dueling movies than battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty to behold. This is one of the biggest scenes in the history of cinema. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First of all, the fighting style and the look of the two characters in this duel perfectly describe the characters. Cunningham is spotty and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and brave. Cunningham uses a fencing sword while Rob uses a sword. Cunningham fights with quick and difficult moves, while Roy's fighting style is more obvious. <br /> <br /> All the film, from the first deliberately slow half to the exciting second half, is moving towards that moment. It is powerful, and it is clear that Rob must exterminate this threatening evil that rages in all his world. When Rob finally takes over (literally and figuratively), it's one of the greatest moments in the history of cinema. Rob wins because he has more to live on and his honor is more powerful than 10 Cunningham. The use of music is absolutely frightening in this scene. The good that prevails against a real evil is more powerful for me than to see a guy get eviscerated to shout "FREEDOM!". But hey, maybe it's just me. <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I do not know if people of aristocracy or Scottish spoke like people of " Rob Roy ", but I think it's clearly an attempt to seize their speaking habits. "Rob Roy" annoys a lot of people just because they can not understand what the characters are saying. If this is the case, read Shakesphere or turn captioning on. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the greatest movies written in the 90s. Many of the dialogues in this film are nifty, but you may have to watch the movie several times to understand it. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the dialogue in "Braveheart" is hardly interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is a Scotsman played by an Australian? It's a legend, and there was clearly no attempt to capture the speech of the time. This film goes several centuries before "Rob Roy", and yet they speak like people today. That's why many people like it better. Today's audience has become increasingly lazy and does not want to take the time or patience to understand complex things. Therefore, as in many epic films, they expect to see villains speak of a recognizable English accent while heroes speak in a vernacular language not too far from our American language. Of course, it is clear that the Wallace is Nova Scotian, but in addition to resembling Star Trek's Scotty and some "Aye", the Scots of this film fit into the Hollywood tradition that we believe that the Scots should ring. <So, do these descriptions prove that "Rob Roy" is a better movie than "Braveheart"? Barely. But if that proves anything, it shows that it's hard to say that "Braveheart" is a better movie than "Rob Roy". To put it simply, "Rob Roy" is a film whose themes are very relevant in today's world. "Braveheart" is a film about a legend that inspires but is not realistic. You can make a decision as to what you think is the best ... <br /> <br /> Rating - A score - 9
