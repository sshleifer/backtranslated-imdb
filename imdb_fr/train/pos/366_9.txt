This film is so wonderful that it's hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can not decide which one is the best, the book or the movie. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is awesome, and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, she could be funny, happy and miserable. All at the same time. Overall, the film was well directed by Steven Speilberg and should not be left behind. 9/10
