I think the movie was very good, will add it to my "classic collection" after all this time. I think I saw other posters that reminded more difficult people that it was still just a movie. Some of the most esoteric points may defy the "logic", but many of the accepted religious questions "on faith" do not pass the odor test. If you accept the religion to which you subscribe, you can certainly accept a movie. Was it just me or someone else who noticed that the Aja-Yee dagger is the same possessed knife that Lamonte Cranston had so much trouble taking control of "The Shadow". No mention of this in the "trivia" section of either movie here (IMDB), but I would bet a dollar to a donut it's the same prop.
