Johnny Dangerous falls completely into the category of chances or failures with his exaggerated gags and his complete lack of script or story comprehensible. But that's the goal, right? <br /> <br /> The cast is nice; Michael Keaton was an excellent comic artist before taking himself too seriously over the years. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all play with enthusiasm and get at least a lot of laughs from me. But the complete stage thief here is Richard Dimitri (inserting the word "Iceholes" in the film's story) as a gangster who kills better by murdering the English language. <br /> <br /> I associate many childhood memories with this film I watched it often enough so I may be inclined to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerous is at least a totally innocent gangster movie that even broadcasts well-meaning messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like that but it's hard to recommend. <br /> 7 out of 10.
