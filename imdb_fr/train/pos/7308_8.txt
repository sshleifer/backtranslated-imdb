With a simplistic story and an endearing heroine, it's the horror movie that started it all. John Carpenter brings to life a breathtaking nightmare on Halloween night, when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role, defining her career) and her mischievous friends plan a fun and insidious night just to meet an implacable psychopath 'hell. . <br /> <br /> Michael Myers escaped from a near insane Aslyum ... having murdered his sister fifteen years ago, he is now back in Haddonfield, the sleepy town of Illinois where his murder took place place. Once he lays eyes on Laurie after she drops a parcel in the abandoned house where he lived, he begins to stalk her and terrorize her, turning her night of pleasure into terror as he eliminates all those who are on his way to join her. Superb cinematography and lighting make this appalling scary horror movie ... with the long, dark shots, it always feels like being hunted down by the manic serial killer himself. Myers is well hidden until he is completely revealed to the exciting conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although "Halloween" is certainly out of date, it is no less scary. The idea alone is the cause of goose bumps, and this little shock is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made ... it has spawned seven sequels and finally the remake just as scary Rob Zombie, and he set a new standard in horror that still exists today.
