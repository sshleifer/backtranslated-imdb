It's definitely one of the best stand-up shows. ALREADY. Eddie is so far from the wall that I've been watching this damn show for almost five years now, and he's always moving every time. Everything from his great physical comedy to his small remark is a masterpiece. You do not need to look any further than this line "The word grass, you say erb, and we say grass, for there is much to be said." Brilliant.
