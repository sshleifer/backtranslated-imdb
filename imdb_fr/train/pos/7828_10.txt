I show this film to university students in speech and media law because its lessons are timeless: Why denounce injustice is important and can bring the changes sought by the oppressed. Why freedom of the press and freedom of expression are essential to democracy. This is a story not to be missed about how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world thanks to Steven Biko's activism and Donald Woods's journalism. It also gives an important lesson in freedom of expression: "You can put out a candle, but you can not put out a fire, and once the flame begins to catch, the wind will raise it higher." (Excerpt from Peter Gabriel's Biko on Shaking the Tree).
