This film was directed by one of Canada's most absurd comedians, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a second that he did a ROMANTIC comedy, but knowing that he was a big-time movie buff, he was seen in every local festival and at the local film library, I had a positive feeling about of this film. <br /> <br /> Hell, I was right. From the start, the screenplay (written by Pelletier himself) is a bit twisted and hard to follow, but like Pelletier, it's a unique 90-minute puzzle. <br /> <br /> Freely Inspired Allusion and Essentially Transformed to Dangerous Liaisons (from Laclos) "The Magnets" consists of a twisted game of notes on the fridge. Throughout the film, you will have the opportunity to discover who is who and who writes to whom on this fucking fridge ... which gives rise to an interesting love story. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story, a great photo, great quotes from other movies. Should I ask more for a first film?
