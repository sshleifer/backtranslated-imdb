It is a film that should be seen by anyone interested, affected by or suffering from an eating disorder. This is a surprisingly accurate and sensitive representation of teenage bulimia, its causes and symptoms. The girl is portrayed by one of the brightest young actresses in film today, Alison Lohman, who was later spectacular in "Where the Truth Lies". I would recommend that this film be screened in all schools because you will never see better on this subject. Alison Lohman is absolutely remarkable and one is amazed by her ability to convey the anxiety of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If barometers tell us atmospheric pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of precision. Its emotional range is so precise that each scene could be measured under a microscope for its gradations of trauma, on a scale of increasing hysteria and hopelessness reaching an unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother, and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions as fine as Lohman's. Together, they create a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with each other. This film is truly an amazing achievement and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason not to see it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you prefer movies about nature, it's after all the behavior of the animals on the cutting edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy its own body in a frenzy of despair. And if we do not sympathize with people who suffer from despair, we are dead inside.
