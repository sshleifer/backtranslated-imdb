I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown woman created an interesting game: "guess who". The movie however needs more Robin. He appeared in the film early and sporadically throughout the rest. I always thought that the new animated series did little justice to Robin's new clean-cut character, let alone Knightwing. This film only perpetuates this bad tradition. The film spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance, which would not be so bad in a movie if the romance was not so incredible. It's always a good movie if you're a fan of Batman and I recommend watching it.
