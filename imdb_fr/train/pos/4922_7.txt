I wonder what the audience at the time thought at first glance about Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Certainly, he does not look like anyone else at the time, that skull-shaped face, that flattened nose and that elongated body - even now, it remains a troubling presence. And what is more appropriate than its emergence in these slums of New Orleans that seem to be infected like the plague that Blackie loses on the city. I'm just sorry he did not have any more scenes. <br /> <br /> The film itself is very skillfully assembled ?? the dark humor of the morgue, the Widmark-Douglas interaction, the little touristic places, the battles between officials are all woven into an extremely realistic thriller with a threat unlike any other. Even the domestic scenes of Widmark that place a woman (Bel Geddes) under the big top manages not to disturb too much. Director Kazan shows his ability to lead a studio product (Fox), no matter what he thought of the commercial aspect. <br /> <br /> Widmark does a discreet job as a Public Health Officer. But my money is on the one and only Zero Mostel. Has there ever been a sweaty performer who could scream louder or get hustled than the bulky fall guy (eg The Enforcer, 1950). This scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with the fine wife of Mostel (Liswood), is a jewel of unbridled submission, Mostel trying to pacify in the manner of a berserk flipper. Too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist. (I wonder if it's the voluble Kazan who named it.) <br /> <br /> But it's not just professionals who add color. The locals add both character and authenticity, especially the two Asian guys interviewed by the cops. All this scene has an improvised air, as if Kazan had recognized their potential and created a pretty little scene on the spot. This colorful rental room with all the hands of the bridge is also a pure inspiration. And what about those cafes with the buns that make me run to the nearest Denny. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is still a captivating and well-directed thriller with an apocalyptic air that strangely prefigures many of today's mega. -shots.
