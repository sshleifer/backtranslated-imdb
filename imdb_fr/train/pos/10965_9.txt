Little Edie and Big Edie are characters for whom everyone can feel compassion. Even if their house was dirty, this is understandable given their mental illness. On the bulletin board, a poster said: "The little Edie has the adaptability of an eight year old child". It made me think of when in the dramatized version of 2009, Big Edie told Little Edie, "If you're stuck, it's only with yourself!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, deep conviction in their opinions and actions. Maybe if Petite Edie was not so bad with herself the first time things were not going well, losing her hair, her job, and the love of her life, she would have done it. This is one way or another related to what I believe to be his mental illness: his inability to get up when times are tough and see the good days ahead. The world will never know what will happen if she does not listen to her mother's supplication, "Come home, Edie, let me take care of you!" <br /> <br /> Yet these women, who fear for their safety, manage to be brilliant, heartbreaking and adorable, even in their extremely filthy home. These women were amazing and their interactions with each other brought humor and sadness. When Edie had one of her emotional crises, insisting on what could have been or what she wanted to leave her home because she felt like a little girl, the intense desire to take her in her arms and to tell him how good! "<br /> <br /> Excellent documentary !! <br /> <br /> 9/10
