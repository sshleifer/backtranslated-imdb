There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword first. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong. This is exactly the case of Dan Burns (Steve Carell, the Bureau), editorialist of the local newspaper. Dan is an expert in daily life tips, but he realizes things are not as perfect as his. Dan in Real Life brilliantly captures these ironies of everyday life and manages to embrace the comedy, tragedy and beauty of all. On top of that, this movie is damn hilarious. <br /> <br /> The death of his wife forces Dan to raise his three daughters by himself ... each girl in her own life stages: the first worries to try her driving license, the one of the middle well in its phase of teenage anxiety and the youngest who moves away from early childhood. Things go wrong for Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and finds a fascinating woman in a bookstore. <br /> <br /> Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolate) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid uncomfortable situations ... which is precisely what awaits them when they will be thrown into the home of the Burns family. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine, I know he's incomparable with comical timing and a very dynamic actor. Steve Carell is great at capturing all the emotions that come with family life: frustration and sincere compassion. The family as well as the house itself offer the film a warm atmosphere that contrasts with the inner turmoil that is created throughout the film and finally explodes into a climax of suspense. The film only partially addresses some of the predictable results, but at the same time, life is composed of both irony and predictability: which is an irony in itself. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life is definitely worth seeing, for the sole pleasure of looking at all the fun subtleties we often miss in everyday life, and I'll probably enjoy a second, even third. Just "put it on my tab."
