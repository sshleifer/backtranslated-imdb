This film is a perfect illustration of the fate of a victim of ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). The subject is made with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is so convincing as a person with ALS that I had a hard time believing she was just acting. Kenneth Branagh, a superb actor, meets expectations as an original artist who behaves badly and is obliged to provide a company to Helena's character as part of his "community service", an alternative to prison time. Watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from start to finish. The fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performance. We are deeply concerned about both.
