Paul (Jason Lee) is an underperforming newcomer to a type A princess named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her clothes and her daily schedule. At his bachelor party, Paul gets drunk too much and eventually brings a pretty dancer named Becky (Julia Stiles) to his work. "Nothing happened", as they say, but the duo wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly, Karen phones. She is on her way to Paul's apartment. Of course, Paul keeps Becky away from the place, even though his underwear is left behind. But, there is even more fun to come. At a family dinner with Karen's parents, Paul runs into Becky again, learning that she is Karen's cousin. Talk about some explaining to do! But instead, Paul chooses to feign a stomach problem and hides in the bathroom. Will Karen ever know that Becky spent the night at Paul's house? And what will be the consequences? I'm sorry for the critics who make films like this. They should definitely be lighter because this movie is cool and fun. Of course, it does not matter if Lee is a comic and funny man, Stiles is a charming beauty or that Blair is a natural like a pretty fiancee, but anal. The rest of the cast, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, is also very friendly. The film is beautiful, as are the Californian costumes and sets. Better still, the script is imaginative and inspired, which makes the audience laugh. In short, if you want to tickle proverbs funnybones, get this movie tonight. It may not be academic material, but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a good day.
