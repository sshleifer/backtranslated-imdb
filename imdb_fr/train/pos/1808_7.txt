All Dogs Go to Heaven is a unique children's animated film. Gambling, alcohol, death, guns and hell all occupy a prominent place in the plot, and even if children will have very little, adults will scratch their heads to explain why this film has was designed to look like a gangster movie. The film itself is by no means explicit, it's just a strange combination to make a children's movie. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog, who owns half of a casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After getting drunk (a dog ... getting drunk ... in a movie for kids ... that sounds strange.), Charlie is cheated and murdered by Carfax. When he is in heaven, he finds a way back to Earth, but he will no longer be allowed to heaven. He always returns to Earth and finds his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise), and provides a return on investment for Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has a little orphan, Anne Marie, captive captive for her incredible ability to talk to all species of animals, which helps predict the breeds. Charlie and Itchy release her and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about themselves. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few films other than Disney to appeal to children and adults. Kids will enjoy the fun characters and animated animation, while adults will enjoy the beautiful, sweet plot and more developed characters than normal. One thing that keeps it low is that it's a musical. Normally, it's a good thing, but the music here is really horrible. They tend to jump, sounding almost ad libbed, with virtually no instrumental backing. In fact, these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated film, but fortunately the rest of the movie is powerful enough not to collapse because of poor ratings. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie works, but I hate it honestly. It's sad, but happy, but sadder than happy, and gives the impression that the film needs a sequel. Given the seriousness of the sequel, I wish the end does not deserve a sequel and that everything ends in a beautiful and super happy ending. It's one of the few films I care about, but I think so. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a beautiful family film, with strange themes, but nevertheless, a good entertainment. <br /> <br /> My note: *** on ****. 85 minutes G.
