Sometimes weak scripts? Yes! Cheesy special effects sometimes? Yes! Delightfully guilty pleasure most of the time? Yes! Learn more about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yes! I've always loved science fiction when I was a child, but I found so much in Dracula / Frankenstein / Mum / horror that shit. Abbott and Costello needed to give me a new perspective on Universal's classic classic monsters, and Carl Kolchak to convince me of the "dark side" of entertainment. The duke had the cock Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Mixed with all these weak scripts, nerdy special effects, this Baroque group of secondary characters, actors and guests, there was Darren McGavin in the role of Carl Kolchak. Despite the danger, he had an ironic sense of humor, an idealist in his quest for truth and a realistic realism when it came to accepting compulsory incompetence and possible concealment by government officials. Moreover, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was willing to take the risk of doing what needed to be done, even if it meant his disappearance, the end of his journalistic career or a prison sentence. Despite all his flaws, including his lack of taste for clothing, Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and genius who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (which was an old used car at the time) to save the planet for the future. 'humanity. Carl Kolchak was the hero of all the heroes every week for one season thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he's gone and his show is on DVD, I hope he'll have as much fun watching it as I'll have fun playing it again at Kolchak The Night Stalker!
