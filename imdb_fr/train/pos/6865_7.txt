With the current trend of raw humor, this film is the grandfather of all. Even if a little humor is dated, each sketch will shock, repel or make you laugh out loud. The commentary on sex games and, of course, the VD advertising are the most memorable. It does not always work, but it's worth it. I give him a 7.
