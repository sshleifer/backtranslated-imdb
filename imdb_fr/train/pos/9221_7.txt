Once again, I browsed the basket of videos at a reduced price and collected this film for $ 4.88. In 50% of the cases, the films I find in the trash are pure shit (I mean horrible, beyond belief) but half the time they are surprisingly good. This film is much better than I expected. I found it very attractive, even if it was done by an amateur. <br /> <br /> The management is nothing special, but the story intrigues with some good chills. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I was not too disappointed. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good kid. There is no bloody violence, no blasphemy, no nudity, no sex. Usually, these films require these four elements. The PG rating is well deserved - not like "Sixteen Candles" where the word "f" is used twice and there is a brief free nudity scene. <br /> <br /> I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his interest in love could have been developed more. The film tends to be heavy in intrigue, and potentially good secondary intrigues are discarded. Instead of developing a chemistry between them, we end up watching a carefree three-minute montage about their romantic adventure. They end up kissing at the end, but there is so little chemistry that it seems forced. <br /> <br /> "The machine to dream" is not a jewel, but it is good, a clean entertainment. It's quite memorable - especially with a cast of strangers, except for Haim - but it's also much better than you'd expect. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
