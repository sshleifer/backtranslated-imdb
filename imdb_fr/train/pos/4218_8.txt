I have not really seen too much of Columbo's movies ... in fact, I think I've only seen one or two of them, other than this one. I have always liked Columbo, however, without even having seen it so much. Peter Falk is and has always been the ideal choice for the character, because of his appearance, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof is that, although the series began in 1968, the last (and probably not the last) film was shot in 2003. It's been 35 years. And Falk was 40 when he first created. The series consists of 68 movies (unless my account is off), all of which are made for television. Everyone knows the character, although no one has ever seen a movie staging it in the cinema. It's quite a feat, if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have with her is that the murderer and the murder are revealed at the very beginning (although it may be the same for all Columbo films), leaving no mystery but how Columbo solves it, which makes it somewhat dull not much to hope for at the end of the film). The pace is good, there is hardly any scene where you are bored. The acting is very good, especially that of Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have very good exchanges of dialogue in the film. The characters are well written and credible. Dialogue and script are exceptionally good for a TV movie. All in all, the movie is surprisingly good for a TV movie and is well worth watching by all Columbo fans and / or mystery / mystery movies. 8/10
