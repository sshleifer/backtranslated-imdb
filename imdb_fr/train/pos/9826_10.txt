This low-budget erotic thriller contains some good points, but much worse. The plot revolves around a lawyer who tries to free her lover who is accused of murdering his wife. As a soft-core, it involves getting undercover in a strip club and having sex with possible suspects. As conspiracies go for this kind of genre, not too bad. The scenario is correct and the story is logical enough that someone who looks at 2 am does not look too many holes in the plot. But everything else in the movie seems cheap. The main actors are not that bad, but just about everyone who supports it is incredibly bad (a girl seems to be intoxicated and / or high). Cinematography is poorly lit and everything looks gritty and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying. The worst thing about this movie is why you watch it: sex. The reason people watch these things is due to hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in red shoe journal situations. The sex scenes are not hot, they are thin, shot in this porn style where everything is a master stroke of two people. The woman also seems to be a refuge against a porn shoot. I'm not trying to be rude or mean here, but they all have this breast prosthesis and a worn / worn look. Even the title "Deviant Obsession" looks like a hardcore movie. Not that I have nothing against porn - in fact, I love it. But I want to separate my hard core and my hard core. What have become actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who could act and awaken you completely? And what happened to erotic thrillers such as Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill. Of course, none of them were masterpieces, but at least they looked like movies. Moreover, they pushed the boundaries, going beyond the relatively prude Hollywood position on sex, sexual obsessions and perversions. Now they only make hard movies without hard sex.
