From the filmmaker "Last Seduction" and "Kill me again", comes another film in the black style. John Dahl created a niche by making films about adultery and blackmail in the early 90s. Although I did not have much opinion on the latest seduction. But nowadays, Mr. Dahl has used television programs. It's a shame because this man had talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ** This is a pretty awesome film that revolves around a drifting Cage) that enters the city of Wyoming for a job. However, he does not show himself lucky and is mistaken for a Texas hit-man by bar owner, J.T Walsh. He is responsible for killing his wife (Boyle). But Cage decides to separate after taking the initial payment without doing it. On leaving the city, he accidentally hits a man on the road, which he then returns to the local hospital. At this point, Cage meets again by chance Walsh, who also seems to be the sheriff of the locality. After Cage escaped from his clutches, he met the real hit-girl, Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl co-wrote and directed this film. This shows that a project can be decent when a director puts his thoughts on the screen. The direction is good, however, when I watch the movie, I feel really made for the movie. There were too many close-ups. However, this does not prevent the film from being a pleasant experience. The film had a good rhythm and the structure was perfect. Dahl wrote the script with a good duration. <br /> <br /> Cage described the role of vagabond in a realistic way, although for me his performance seemed a bit limited. His facial expressions were on the mark. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and perfectly treated her role as a femme fatale. Her hairstyle was very far away and can push any guy to get on his knees. Hopper played well. But I think he was badly chosen for this role. He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit-man. The role was not written keeping his personality in mind. <br /> <br /> During the viewing, we have already seen previous films such as "The Hot Spot" and "A Perfect Murder". Due to the fact that some subplots are similar. Overall, if you are a fan of black movies, this one is for you. To recommend. 7/10
