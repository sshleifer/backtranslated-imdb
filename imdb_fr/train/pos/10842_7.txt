So I rented "Still Crazy" instead. When I described Hardcore Logo to the videoclub guy, he told me that it was a bit like Still Crazy. So I rented it. Was I disappointed? Well yes, like Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band, but it does not matter. Still Crazy tells the story of Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke in the 70s at the height of its popularity at a major rock festival. Twenty years later, members of the group are all struggling to make a living and are offered the opportunity to perform a concert on the twentieth anniversary of this festival. They accept the offer and decide to reform permanently, thus traveling across Europe. The result is hijinks that are quite amusing and all the characters undergo subtle changes. Looking at this film, you feel more like a spectator of a carefully edited documentary than a participant. And it's not bad at all.
