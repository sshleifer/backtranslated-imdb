I'm talking about animals that speak with care. For every wonderful as Babe, you get such a poor, like the awful remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or, in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a film that does not hold its full potential. When I heard about Paulie, the principle of a skeptical parrot did not really reassure me. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. And he manages to sneak into your heart without you realizing it. <br /> <br /> A Russian concierge, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) finds a job in a research laboratory. One day, he hears singing from the basement. And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in his cage singing his little heart. Misha becomes fascinated by the bird, especially when it turns out that the parrot can not only sing, he can talk. And not a few sentences either. It's a parrot with which you can actually converse. <br /> <br /> The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr) and recognizes a shipwrecked companion in Misha. Asking how this world of the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Misha convinced Paulie to tell her story. It all started when he was a baby and in the care of Marie, a five-year-old girl who stutters. Both of them became birds of a feather (OK, bad pun!). <br /> <br /> When Mary's parents worried about her friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. And they finally did it after Marie almost hurt herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Desperate to find her, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which includes a large number of new owners, traveling great distances and even ending up behind bars. <br /> <br /> Paulie is one of the many talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late '90s. And while Babe did not get the same recognition or box office success, Paulie succeeds on many levels and is an occasional work of striking intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr's stand-up playing style is well suited to Paulie's role. He never plays the role as too much, even if he is a little smart Aleck. Paulie is worldly, but he is also naive. <br /> <br /> Since he has lived a fairly protected life with Mary, when he is taken away, he must fend for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Mary, which he believes. Only so that these promises are broken repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Paulie is certainly a little episodic. It follows the eclectic people with whom Paulie finds himself and how he slowly approaches Mary. He first finds himself in a pawnbroker, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a benevolent woman who teaches him the meaning of good manners. She sympathizes with Paulie's situation and drives a RV across America in search of Mary. <br /> <br /> Paulie is a film sometimes very touching. His scenes with Ivy are among the best. Paulie was perched on his shoulder singing numbers of Tom Jones. The way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some dialogues are quite well written and even stimulating: <br /> <br /> "There are things in life that you postpone, because you think I'm going to do them later, but what Ivy taught me is that you have to live as if you do not have it later. "<br /> <br /> scene where Ivy dies en route, leaving Paulie alone, is very heartbreaking moment. And the sequence in which he has the courage to fly for the first time in the Grand Canyon is majestically sumptuous and is a stage composed with such beauty that he stays with you for hours after the end of the film. <br /> <br /> sad moment, there are a lot of laughs to have. Paulie joins a group of parrots in a Spanish outdoor restaurant. The animatronic effects here are really excellent since four birds make a perfectly choreographed dance number. And Paulie even has a love story. What is annihilated when he falls with a little thief (also played by Mohr). This may be the only complaint I have. As soon as you are comfortable with a situation, the film then moves Paulie to another. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Paulie is taught to steal cash from ATMs is funny, but a little worrying too. I'm amazed that DreamWorks had the opportunity to include such a scene in a children's movie. And the burglary of Paulie's diamonds is an impossible mission. He is caught in the act and sent to the laboratory for animal testing, where he has remained ever since. <br /> <br /> The story finally turns to the circle in the laboratory, where Misha swears to help Paulie. Of course, they find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I stayed numb for several minutes. Paulie may never have the longevity of Babe, but I think it's an equally brilliant film. The same laugh. The same flawless effects. And the same surprising intelligence. <br /> <br /> A little gem.
