This is the cartoon that should have won in place of Country Cousin. Visually well done and much more fun and memorable. You only have to watch for music alone! Although certain elements can indisputably tarnish the sensitivity of some of our days, we must give a little perspective to the cartoon. He's over sixty, and after all, it's just a cartoon. I am handicapped and if I was as hypersensitive as people who look at things like this caricature and get confused, I would have long rolled into a ball in a fetal position and fainted. Sometimes you need to lighten up, put your head back and float! Caricatures of famous characters in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering. Bing Crosby would have hated him when he was used several times. *SIGH*
