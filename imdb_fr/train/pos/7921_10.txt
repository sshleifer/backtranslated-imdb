It's just funny, look at it !!! <br /> <br /> OK, they want 10 lines then there: it's a parody of movies of werewolves of the years 50/70. A lot of satire, some politics. It's like Clouseau's first film (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with less sticks. If you like Naked Guns movies, you'll also like this one (again less awesome in this one). <br /> <br /> In fact, the humor goes from slight sexual innuendo (inevitable in a comedy for teenagers) to a poignant socio-political satire. The transformation of Moon High School from 50 to 70 years is really fun. The sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! OK maybe not great but still hilarious. There are tons of (historical) cracks from the paranoia of the 1950s cold war and the inflation of the late 70s. <br /> <br /> Anyway, look the film if you have the opportunity!
