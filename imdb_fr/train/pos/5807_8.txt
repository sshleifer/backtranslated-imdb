This is, in my opinion, a very good movie, especially for fans of Michael Jackson. It contains a message about drugs, stunning special effects, and an awesome music video. <br /> <br /> The main film is centered on the song and the video clip "Smooth Criminal". Unlike the four-minute video clip, the speed is normal and, in my opinion, much easier to watch. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather strange. Michael Jackson plays a magical "gangster" who, when he sees a shooting star, turns into a machine. Throughout the film, he transforms himself into a racing car, a giant robot and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> The robot scene in particular is a bit long and strange. I found it a bit out of sync with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> A child is kidnapped, Michael tries to save him, he is tortured and beaten and suddenly turns into a giant robot explodes all the bad guys. A little weird? Yes. <br /> <br /> But in addition to the weird robotic scene, it's a very good movie. All Michael Jackson fans will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal video and the movie.
