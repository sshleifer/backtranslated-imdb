One of the best movies out there. Yes, maybe cinematography was not the best, but an excellent concept and intrigue. Ideal for time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something different from the usual movies and very entertaining. One of my favorites and I would recommend it to anyone who loves creative and imaginative films. After the Third World War and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a good performance and were worth it. The sets are not surprising, but simple and worked for the general appearance of the film. This film is very difficult to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Go see that because I like it since it was released. Not a mainstream movie and not like everything you've seen. Look and think like a child. It is a beautiful view and very fun.
