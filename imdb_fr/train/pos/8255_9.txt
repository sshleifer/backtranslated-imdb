Fido is a cute comedy that deserves greater recognition, especially considering the shit that is supposed to entertain us these days. <br /> <br /> As already pointed out, this film is not really a zombie, but rather a sweet satire that uses the undead to point fingers. Although there are necessarily bloody scenes, there is almost no gore and the way this film is presented (style 50 years), I can not imagine that someone is really scared or shocked by Fido and his companions in misfortune. <Br /> <br /> While the distribution is generally good, I had the feeling that Moss and Nelson stood out. Humor is not in your face, but rather mastered; there is a lot of attention to detail and I surprised myself by smiling several times throughout the film. It is certainly not a masterpiece of cinema, but it does not intend to do so. Currie manages to produce a comforting black comedy.
