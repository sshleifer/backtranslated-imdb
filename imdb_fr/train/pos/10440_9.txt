This film is intelligent. In other words, more than most other movies, it transcends the lowest common denominator - stupid people will probably not like it. History is also very much about dialogue. It has some parallels with Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract and just better. <br /> <br /> The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors absolutely play brilliantly. I have rarely seen a film where the script and acting have melted it perfectly. <br /> <br /> The dialogue turns into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little excessive. However, there is almost always the right side, although I find some moments a little awkward and embarrassing. Balancing on this thin line requires incredibly talented players. Sometimes this gives great results, and overall, this movie is just amazing! Only very very rarely, "love" is described in movies in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Whenever this is done, the result is fantastic. I think the amazing and seemingly timeless beauty of the main actress has helped a lot in this regard. She still looks beautiful in this movie, 12 years later. <br /> <br /> It's simply a jewel of a film not to be missed. One of the best movies I saw in the 1990s!
