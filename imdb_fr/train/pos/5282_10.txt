I do not know ... Maybe it's just because it's an awesome tribute to a Muslim religious action (hajj), but I just felt that the movie was so underrated. I just can not believe that the film has only been voted by 223 people to date, since the film was produced in 2004 and has won many awards since. About the movie ... this is one of those sweet and well-played movies.Reda, a French teenager about to pass the Baccalaureate, is invited by her elderly father to drive him to Mecca. Strange as it may seem (if we do not know everything about Islam), the father wants his son to take them from their home in France to Saudi Arabia for a unique religious pilgrimage. The generational gap between father and son is based on fairly simple terms ("you may know how to read and write, but you do not know anything about life, the father of his son, whose name is unknown), but we avoid a kind of literature on the gap between the generations. They are affectionate in their frustrations. The father never speaks French, although Reda understands Arabic but seems to answer only in French. Although they meet many people on the road: "There is the scary old woman they pick up at the Bosnian border on the way to Belgrade, and the talkative Mustafa (Jacky Nercessian), who helps them out at the Turkish border, the reluctant and shy women wearing burqas on the road to Damascus "the emphasis is always on the father and the son who do not agree. There is not much conversation in the film that makes it pleasant to you. The director even shows you the blue mosque and the Hagia Sophia even though the film is not long enough. <br /> <br /> Generally, I do not like movies that I do not like. have enough dialogue and draw their power from the subtleties of the camera, but this one was really great. Despite some details left unanswered (like the invisible French girlfriend of Reda), the film appeals to the senses.
