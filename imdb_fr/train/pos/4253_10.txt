really great movie, one of the best I've seen. Touch and simple - just like life, sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it's just beautiful. not too much of anything, just as it is supposed to be. Really liked the idea of ​​the film, no one is good or bad, all or just people, sometimes make mistakes mainly because of the pressure of society, everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you do not do it. have reasons to get angry - you can do it, but the anger eventually disappears and you have to let the love come back, even if it's difficult, there is real happiness. <br /> <br /> Great actors and actors, the film really plunges you into the feeling of the film. <br /> <br /> nice nice nice. <br /> <br /> I recommend you to see it, especially if you like to see the life of Italians ...
