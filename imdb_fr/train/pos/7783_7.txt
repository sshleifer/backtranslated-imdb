A girl surviving as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> A cheap hustler who wants to get the big score. <br /> <br /> They meet in Thailand. You may think that in the first titles it will be a violent film, but it's also a love story with two people struggling to get the money for a better lifestyle. This film looks like a test sometimes because of its image changes, but still refreshing. This story also concerns Eros and Thanatos. "It's not an original joke but it's well said," said a character and it applies to this one too: we have seen the story, but we see it as well. Thailand appears in warm tones, the photo ranging from a colorful place to a multicolored place. And he captures the city as the cage of these imperfect people. There is also a good use of music to perform the actions.
