Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive suite. Do not expect the output values ​​of a theatrical release, but expect the highest quality direct video output. <br /> <br /> It's set up when Timon & Pumba start watching the original Lion King in a dark theater. and abruptly change tracks and start telling their own story. This is done with frequent comic interruptions. For example, during a particular moment of tension, a remote sales ad appears and Pumba, distressed, realizes he is sitting on the remote control. These little moments spice up the movie, and whether you find them entertaining or not will depend a lot on your sense of humor. If you are particularly concerned about films that deliberately recall the viewer watching a movie, it may not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best thing they can do in the Disney DTV range, and fits almost perfectly with the original material. The new independent material uses the artistic style of the original a lot. The voices are well interpreted, although I could not help but think of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner. <br /> <br /> Most jokes of the film will be well recognized by the viewers. generations, but are presented with more familiarity with the comfortable quirks of old friends than boring repetition. <br /> <br /> The music made me understand how much I appreciated and missed a good musical integrated in a Disney movie. The first part of Dig A Tunnel, which opens with the fingertips, is well choreographed and hilarious. The performances of Timon and Pumba on the opening sequence of the Lion King and their introduction to paradise are also amusing. The only problem was the resumption of the 'Dig A Tunnel' at the end of the film, making his words and his defeatist melody sound exhilarating. <br /> <br /> The scenario is rather well done and the integration of new elements of the plot is almost perfect, although the last element of the hyena pursued has somewhat stretched the credibility of the history. The new story does not seem to handle saccharinic or emotional moments well, and does better when it uses full comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's worth buying. If you like all the bonuses offered with a game of 2 discs, then go for it. For the penny pincher who is always ready to invest in a good movie, wait until he falls at least four dollars and go rent it immediately. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
