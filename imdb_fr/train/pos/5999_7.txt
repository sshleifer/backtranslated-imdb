This is a strange film for me, because after having seen a beautiful film of a new director (FAR OUT Phil Mucci), another writer / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to watch and to see his movie, THE CURE. . Normally, I do not pass movies this way, but damn it, I love short films and can not wait to see another one. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that I liked THE CURE. not happy and Jafri knows. To his credit, he encouraged me to see him again - giving him my honest evaluation. <br /> <br /> The film has a great style and, in the direction given by Jafri, it is exceptional - especially for such an inexperienced film. Maker (this is his first film). The combination of exceptional color, cadence and music choices that suited the film perfectly created a pleasant atmosphere. You are really involved in the film and it is a credit to the film's making. However, the thing I did not like was writing. The basic idea was excellent, but the end was too easy to predict. I would have really liked the end had it been more of a surprise or if there had been an unexpected twist. However, since this film comes from someone who should not be able to make such a professional film based on his experience, it bodes well for his future. Good work.
