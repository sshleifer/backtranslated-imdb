The inevitable William Powell. It's a joy to watch on the screen as it makes its way into worry-free situations. He always seems at the top of his game and pays little attention to anyone's doubt. Murders are projects, barely human beings. I noticed that this is a staple of the polar. Other than an occasional widow in tears, the victims fulfill the function of being the reason for the film. Nothing more. There are enough meanders to keep things interesting along the way and Powell is a master in this area. There are many political disadvantages, especially with regard to Asian artists. It's a bit difficult to take. The distribution is excellent and the management of Curtiz is also a constant asset.
