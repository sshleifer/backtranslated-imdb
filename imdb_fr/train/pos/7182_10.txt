I thought that for a first episode of a first series, it was really good. It was really fun and I thought the actors were great. I think anyone who says it's a crime is a crime because the timing was right. I find it really boring when people say it was not historically correct, because it's supposed to be a Saturday night entertainment show and not a boring historical documentary, so I think the costumes and sets were perfect . A brilliant start and I will love what will happen! I talked to a lot of people at my school and they like the show! we all think it's great entertainment and that there are many stories to accompany it.
