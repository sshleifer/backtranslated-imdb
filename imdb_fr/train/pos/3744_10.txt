This is perhaps the best short crime drama I have ever seen. The acting is superb, especially Amanda Burton, whose character goes from scary to sweet, disturbing to sad, then to others ... She does an incredible job balancing the feelings of Rachels / Carlas and putting the pain of someone who has lost a child is so believable that it looks more like a real story than a drama. The other actors are of course equally brilliant, as they are usually in British television / film. The end, which I will not give, is fantastic mainly because you do not really have one ... (you'll get what I mean after seeing it) It's worth buying and seeing more and again and again and if you are not touched by that, you are a cold-hearted person.
