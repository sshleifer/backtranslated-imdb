It's a road movie, with a killer on board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), urban and sophisticated writer, wants to conduct field research on US serial killers. But neither he nor his girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), have the money for a tour of murder sites across the country. They promote a sharing of travel expenses. They find themselves with a young couple, Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend, Adele (Juliette Lewis), two best examples of "poor white garbage" that you will never find in the entire cinema. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Early and Adele are what make this film so entertaining: they babble, moan, confide, meditate, speculate, drool and behave in a way I've never seen before since the reruns of "The Beverly Hillbillies". Early thinks in California: "People think faster, because of the heat, the cold makes people stupid". That's enough to convince Adele: "I guess that explains why there are so many stupid people here." To which Early answers proudly: "It is the case". Early continues to inform Adele of California: "You never have to buy fruit, it's because everything is on the trees ... and they have no speed limit, and I hear that your rent for the first month is free, according to the law in force ". <br /> <br /> But poor Early has some mental problems that are becoming more and more obvious to Brian and Carrie as the four travelers head west to the United States as they enter the desert Southwest with its beautiful landscape. "Kalifornia" begins to look more and more like "The Hitcher" (1986), and Early begins to act more and more to John Ryder, the maniacal hitchhiker of everyone, whose terror seemed so unstoppable. <br /> <br /> In "Kalifornia", the acting is uneven. Duchovny's performance is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, despite his excessive efforts at times. Michelle Forbes is a great avant-garde photographic artist. But my choice for the best performance goes to Juliette Lewis. With her nasal voice and her powerful Southern accent, she is breathtaking in her naive Adele, very lively and lively. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film takes on an atmosphere of Twilight Zone, as our travelers enter a Nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test dummies. The plot dissolves a little in disorder in a useless and absurd violence, a somewhat disappointing end. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Kalifornia" is an entertaining film, thanks to an intelligent concept, beautiful landscapes, especially in the second half, good cinematography, good dialogue and this magnificent performance of Juliette Lewis .
