I'm rarely out of a movie with such a feeling of warmth and happiness. I felt like I had been with very good friends and had a wonderful time! I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was superb, although I must mention that Bill Nye in particular gives an absolutely irreproachable performance. Bill is an excellent actor and would like to see him in more movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and still love to see them because they give such a performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, totally beautiful. It was a magnificent overall performance of all concerned. Such a refreshing experience to see a well written, beautifully played and beautiful movie.
