A wonderful surprise of Spanish cinema. I never thought that Jordi Molla could be such a good director, after all, I do not care about his choice in movies. However, this movie was absolutely fantastic and absolutely unpredictable ... something that I enjoy ALWAYS! He did not have a good press and I really do not think he will be published on the American market. We'll have to be content with the DVD or the VHS if that's even ... I do not want to say a lot about the story because I do not want to spoil it for you, but the film basically talks about a homeless drunkard who becomes the new messiah just to kick and earn money (like many others), before he realizes it, he plunges into a life he did not count on.
