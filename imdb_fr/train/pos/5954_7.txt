I feel there a mixture of confusion and various personal tastes in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes covered here. Even martial arts stereotypes. Everything is fine, and of course, not quite perfectly. However, I feel that one crucial point about this film is neglected: the cultural significance of its location. The film takes place in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid saying it. It's a bold move in today's movie world, and a rare treat for indy movie fans. And indeed, it may not be the last. Pensacola is known around the world as a naval city, aviation town, lumber town and sometimes even a hotbed of political controversy. It is rarely considered a growing film city. But all this is changing now. More and more film companies are coming to shoot. And more and more Pensacolans are discovering the power of cinema. This film is part of a growing trend of independent films based on Pensacola, and other films are in preparation. Pensacola is making a splash in the global film community and, increasingly, the world is becoming increasingly aware of it. Look and listen, World. The Pensacolans arrive. Like a virus.
