Trelkovsky settles immediately when the previous tenant dies. has found such a beautiful apartment.His happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes more and more suspicious of his neighbors, who seem to try to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat the suicide of the Previous tenant.This film is great.Polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of fear and paranoia.Several brilliant moments such as the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers the tooth of the previous tenant in a hole in the wall, or the dream of fever where he walks in the building The photography of Sven Nykvist is really beautiful. "The tenant" is a neglected gem. It can be difficult to locate, but it is worth it.
