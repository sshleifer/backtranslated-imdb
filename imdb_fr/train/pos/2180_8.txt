Louise Brooks gives a wonderful performance in this well-done French melodrama. She embodies a typist named Lucienne who, despite the fact that she is in love with a man named Andr√©, dreams of rising above his position in life. She sees an opportunity in a beauty pageant for Miss Europe, but Andre is furious when he finds out that she has entered, then demands that she withdraws. She tries to resume her registration and discovers that she has already been chosen as Miss France and that she now goes to the main competition. <br /> <br /> It's a story of love, loss and decision that explains passionate end. The film is very energetically filmed by director Augusto Genina and film tographers Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. The style of filming is more like modern films than Hollywood movies of the 30s and shows the different styles used by Europeans. There are many fast cuts and shoots, mostly done with great talent and verve. The high energy of the first third of the film decreases slightly in the middle but resumes in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The performances were very good from all the directors, but Louise Brooks' performance is particularly memorable. . Louise relies heavily on her silent screen skills even though it's a walkie-talkie, but because her dumb style had a surprisingly contemporary and unobtrusive feel, she's making the transition to the talkie very well. The long scene that preceded the fair was particularly moving. Louise used her remarkably expressive eyes to express her growing sense of misery and alienation, to become trapped in a life she no longer wants. I doubt that it has ever been better done. <br /> <br /> The film is built on a superb finale, cleverly shot, powerful and elegant. It's really one of the best things from the beginning of the movie. And the tragic scenario only underscores the most tragic tragedy: it is the last major role of Louise Brooks. She was not just a great beauty who looked fantastic in a swimsuit, she was really a major acting talent who threw everything. We are all the poorest for that. <br /> <br /> This film is less known than its German films with G.W. Pabst, but I think it's a better one. I think this crew is simply better in storytelling than Pabst, and although Prix de Beaute is perhaps lacking in the deep moral complexity of Pabst's films, it is much easier to follow and is overall a simpler and better job. target. And it does not hurt that the roles of Louise are interpreted by Edith Piaf. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a classic film by Louise Brooks that is definitely worth the search.
