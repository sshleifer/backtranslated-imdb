I just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out. Toby Malone's performance really stood out, I was really concerned about what happens to Matt throughout the film, which in itself is very fun, very rhythmic with a good mix of well-rounded characters, a exploit given its short duration time. There are also a lot of twists, it will keep you guessing until the end. The other characters to watch are Tiny, completely crazy, and Jesse, an attractive and devious. It may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster, but do not be discouraged, you could do a lot worse than check it, you will not regret it. Good fun. 7/10
