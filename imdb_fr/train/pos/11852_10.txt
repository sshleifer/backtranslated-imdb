Spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse and Native Americans. The film focuses on the friendships and dangers that a wild horse, the spirit, encounters during his life. <br /> <br /> The presentation is very successful. It uses the technology available today to produce breathtaking depth images. and realism. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams and music by Hans Zimmer, who is also responsible for the hugely popular music of Disney's blockbuster The Lion King of 1994. <br /> < The story is not very deep, but the fact that it is not as detailed as some movies does not detract in my opinion in his image. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie that I loved, and that suits the whole family. Not one to miss. (10/10)
