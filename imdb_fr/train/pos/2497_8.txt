Indeed: drug use, warehouse fire, Matrix bullets, a futuristic city with a mix of Asian races and a solitary vampire - all in the same movie - seems like a story that could be imagined by a Japanese pop / rock star. And that's exactly what "Moon Child" is, and more. While all these elements combined may seem like the ideal subject for a campy B movie of the week, "Moon Child" is getting away with some bumps and snags expected along the way. <br /> <br /> The film has an impression of grain, resolutely independent, jumping from one scene to another, not smoothly, but rather sporadic, giving insights into the lives of the characters and erasing barely a real plot. But the film presents no excuse, but turns the story into a story of friendship, love, trust and treason, covered in sugar in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society, gangsters at war and vampires . <br /> <br /> HYDE The vampire sage 'Kei' is excellent, giving depth to the character and balancing Gackt's over-zealous play as 'Sho', an orphan who befriends Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as the vengeful "Son" who befriends an adult Sho. The story revolves around these characters, their friends and their families during different periods of their lives, and explains how a simple friendship can easily turn into grief and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Even if the action is sometimes too unrealistic and special effects appear just to show, one thing the film never does is presume to be on the hugely popular Asian singers it presents. Superstars as actors have their faults, as do their characters. The film rarely gets boring and ends where it should after jumping a bit. 'Moon Child' is rather nice, sometimes funny and even very touching: it's really worth it!
