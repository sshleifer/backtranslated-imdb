This afternoon, we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is Wow. <br /> <br /> It's rare that I'm completely caught off guard, but it's probably the greatest fantasy film I've ever seen, maybe even the best movie of all genres, and everything is the fault of Neil Gaiman. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could have been sucked by the wonderful dialogue that was intelligent, that ran smoothly and that the characters quite credible. <br /> <br /> I could go on for days on the drama game, Charlie Cox is perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines is brilliant in Yvaine and Robert Di Nero almost steals the movie as Deep in it. The Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The sheer joy of humor that has managed to be funny laugh, smart enough that the first Shrek looks like a sitcom of the 80s and fits perfectly with the rest of the film to he alone would have made an excellent film. <br /> <br /> The special effects were almost perfect, It was not LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they were used, it was exactly what was needed, not too much to distract you from the film itself and blend perfectly into the story. <br /> <br /> Then, there is history? What can I say? How often do you come up with a story containing all the classic components of the fairytale formula that does not look like another cheap imitation of Princess Bride. It manages to be familiar and comfortable and at once completely new and refreshing. <br /> <br /> Any of these elements would have made this movie a good movie, all combined make it a great movie, but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that these elements combine to give life. Once again, Neil Gaiman did it, he pushed another dagger into my heart creating a world of fantasy so beautiful and enchanting that I would do almost anything to live there and gave me only a brief overview of this world. I did not want it to end, I wanted to be sucked by a vortex in the country of Stormhold and meet Tristan and Yvaine in person, browse its fields and valleys, stroll on its markets and meet its residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever. It's a feeling I've noticed every time I read something from Gaiman, The Sandman, American Gods, Coraline, everything left me with a deep sense of sadness when I finished reading them because was over, I could not see anything more worlds he had created that seemed to be so much more alive and alive than the one in which I have to live and that look at Stardust was no different. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure that the writings of Neil and this The film will not have the same effect on everyone, but believe me, I will tell you that you will not regret the time nor the money spent to watch it, it's easily one of the top 5 movies I've seen and I can guarantee that anyone with a soul will at least love it.
