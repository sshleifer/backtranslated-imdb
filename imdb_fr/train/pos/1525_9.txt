Having recently seen the version of Peter O'Toole, I was ready to be impressed by the intelligent writing of this version. Little time is spent fighting, which I prefer. Instead, we see all the many underlying motivations of French and English politicians (who held Normandy) and priests who put her to death. Even the worst hypocrite of all, the Archbishop, lets us think, "Of course, she was innocent. The innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the powerful. She had no idea what she was saying, no idea. Blinger, she had no idea of ​​the church's position on it. "<br /> <br /> Preminger was true to the myths surrounding his death, and I enjoyed the preview on the tape that showed the flames reaching and burning, why they used gas jets in the movie and 2 of them were plugged in. Suddenly, the air pressure blew up the stop and the flames jumped on her.Lucky for her, they did not have to repeat the shot because it was so realistic: she was a traumatic introduction to a young Iowa girl in her new acting career. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud was a remarkable English politician who orchestrates the show. that once you condemn someone to death, you do not want to be there to watch him die, you may be able to retreat before your "duty" next time ... not that such delicacies interfere with the soul of our future president, we Christians, even the more anti-Semitic, have no problem using the Old Testament for capital punishment, even if it was annulled by the words of Jesus. Organize public executions like this little girl's. A smell of burning flesh could bring us respectable people to the senses of our soul. <br /> <br /> The only small choice I have about this film is that it is not shown to us why the priest who so insisted on burning it becomes so suddenly so upset, to madness. There should have been more expansion of his character, more dialogue - because the sudden "come back to himself" does not make sense. <br /> <br /> And whether Graham Green does it deliberately or not, St. Joan is a little beginner so sure of herself. You are almost, but not quite, happy to have met her. And when she refused life in jail, I thought, for some reason, of Anne Sexton, the poetess who accused Sylvia Plath of "stealing her death" when she committed suicide ... knowing that such action guaranteed immortality. <br /> <br /> If there ever was a good example of obsessive thinking and logical compartments, this is the case. St. Joan should have become a Buddhist and silenced the "voices in her mind".
