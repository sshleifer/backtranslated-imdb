"The Man In The Moon" is a very good movie. It is very touching sometimes and very well done in all respects. I would not say that the film was terribly original, but what about nowadays? <br /> <br /> The members of the cast have all done a great job with their respective roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age and doing a really good job. Jason London is also doing a good job. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I really liked the character of Sam (Matthew Trant). Sometimes he seemed like the kind of father you dread, but in the end, you really love his character. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> If you like filming movies about growth and life, then you should watch this movie. I would suggest reading the synopsis of the plot and if it sounds like something that would interest you, then go for it. Anyway, hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for your reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
