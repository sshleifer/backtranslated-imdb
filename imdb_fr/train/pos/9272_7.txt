It was the first Panahi film I saw, I saw it at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was totally absorbed by the different characters he creates and by the way they react and behave differently to Australian children and yet, at other levels, in the same way. I think if more people could see movies like this, they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by fear of the unknown. There are obvious political differences between the Oz culture and the Iranian culture, but I found the more subtle differences between the characters that this film has so successful on the screen, extremely fascinating. There are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem so unique to me. I thought it made the characters fascinating to watch.
