It was a really cool movie. It just proves that you do not need silly things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. It crosses the continents in a few seconds, people are shot at and nothing happens, swords burned, samuaries fighting to cause galleons to flow, David Essex is the very incarnation of Slimey Villainy and John Rhys Davies is that fooling. I liked this movie but I like movies, it's the perfect example of a very s ** movie that only KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth, you'll love this movie, its hanging, its speed, its idiot, its samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> as if it had been manufactured in 1972
