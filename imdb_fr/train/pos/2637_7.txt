It's a direct video, so it should be self-evident that it will not compete with the first Lion King, but that being said, it was downright good. <br /> <br /> My children loved it, but it's a given, they like everything that is a cartoon. The big shock was that * I * liked that too, it was funny, some parts (even jokes about cats *), there were a lot of rather creative links with the first movie, and even some jokes that 'you had to be older to understand (but not risky as in Shrek [' do you think he's offsetting anything? ']). <br /> <br /> A special note on the jokes about the worst, I was surprised to find that no jokes were just toilet noises (in fact, there was almost no noises / pictures, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup / punchline / etc, and were almost tasteful. I would like my children to think that there is more humor than going to the bathroom and that the film is suitable for this purpose. <br /> <br /> Hmm what else? The music was average, not as creative as in the first or second film, but very entertaining for the kids. No painfully silly moment, which was a blessing for me. A bit of action but nothing scary (the secret of NIMH has given my children nightmares, I'm not sure that a note G is appropriate for that one ...) <br /> <br /> > In summary, I would say it's a great movie for kids of all ages, 100% sure to let them watch (I try not to be too sensitive but I had to jump and turn off the TV for some less suitable movies than expected for children) - but you can leave the room safely during this time. Anyway, I would say that you stay in the area, you may find that you like it too :)
