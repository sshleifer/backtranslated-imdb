This film is cold, naked truth. Often, we think "oh no, it will not happen to me." But it can. Drug trafficking is very expensive and often people are unknowingly (or deceived) doing things for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who, like them, only want an exotic vacation - which has turned into a nightmare. People need to know that this type of event is neither improbable nor exaggerated - it is a major problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to an informed audience because of the understanding it needs to truly appreciate this experience. movie. It's very emotional and raw. It's worth watching and definitely stays in your memory.
