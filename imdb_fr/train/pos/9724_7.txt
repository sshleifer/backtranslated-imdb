I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I guess she's the kind of actress who better not play in front of the camera, but to be herself. She did it and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this movie, however, she has tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, to look more like a sober editor. In the other half, she totally moved back into her daily life, and I just could not tell her to be an editor. Therefore, his performance is not sustainable in this film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film attracts and inspires. the character of Young is complete and reasonable. Anyway, the film tells a long and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only big flaw is that it was not marked by a turning point in the hero's love story. I'm totally confused when they kiss each other at the end of the story, because it's unclear to both people.
