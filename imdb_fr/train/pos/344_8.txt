Another entry in the category "holiday horror" that fills the shelves of your local video store. The "spoiler" plot "a wounded nerdy teenager taking revenge on the" cool "kids who hurt him" will obviously be familiar to those who have already watched it. And those who have seen it will probably look at it again; those who wait for Ingmar Bergman and become indignant after their lost time should simply avoid it. Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl for the pleasure of the eyes - go with the flow and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the scary mask.
