This film contains personalities who play so deliciously their roles, I love the finale, when no one knows what they will do with their lives, but it's really great to see and realize that the priest is right that it's for two, so what are the other people doing there? The film embraces you in a new life, in experiences, to be able to dream with another person and to reach those dreams. Also shows you life itself, lasts like that. But gives you the opportunity to choose what you want and what you really need. I hope this comment works for you. The film worked well for me. I bought the movie by the way;) Take care of yourself.
