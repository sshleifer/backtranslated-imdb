I thought Hugh O'Conor was amazing as a young Christy Brown and really deserved greater recognition for his role. I could not believe how much he had played that role. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also brilliant. My favorite scene is where boys play football and Christy uses his head to stop the goals and then inflict the penalty! Amazing performances of both Christys (and others as well).
