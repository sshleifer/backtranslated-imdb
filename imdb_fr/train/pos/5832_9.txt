Since I saw this film in my childhood, more than 30 years ago, I never tire of watching it. From the first scenes in the horn factory, to the engine of the car that went from the back seat of the car, to Ollie who was answering the phone and was accidentally pushed by the window by Stan, I think it was okay. -be their best movie of the end of the day. After that, they moved on to 20th Century Fox and, although these films were not terrific, they lacked the comic timing of this movie. Jimmy Finnlayson, their long-time paper, in his last appearance with the boys, posing as the doctor is great! quote: "I said goat milk" his answer to Stan asking him how to milk a ghost! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin introduce themselves! I would say in any case one of my favorite comedies of L & H.
