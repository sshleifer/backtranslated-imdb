I thought this movie did a good job. It was not as creative or original as the first, but waiting for it. It was very fun. the more I think about it, the more I like it, and when it comes out on DVD, I will pay very proudly for that, every penny. Sharon Stone is great, she still has it, even though her movie is horrible (Catwoman), but this movie is not, it's one of those movies that will be underrated for all her life, and it will become probably a classic in 20 years Do not wait until it's a classic, look at it now and enjoy it. Do not expect a masterpiece, or something that captures and touches the soul, just get out of your life and get involved in theirs. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is entertaining and I recommend it to people who have not seen it, because what critics and box office say does not always count, see it for yourself, you never know, you could just enjoy it. I take my hat off this film <br /> <br /> 8/10
