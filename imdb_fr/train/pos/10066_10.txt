King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a film of shocking and deeply moving beauty. Winner of 16 awards from around the world, this film based on a true story focuses on Wang Bianlian, a street artist of the 1930s in China, who is aging but has no heirs to convey his revolutionary operatic art. He has a unique talent for quickly changing from mask to performance and no one knows how he does it. He is anxious to have a grandson because his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. Then we go down the street and find that people sell their children because they can not afford to take care of them: some even beg to take their girls for free, because the girls are not worth much in this society. Wang Bianlian's story continues from there. <br /> <br /> The movie was incredibly good, the acting was amazing, and the problems were so heavy and so well treated. There is the inequality of the sexes and the depressing fact that nobody wants a little girl at that time. It is also interesting to note that the famous opera actor who still plays the role of a woman and who is known as the living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman. Although he is famous and respected, he considers himself a low man. women. As we move through the film, we have to deal with the problems of human trafficking and its demand, and hence with the lack of a possible solution, the brutality and the corruption of the army and police, as well as despair and lack of power that any individual face because of unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, still has a great performance.
