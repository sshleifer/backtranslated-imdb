I saw it recently on a cable channel. The movie is great. it's one of the few musicals I've seen that does not fear light and darkness. It portrays some of the splendor of age with a lot of misery. Some sequences of staged dances are so numerous that I did not know where to look next. One day, I'll see it on the big screen, just to see what happens. But what really elevates this to another level is Oliver Reed's performance as Bill Sykes. Not only is the man really mean and threatening, but there is something else, inner demons. He gave me the impression that if you pushed him in a corner, he was capable of everything. It was almost as if Sykes's character was on the verge of madness, just waiting for the trigger. I saw Robert Newton's Bill Sykes in the 1948 film and I thought he was "just" a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's show intimidated me in my own living room.
