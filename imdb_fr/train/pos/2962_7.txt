Parker and Stone transpose their pacy-expletive humor, from their animated masterpiece to a live action feature film with generally good results. Much of the movie is thrilled with Trey and Matt with their new toy box. The plot is simplicity itself: two average guys invent a new sport, a mixture of basketball alley and score in baseball that becomes a national craze. Along the way, they meet and send many snapshots of sports movies, as well as any other element of popular culture that joins them. It sounds like an episode of South Park, with the usual machine-gun dialogue, toilet humor, and homilies from the heart. <br /> <br /> If this film has a weak point, it is the association with the team that gave us "Airplane" and the series "Naked Gun". This influence is clearly visible with the heavy use of lame visual gags and the presence of a bright and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role generally attributed to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn plays a little better in the business game b ** later that has been part of his party since "Bullitt" and Ernest Borgnine exaggerates as if nothing had happened, but we must admit that it is perfect for the role of the whimsical team owner. <BR/> <br /> For those who have not noticed yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable than aspiring rock stars than comics. This is evident in the importance attached to the soundtrack in just about everything it creates. As usual, they offer a good choice, including the mandatory track, with their own ultra-non-PCA DVDA. A special mention must be given to Dian Bachar, who deserves a reward for having difficulty playing Stan and Parker against the pair of raging cartmans. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a funny comedy whose potential is limited by too much confidence in "Naked Gun / Airplane". formula. Parker and Stone could do something really brilliant (or absolutely awful) if they were given full control of a future movie. America, shut up these guys or put them in charge.
