1939 is universally recognized as the greatest year in Hollywood history, with more classic films released than ever, and John Ford directed three of the best, "Stagecoach," "Drums Along the Mohawk," and this beautiful tribute to a young lawyer in the backwoods to save the Union, "Young Mr. Lincoln". <br /> <br /> As the world plunged into a war that America feared, but knew it would be dragged down, Abraham Lincoln was a big part of it. the people's minds, in 1939, as a person who faced the same dilemma in his own life and having triumphed. On Broadway, Robert E. Sherwood's award-winning "Abe Lincoln in Illinois", with the physically deadly portrait of Raymond Massey, was performing in packed halls (the film would be shot in 1940). The rest of his epic biography "Abraham Lincoln: The War Years" by Carl Sandburg was published and quickly became a bestseller. President Roosevelt frequently referred to Lincoln in his speeches, and Lincoln Memorial in Washington became the city's most popular landmark (a fact Frank Capra used wisely in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" ). <Br/> <br /> All this was not lost on Darryl F. Zanuck at 20th Century Fox; as soon as he read Lamar Trotti's screenplay of Lincoln's debut as a lawyer, he named it as a "prestige" production and entrusted John Ford with the role of director and Henry Fonda with playing the main role. <br /> <br /> Fonda does NOT want to play Lincoln; he felt he could not do justice to the "great emancipator" and feared that a bad performance would hurt his career. Even a filmed makeup test, in which he was stunned to see how much he would look like Lincoln, would not change his mind. According to Fonda, John Ford, with whom he had never worked, had shocked him royally at their first meeting and explained that he was not representing the Lincoln of Legend, but a young lawyer from the "jackanape" campaign. "undergoing his first murder trial. Humiliated, Fonda took the role. (John Ford proposed a different scenario of events, but the result was the same!) Obviously, they found a chemistry that worked well, because almost all their couples would produce "classics". <br /> <br /> Unlike Lincoln's introverted and melancholic "Abe Lincoln in Illinois," Ford's vision is that of a shy but friendly young lawyer, who easily makes friends and misses the mother he has lost, too young (which creates a link with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story). Injustice irritates him and he speaks with "common sense" to repress violence, intertwined with humor. Both productions play on Lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with Ann Rutledge; in the Ford version, the two lovers are really in love and tied to each other. After his death, Lincoln would frequently visit his grave to share his life with his "spirit" (a theme that Ford would pursue in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"). <br /> <br /> A murder trial is the centerpiece of the film and shows the prodigious talents of the star and the director. Fonda deftly describes Lincoln's inexperience, but his profound belief in merciful justice, and Ford stresses the gap between "intellectuals" in the big city (represented by the pompous DA Donald Meek, and his clever "advisor" , Stephen Douglas, played by a young Milburn Stone), and the informal and compelling sense of the land of Lincoln. The Ford Record is a key witness to Ford's "ordinary" lawsuit. The trial is both unconventional and exciting. <br /> <br /> The movie ends as Lincoln moves away in the stormy distance, and as his fate (dissolve in a view of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial), the audience could be reassured by saying that if a cause were right, good would finally triumph. <br /> <br /> "Young Mr. Lincoln" is a truly remarkable film an amazing year!
