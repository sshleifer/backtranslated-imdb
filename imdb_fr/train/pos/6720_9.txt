Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other well-done and acclaimed surf films, Dana Brown's Endless Summer, his follow-up Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, Dana's son, and Step in liquid (IMAX). I saw the first, not the others. <br /> <br /> Although the surf images are spectacular, I especially appreciated the filmmaker's historical perspective. It brings us back to the origins of this sport nearly a hundred years ago and shows how it has evolved to its present form. This includes in-depth interviews with prominent personalities and artists, the evolution of surfboard designs, the world's most popular surfing beaches in Hawaii and California, as well as the tremendous growth of surfing. adrenaline provided by this sport. The athletes lived on the beaches for several months, surfed from dawn to dusk, camped on rudimentary berths, searched for food and returned to their board the next day. What a euphoric way to spend his days of youth. <br /> <br /> We see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest boost for the sport? Believe it or not, it was the movie Gidget, although I suspect copyright issues might prevent crediting surf songs from Beachboys like Surf Girl and Surfing USA. Surfing magazine and the Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew there was one) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see comments from the sports pioneers, their families and how the current generation benefited from the creators of the 1960s. One of these stories is: Laird Hamilton, 40, considered the greatest surfer of Today, linked to a surfer previously known, introduced him to his single mother, with whom he married before becoming his father-in-law. <br /> <br /> A lively musical narrative composed of contemporary music of all eras accompanies the story. Have I whetted your appetite? Wonderful. Good walk.
