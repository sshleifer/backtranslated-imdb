Yes, it was a small budget, but this movie shows love! The only drawback is that you can say that the budget of this film would not be comparable to that of "Waterworld" and, even if the plot was good, the film has never fully exploited its potential! The strong performances of all and the suspense are worth seeing on a rainy night.
