White Fire has a lot to offer. With Larry Bird's double, Robert Ginty, at the head of the charge, with his fabulous hair and his super macho mustache, the film hovers over other low-budget actors. The charisma he has in all this makes Tom Selleck look like a putz. With Ginty beating everyone, the film only gets better when a story of diamond intrigue enters the scene. Then add Fred Williamson, frontal shrubs, chainsaw attacks and impressive themes of incest ... this film ends up folding every time. If you are looking for a great B action, this is it. Now, if I can just get my hands on this soundtrack.
