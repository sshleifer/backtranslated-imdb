I have to start by telling you how I came across this film. It was winter in Alaska around 1990. One of my friends from Australia was living with me and my girlfriend in a shoebox of an apartment. Winter in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink a lot and watch everything on television. I found this movie outside a thrift store in a school bench. snow and immediately a new treasure. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like a fish. We've seen it so many times that we would sometimes turn the TV on its side or turn it upside down to get a picture. more complete filling.This is a real gem.The laughs will not stop and the memories will last forever.If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it.You will not regret it!
