"On my lips" (which probably has a different idiomatic resonance in his French title) is a clever and sinuous contemporary narrative of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime corsair when unusually assorted characters slip from up and down sensual slippery slope. <br /> <br /> The two leaders are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (whom I've never seen before, despite her long resume in French films) and a Vincent even more disgusted than usually (who looks sexy and / or threatening and voice to some American movies) <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is on its territory in a competitive real estate office and it is the neophyte. half is on his land like an ex-prisoner and his heartbreaking adaptation to this environment. <br /> <br /> The writer / director Jacques Audiard uses very intelligently the auditory insulating handicap of the woman as a way to get into her perceptions, turn the sound up and down so we hear her as she does (so it's even more boring than usual when audience members speak), also using visual elements as sensory reactors. <br /> <br /> None of the characters act as expected (She is not like this collapsible victim of "In the Company of Men", not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the global arc of the unpredictable scenario (well, until the last shot, but the devil the audience was waiting for this achievement) as we move from a frantic modern office to a hectic nightclub into romantic and criminal pacts. <br /> <br /> There is a parallel story that is thematically redundant and useless, but it just gives us a few minutes to catch our breath. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites of the year! <Br /> <br /> (originally written on 28/07/2002)
