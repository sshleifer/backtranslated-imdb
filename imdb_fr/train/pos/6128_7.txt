Yes, it's a horror of grade B. But at least producers, directors and actors do not claim that this film is a manna from heaven. The plot is corny, a psychotic serial killer about to be executed is splashed by a genetic acid that turns him into a snowman. The snowman, Jack Frost, then launches into a murderous murder to find the sheriff of the small town that finally stopped him. With a limited budget, the crew had to be content with limited special effects, most of the money spent on the snowman costume. Particularly difficult shots are managed by cartoons or panoramic shots (shots in which the camera moves away to hide details). <br /> <br /> This is not a children's movie and should not be confused with a Disney movie of the same title. If you do not let your kids watch pg-13 movies alone, parents should not let their children watch this movie. This film has two claims to fame. 1. The beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) played her first big role in the movies. The scene where Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth deserves to be seen a few times. 2. This movie has the worst snowman joke of all time. The joke is so bad that the directors give him a credit.
