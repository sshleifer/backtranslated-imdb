The basic scenario is as follows: Aditiya (Kumar) is the spoiled son of a millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan), owner of a toy industry. In the eyes of Ishwar, Aditya, his son, can do nothing wrong. his son to the responsible way before it's too late, because Ishwar is a lung cancer patient and has only 9 months to live, when his son gets up and marries Mitali (Chopra), Ishwar willingly forgives Aditya, but when the happy couple Aditya Mitali is pregnant and this forces Ishwar to expel Aditya from the house to make him more responsible, Aditya does not know that his father is suffering from lung cancer, and he does not do not know either. his father has kicked him out of the pipe to make him more responsible, Ishwar can not bring himself to tell Aditya that he is about to die, with a hungry pregnant woman. It's a race against the clock and Aditya is doing everything in her power to prove herself to her father. His heyday comes as Aditya gets his big hit in the film industry and his father tells him he's about to die. <br /> This movie is absolutely great, it's the breakthrough in Indian cinema that the Bollywood industry needed. The realization of Shah is almost flawless, but which film has no flaws? The best part if this movie is the father-son relationship that is a tearful. the interludes of the song are just placed at the right time, the decor is good, the only part where this film fails is the one where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav are too long and after a bit boring, but overall c is an awesome movie, I advise anyone who reads this review to go watch it regardless of other reviews. 9/10
