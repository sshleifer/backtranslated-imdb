She is not Michael Jordan <br /> <br /> Think of all the wonderful NBA players whose career has been sifted for the right reason at the time of their birth. Their names could as easily fall from the public's lips as Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, the list goes on; but the volume is a little down, for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other great players who have always lost the headlines in front of Michael. <br /> <br /> I saw that it was written that Gretchen Mol's career was soaring following the cover story of the 1998 issue of Vanity Fair that predicted the inevitable superstardom for Ms. Mol. It was later said that she had been overexcited. I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I still remember that for a while after seeing "The Devil's Advocate" in '97 or '98, I wondered what actress was playing Mary Ann Lomax. Was it Mol or Theron? Oh yes! Charlize Theron was "2 Days in the Valley" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mol was featured in "Donnie Brasco", "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> By the time I had seen "The Thirteenth Floor" (Mol) and "Sweet November" (Theron), I had pretty much straightened them, but I still put them in the same drawer for mental records. Both were very talented, had a charming face, a similar body type, short blond hair, and so on. <br /> <br /> Theron, however, was offered more work. I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon, her beauty was downright intimidating. <br /> <br /> In 2003, "Monster" came out and, as of the awarding of the Oscar itself, everyone knew which "Best actress" prize was going. And rightly so! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made Aileen Wuornos's tick was to replay the digital video in Selby's head. And for a major talent to physically go unattractive! Never seen! <br /> <br /> Then, in 2005, "The Notorious Bettie Page" was published. Mol's performance was extraordinary. Maybe she was standing in Mrs. Theron's shadow. It was like the ballroom for the celebration of the victory of the defeated presidential candidate. Nobody came and no one cared. It was seen as a continuation of an old tale, a promising actress with a declining career making a nudique role in a movie "B". Ho hum! No no no! False! No matter what you think of the film (and I like films about the 50s), if you pass this film, you will miss one of the best performances of this year. Mrs. Moll was as much Bettie as Mrs. Theron was Aileen. Unfortunately, Aileen, to the cinema audience, is the most likeable character. For some reason, a sociopathic amoral murderer embarrasses us less than a naive, unsophisticated, uninhibited, and religious girl, whose most crucial crime has been to live her life totally confident and completely exposed. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties. Her photos and films are never sexual, never pornographic, but she looks almost like a caricature of all that is perverse. There was no realism, only parody. Ms. Moll captured the essence of the character. She took 20 pounds to add a zaftig to her normally thin figure and when she posed for different photographers in the movie, her body was that of Bettie. His total absence of frontal inhibitions is exactly what was published on Bettie. Cinematographic nudity normally represents eroticism or sexuality. In this film, there is talk of innocence. Seeing Gretchen / Bettie naked did not make me want to jump her, but made her want to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other. If you transmit this film, you will miss one of the best performances of recent years. By the way, the MPAA should be ashamed of having given it the R rating.
