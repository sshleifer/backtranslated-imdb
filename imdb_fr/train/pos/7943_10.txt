I love this TV series so much. it contains an interesting and beautiful animation. I can not believe they cut the TV and I never knew if the cybersix and the data7 would die or not, apparently, they survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the best TV show of all time. I know it's too late to hope they'll start the show again, so I'm really glad I saw it. I read it so much <3> It's about a woman named cybersix, she's not human. She goes through adrian sieldman, a teacher in a high school. Now, Cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she's just disguised as a man of the day. At night, Cybersix patrols the city. <br /> <br /> A guy named Von Reichter is the one who created Cybersix. Once he finds it alive, he uses all he can to capture it. <BR /> <br /> If you've never watched it before, you should download it completely. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut it ???? some people have problems. but I'm glad I could watch the 13 episodes.
