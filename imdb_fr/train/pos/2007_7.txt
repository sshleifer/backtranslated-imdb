My personal opinion is that this movie did not have a real storyline for John Carpenter's early vampires, but I do not care, I loved him. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this movie. It really pissed me off to believe he was the person you would never think would be a famous ROCKSTAR. There were bad things about this movie. As in the scenario, the film should have done more. There should be a sequel to the movie that followed the script and they should have kept the same main characters in the three vampire movies. I really liked the clothes that people wore and the frame they choose in Mexico. I liked the way it was old Mexico and not the new Mexico. with clay houses and old-fashioned churches. I was a little confused with the vampires and how they could walk in the churches, but it was cool to see that they did not follow Dracula's rules.
