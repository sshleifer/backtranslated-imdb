In a series filled with brilliant episodes, this one is one of my favorites. This is not the deepest episode, there is no great meaning or message. But it's very entertaining and there are some great performances. <br /> <br /> But what really distinguishes it is that, to my knowledge, it is the * only * episode * of Twilight Zone with * double * end of the snapper. The Zone is rightly famous for offering a big surprise at the end of a story. But this time you have a surprise and think this is the case, but it turns out that another surprise is waiting. I like it so much, that it's probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other being deeper and more message-oriented).
