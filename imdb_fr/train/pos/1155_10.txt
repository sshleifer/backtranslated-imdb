This is very fun. It has a large distribution which each gives great performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It's a well written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I do not like soap operas, even if I never look at them. But I love this movie because it is so crazy and offbeat that it blocks to death any stupid soap it has on television. In my opinion, it's the best movie of 1991.
