I love that movie!!! Purple Rain came out the year of my birth and it is close to my heart since I remember. Prince is so tight in this movie. Last night, I went to a special screening of Purple Rain and it was like a concert. I was happy to see real fans because this film is so underrated that it is really one of the greatest movies of all time. The music is untouchable. The film is about "The Kid", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the most popular act in the city and he's staring at Apollonia, a budding singer. There is no doubt that purple is my favorite color, I can thank "The Kid" for that. So, if you have not seen this, you must do it as soon as possible. This is a classic - 4ever!
