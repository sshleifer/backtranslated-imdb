"Home Room" is a total surprise. Having no idea what it was, it paid off because it does not hold up and we see how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his classmates, who are the innocent victims of his reckless actions. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, the director, who works and mounts his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded with an incredible acting game all around his casting. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl trying to graduate from high school. She has been absent for a few years and does not seem to be in the same wavelength as the other students. On the one hand, she is a rebel with a punk look, a lot of make-up and a mouth that will cut off anyone who dares to approach her orbit. Alicia was one of the students in the room of the house where nine students died, allegedly killed by her boyfriend. Alicia, we are aware, is an injured girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal of her life, but we have no indication to that effect. <br /> <br /> What follows is the day after the tragedy, because focuses on a young woman who survived. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teenager who should never have been to school. When a ricochet ball hits her, she is hospitalized with more than one injury. She tries to overcome this dark period in her mind but the nightmares do not let her forget. <br /> <br /> Alicia is forced to go to the hospital by the school principal. Since she does not cooperate with the police, the head of the school asks her to see Deanna in her terrible state. Maybe she will calm down and tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia does not like Deanna, but in a few days, the two girls will make peace. We do not realize before the last sequence what really happened that horrible day at school. <br /> <br /> Busy Phillips makes an excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen is as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the cast play in a set. <br /> <br /> The film has an intensity because it is not explicit to show how the filming took place, which helps the tone Ryan wanted to give this film.
