This has to be one of the best movies to come out of Hong Kong for a long time, I was looking forward to getting my hands on this movie by just watching the title. A lot of fantastic actors in this series and I was particularly impressed by the insane behavior of Sam Lee, incredibly believable, and by Edison's portrait of a deadly machine, which totally reversed his image of normal idol. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a stylish and action packed movie. However, I must warn you that it is also an equally depressing film, because each character in the film is in a kind of deadlock and problem, and has trouble breathing. It makes you think of what life really is.
