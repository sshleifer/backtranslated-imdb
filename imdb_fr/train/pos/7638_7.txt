Larry Burrows has the distinct feeling that something is missing. Since he missed a crucial blow to baseball at the school that cost the championship, he is convinced that his life would have been better if he had made it. Then one night, his car breaks down again. Entering the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck, Larry falls on the bartender Mike, who, unbeknownst to him, is about to change his life forever ....... <br /> <br /> the cinema is not new, going back to the life of It's A Wonderful Life and showing no sign of decay with the recent Sandler vehicle that was Click. It's a genre that has produced very mixed results. In 1990, this production, directed by James Belushi, rarely mentioned when the subject in question was discussed, seems to have been largely forgotten. Which is a shame because it is full of charm and is not short of stories of humor. We know that we are driven to the end of its ultimate message, but it is a fun and enjoyable way to go. The film also shows how much the actor James Belushi was a good actor. I mean, if his style of smart exasperation and exasperation is not your thing, then there's a good chance you'll avoid this movie anyway. But for committed people like Red Heat, K-9 and Taking Care of Business, Mr. Destiny is all you need. Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox will accompany the ride. <br /> <br /> Mr. Destiny, a pure entertainment escape with the kicker of a message in his heart. 7/10
