"Match Point" and now "Scoop" convinced me that not only did Woody Allen do a neat job in England (and that Scarlett Johansson was the right-hand member of the cast), but corroborated what I had known for years: Do not focus on the rich and neurotic New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson embodies journalism student Sondra Pransky, whom magician Sid Waterman (Allen) puts in her box of disappearance, where she meets the ghost of murdered journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells him that the murders in series that hit London were committed by millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). So she gets to know him and ... well, I do not know what I can tell you without revealing it. But I can say it's probably Allen's funniest movie in years. There is his unique and omnipresent style of humor (especially the phrase about his religion). <br /> <br /> You are sure to love this movie. If nothing else, it will make you fall in love with London. But above all, it's so hilarious. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you must love this one.
