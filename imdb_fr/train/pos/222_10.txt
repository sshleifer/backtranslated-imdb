A hilarious comedy by Neil Simon that evokes bursts of laughter from beginning to end. The late Walter Matthau is the grumpy ex-comedian who is confident of joining his ex-partner (Oscar-winning defeated George Burns) for a reunion show on stage. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew, and both have as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love the grumpy character of Matthau - he is as he always has been, yet he is also very different. <br /> <br /> Burns, as a distracted old man, is as funny as Matthau. <Br /> <br /> Matthau: Do you want crackers? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: why not a hard biscuit? <br /> <br /> Matthau: I'm not clear. I have coconuts, pineapples and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Okay <br /> <br /> Matthau: They're in the kitchen cupboard. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or how about that: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I was black, the whites knew what I was saying! <br /> <br /> You have to see it in the movie to understand it! <br /> <br /> All in all, a comedy of characters refreshing, hilarious, sweet, warm and warm with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /> <br /> They do not do it anymore! At a time when all new comedies are rudimentary, juvenile and stupid, it brings us back to the heart of true comedy: amusing characters, intelligent and amusing dialogues and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies among friends of all time, with "Planes, trains and cars", "Fatal weapon" and "The difficult way". <br /> <br /> You may have trouble finding that for rent or on TV, but believe me, it will be worth your time! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
