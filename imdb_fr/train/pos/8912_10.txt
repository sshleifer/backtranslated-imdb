I read many reviews on this site criticizing The Blob for its nerdy or campy character. The film has been criticized for its amateur acting and weak special effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose only experience has been the production of low-budget, locally produced Christian short films (Valley Forge PA)? Allow me to say to these overly critical critics that this film never took itself seriously. This fact should be evident from the mismatched thematic theme complete with silly lyrics played at the opening credits. For what it was supposed to be, this movie is excellent. I've seen some of the recent ultra-low budget attempts, including Blair Witch Project, that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thinking behind their plot. BWP was pure excrement. The Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well written and very entertaining. The scene where the old man meets the meteorite and stabs the mass it contains with a stick is extremely successful and truly frightening. The scene in the doctor's office with the Blob slowly moving under the guru's cover as he consumed was a masterpiece of cinematic horror. In the end, I love this movie. I challenge anyone to take $ 120,000, inflated to the value of today's dollar, and make a film as entertaining and / or as successful as The Blob. It just can not be done. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
