For me, this movie was powerful. I do not want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend years ago. we were like brothers. This film brought back vivid memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I could not put my vote for this movie that would have been a 10. I kept getting a message like "No vote has been cast ... "And yet, I saw in the statistics that there was. I will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> Minor defects that I forgot. It's the relationships between the characters that attracted me. Beautifully played and real situations. I went in a few of them. <br /> <br /> A little gem of a movie. Just like "Spring Forward" is another neglected gem. I am very happy that films like these are still in progress on the relationships between people, well written, with sensitivity, with a game and a leadership of the first order. After all, is not it what it is?
