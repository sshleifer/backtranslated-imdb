From time to time, a filmmaker gives life to a unique group of people and allows you to see inside what makes us human beings. Lawrence Kasden did that again. I always thought theBg Cill was the hymn of his age and he managed to do it again in Grand Canyon. From time to time, we are at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we miss it. It is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life through this choice. The juxtaposition of small and big events that allows us to see how much of the things we worry about is trivial is truly great. I have watched this film many times and I am constantly surprised by the depth of the emotions that go through this film. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline play their roles with great tenderness and Stever Martins is priceless for his role as director. Thank you again Mr. Kasden
