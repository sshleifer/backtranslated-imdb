Everyone should see this movie! It's scary, but do not use lame stuff: "Jump-just-for-yourself-to-surprise-and-pass-as-scary". It's really awesome. See this awesome movie freaking !!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, by far the greatest director of all time. Each of his films are masterpieces, including this one. The Shining tells the story of this family who goes to a Colorado Rockies hotel as a winter guard and gets the snow inside. The house is haunted. The kid is psychic. The husband is easily impacted by hotels haunted by evil, and ... well ... HILARITY ENSUES !!!! Not really. It becomes this thrilling thriller where things are thrown on the viewer from all directions, and it gets scary. Not just the classic, "Here's Johnny" scene. It's memorable, but I can not speak for all the movies. It's one of those things where words do not explain it properly, and you just have to see it. So go on Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
