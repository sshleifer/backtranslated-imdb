'How to lose friends and alienate people' is a funny, albeit cowardly, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also an excellent title to help fulfill the line requirement in IMDb reviews! The point is the same as the book with some dramatized incidents, but a romantic plot is added and the end is certainly Hollywoodized. Simon Pegg, despite the fact that he plays an essentially irritating character, is still as friendly and funny as usual and carries about the film. Strange to think that only a few years ago, he was just a type of sitcom on television and now, he rubs shoulders with Hollywood names. There is a good support cast and it's a fun and easy watch - a kind of "Ugly Betty" male, but funnier.
