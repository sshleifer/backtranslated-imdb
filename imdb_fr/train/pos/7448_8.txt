I have not laughed a lot for a long time - although the film also has some sad moments, especially when it goes from hyper-funny to honest and serious. The characters are very realistic most of the time, sappy sometimes, but quite credible. I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's show - I'm sorry for the participants. This film is instead a satire and it is fine. <br /> <br /> Too bad all zanys were * peeped * while this film was broadcast on public television, it amuses him a lot. I will rent this movie to enjoy it. <br /> <br />
