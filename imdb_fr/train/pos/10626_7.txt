This is a decent little film made in Michigan, about a guy haunted by his past, with his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and who grew up with little adjustment. In fact, he is absolutely crazy, but tries not to be too obvious. He also has an entourage, his own little demon and angel who follow him everywhere. The demon never says a word, but he does not have to, and he's scared by Max Schreck. Let's just say that the angel is spinning hard enough in this area, because Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like "freeing" the people he decided they needed, mostly beautiful young women . It's a decent representation of madness, and you're a little lonely to understand what's going on, but overall I watched this film from start to finish, very focused on the film because it really wanted to my interest. . It's missing a bit in some areas, but I really can not say anything. A decent effort and worth the trip If you like serial killer movies.
