I loved this film! Chris Showerman did an amazing job! Not only is he an amazing actor, but he is gorgeous with a great physique! He did a great job delivering his lines and turned himself into George better than Fraser. A great performance for his first big roll! This film is full of hilarious scenes that all kids will love. My children have watched this movie many times since we bought the DVD the day it was released. In addition to the movie, the extras of the DVD are just as fun. Congratulations to this one! I highly recommend it to everyone!
