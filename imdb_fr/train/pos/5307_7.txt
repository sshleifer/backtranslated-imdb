"Pecker" is a young and unknown Baltimore photographer who becomes a big star in the public, the media and the local art scene with his images showing the dirty reality of everyday life, as well as dirty underwear or human excrement. This is a typical subject of John Waters' independent comedies in Baltimore: showing the strange aspects of the American way of life between the tendency to political correctness and conservative reactions by exploring the origins of middle-class society in his hometown . <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong of "Terminator 2" plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and Water's longtime actress, Mink Stole. Although the rhythm of the plot sometimes becomes a big defect and can not compete with the attacks of fast and furious jokes of the awesome "Serial Mom" ​​of Water, he still has something to laugh about and unforgettable scenes like an old junkie-girl who has become vegetarian by sniffing peas in a vegetable dish ... "Pecker" is a superb comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, the media rumors, the sexual anguish of the middle class and the strange ways to become a pop star without realizing it. . Recommended!
