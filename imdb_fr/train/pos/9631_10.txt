A short film LAUREL & HARDY. The boys arrive to sweep the chimneys at the home of Professor Noodle, a mad scientist who has just perfected his rejuvenating serum. Stan and Ollie continue their dirty work by spreading the destruction inside the house and on the roof. Then, the teacher wants to try his new potion ... <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie. The end is a bit steep, but most of the paper leading to it is terrible. The Stan & Ollie wills contest at the opposite ends of the chimney is particularly interesting. It's Lucien Littlefield as a teacher.
