Welcome to Collinwood, that's a lot, but it's not the following: <br /> <br /> A George Clooney Unfunny Un-Original Featured Vehicle <br /> <br /> And yes, I know , the fundamentals of the film is another film. However, for Hollywood, it may be one of the most authentic productions of the decade - and mine is. <br /> <br /> The film is, from beginning to end, a real gas. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no bad performance in the film. The funny parts are funny. The edgy parts are pissed off. The scenario contains, not a moment of boring dialogue The cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful. And that does not conform to the Hollywood norm (you'll see what I mean when you see the movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember seeing commercials for the movie. This film went under the radar after not having had much success at the box office and is not even a cult classic. If Transformers 2 is considered acceptable by average viewers, it's because they are used to seeing Transformers 2. If the movie is as original and fun as it has been screened as often as several million pieces The film experience would be a much cooler place - <br /> <br /> When "they" say they do not make them as before, they did not see Welcome to Collinwood. <br /> <br /> A fun, mini-masterpiece of the caper comedy, which refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
