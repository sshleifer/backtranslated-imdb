When I flipped through the TV guide and came across "Twisted Desire" in the movie section, I read his description. Three words caught my attention "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I find her role in "Sabrina: The young witch" absolutely abominable, I hate this kind of programs, so I thought it would be an old boring, love story starring it ... I did not know it very well. <br /> <br /> It finally started on TV, I had my bucket ready in case I vomited over its sandy or cheesy appearance, you know what I mean. At first, you think it's just an ordinary girl, beautiful, who loves, but who has bad parents. Then, when you discover that she manipulates her boyfriend to kill her parents, so that she can be with her TRUE love, you are like "Whoa". You do not expect this kind of role for this kind of actress. She played very well in my opinion, I did not expect her to behave like a bitch, and now she did it perfectly! Congratulations to her, the movie was very good, I would definitely watch it again and recommend it to others.
