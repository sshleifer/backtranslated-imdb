Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) ​​is tried for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses testify - the father Warecki (Henry Travers), the brother of Wilhelm, Karl (Erik Rolf) and the former lover of Wilhelm, Marja (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaks for his own defense. The film ends at the end of the trial .... <br /> <br /> The film is told in three sequences back when each witness appears at the hearing. The story takes place mainly in a small Polish village and the memorable scenes include the village's reaction to the death of Anna (Shirley Mills), accused of rape by Wilhelm; the treatment of Jewish villagers as they prepare to be transferred to concentration camps; and the religious service where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) denounces his Nazi education mourning his girlfriend Janina (Dorothy Morris), daughter of Marja, after being shot in a brothel. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter, resentful and mean man. Martha Hunt has strong moments and fits her like a glove. Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest. This movie offers an effective story that stays with you once it's over.
