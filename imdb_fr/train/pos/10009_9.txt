When I first read the story of Armistead Maupins, the human drama presented by Gabriel interested me. Nobody and those he loves and loves. That being said, we have now received the film version of an excellent story and we hope to see the Hollywood death knell ... <br /> <br /> Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have done really well! <br /> <br /> With just the right amount of restraint, Robin Williams captures Gabriel's fragile essence and lets us see his fight with problems of trust both in his personal life (Jess) and in the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> As we are introduced to the actors of this drama, we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can irrevocably change our lives. The request to re-read a book written by a young man is transformed into a life-changing event that will help Gabriel find the strength to continue and move forward. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that most people avoid this movie. . I say this only because the average American will probably think "Robin Williams in a serious role?" It had not worked before! PLEASE GIVE A CHANCE TO THIS FILM! Robin Williams touches the darkness that we all have to find and go through in ourselves to become better people. Like his film One Hour Photo, he became an actor and made another quality work of art. <br /> <br /> Oh, and before I forget, I think Bobby Cannavale is like Jess steals every scene he's in. He has the leading man of the 1940s look and presence on the screen. It's this hacker opinion that he could make his own movie right now! <br /> <br /> S ~
