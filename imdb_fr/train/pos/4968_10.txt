Diego Armando Maradona was and still is the best football player in the game. Not just an athlete, but an artist. This documentary on the 1986 World Cup will always be remembered by all football fans around the world. Because of his huge and incredible goal, which he scored against my own country (England). There is absolutely no reason to diminish this star. Although I do not understand Spanish, I can appreciate the Argentine narrator. In fact, he cries with happiness and can barely express his emotion ..... Everything I wrote can be foolish and hard to understand, but readers ..... you have to look at this to find out what I want to say.
