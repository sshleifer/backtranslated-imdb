The new Batman Adventures (also called Gotham Knights) takes place 5 years after the last episodes of Batman: the animated series (B: TAS) and has only been aired for 24 episodes. It's not a horrible show, but it's just not as good as the original Batman animated series. I will start with all the things I found not very good. <br /> <br /> First, the animation itself: long and sweet, Gotham is no longer black, the sky is always bright red and orange, B: TAS did that too, but was drawn on a dark palace, the color of the sky was more disturbing, in this show, the color of the sky is too bright. It looks like any other children's show and does not seem unique, like Batman: TAS, with his dark and cool artistic style on Gotham. The artistic style is ok but does not remember Batman anymore. Each character is composed of straight lines, squares and triangles, which makes it less human. In the original series (B: TAS), the characters are more like drawn versions of real people. The animation may be more consistent here than in B: TAS, but it is certainly not as good. <br /> <br /> Next: some episodes seem too stupid and childish, but some topics are even stronger than in B: TAS. (Two-Face trying to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2, and some villains are undergoing a pretty hard treatment). This brings me to the next point. <br /> <br /> As it is supposed to unfold in the future as well as the latest episodes of the animated Batman Universe, many villains are falling apart or leaving forever. The Ivy Poison apparently drowns when a cruise ship explodes; Two-Face almost killed Penguin, Killer Croc and himself. So he moved to Arkham forever. Joker falls into the exhaust tower of a factory (although he returns later in the animated series Justice League); Catwoman moves to France leaving Batman, etc ... It's not because the series ends that it means they have to get rid of super characters! The motivations of the bad guys are also very bad. There are not any! In B: TAS, we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined, which is why they act as they do. In this series, the bad guys just commit crimes to advance the story. It's as if Batman did not even care about saving the mental health he was left with the people he was fighting with, he was beating them senseless. This Batman is a cooler and meaner version of the character, but since he's been doing this job for years, I understand why he's so tough. <br /> <br /> Next, the redesigned character models: they are awful. Gordon has lost about 100 pounds ... is he sick? Many villains look STUPID (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc are some of the worst). Although I think some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is pretty much the same, and Ivy (who is even hotter now) has pale green skin. <br /> <br /> The series having many flaws, some episodes are great - Over the water, Crazy love, Beware of the fright Girls Night Out, Old Wounds, Legends of the Dark Knight and Never Fear are my favorite here, in my opinion. All crossovers featuring Batman in the Superman animated series were also excellent. <br /> <br /> The absolute essence of this show is the way the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original. On the DVDs of the original Batman animated series, they explain how proud they were of the artistic style and how difficult it was to animate certain characters, but they finally succeeded (the difficult animation necessary to animate Clayface, for example ). . On the DVDs of Batman's new adventures, the creators basically say "Hell with B: TAS, it's a new and new vamp, it looks better and we like the way we've almost done the series!" (Okay, that's an exaggeration) When the creators rejected the incredible artistic style of B: TAS, it really annoyed me! <br /> <br /> This is not a bad show, but I still do not like it as much as the original animated series. At least, the show does not speak with his audience, that's why I always congratulate him. Some episodes of this new series are fantastic and deserve to be watched. <br /> <br /> Superman: The Animated Series and Justice League: The Animated Series are excellent Batman follow-up shows: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, so offer them a watch too.
