This film is the best movie of all time. I can not remember the last time a film brought tears to my eyes. with a tear in the eye, I admire this film. It contains all the elements that a good film must have: excellent dialogues, music, acting, narrative / script. A story of friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between a street singer famous for The King of Masks and a little girl sold as a boy in a serf bazaar. Little girl liked being her granddaughter and King of Masks loved a grandson. They were not conventional in real time. Every scene where they were together was invaluable. The work of the camera is flawless and grab you. The game is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as a masks king. Renying Zhou "Doggie" looks pretty and has very well interpreted his character. Zhigang Zhao like Liang Sao Lang was great. He played very well his helpful and generous character. If you do not have this movie, try it once, look at it.
