In fact, it's one of those movies that would have to be 7.5. The fact is; as already said, it's very entertaining. Wonderfully atmospheric. Askey certainly sounds exaggerated, but it's a great vehicle for him, just like Oh, Mr. Porter is for Will hay. If you like old movies and black house trains, this product is for you. <br /> <br /> Curiously, it's pretty strange to see this kind of movie. It's nice and charming, endearingly, with all the nostalgic references that made the war time. The band of "strange" characters is played simply as in many other British films typical of the war. It would have been wonderful to see this movie if it had been recorded by Ealing Studios. Too bad the original of 1931 did not remain intact
