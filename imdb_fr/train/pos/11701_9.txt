This is a great movie for all generations X. What a different world, 1972 America was compared to our psychotic 21st century. You can get an idea of ​​what a 1972 America was like by watching this movie. I discovered that clothes and car styles reminded me of good memories of a country much better than the one we have now. Just think ... at the time, there were only 4 or 5 TV channels to choose from. There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, bird flu, sniper freeway, etc., etc. The war in Vietnam had just ended. It will take another 7 years before the release of Star Wars. The personal computer and the Internet would still be in 29 years. <br /> <br /> At the release of this film, the producers had to market the film themselves because no other film company wanted it. He began touring small Protestant churches across the country, projected onto movie projectors (well before the time of the VCRS). The pastor of a church who would be interested in showing a robber at night to his congregation would get a copy of the movie. Then he organized an evening to show it in the meeting room of the church or in the dining room. The members of the congregation would invite friends and family members "unregistered" and this would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can go beyond the film's limited production values ​​and look at it for its nostalgic value, then I think you'll enjoy the movie more. Of course, I speak as a generator. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine, I would go back to 1972 and bid farewell to the twenty-first century cesspool we have now.
