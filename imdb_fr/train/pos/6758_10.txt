Where the sidewalk ends (1950) <br /> <br /> Where one ends, another begins <br /> <br /> This is a prototype black film and, as such, quite impeccable, both from the point of view of the style as the content seen. The photography and night settings are first-rate (the director of photography, Joseph LaShelle, lets drama scene after scene), and close-ups on faces of pure expressionism. I can watch this kind of film only for the visual elements, even when the actors are struggling and the plot stinks. <br /> <br /> But the acting is top notch here, and the plot shows what I see as the core of most of the dark movies, the alienated male lead (representing the many men coming in home in a modified state after the war and feel lost themselves). In fact, not only is Dana Andrews really convincing as a troubled solitary detective, he has a small but important counterpart in the film, the first husband of the main woman, a decorated ex-GI, fallen into hard times and drinking. The fact that one man kills another may have monumental significance, overall the ordinary guy who tries to overcome his internal problems is doomed while the soldier carrying a medal falls into an accidental death with a silver plate in the head. The woman goes from one to the other - we assume she gets married and has children as previously suggested in the movie. Even if it involves an after-the-fact interpretation, we can still see the path of a man with a psychological baggage who is going through a crisis of the highest moral order - going for a small crime just to the point where he really is. drawn. <br /> <br /> This film belongs to Andrews. He plays a much more sober and emotional guy than Kirk Douglas in a similar role in William Wyler's detective story directed a year later, and Andrews is certainly less theatrical. You can easily see both movies side by side for a comparison and textbook contrast session. The fact that Andrews, as Detective Dixon, struggles morally through all of this, and that Douglas as Detective McLeod is not, may explain why one man gets his daughter and the other does not. Gene Tierney offers an extremely friendly, discreet, and ultimately "classic" type of woman - not just a desirable card, but a person with whom you really want Dixon to get married. <br /> <br /> The criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but is quite effective in its play with types and clich√©s. The bit parts are kept, the little details (like the portable craps table) are nice, far from the actors of characters or the glamor of the game in Casablanca. But then, Curtiz's great movie is iconic, even in the details - it makes no effort to be subtle, real and penetrating, but it's at once spectacular, memorable and inspiring. They come to the opposite ends of the war and represent opposing opportunities for their leaders. Bogart begins his active service, Dixon, and the man Dixon killed has indeed passed. Through, carefully, but not failed. <br /> <br /> It's no coincidence that many, perhaps most black films, have what you would call "happy" endings. Man overcomes his adversaries and transforms his inner self, and the viewer, from yesterday to today, understands how beautiful it must be.
