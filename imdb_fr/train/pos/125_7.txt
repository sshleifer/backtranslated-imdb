Lars Von Trier never tries to try new techniques. Some of them are very original while others are better forgotten. <br /> <br /> He describes post-war Germany as a nightmarish train journey. With so many cities in ruins, Leo Kessler, a young American of German origin, feels obliged to help with their restoration. It's not an easy task, because he discovers it quickly. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds him a night chef job on the Zentropa railway line. His job is to meet the needs of passengers. When the shoes are polished, a chalk mark is made on the soles. A terrible debate ensues when a passenger's shoes are not burnt while they have been polished. There are many allusions to German fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details. <br /> <br /> The train ride resembles an allegory representing the procession of man through life, with all his trials and tribulations. In a sequence, Leo rushes into the back cars to find them filled with half-hungry bodies that seem to have escaped from Auschwitz. These images, as horrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible impact but without any link between them. <br /> <br /> At a station called Urmitz, Leo jumps off the train with an atomized bomb. At the sight of many spectators, he connects the bomb under a car. He returns to his cabin and establishes a connection with a clock. Later, he jumps off the train (at high speed) and lies down in the cool grass beside a river. Looking at the stars above, he decides that his job is to build and not to destroy. Then, as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge, he rushes at full speed to get on the train and stop the clock. If you want to analyze the situation, the task is totally impossible. Pretty ridiculous actually. It could only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It's strange to see how little things are remembered, like a row of cups hanging from hooks and vibrations of the train. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, I prefer the latest films by Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The bomb scene described above really discouraged me. Maybe I'm realistic.
