I have been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This film is the best fantasy film of recent years. I do not think "action" is the right kind, although there is a lot of action and KongFu scenes. Wait, did I mention that this is a fantasy film ORIENTAL? Please, keep in mind that DO NOT use the hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for the guy who "pooped" around, I do not blame you, because you're still young and need to know more about "culture".
