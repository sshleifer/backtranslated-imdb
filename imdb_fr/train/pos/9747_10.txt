I remember seeing this movie when it was released in 1982 and then enjoying it. About 4 years later, I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York (in Tosca). Seeing the end of this film reminds me a lot of this beautiful night. What does not like this movie? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Finished) was at its best and always looked great. The story is actually very funny in places and the scene of the "food fight" remains one of the funniest I have ever seen. The hot air balloon flight over the Napa Valley was magnificent, as was the song he sang "If we were in love" (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English). And hear the magnificent Santa Lucia duet. Get real friends, it was a movie about an opera singer named Georgio Fini who happened to be played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold and Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> I'm VERY happy to still have this almost worn-out VHS tape from this movie, but I wish it were published on DVD, especially now Pavarotti is no longer with us because that I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him and that he still turns today!
