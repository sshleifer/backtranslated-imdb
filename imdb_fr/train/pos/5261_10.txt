Do you like really inventive comedy or do you like "wedding breakers", if the answer is this one, stop reading now. I can not believe this movie is not rated better. Basically, Meadows plays a character quite similar to Austin Powers. This gagorama has countless inventive moments. Crudity - Leon playing with himself on the porch, the ex boyfriend tricked into eating. . Never mind. To inspire whimsical-clown sex, Broadway routine, voiceover. Meadows is great like Leon, a very sweet but very sweet child. A few outlines "do not blame the wang" "weird sex world" too much. . . Why this movie was not huge is a mystery. Super comedy.
