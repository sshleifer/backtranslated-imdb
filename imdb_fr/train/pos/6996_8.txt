This movie was a really great movie about something that concerns us all. I know that I have personally met him several times. Fortunately, Will Smith addressed the societal problem of text messaging while driving. People do not do it. An hour and forty-five minutes is not enough for this cause. Personally, I wanted to throw my mobile phone after the movie. I was happy to see other people in the theater see the message and throw their phones with the empty bags of popcorn. I decided to turn off all text messaging on my phone and encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, have them watch this vital public service announcement on text messaging while driving, otherwise they could kill seven people. Thank you for showing us the way.
