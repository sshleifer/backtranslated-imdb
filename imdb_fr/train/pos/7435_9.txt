I saw this video for the first time 15 years ago. I thought it was great then and I still do it. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and a lover of English romantic poetry. Coleridge is important to me. Anything that could harm the beauty of the poem or the power of history would not get my vote of excellence. In this case, everything works well to engage the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for a generation that grew up on television. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice gives him a sense of authenticity and authority. Well, there was not a big budget for the project. So it was not Star Wars and there is no CGI in it. But who can reject the illustrations of Gustave Dor√© as part of the presentation? The comment above, which in just four lines rejects the video as junk, is totally unfair and understating. I am a friend of the producer, but this is not the reason for this comment. I defend an artistic work that, in my opinion, has value at all levels. It is very appropriate to bring the Coleridge poem to the students so as to awaken their appreciation and sympathy for the lesson given by the former sailor.
