I had not seen this movie since the late 80s and decided to choose the VHS version. The plot is very slow, and the actors seem almost robotic in this breakdance movie. Music, hip hop / freestyle artists and breakdance scenes are what make this movie special. The break is really better in this film than in "Breakin '", but I must say that "Breakin' 1 & 2" carries much better energy and excitement on the screen. It's a movie I'll keep in my library, but it's not a movie I can watch over and over again, just once in a blue moon.
