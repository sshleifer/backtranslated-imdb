The Man in the Moon is a warm and moving drama, centered on a farming family of the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who falls in love with a 17-year-old neighbor ( Jason London) who ends up cracking for his older sister (Emily Warfield) and the unexpected tragedy that changes the dynamics of this family. forever. The 1950s are evoked here with love and the scenario gives you the characters to whom you attach immediate importance. Witherspoon is already beginning to show the talent she has developed at the Oscars and she would develop in this first role. London is a charming and prominent man. Warfield gives a discreet maturity to the role of elder sister who is also effective. Congratulations to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who are the parents of the girls, and to Gail Strickland, who is the mother of London. Unexpectedly, I was moved by this silent and moving drama that arouses strong emotions and gives a deeper meaning to the expression "family ties".
