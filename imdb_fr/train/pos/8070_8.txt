I have no doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Best Actor Oscar for this film after a three-part split between Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone, all of whom were in the same race. But The Informer is still a good movie because John Ford would not have had his first Oscar for best director if he had not done it. The film and the story of Liam O'Flaherty on which he is based are based on a poor idiot named Gypo Nolan who has been a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was put out of action for a foolish stunt he shot and he wants to come back. He's at the last pint and if he can not go home, he wants enough for the passage to America. There is a reward of twenty pounds for the information that led to the arrest of an old comrade named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness, he goes to the black police and Tan police and informs McPhillip. <br /> <br /> The IRA is anxious to find out who criticized McPhillip and is almost certain that it is McLaglen. He does not have the intelligence to really cover his own tracks. He makes a small effort to involve another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek. He also takes a pair of underpants played by J.M. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> All the action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin, from six in the evening to the next morning. It must be shot in darkness and shadows, making it probably the first black thriller. If it had been done after the Second World War, The Informer would have classified itself as a great black classic, like Odd Man Out or The Third Man, to which it looks a lot like. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew this world. very well. He took time during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. Sean O'Fiernan was his real name before being anglicized. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays IRA Commander Dan Gallagher. In the book, Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has here. I imagine that John Ford wanted him as a nice character to give a fundamental interest to moviegoers. It clearly indicates that Foster must eliminate the informant, because the Black and Tans will catch him, pull him a little further and put the whole organization in danger. <br /> <br /> The scene of the IRA trial is the culmination of the film. When Foster asks Donald Meek if he recognizes the authority of their court, Meek is not able to say no. The justice and the writ of the king do not go here. It graphically illustrates at this point, despite the occupation by the troops of the army and gendarmerie, the British are losing their grip on the population. <br /> <br /> Of course, The Informer has a rather dark story about John Ford, but a little less. as you can imagine. Even if McLaglen spends his money on a drunken craze, the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching over it and counting every beat. <br /> <br /> The Informer is a well-told story about Ireland in a dark and lamentable time.
