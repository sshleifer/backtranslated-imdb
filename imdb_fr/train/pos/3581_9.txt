I had already seen this movie in the 80's and almost forgot it by noticing that it was on TV again and I was watching it. I remembered having loved this little sleeper when I first saw him, and I loved him even more at a second reading. <br /> <br /> All actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, and Jason Presson (as a twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental death of his older brother by ball), is superb. The film has a very authentic feeling: a sober, calm and deeply moving story of a family bereaved by grief. Dialogue is rare but speaking, and nonverbal play is remarkable. A bit like a simpler and rural version of Ordinary People without a psychiatrist but an equally impressive family dynamic. <br /> <br /> The stone boy is well worth the time and emotional energy it takes to watch it.
