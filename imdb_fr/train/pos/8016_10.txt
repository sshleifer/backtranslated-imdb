Do not think this movie is just another kid movie - the whole family can enjoy it. It's a strange mix of film, because there seems to be a movie, but at least it makes sense in the end (unlike modern movies!), It gives you all the elements of a movie (decent plot, good characters - well, it stars the Muppets, a list of lesser celebrities * that the movies would claim) What is amazing is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some comforting, some funny and some serious - Everyone makes a nice family movie that everyone can watch together. <br /> <br /> * The stars of the film are actually the stars of the day, but there is only one real star of the film and nobody dares to dare to eclipse Miss Piggy !!!!
