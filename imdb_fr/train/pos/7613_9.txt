/ The first episode I saw of Lost made me think, I wondered what are some people who crashed and who were chased by a giant monster. But it's not like that, it's much more than that, because it's not a monster at all and every episode of Lost you see, well, it gets better every time. a deserted island with an underground bunker and in particular the connection between people who crossed each other before crashing. This is the real secret. <br /> <br /> This series reigns and I can not wait to find out what's really going on there. I hope they will not air in the last 2 episodes in theaters, this series deserves a 9 out of 10
