Perhaps not the biggest absolute entry in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it surely wins the prize for the most inventive episode! "The house that blew to death" ?? I could shout this title all day long without getting tired! And in addition to the wonderful title, this short film also benefits from a solid scenario and some truly suspenseful moments. You may need additional viewing to understand the particularity of the ending, but it is certainly an original idea for a horror short. The story begins with images of a senior couple drinking tea in their mansion. The husband kills his wife sadistically and several years later, the "cursed" house is still for sale. A young couple and their cherubic daughter enter and begin to restore it, but mysterious events occur and particularly affect young Sophie. His beloved cat is killed and even his birthday party is ruined when one of the pipes of the house sprays blood on all the guests (particularly scary sequence, this one!). Is the old house really haunted? Or maybe the seemingly helpful neighbors are causing all the horror? The answers to these questions are provided in the original climax and quite unpredictable and there is even room for a real shock at the very end. The tension is perfectly controlled and the house is filled with strange landscapes, like the pair of rusty machetes used by the husband to kill his wife. Small warning though, the sequence with the cat is hard to watch when you are an animal lover. Finally, another winner for Hammer's short-run television series!
