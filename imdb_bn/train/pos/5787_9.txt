Many dates (mostly like the episode of Twilight Zone) in this episode, such as the incredibly sexist military of women "identical" And some things are incredible, like simple water, easy to clean. Nevertheless, this year has been created and consider the time, and you can quickly understand why this episode is so special why you are watching. It has a great feeling of hope, along with a number of twilight zones as well as an attractive female character (though she rarely speaks), in some rare twilight zones. "Twenty" is a great example of how Twilight Zone can pack more passion and drama than two hours into film within 20 minutes. And it became great to see two people who became American icons at the beginning of their career.
