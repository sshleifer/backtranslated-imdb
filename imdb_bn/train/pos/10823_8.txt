I always liked Jonny Conko and I want this movie to be out of VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra is one of the most outstanding performers in his career. <br /> <br /> When we meet Frank in the title role of the first film, he is currently the brother of a notorious gunman brother outside the city. Brother gets terror in the heart of the city, and Frank takes full advantage of his shadow to beat the safe and safe city. Only Phyllis Kirk has no feeling for him. She is the daughter of the shopkeeper Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two gunmen arrived at William Conrad and Christopher Dar, and it proves that Conrad killed Sinatra's brother and he is coming to town. They insulted him and carried him out of the city. Kirk followed him. <br /> <br /> Overnight Sinatra turns into a coward from the pank and a man is searching for a kind of backbone. It is a well-played performance, with its Oscar man-made, The Man with a Golden Arm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His career was played on screen. She speaks incredible dirty, pure evil incarnation and talking on the silver screen, an arch. However, what I like about Johnny Concho is an unforgettable one where Conrad and Dark are confronted. Let's just say, I believe Johnny Concho is the answer to MGM's MGM and a break in the law-chain, what do you do when a prime minister breaks?
