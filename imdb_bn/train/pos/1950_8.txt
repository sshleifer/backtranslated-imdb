Diane Keaton has played some "heavy" parts on the big screen for several years, but he is known for most of the "light and sculptor" elements of Woody Allen like Anne Hall. For this endeavor, she earned an Oscar for a great actress and it really does not matter what it was in the first year of the competition. Try and find a scene where he does not exist. And it's all heavy drama, tired of its speed and retakes, actions, all at full speed. Make-up makes him as young as possible and even closes it at the age of 30 seconds, but he is half his age and plays at a very fast pace. The movie was overall fairly good, staged and carry a good shot but Keaton load with a strong supporting cast.
