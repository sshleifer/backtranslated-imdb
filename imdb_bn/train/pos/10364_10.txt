Lindsey (Merrill Strip) and her husband Michael (Sam Neil) just welcomed a girl daughter Azaria. As a Seven Day Adventist, they live their faith every day and soon dedicate their two elderly children to the God of their church. Michael gets a holiday and family Aire Rock, one of Australia's most attractive tourist spots, makes the leading decision. The family camp near the site, being not rich. After a wonderful first day, Lindi kept the baby Azeria to sleep in the tent. Suddenly he heard the tears of Aziziyar. Like Lindi gets hit in the tent, the Dingo dog shakes his head. The baby is gone and so soon, so is Dingo. Although the whole camp shows for the child, he could not be found. She died and Dingo closed with her favorite child, Chamberlines struggled to take God's decision and to walk with their life. But, unfortunately, this story gets exciting coverage of the news media and soon this story is broadcast that Lindy was murdered. He was later arrested and tried. How could it be? How could it be? This is a great screenplay of real events that shows how "public governance" is not a symptom. The entire country becomes against Chamberlain because they seem weird. The Strip never gives its best performance like complex Lindy, whose own strong will will work against every step of its way. Neill, likewise, makes an excellent job as hesitant and confusing Michael. Caste is one of the most popular, in the case of Lindi, people screenplay people all over the country. All tops of clothing, visual, script, direction and production lines. If you do not see or hear this movie, then resolve it directly. It is not much cry from the fact that those "action" movies and media related abusive power should be seen by all who care about them.
