Anyone can say this bad is beyond me. I liked this show before I even saw it. 3 reasons, 1. The story has curious me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Ignore bad comments and please see the whole first season. If you know that if you see the first season before it gets worse, then you will like it and buy Season 1 as well as Season 2 DVD and then join the Campaign to create session 3! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox, and I'm sure you hate many "dark angel" fans too. They have a thing for Canning better show! Do you all agree?
