Before playing a minor role before friendship, Belushi was the most loyal and courtney cox. I often think Buluchi is used under Hollywood and the role of this movie is its best. For those who are watching his TV show, this is a very different and favorite character. The film itself does not dissociate the world, it is sweet and respectful, not a new message. The familiar face and unfamiliar names supporter can be a perfect balance, although the lavish screams can become tedious, and if Michael Keain's impressive spiritual guidance is not meaningful then it is a little harmful. Hamilton, the wife of Belusi, was unfortunately two-dimensional and why she married him. In addition, Rene Russo has been lost and is not afraid of "queen like". Yet, there is a wonderful way to spend two hours.
