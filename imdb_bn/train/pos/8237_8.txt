For my life, why did this film get a rating?! Although it is about meat eating zombie, do not believe it, it's actually a beautiful family-friendly movie - if your kids are 10 years old and younger. Contrary to the traditional Jumbo film, it has a wonderful idea as well as a traditional standard - though a bit rolled up! The language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and the film style must be focused on the kids (like the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - still some fake titles rated it a rating! Believe me, most kids show such bad violence and the viewers think that it's just as an adult movie that seems shameless. <br /> <br /> The story is set in a parallel-typed world. Fashion, cars and moms appeared in the year 1953, in this odd world there is a fiercely recent zombie plug that has resulted in "zombie war" and the daily life has changed greatly. At school, children are trained in armed wars and late scenes are seen in which the father hammers his son and says "OK"! As life outside the school, as well as it's fantastic weird, people now learned that zombies are not such a bad thing! Using hacks, shock collars and training, they can be made into slaves who can supply your home, cleaning roads, milk, or be your "special friend" in the case of a really sick person. <br /> <br /> This film is managed by a special family that eventually buys their first Zambi slaves (played Billy Conley). The mother was delighted and her boy gradually became the friend of zombie. Dad, on the other hand, does not believe - he was forced to kill his own father's father, and he has not yet insisted on it !! Funny, overwhelming and unique - this film needs to be seen by a more comprehensive audience.
