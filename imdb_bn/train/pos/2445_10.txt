I really like this show. For this reason, I was frustrated to learn recently that George Lopez was a racist, and he shot Messila Lusha to Shoke, because he discovered that he was not a Latino immigrant, but he was an immigrant from Albania. I learned from this show people. He was actually one of the better parts of the show, and thus, you can learn that those of you who feel that can be sensitive to racism, because of the country they were born, they could hate anyone because of depressing.
