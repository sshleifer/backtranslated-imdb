I think the film is educational. However, it failed to solve the problem that has caused many debates: plural marriage. Also, the film reveals what the privacy of the LDS Church reveals. The big chance they were actually missed was to tell the world what to believe. I do not have a clear idea of ​​the LDS's opinion on the central issues of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many LDS friends and they are excellent people. They became beautiful to get a clear picture of how they saw more controversial statements of their prophet. Maybe it is very controversial to treat these statements in a film format, but it was great to hear the story of Joseph Smith's true interesting life. After all, it gave insight into American thought over religion in the 18th century. I hope they will make some documentary on this interesting topic, which allows historians to comment on Smith's life. We might be a Mormon President some day. After all, Smith ran for the President.
