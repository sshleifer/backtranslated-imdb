I think this film many years ago. Of course my experience must of course the best movies Soon after that I remember so much of the film that it proved its effect. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on performance level without language barriers. But they were still very strong. <br /> <br /> This issue has fascinated us for years. And it was most effectively treated here with the historical aspect and the appropriate proportion of suspects. <br /> <br /> I will show at least once on TV. Or at least tape or DVD can be found. Or is it? Some art film archives make it a hoarding copy ??
