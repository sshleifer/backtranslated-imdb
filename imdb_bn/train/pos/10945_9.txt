The best show from Seinfeld. She really is really fun. Its total self-centering, scary gay studio neighbor, song or cartoon exit, makes it the newest show on TV. Some looks like I see the points. The sight of an intelligent old lady in the drug store ("Oh wait now that you are going to get off you look old", turns the face and turns away), cough syrup is too much, sleeping with God, it's all fun or so stupid It's just a lot of fun. The show weak points his sister and the police only because they are very normal !! I can not really wait until the next show, a program that I have not felt for a long time.
