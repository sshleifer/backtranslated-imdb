This is a great film - SP when compared with today's politically-minded film makers with intense sincerity. A movie that can combine sex, sex, politics and art so easily is annoying at these days. Although the bout optimism of the 1960s can not be reversed, I think we can learn the radio and radio from the film at least. I do not know who saw the movie as "boring" - they have so many packs that it will not be in the same movie for more than 15 minutes at a time.
