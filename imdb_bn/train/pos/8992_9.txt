A really cool flick. Must have a music snob. You really do not know about the band to enjoy the movie. Before the movie, I only heard two songs of Dandy Warhols. The only thing needed is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The image is located near the massacre of Brian Jonestown. Danny Warhol's role plays role as 'Rival Band', but it is the second step for the BJM. Dandy Warhols basically did not play a major role as a role in movies, but again, their BGM's tensions and unpredictable components were not. You can not help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic front man, Anton Newcombe. In itself, it is an insightful film and music industry research. Just watch this film and enjoy it.
