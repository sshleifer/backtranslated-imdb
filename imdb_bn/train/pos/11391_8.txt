A showcase by an American gene kelly in Paris. See songs as genes, dance and dance on his way through Paris in any situation. Some purely royal, others pure corn. Kelly was created, only imagined that she made this movie "Singin in the Rain" a year ago. He definately is one of the great all the time. Seeing the similarity between the two films is interesting, especially in Kelly's letters, the only major difference that is located in Paris, someone else. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Leslie Carn's performance was less than pure. Perhaps Syd Charis, who was largely adapted for this role, could have done better, but Caron is very credible in the role and chemistry with Kelly. The Oscar Levant's small role in this film only added its necessity, which nobody looks like a genuine Kelly. Filling the role as a public is not an easy task, but Levant has done it with many classes as any other lead. <br /> <br /> Complete perfection of songs and dance routines. Even at the end of the film, the extra-long ballet produces a good film with it. For example, seeing that there was not really a lot of screen time to be faithful to a loving relationship, Minnieli used this sequence to think that you spent four hours with them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have to rate this movie with Singin, because it is similar to stories and songs. Because of the Debbie Reynolds Uplifting performance, 'Singin' will rarely be found. <br /> <br /> Full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
