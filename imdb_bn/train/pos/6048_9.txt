What a bit of British movie bits! It's about time. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The film is moving fast and does not allow you to leave for a long time ... Sometimes there are reactionary moments, but I think they are well connected and add acting portraits. I was initially concerned with the character of Phil Daniele but thankfully won more than half In the most fun scenes of the whole movie, I usually find myself belly around some of the people who have been bored through a boring movie film. Oh well. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it perfectly. It became a ritualistic British comedy. Worth of view
