When people ask me why I like so much movies, I usually respond, "Did you see De Palma's dress-up art gallery gallery?" That scene alone, mostly represents what I want to see in a film. If I was a film director, the kind of work I would like to do would be. The "Piere Cinema" is one way to describe this sequence, and it's really nice to see how the whole movie of Director de Palma works in the same high artistic frequency of that scene. It's a dream-like film, tricky like hell, and with more intelligence and intelligence than a dozen movies. I think the movie raises an important issue that will always be a topic of hot discussion: Is a film simply based strategically and can still be considered an artistic success? There is no message to talk about the film, the acting is great, but it is a short on script style, and script rationality. The film of de Palma really makes a good case that when the style is managed properly, it can maintain a feature length movie. Of course, Michael Kain, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon have done a great acting, but this directorial movie is all the way to fadeout. This is an exciting exhibition of the potential of filmmakers. Hitkoch does not encourage any film in the film (I do not want to hide any wonder), but I think De Palma crossed the cycle of the story, and she guides to create a movie that most of her career shortens. . Not for the faint heart!
