When I was 4 years old, I used to see this picture with my friends, but the strange thing is that I have never seen it later. The other day I was a kid and my cousins ​​never saw a dog going to the dog, so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really liked these movies. Many memories came again to see this movie again and I admitted that I even cried a little bit. I'm 22 years old and still gets me. All dogs go to heaven is one of the most sensitive animated movies and I am truly disappointed by this rating of 5.8, I thought the film would bring back good memories for others. I accept the animation as a little bit, but the story is so charming and funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Charlie wanted to take revenge, he returned to the world with a clock that would not last. Can not do or his life ends. When he and his best friend, Ichi, search for Corfaces and spy on them, they know how the curfews gets all its money, he has a small orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win. Charlie takes the girl, Anne-Marie, and gives false answers to get the money. But he is learning that Curses will bring Anne-Marie in front of him before returning to his revenge. <br /> <br /> All dogs will go to heaven, family of the family, not Disney, but it is a nice family film to see. It does not mention that it's just so tricky and touching. I know it ridicules and some people called me crazy, but for me this movie has a dog spirit that believes in me when I was a kid. How could they? They are just so loving, and I think I'm going to cry again. But anyway, I'll recommend this movie for just anyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
