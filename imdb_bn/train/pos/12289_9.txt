After all, I want to indicate that I did not read the book, so in this perspective I had no chance to be frustrated. The biggest mistake I have seen, including most cars, trains, clothes, etc. was historical details, I think there is no connection with that time. <br /> <br /> *** Probable spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the movie is fine, there is nothing to say about it. But acting, I think, was horrible. I have no experience in acting, yet I can not believe that people can consider this terrible! Maybe they just watched two movies (ever), and another must have lived very well! <br /> <br /> I especially like Jeremy Irons, and really understand his character, anyone who shows up the social ladder. With very hard work, then fighting against those who will live her life, she is so involved in this war, she does not realize that she does not have anymore, and she ends a deadly, frustrated man. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also a romantic young girl, who is attracted to revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend. , He was an intrinsic part, I think), and Glenn was very good off. Merrill Strip's average performance was not bad, it was not bad to the other actors. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Contrary to today's movies, only explanations here are only people, but at the same time, this is not a humiliation, see it for Miguel Guillaume. The movie, trying to be intellectual, is very worried. I prove it really good, I write a review after 7 years.
