The title got my attention and then I thought what would happen in the plot, as we saw many "super-guy" movies in these years ... and in fact, I really liked it because there were so many unusual scenes that I did not expect. Uma Thurman plays the role of G-Girl as the average. Surprisingly, I again saw a wide screen on its screen (like the beginning of the bill bill). Louis Wilson, although he met the cats very well, played the innocent daily person, I could really read in his situation. If you want to touch the light light, of course you must definitely watch your girlfriend and average matte events, especially to encourage your partner. 7/10 of my collection
