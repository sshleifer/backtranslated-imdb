The first sequel Melodrammata is a small film shot in black and white, but the German director has been able to increase the lines of tired story in some similar art. Set in the 1910s, Barbara Stanwick left her husband and family in her small town for the greed of the Chicago Stage. He never met his ambition and wrote a letter from his daughter that he also liked the theater (which is a high school production). Returning to his old town, he again comes up against a childhood, and has to deal with the elder daughter of his opponent, (and annoying) husband (Richard Carlson) and former lover. The plot is not new, but each frame of the SQK carefully sets aside its meaningful compositions by shots and stamps Stenwake as its leading lady. It runs a Christmas in 76 minutes, and it is exactly the same, because the material can not actually fall.
