I am fascinated with the curiosity (yellow) and the companion piece with great trepidation I approached. I would like to read numerous reports about his widely controversial debate and explicit sex. I did not have what I got, but any other completely worried and excited movie experience. I sincerely believe that most commentators of the film saw 'Lam' or 'boring' as a pornography film. Perhaps it is pornography, pornography speculation, but to deliberately non-boyfriend. Lena, the hero, her performance gives her all a realistic and humanity that is simply believable and lasting. Her breasts may be saggy, her nipples are unusually large, fat in her thighs, and her face, chubby. But at the end of the film, the audience gets acquainted with him and his errors are accepted by the people. This tactic gives its even more credibility to the requirements. If the director attacked a Brigade Baradot bomb, the effect was canceled. I can not recommend this thought provoking piece more. This deliberately paced film should be ready to invest a lot thinking. Patients and stupid observers who can show other movies in dreams will be fully rewarded.
