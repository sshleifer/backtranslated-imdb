When compared to bond movies, when the performance of the bosans in real James Bond novels has become more realistic, it is more interesting. She is a woman for neurotic, paranoid, alcohol and a boot. This is a perfect break for her, even to make the bond icon fun. "I'm a mess, a parody of myself," he says. It's not better than that. I am just I have finished reading and Ian Flaming portrays James Bond. Personally, I did not like Brodn as a bond because he fits the icon very closely. She had nothing to do to make her character private than Roger Moore or Shan Connai. Brosnan is great to see Ground and Flamboyantly play a character both off the wall in reality. A shallow character with whom he is trying to understand deep deep mental and emotional problems related to a background. This is an impressive illustration, and Greg Kinear is just poetic, having her on the ground. This movie reminds me of the dynamics among the main characters of "My Blue Heaven", but more true in their coping processes.
