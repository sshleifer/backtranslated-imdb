I can not see a movie without film styling these days, much like Dougma, Lars von, Watchsky Brothers, what we hope for in a movie has changed, perhaps, Casamai is an independent non-American film, the movie is all cinema assets And to give us a simple history about love and marriage in language, but more .. Completely Tamata, speech and thought ... and I'm sure you, you're not 116-minute-long fell a second more. 3 and 2 1/2 minutes that I do not have a single view that's counted.
