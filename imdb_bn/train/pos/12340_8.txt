There is actually a lot to complain about Molner's version of the movie's mysterious game - Pharrell likes his title role, but his line readings are obviously fragile. It also suffers most of the time, from which it has been paid as the first film, which uses the projection of the back. The set cap shows up. <br /> <br /> There are two great powers in this show, but the dialogue text is tall but the visual performance is perfect. Rose Hubert as Julie is remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, of which Joseph Colonel Bonario programmers simply threw into his shots: Originally the stylish visual aspect of Credit Mefford Her amazing looks and simple (though staging) performance helps to damage some of the damage to the Earth-bound sections of this film. <br /> <br /> Boisej's theme is the mysterious power of love, and it is the management of astronautical departments by the arrival of the Galaxy Train to the 'Hot Place'. H.B. Here Warner's performance is always perfect. <br /> <br /> So we have a flawed but very interesting version here. I think Lang's version 1934 is good, as well as the skyline scene of the remake of the vaseed down-down musical instrument in Henry King edition of Carousel. But I still enjoy this version and think you have to give it a chance.
