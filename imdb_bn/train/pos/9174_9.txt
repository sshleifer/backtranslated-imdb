Jane Eyre has many movies and TV productions that are in their recommendation points, but I suspect that people will still fall in love for this decade and fall in love. It is simply a classic (and many more stories than others offer). Timothy Dalton Rochester as his element is completely, very rarely missing the mark; Its performance is surprisingly weird and stratifying far away from many colorful, character dark complexes. Jella Clark Jane is more than one brain, but Dalton (who, appropriately, towers on her!) Creates a perfect foil for her. His performance perspective is better in the second view (once you've absorbed Shakes in Dalton's charisma.) Some technical flaws and a few moments where production values ​​may be good; Although this period was mostly a top-of-the-line production of BBC standards. However, it is a real pleasure that performances. Do not miss this one!
