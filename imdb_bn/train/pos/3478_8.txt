This was actually my favorite series of Scooby Doo when I was small. I had more of an edge on each episode than it was and Villain had many creative ideas for them (and even as very scary and credible). Some of the best episodes were "I left my throat in San Francisco", "Twenty Thousand Scorms Under the Sea", "Ghawl, The Bat and the Augle" and "You Wish Upon A Star Crayer" Please do not see these episodes. This series was a bit of a mixed bag, although the other episodes did not seem to have the same edge to them as "Rocky Mountain Yi!" And "the price of the head of the scuba chief". Like before the series, it was well kept together, interesting stories and brilliantly drawn. As everyone says, so much better than Scrappy Doo. The character was tedious and the story was going to be called.
