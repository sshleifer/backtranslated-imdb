I want to see a lot of folks on this site wishing to come out of DVD AG. Well, I bought the DVD. (From the border, not the least!) Even though this great display is a fantastic display in a bbCCD DVD form, but I am "additional" (its director of Shawn Cassidy's pilot episode) and the episodes are shown in the same sequence so that they are kept on the TV. The missing parts not appearing before running on the sign-in channel are in the box set but the final DVD is playing. If you have purchased a DVD set then you can see the actual order and you will be more happy. (You will need to switch your player in and out of the DVD to see them, but you will be happy.) <br /> <br /> S
