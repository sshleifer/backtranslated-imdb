We all make our own reality, or do we? This is the main question behind this very original and skillfully tested test of a truly delusional nature. M. C. Combining eastern and Buddhist philosophies with its visual contemporary Escher, this fascinating book, 'Who are we and our place in the universe?' Instead of being directed to take cerebral questions, and it turned into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minutes. The film is the center of Bert's film, which is struggling with its scrapplaces, 'The Sea Secrets Things'. While sitting on a computer, nothing can be seen except for the details of his sitting on the computer, the writing of the screenplay started. Long ago he was stuck in a rolling conductor, which became the reality of everything he wrote. Director Gart de Graf stepped in to his subject with a vague sense of humor and dazzled with a series of spectacular visual tactics that face the views and views of the audience. Finally, De Graff's film challenges the audience at various levels and asks whether we see or touch or taste what really happened, or our complete understanding of the universe and our place in it is simply a technique driven by us.
