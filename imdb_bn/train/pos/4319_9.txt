After the second viewing of this movie, I loved it the first time. It is a very common and often horrible life as perception and an appreciation of life that rarely leads this film to the height it focuses on the small events of our lives, which we usually offer the shortest offer of attention spans. Here to celebrate this event, a tower trucker and client's meeting, listening to a child's tears from poker bush. Dialogue, acting, welding and direction gorgeous No two quarters, no grand revelations. What I saw was how true the character of their original nature and how true their life was at the time they were celebrated. For all those involved, we need more "Grand Canyon" in our lives. 10 out of 9
