"The Woman in Black" is easily one of the greatest British ghost stories ever. After a dead solicitor reached a small town to manage the client's property of the deceased, a black-haired woman was scared for fear. The image is loaded. The ruthless atmosphere and fears are counted and provide the most effective effect. The action keeps the audience deeply involved and the last is quite annoying. Acting is excellent and tension is almost helpless. So if you want to see the real horror movie, give it a view. I dare to look at the "black woman" alone at night in the night. Very rarely 10 out of 10 recommendations were made.
