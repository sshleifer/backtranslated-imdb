By my stand, Verne and Teddy have discussed that the solid, superman or strong mouse. My friends and I often discuss those who will win in the war. Sometimes we are unreasonable and compare guys like MacGyver and Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems we've discussed things like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a pointless comparison which Lee is seeing dead, but it's a fun one. If you go to what we saw from Leethal 4 and Black Mask Jet Li, you would have to say at least that he will match well against Chan. In this film he came across as a martial art. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are inexplicable in some ways. Now the premiere for this movie, but all the amazing dancers who set up the fight scenes set. <br /> <br /> Jet Lee is a wonderful event. Any human that he and he can do with his body should be able to. <br /> <br /> In addition to martial arts in the film Black Mask is firm with humor and due to chemistry, its co-star, the police officer. They are great together. But be honest. If someone is reading this review, they want to know if this film is taking away the donkey in the Action section. And that answer is a great YES !!! Lots of lots and lazy stupid actions. You will love this picture.
