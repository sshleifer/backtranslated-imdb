I wrote this article after seeing The Perfect Gold of Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia in 2002. <br /> <br /> When their father dies, two unhappy brothers serve the funeral and after the discovery, the brothers are dying of AIDS, they enter a heart warming journey for reunion. Two developments have done a great job of generating respect for gradual warmth and film progress. Although I have a joke about the movie - although the brother is sick when he is dead, he does not see it. A person of 0 T4 cell will become very sick - the actor can not even get a job to feel sick. A small gripe, but that makes it a little less realistic. Even after a little grip, The Perfect Sona is a wonderful movie and you have the chance to see it - do it. I hope to release a DVD in the future!
