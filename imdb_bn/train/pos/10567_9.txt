A surprise. One of the best musical instruments ever. The three Bebly Berkley numbers of the film's ending are spectacular, but the film is so surprising that the incredible non-stop patter and the natural performance of Cognizant and Blondel. (Kepler is very beautiful, though she may not be a great actress). There is an innovation in the movie that you can not see today, usually very few of the 30 films, though the plot involved in the film progress is quite date.
