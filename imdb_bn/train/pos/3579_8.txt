Stone Boy The almost forgotten drama of the 1980s Considering how famous or famous person should be in the film, one wonders how it can be so ignored. It is a gradual, moody, but a sensitive account of a tragedy that damages a farm family. This movie is less or less compliant with Mid Western Standards and emotional suppression. The film will not be for all the taste, but anyone who can appreciate the true human drama should consider it right. <br /> <br /> At the very beginning of the photo, we see two brothers picking some peas in the morning and they are lucky if a poultry or two shoots. When climbing through a curved wire fence, accidentally shoot guns and small boy fatally shoot his big brother. These boys obviously have not taken a predatory safety course. Two people will have to go through a fence with a gun properly: the first man climbs. The second man then passed the gun through him fence. Then the first man set down the gun and helped another through fences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is still not running for help after shooting his brother. He goes ahead and likes the pea and then tells his family about the accident. Arnold can not express any sadness or sadness at any time during the funeral or investigation. His family seems to stop him. Perhaps they also angry him for the murder of his brother. An ornate uncle, directed by Frederick Forest, is disturbed with Arnold, though the death of the older brother allows him to hit a child's girlfriend. Arnold's parents do not understand how to deal with their son. They really do not try to talk to him. He can only contact the person with his grandfather, who usually played Wilford Breamley with the grandfather. After some time, Arnold also went with the old timer. <br /> <br /> Anaerald can not open until Reno Nevada is curiously traveling to a strange road to show his uncle's ex-wife. Once she meets her, the family comes out of her shell by apologizing for breaking the marriage by starting the turmoil with the family. From here, film reconciliation and reconciliation becomes a quick study. <br /> <br /> In most cases acting fiercely distant Robert Duval and Glenn Close's perfect stoic farm parents. Forrest is good, but Hood Paul is trying very hard for Newman's performance channel. Cinematography is exceptional, too. If you like Moody Pictures about the general public, it might be for you. Some may even be advised to bring some tissues. 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Hound.
