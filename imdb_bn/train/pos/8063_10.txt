This amazing Oscar winner (total 4) and John Ford's first Academy Award winner, only spelled with a pounding score of Max Steiner. An art film was called, because of Ford's crime and revenge, and this great story about greed and stupidity was very little money. But this film makes such a classic, it's direction and wonderful photography and the use of fog and illumination that is different from ordinary American films and more in the tradition of German publications. And the Oscar winner performance by Victor McLaglen as Alcoholic Gypo is incredible. Originally this movie was held in Ireland, and Jipo turned a friend into a rebel movement in English to collect his girlfriend Â£ 20. But because of all this money, he started getting drunk in the night and the leaders of the movement were trying to track the information. The whole movie is a night of dark night and a festive Ireland night and a custom of memories that is memorable, but above all, the whole world of the jeep is mentally closed in it. If I had the choice of taking three directors all their films on a secluded island forever and not a boy, John Ford would surely be one of them. What a really great movie ...
