I have never seen a baby, so it is seen in new eyes. I never heard of it and hired it for my 5 year old girl. Plus, the idea of ​​singing and dancing to Christopher Walken's song makes me weird. Special FX is cheesy and singer and dance medium. But the story is great. My daughter was entranced. I like watching Walken in this role, thinking about what kept me in the future. It was so much fun to see him! And if the songs are not great, at least they are not much of the sakarein produced by Disney. The Ogre scene was initially a little scary for him, and in the end we were a bit annoyed at seeing him again, but it was mostly modest. Interestingly, we recently read "Pus in Boots", and I was surprised by the uncertainty of the story. But while having almost every aspect true, Walken's acting made it credible. Great pleasure I would like to see it again with my daughter.
