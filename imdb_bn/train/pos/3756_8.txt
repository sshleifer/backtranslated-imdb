Just ten years after the actual events and set in bunkers under the Rakhastag, Puddt's film is completely clothed. It revives Sulfur's death in waiting for the war criminals of the world. It has not been seen for three decades, but it is strong in my visual and emotional memory. The letters seem to be walled up in their cave. Something between the two generals seems to be: "Does God exist?" "If he does, we do not." It is not easily available for the exhibition or purchase because it is interesting to see and compare this movie with trudele janz, "I Totten Winkle" {ur "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary") and a documentary about "Downfall" with Bruno.
