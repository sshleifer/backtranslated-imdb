This movie is great for making Spirits exquisite. <br /> <br /> Every time I see it, I see and hear some of the fun things that I missed before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible. Mike Jones (Foreign) and Chris Deford (Switzerland) wrote the song, created Strange Fruit, which hit today's music scene. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the strange result was not good to start, due to the strictness of the 60's 70's and 70's bands that started the drug and internal war. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fruit member is quite memorable. Stephen Ray is dead and deadly broken Tony Costello, who asked a festival promoter to restart his revision visit, hoping to reduce financial benefits. Castello has played Juliet Oberoi, former street Karen Knolls, who helped to revive his dream flame for a long time. <br /> <br /> Whiskey Whalley Whirlwind Whitelist Jimmy Neale (Les Wisse) David 'Vayano' Bagat), and unusually glamorous ray sims (Bill Nayyigi). Huipi (Billy Connolly), who did not let the Globe-Ticker-Jostar Hilie (Billy Connolly) burn a fire. On the other hand, Juliet searched for the ultimate band of her totale band. Guitarist-songwriter Brian Lauvall (played by Bruce Robinson), re-established members, like the old times, compete with each other a bad competition. <br /> <br /> The band is then given the opportunity to take a small Dutch tour, ready for the festival. Like the young Hendrix-like Look Shand (Hans Mattason) Lowell's place, crew hit the street. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .
