Arnest Marcisco, one of the most respected Austrian directors of that time, made films with beautiful scenery, fine love, and respect for the precious people of life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, if people hear about him, they add Markaska to SISSI Trilogy (1955, 1956, 1957). However, he has created other excellent films such as the Das Drymaderlah (1958), Mbjjelded Hewen (1958) and apparently, the Queen of Victoria, Queen Christine, showed the young ones. Although it is related to a slightly different theme than SISSI movies, I can not see much difference between this movie and SISSI. They are suddenly the same. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost identical. Style, music, photography In fact, crew is almost the same. Anton Professor, Bruno Mandi! <br /> <br /> Cast ... the first major role of the Romi skinny. This picture was made a year before the first part of the triangle about the Austrian emperor since it was a lovely role in his role in Cincinnati. This is a movie where Romi played with his mother, Magda Scendor. But Arnest Marcisco is not the first director who played Rommy with his mother. Romi's first debut, Win Dare Wise Fledder, Willier Bluhan (1953), also had her acting with her mother. Therefore, there were some voices that Rami started his Austrian career on his mother's fame. In fact, there is some truth in it. <br /> <br /> Again, like SISSIA, this photo shows love very slowly. To showcase a small Sunday Prince of Albert in Victoria Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure height of dance and gentle smile. And now ...? What would it look like? Just sex ... but is love based solely on love? <br /> <br /> I appreciate Arnest Marcika for these films. They had a spirit and a message. Some people can call their kitschy, but I do not have to leave admiring these films. They are responsive !!! Unexpectedly, too much!
