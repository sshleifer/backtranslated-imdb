I never heard of this movie, it saw the DVD. Great movie, this is a perfect example of a film that takes every cast member to work on it. An old Hollywood movie does not have the same old overhead actors. An existing quote "A" list exceeds any performance in this movie. Military experience of the Vietnam War remembers the memories of my own post. It focused on the people sent for war. These were portrayed by some characters, who had fear and emotions while volunteering for some services. They were regular people, some were not just living for military life, in my experience some people remember - it can not cope with neutral military life - but I will never forget them - at the touch, in the touch. I highly recommend and think of presenters in Afghanistan today. A trip to Basic Training, notice that the drill sergeants do not have people in the morning and maybe they need "sensitivity training"! HA! HA!
