A disgusting person disappointed about a male hustler in New York City was forced to live in a reprehensible building. The extremely relentless test of modern day moral and social decline, John Schlesinger (who did not top it here) has done very well and played John Voight and Dustin Hoffman. A punch pauses almost but still "visual" scenes - which are played for some shiny - lightly infiltrating, such as "mode" drug party. The relationship between the two men is emotional, but the filmmakers should be careful not to be mushrik, and the edge of the film may not be less than the shellsinger. Originally the X-ray in 1969, and Oscar winner of the best picture; Screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted the book of James Leo Herily) and won the sculpture statue. **** to ****
