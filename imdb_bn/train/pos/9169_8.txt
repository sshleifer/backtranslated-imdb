I loved Timothy Dalton very much though he was a young man and was very handsome for Mr., but I thought Jela Clark was too thick and small. However this version was very true and well-liked in the novel. I have seen 4 editions, Osros Welles is still my favorite, and George C Scott was very good, and it was tossed between Joan Fontaine and Susanah York, though they were too old for both roles. I recently saw a brilliant TV version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I want to see those two Jane Eyrei. When I saw the version of Sierren Hinds, I thought I was out of Zen Zen, but I would never be tired of the first few minutes before listening to the voice of Joan Fontaine. The first version I ever saw. I always want to go back and read the book again.
