This is a family movie, which automatically closes some people. It seems that many people do not want to see pictures that are not loaded with enough pain to meet the failures of arms and legs, unwanted violence and New York phone book. This film is not anyone who is. It is clich√©, it's formula, but it's fun. It does not ask you to think, it does not claim that you accepted this movie as a reality. It ought to duty only to do a good film, which is willingly postpone the mistrust for two hours and enjoy the adventure. Throwing is nice, while not nice. As another commentator, John Williams's score was fixed as usual, as usual. And in the real-space camp Huntville, this movie was shot in many ways making it more believable. It was violent that the original release of the film was delayed due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which played a major part in its original dramatic opening, but the film finally focused on the space of many young people and its possible possibilities. Please. So get ready to sit back and enjoy with your kids.
