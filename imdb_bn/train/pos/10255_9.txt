This movie is the first of six notorious Guinea Pig films and it is the best. At the same time, it seems to be realistic and unrealistic, knowing that the movie is fake. This story is about a woman who has been caught and tortured in different ways. At the beginning of the story a man gets a letter without a return address, and it includes a manga video, showing torture. Those who hold her are trying to limit the human limit before death. Some scenes are frustrating, such as jaw scenes and others suddenly do not hit the girl 100 times, because you see the Panch in almost every movie. There are so many people in this movie, so I recommend this to people 17 or older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
