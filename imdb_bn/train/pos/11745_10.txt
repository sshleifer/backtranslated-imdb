See if you have a chance to see these pictures. It is quite frustrating in part and really makes you think about many important things but it is not doactic. In my opinion, it is a piece of art ... beautifully portrayed, fine-grained music from many styles, the impressive level of expected performance from the BBC drama. Nathali Press (billed as 'Natali' Press) is asserted as a depressed teenager absorbed by a male classmate. Celia Imrie gives that nicely assured quality that sometimes unqualified action stability and the viewer's comfort is actually 'normal' outside anyone, but as a true star always gives Timothy Spell - certainly the best actor of our time!
