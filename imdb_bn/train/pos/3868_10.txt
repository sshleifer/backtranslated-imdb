<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very different from the trash we got sadly. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, credible and playful Easter Kahn. Everything else in this movie, its acting is unique - it's completely self-made - not "British" or "American" or which I have never seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
