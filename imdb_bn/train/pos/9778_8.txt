It is a triangle in the stories of "energy", "goddess" and "kali" about an experimental commute (or something) called the Taylor-Ericsson Group, which leads people to travel in and within the region. Unknown, and left here and there a bit of damage, I'd say. Many years later some of that damage are still hidden and waiting for the right moment to show themselves. Power tells the story of a woman whose husband had been mysteriously died, in fact, she was separated, and there was a suspect who might not have existed. It seems that this woman is capable of projecting some internal monster, or finds a sister when she tries to talk to this woman by pledging her as a journalist. Goddess tells the story of a young man who "jump out of his skin" He is sent to see a skinhead, a speed-time, and a psychologist who is a former member of this commune, so a good doctor helps young people to understand his desire. This is probably the best of three categories. Calli is the story of a healing, who tries to "cure" this part of this woman and let go of any kind of giant living in this woman, but one wonders if she does it or if she releases it, it can survive in it. No These three stories are quite awesome and suspicious because you are not really sure what you can hope for, and the premiere and settings are so different from the usual horror movies that it adds to the oddity. It has a very low budget look and feel, but it's mostly done to measure a fantastic strange atmosphere for its achievement. I saw it with a good part hanging open with my face and when real scares (and gore) comes in it's pretty hard to hit. I found it a very interesting and annoying film and it liked a lot. Looking a little better, this one, I'll give it 10 out of 10.
