This is a film that I can keep an eye on and never get tired, lots of laughter, guns, action, crime, a fishing boat, and an appropriate plot, a rather playful role in Assasain in the top Donald Switterland. Tia Carrara looks hot like her and can act very well, Thomas Ian Griffin plays FBI agent, carrier for Dia Agent Diane, and John Lithgow from Fertiyear, bad guy, "Livingstone", on TV, as the great character "Max". The conspiracy centers around Max and Dine are trying to keep Livingstone and they dispute with each other for getting money for their respective organizations, Assassain Sutherland, who puts in a good mix of all the best fisheries, is the perfect crime copper, the usual love story, But you've played it very differently than Carerra and Griffith would think. Here is a mix of your Russian mafia, Italian mafia and sugar mafia, it is shot in Boston, where you have some great shots and local people, great photography and music in this film, this movie is just an episode of crime comedy, can it ever There is everything. A special view, see Sutherland's toilet, is very unusual. This image is a riot and you will smile 10 plus real hard for me.
