Rate this as one of the top 10 movies of my favorite time in this movie. Many have seen it for the first time and know very little about most of the themes in the movie. I probably do not understand why I think it is so exciting, so I will try to explain ... <br /> <br /> There is plenty of rich in historical detail and cultural insight , And when it contains some small anonisisms, they are completely forgiving. The story revolves around the famous conflict between Monk Benckey and young Prince Yoshitsun in the Gokko Bridge. During the Battle of Legend Yoshishun, Benkei became loyal to the monk during the war and the monk Rajkumar. This film includes the revision and war, dark prediction and political intervention of the story. <br /> <br /> One of the main things in the movie is Buddha's prediction which will fail for 1000 years of his education and will fall into chaos. After Mount Fuji bloomed and after the civil war between Teyra (Heike) and Minnamoto (Jane), Hian Japan believed that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would fall. It's a time of giants. <br /> <br /> You have a way of resolving that the shooting of the movies is resolved by Karuma's Tinku (Renay Gobins). The defeated tribes often run into the mountains and disguise themselves as ghosts to scare the locals. It is said that Nizwa tribes were historically started. Yoshitsune's paintings in Goose are well-adjusted. <br /> <br /> Then there are different trends of Benkei and Buddhism, along with many clan Buddhist religions of the Shangdan community. All of these are properly illustrated and only to add a little extra, the film moves to reflect the power of meditation and the power in ways that make this story integral, that is, it uses the magic reality to add an extra dimension. The picture however, makes it strategic and appealing to do so. <br /> <br /> It is always interesting to fill interesting and amazingly real life for the time. The scenery and costuming are also completely unmissable and very authentic. The soundtrack is great, very brooding and evil. I thought that the original performance performance was amazingly good. Bennki is a great anti-hero hero, Shanao (Isisitsun), who is depicted as a drunk on his own strength to test his limits and his own power, and Tetsukichi harmful Talwar-Smith creates interesting and interesting illustrations for "ordinary people" and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, why look so good, I really see you dig old books in Japanese history and see T. How this retailing turns into a story of Little John often made heartbreaking Robin Hood a proud story of conspiracy, violence and hell work.
