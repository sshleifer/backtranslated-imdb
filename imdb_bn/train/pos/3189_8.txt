This is one of the best allied comedy / musical "B" movies I have seen (and I am now 40 and I have seen it now, I am not an expert but I have seen all known movies there). For a minute when the actors lead them for a few minutes, usually interfere with comedy musical bits and often the musical instruments prevent the comedic flow. Call me in an insane mood but when I saw it in TCM Europe, I started to laugh loudly! Then who laughs for me? Without a doubt, Misery Oure laughs me a little bit horrible, even stealing till the end, it was very good! Not talking, I think why this movie works because L & H is a selling point though (and why I got to see it (and their rooftop), I love them in their early roles in Roach stuff), it keeps them at the lowest And Adult Rent (according to the 1930s decade, and if you fall into the line, not far from today's standards) from the square. Jack Helio is very good to see, I admit that I know only from him and Ozz and I love him there, and I'm laughing at his Waiter Bill at the show. Paty Kelly is the only "ugly" woman in 30 films that actually activates me (some saying she was an explosive in real life); And the number of musical instruments is the actual professional production (Bebie Berkeley's) quality, which has pushed me away from using this section. I could go over and rest assured, but I really enjoyed this movie. Of the 10 out of 10 I have seen TCM in Europe and TCM will record to meet my wife again in the United States. Good thing
