Come to Pinjar from a completely different background than the other critics I've posted here. I am relatively new to Bollywood and born in the United States. So I do not have a broad base to compare pingers to other Indian films. Thankfully, no comparisons are needed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Movies any time in the studio at any time. On the mass-appeal scale, it could be equivalent to Indian "Crocking Tiger, Hidden Dragon", it was well-publicized in the United States. It is very good that the movie has kept Bollywood on the American map. The public of American film has a long-standing love relationship with "the wind in the air", and when the Pingers do not take loans from that plot, some differences are mixed. A compulsory human drama of a young man set up on the opposite side of partition of India-Pakistan in 1932-48. Under the circumstances, he had no hands made in prison and pressed into troubles. Put it in an unstable position, he can not survive in any way, but it can grow - even grow. <br /> <br /> If the story is lacking in any way, it is publicly known. As a person, the picture of old (dramatist) growth will be better illustrated - at least for Western audiences who are unfamiliar with Indian culture - if their character "backstory" develops more fully in the first half of the film. But it will extend up to 3 hours and 2 minutes or maybe even more. Because the movie did not get lost for a minute, and none of it can be cut for the time being out of editing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, "Heart-ranching" comes to mind immediately. But "uplifting" probably because none of them as apropos. Any story that points to the incompleteness of the human soul against the worst discrimination, should be considered. And the victory of the whole - probably not immediately clear to those around him - is not less than inspirational. I can not recommend this picture enough for the power of the story alone. <br /> <br /> Uniform inspiration for the whole picture of Urmila Matondkar. Small actors are often neglected in the wives of new actresses, the role that Ummela plays is the unique ability to supply a completely credible character. He not only plays the part of the old, he indulges in the character of life. Like Rashid, Manaj Bajpai's election was inspired. He can manage a few Indian film heroes: subtlety His expression and role of the Nuuan command are essential. He brought more danger to the first part of the film. His tears were torn apart by all those involved in the bombing of the sword. <br /> <br /> If you only see a Bollywood movie in your life, then pinned it.
