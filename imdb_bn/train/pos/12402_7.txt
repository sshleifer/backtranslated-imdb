** Warning! Earlier, the operators! ** <br /> <br /> This little part explains in the short section of "matrix" that explains how matfix happened. Because we already know the story, the plot itself is no surprise; And not so entertaining as little informative. But it is presented as a file of historical archives. Visuals are better than average, and generally cold colors help in shortening. <br /> <br /> There are a couple problems. The violence in the story is a little unpredictable and briefly briefly summarizes the dose of political purity (United Nations scene). The plus part should be divided into two parts. <br /> <br /> The animatrix concept is bright and despite some problems, this brief still fulfills its purpose. It will not be appropriate in style, content, or stream in the original movie. This perfect method of publishing the history. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Good information. May be called a little better, but still a difficult 7's 10.
