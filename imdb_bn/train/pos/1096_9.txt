I saw the first film in the mid-1980s. After the next few scenes (and buying the video) it still makes me laugh loudly. Yes, it is another age resort - a domestic comedy set in rich middle-class America - but executed well executed well. But it is a document of its age - the postwar optimistic celebration, baby boom and newest consumer age. This image is not a "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three wonderful sophisticated actor - Urbane Melvin Douglas; Cary Grant bemused; Mrinal Lley is determinedly cruelly - complementary to each other and a memorable team of characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes - "It means that we will explode" and "Miss Stellaggagen" and "this little piggy". <br /> <br /> Love it.
