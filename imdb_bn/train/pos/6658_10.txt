Mahatma is portrayed as a man who neglects his own son in this film. I'm not condemning the movie; It's a wonderful movie and gone out of the movie with a pile of my throat. We must understand the spiritual position of the Mahatma, he is the true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened person can probably separate himself from his beloved. For example a man with such power leads his family and followers. According to the movie, he talked to his son and tried to understand where he came from, but with poor intelligence, poor Harilal could not understand his father. When something goes wrong with Harilal, the Mahatma can calm down and acknowledge that his son is a big tragedy. <br /> <br /> If there were any other parents, they compromised their values ​​to help the boy get up on his feet. The Mahatma did not do this, he is the true leader who will lead for example.
