Well, "Cube" (1997), Vinceenzo's first film, I was one of the most interesting and clever ideas while talking about the film. One of them was the scene, the actor and a plot. So, it has been made so much that the functional aspects, great dialogue and a strange condition that the characters had to behave like a mole in a sphere. His second film, "Cipher" (2002), was all about his story, but it was not as good as "cube", but here the characters are examined like fat again. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is very interesting and Vinceenzo is coming back to her 'sleeping day', and locking characters in different places at once, and never play again with the character playing with the mouse in the experience room. . But instead of a thriller saifai (even some promotional teasers and trailers seem to be wrong), "nothing" is a loose and light comedy which can definitely be called modern sarcasm about our society and the intolerable world. We are alive Again Vicenzo surprised us with a great idea among a small kind of thing. 2 actors and a dark white scene, you've got the most part of time and you do not need more than that. "Cube" is a clustrophobic experience and "cipher" confusing, "nothing" is completely opposite but frustrated at the same time. <br /> <br /> This film again proves that a smart idea means more than just a million dollar budget. Of course, the film sometimes fails, but its main idea is that many and no errors of offset. There is nothing more to say about this movie because everything is a bright surprise and my totally different experience in movies from "Cubic"
