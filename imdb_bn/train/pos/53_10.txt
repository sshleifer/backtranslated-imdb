The home room really surprised me. Writing about high school in Columbine is one of the best in this one compared to other movies. The home-room school does not show the shooting but rather displays the influence of communities and cities and the city. Movie focus' are two opposite characters. Alicia (Basi Phillips) and Deba (Erica Crisensen). Alecia is an Outcast who is the whole shooting witness. She seems to show no emotion about it. Dena is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. For graduation, let's go to the hospital at Alessia Hospital. Meanwhile police are investigating Alessia because she knew that the shooting was going on. Alessia and debt are very different and not always the first. Finally they develop mutual understanding for each other and become friends. (Too much in the breakfast club style). The Home Room looks neatly close to strength and turmoil after a school shooting. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone.
