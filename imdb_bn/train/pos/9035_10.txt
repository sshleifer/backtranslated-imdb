Acting in this movie was fantastic. As an amateur rocketeer, I found very few mistakes. As a man, it touches my heart and soul. To view the actor, you think that they are actual characters. My favorite actress Laura Darn did not miss anything from her performance. The performances of rocket-age players showed their talent outside the year, especially the young Homer. Inspired by Homer's father that the eternal love / hate relationship between the father and the son is so real that it seems real. If your throat is not found for one hour or the first successful rocket or when it comes to the father and son, check your pulse (you can be dead).
