Although some wild and devious like Tikasi Miik's next films, it is a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The story of a policeman from the Japanese police force with the original story taking Chinese soldiers to China's parents and trying to arrive in China. The complex subject is working as a lawyer for his younger brother, Villain and his gang. The film is much more complex than many complications, which both keep things interesting and confuse things from the central story. Its complexity and the loss of the movie about an hour-long, which makes it less than a great movie. (This is a very good one) Especially if you do not pay attention at a great speed, it is certainly valuable. <Br> <br /> A word of warning, when it occurs, violence is explosive and nasty. There are semi-graphic imagery of gay sex. If you do not tea tea, proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> 10 or 7 out 8.
