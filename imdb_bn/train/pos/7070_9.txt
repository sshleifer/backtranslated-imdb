One of the most striking elements of the gilium film is the fact that the well-organized visual, orthopedic backdrop and psychological frustration character builder's involvement. Instead of most movies (where filmmakers are paying for some directors-for a star or two), you can experience the presence of Terry Gilliam through experience. "Monkeys 12" prove Gillette's own outlook and style, because they oppose them for making off-film films for themselves. A variety of themes similar to those of the "monkeys" gilium "12 monkeys": the oppressive / returning society, the unity of drama, the frustration associated with disbelief and parallel zones. In this movie, Jilliam did a fine job of blurring lines in two areas, which used obscurity to force the viewer to believe forcibly. This trend for negligence to meet Gilliam's specific gap leads to criticism of pretentiousness in the art-house. The difference between gilium and artistry is that the choices of gilium are clearly a purpose and all its images have meaning. In the beginning, almost identical bath scenes of the coals are drawn relatively, which makes the audience uncomfortable. His brain's head makes a mark of the world classical analogy in the future, yet it is recognizable in 1996 to him in the world. The title itself is a sign of the creativity of gilium, because its understanding of the meaning is fully understood, it is necessary to meat most of the story. Finally, the dedication to making creative films of Gillette, which is still interesting to watch, requires views from the audience and explanation. The film has a past re-look, because there are delicate details and hints that can be missed in the first sight. Certainly this is one of my favorites.
