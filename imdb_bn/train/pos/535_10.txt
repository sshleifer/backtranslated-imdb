One thing about Life and Death, can you tell the truth that the beauty and genius of this movie will be judged properly. The visual imagery of Powell and Pressbahr knows no boundaries, each frame is filled with fantastic comic writings. In the bold colors of "the real world", the deviations between black and white white colored white are impressive, which shows us a more vibrant life. The scene of the final courtroom is also fantastic, because the judge and jury came down under the stairs of the court for trial of the court on Peter's campaign (David Nivon). <br /> <br /> All these events are spot (Roger Lvci is a standout), and the film's romantic power is beautiful, it was never a romantic movie (if I were there 'it can not be seen). Life and death are all about the power of love and how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is simply good enough to see the film, just as he makes Kim Hunter's face more beautiful, what a gifted, he can see the simple things exciting as a game of table tennis. And the sound design is also defective; The key to silence was the way to make sound decisions at a critical moment. <br /> <br /> This is a real classic that can restore the belief of someone in the movie, its initial publications and praised by today's audience, but one is my favorite time, therefore I This image is 10/10, a sound - beautiful.
