I understand that I am using IMDB now and I have never reviewed my favorite movie. I do not like anything by choice now, I mean that this film is so spontaneously perfect that it has no other animated experience to touch it anymore. This is obvious because I'm never going to be a child; I saw this picture on ITV in the early nineties. I am a 12-year-old film directed by the old group, I am male, gender for the film that was created (a large majority of Miyazaki's titles). As a result, this film inspires my childhood psychology and I am forever indebted to Karl Mesak (Span?) For creating the English dub of this movie which is far more fun than the DEE $ neo production, which is not even fun - I have never been able to see it - Of course, the subtitle is the only way, but the mesx version is very good (essentially the voice related to Japanese Japanese actors) which is this Available in Japanese DVD! It is not available for any distribution in English-speaking countries. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I Critics want to agree with those who said that to review Mijazaki's films, you need 20 out of 10 - they are in their own league so that they make the entire catalog almost unimportant with the pale dimension of IMDB. The interesting story with this movie is that in Miyazaki Welsh mining communities, in the rural areas around the Slug Ravine (Pajur City area). In the early 80's (Wales, in the late 70's), he visited Wales for a few minutes. In the sixties, he felt his plight as an enthusiastic supporter of the student social movement. Initially describes this sympathy with the people of war fighting between the pirates and the pirates. Especially in the rural areas and the clouds made me grow up, where I grew up, the picture illustrates an imaginary version of the hills of Midwest British Isles. <br /> <br /> Island is certainly the genius of Swift from the genre of the eighteenth century - Swift's book story is deliberately funny. In Casey in the Skya, Miyazaki brings together mythological stories like Atlantis and Tower of Tables - I think the architecture is based on the ruins of Peru, but I'm not sure anybody told me. <br /> <br /> Anyone who chooses to read this review, and who likes this movie, actually listen to the epic series series Mirzaqi, based on the short story novel 'The Incredible Tide' by Conan-Future Boy Conn. - Alexander Key ( The novel is available online). Canaan is a prototype for Laputa pas and Shita. You can also not be familiar with his previous work in Masterpiece Theater - some of his key frame animations. She also made the original frame for Sherlock Hound - it has the best backgrounds I've ever seen. See also Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature Film Horse Prince of the San (1968) - Actually its values ​​are amazing. What's more ... celebrity and flying ghost ship gouche - although they are very rare. <br /> <br /> This picture is so gift, I do not know what we'll do without this storytelling near these other shit, like this a oasis. Arigato Miyazaki-Sansi!
