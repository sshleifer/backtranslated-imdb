One of the movies that can be seen in the theater through a river run is so that the glory of his art can be really appreciated. Acting is surprising and understated, carrying each gesture and smile and meaning. Brad Pitt gives a brilliant performance and is as strong as Tom Schert preacher's father. When the movie moves like a river, you will be ebbs and willing to follow it through the flow, but ultimately it's worth the good.
