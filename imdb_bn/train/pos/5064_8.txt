All the way that this picture is not a modern action adventure is surprising. Take some time. Enjoy, relax. Think about it. Those who see this movie as slow or pladding, they must close a week and see it a few times until they are involved in the possibility of engaging with a reason or even a beautiful story for a mindful time in their short notice. No other reason is that it does not rush to make these points so fast enough to do this in a short time. At first I was afraid to play Brans√°n a Native American. Although given the story line, I think it was appropriate casting. Now, return to my hermiting. -Jahfre
