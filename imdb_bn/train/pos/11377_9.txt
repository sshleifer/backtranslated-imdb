Story of Citizen X Andr√© Chicatilo, Rostov's Ripper, who killed 52 people, especially women and children at the age of 8. It shows how difficult it was to investigate the Soviet bureaucracy, how difficult it was to investigate the crime. It works in a great way that it does not leave an impression. At the beginning it is likely to slow down slowly, but with the release of the story it really attracts you. I can only say that, along with "The Silence of the Lambs", I have ever seen this film about serial killer. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to say that the performance of an actor has been more than the rest of this movie. Stefan Re as an inexperienced forensic expert in charge of the investigation is really luxurious Donald Sutherland's performance as superior to his ruler, and the Russian government is the only person willing to help him, as outstanding as Rea's. And Jeffrey DuMann, what would the serial killer say about playing? DuMann inspires hatred rather sympathy to those who create a character brighter. Yes, he is a demon, but he is tragic, oppressed and ridiculed by his wife, his boss, his colleagues ... He is tortured, ashamed, as well as very wicked. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend everyone in this movie who is interested in Doku-drama, where the actor is more important than special effects. If you ask me, it's less than 9/10, probably more.
