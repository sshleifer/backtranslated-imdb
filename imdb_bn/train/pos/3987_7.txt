Mother, you know that one of the movies is good, even the cool, but it is for kids to eat vegetables or homemade homework - lots of work and lots of pain for investment. <br /> <br /> The story is mostly dissatisfied: the death of a character within the first half an hour, December-May romance, a person's idea of ​​cheating on his wife, and the idea of ​​betraying his mother to her mother. Weak and rather unpleasant thirty-some letters, clear apathy of the children of their children in their lives. This film was created in 2002 or 2003, but was cast for the collection of British (Generally Created TV) Films in the late 1980's - it's a moral intensity that never ups, which creates a crooked upturn <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Some less actors - et al Turns off the edge, but if such a movie is so perfect, the viewing experience is raw and painful. Even technical attributes - light, editing, etc. - create the pain of the audience; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You will enjoy mother Anyone in, give it a miss, or be prepared to squirm. And be careful: the movie is as tough, the earliest to the worst, the worst. At the end of the movie, the mother asks her daughter what she can do (to sleep with her boyfriend), and the girl is quietly saying that she thinks about him and wants to hurt him. The mother agreed to this, they both stood, and - instead of a well-primed slap - the girl clenches her fist and delivers a blow of a boxer. Oh !!!
