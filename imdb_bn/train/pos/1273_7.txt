At the beginning a simple movie, a simple movie ending. It has that cluttered and exposed cliche, however, most TV movies are in any way. <br /> <br /> Christopher Riv works a good job as a pre con con. Marriage between her and the woman she works for, I feel a little worried, but, I believe for that time, it is not believable that it is rarely. <br /> <br /> Now, I saw the edited 'TV' version, even the movie was made and even shown on 'TV', I see it a bit more diverse. However, I think if I saw the fragmentation of the piece, I would give it more chances of the same rating. <br /> <br /> jetty. Walsh does a great job, not his best role, but, still .... A wonderful job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
