Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in the show business. I read both of his books and think he is great. Peter Falk can provide a punch line with their best. The combination of the two is magic <br /> <br /> It has learned about one family one by one. A father and son through a road trip connects for the first time in their lives in the middle of a family crisis. They do all the things that parents and children seem to be working in ... they are working very soon in their lives. The situation is so funny, but in reality they actually have feelings that can happen to people (not vaguely on top or cartoon). This is the first time I have seen Paul Reiser and believe in every emotion emulated. Occasionally, her eyes look very sad. <br /> <br /> Great movie and great stories and plot. It's a comedy and emotion but an uploading message ... Olympia Dukakas also have a great job :)
