I basically know that this film was not hurt at the box office, but in the light of the recent Hollywood publication (which is mostly formula-raided, plot less, pointless, "mug-save-blonde-cook-no-matte-key" ), Festivals of all saints, of course deserve a second opinion in this sorry context. The film - like the book - loses anchoring in some historic background, but it sets a unique American suspense against the unique horrific American institution of human slavery and some of its sad (and funny, and touching) results. <br /> <br /> and singles worthy of being qualified, Robert Richard, portrayed as the leading personality of Marcel, whose idealistic source is truly universal, as soon as his 'arrival arrives' is implemented. Louisiana's Southern Plant will be cruelly frustrating to become its true education at the top of the world by the Antiglum era. When I saw (demon) the blonde-haired Ri'chard featured (eyewitness) preview, I expect a buffoon, a fop, a trick - I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Humor emotions lend rich illustration and strong skills as Osie Davis, Ruby Dee, late Ben Vereen, Palm Greyer, Victoria Rowel and even Jasmine Guy Plasze, voodoo, Creole "elite," and Haiti rebellion actress , Hatred, love, family woven into this story, and ethnic confusion in a society that has gone guessing and still remains with us in some way.
