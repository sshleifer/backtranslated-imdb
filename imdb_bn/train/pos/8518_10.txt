I ran across this movie during the sale of their annual pedestrians in local movie stores. While scanning thousands of videos, I came across this movie to sell some cartoon movies. I read behind the movie and knew that it was in God's hands to buy this movie. You see, there are three Foster (and soon adopted) siblings who live with my family. Immediately my animal's son made a connection with the three children in the movie. The film helped them to understand their own situation better. For the first time, the oldest (7-year-old) sister of the brotherhood group decided to open a bit closer to me because of his past and his experience. He has been fighting the problem of complete faith. This is the first time I saw her tears. After watching the film, I asked him what to do for the child. He replied, "It must be happy." One should see children who are foster for children and must be considered taking care of. It's obviously open the contact line with us.
