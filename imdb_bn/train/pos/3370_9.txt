Just a few minutes before I finished the chronology of Hironik Knight, I made myself very happy, but still the questions were blurred on me. Although it would be seen that the first 7 episodes or the fact that the first record of the first record of the Loads War was a resume, they are not really. It would appear that the quote maker had a different view of how the original had ended (and it could be the first 7 episodes) but I could not find it. CotHK says it was a part of the Paran which started 5 years after the Battle of Heroes. I think that the director believed that the first 5 episodes were a repetition of the original, so that a small reminder and characters and their work were played to the viewer because they were rarely displayed after the kicks in the series' Spark story. Now, once we jump into the spark part of the series, we found ourselves after 10 years (15 years after the Battle of Heroes). In some cases, Spark and his crew saw Paran√° and his crew once in the gear, and saw the story of love flowing through Spark and Neese. I thought over several times throughout the CotHK that I had dropped out of the original series, and if it is not for spark's long blue hair, I know that I want to stop it more than once to ensure that the correct disc was there. Consider these major setbacks, however, the authors have done a fine job in writing credible characters and an extraordinary storyline. The only thing that strikes me is the Ashram and Wagner Umm ... how ??? The only harmful feature of the monastery is that he supports Marmo, although both of them are not wrong. Perhaps I explained the part of the series that missed some of the obscure time. As far as the sequels go, I highly recommend the CotHK. I keep CotHK and more, Lads War's real record ring is far more than Lord of the Trill. This is more epic than both I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend this.
