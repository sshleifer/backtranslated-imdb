In 1953, Sam Fuller has some of his best works, and sadly he did not get the support of the main Hollywood studio for his stuff. The story line goes something like this. A hard-hard Broad (prostitute reading) is riding on a hot summer day subway, and gets her pocketbook in the pocket by Scotta McCoy. Do not skip (and dame) do not realize that he is carrying some microfilms which will be sent to crocodile spies. This opening shot without conversation, and one of the most tight closure-ups, is one of the many, fuller movie covers. Playing baby as Candy is not good looking Gin Peters, who were not good at all. One forgets how beautiful he is, and he handles this role very well. The cockpocket was played by Richard Wymark, who had already made his mark, and with his 1947 Chess of Death, his style made it look like a crazy madman with astonishing laugh, and although he is a little "soft" yet still scary. These hard-edged characters have soft spots here and there, but all its way to dirty and nasty. Standout performance involves a wonderful Thumma Ritter, who stores his duck for the funeral of his own funeral. Rutter earned the Oscar nomination for his performance, but lost "Donna Reid's annoying but popular performance" as a b Girl (for a prostitute) in the film "From here to eternity". Hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad, and her performance generally owes her Oscars though awful. For example, look at "Elmer Pantry" in New York City's Doc and Dive in Sheryl Jones, with great Joe McDonald's with nasty black and white photography and some very good industrial aspects. Especially the New York City representative set is a good one. The subways and the roots of the vidmark are near the river. The cold war and red fear created in height, the common looking defender, is a criminal who is played by Richard Kelly, a criminal who is more dangerous than the cockpit but is just a lively and trying out all the above is a devoted American.
