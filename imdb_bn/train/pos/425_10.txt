I want to comment on April love movie. It's always my favorite because my dad, Nelson Malone, plays a horse trainer. Remember clearly when Hollywood lived in Lexington, KY, where we lived in time to love in April. My father had many plays and was a brilliant man. I asked him to try for some parts given to him, and see and he came home / script. That's how exciting! Also, the crowds of my classmates were in the scene - especially in the entertainment church. Each time it is shown that the film is being shown once and the love song of April, Pat Bhan's song has still been played on the radio. All time, stupid language and violence when you watch movies, a time-honored and memorable one has passed. April will be refreshed to whisper to see more movies like love ...
