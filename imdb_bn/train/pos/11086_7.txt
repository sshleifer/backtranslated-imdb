I saw this movie when I was small - it's called "Glasios Fox". I was completely traumatized by it! It follows a cute little fox family around it. The start was good and I was feeling very attached to the little fox. I think my mother took me from the theater when I was violent. I will not tell you what happened, but just say it does not end well for all the foxes. I used to be in Disney type of nature movies where animals do not actually die. Oh man This movie is crying for me for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was really small and told the truth - I think being felicitated for the foxes and then one of them is dying. If you can rent it, but do not show your kids!
