Unfortunately, this movie did not create it in DVD. The first was released in theaters in 1983 and I saw it after the VHS release in 1992. I recently saw VHS copy in a chip market, when I bought it. I was not frustrated. First, obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and delight to see. But then, the film takes you to an unreal world where you have to reflect your values ​​and what you really need to determine. About a lot of movies. How the World Bank and big corporations exploit and exploit developing countries with their capitalist plans for loans that can pay their debt. How our economic system exploits us by compelling us to borrow credit cards, mortgages, and car payments is the way it exploits us. It's trying to preserve an innocence that we may never have ever encountered and perhaps we can not save them. It's about how hard it is to say good and bad about me and sometimes one to another. It raises many questions but does not answer. I sometimes think this is good. Because of this, it's really a film save and worth watching.
