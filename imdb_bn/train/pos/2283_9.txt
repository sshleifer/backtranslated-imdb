I still have not optimized the book Cart Vanguat yet, I could not read it yet, but I would like to know some of his other works and see how it will be translated on the screen. Above all, I think it's a very successful adaptation of Vonnegut novels. It expresses concerns about an American living story in Germany that is appointed as a spy in the United States. His work surrendered to the High Rank Nazis and sent American secret messages through his weekly radio show. But when the war ended, he was condemned as a war criminal, but fled from New York, where waiting for some strange plot. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem in the mother's night, it seems a little more sensitive to the bar. But for most movies, skimlats are kept at a minimum and very strange skeptics are skeptical and leave behind. And there are some fabulous moments of black comedians involved in the Clay room's three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a very high-profile Nazi. Highly recommended.
