Just saw the movie, and the scary thing was that, during the movie, people were just as bad as these actors. The film was at its moment, but it was rather lagged and ill. It was all meant to be a dispersal, but once you see the sad life of the movie people, you yourself think "Such people are around us". All attempts to achieve the sympathy of the audience have been reduced to actors after the other stupid things. Plus beside, there are some great (and funny) insults. I think I'll wait for the video - but it was a good smile. Warning - Jerry takes off his shirt movie time !! (Not a beautiful scene!)
