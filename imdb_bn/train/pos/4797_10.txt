I was always a fan of David Lynch and Lynch with this photo proved to critics that in the past decades he has the talent, style and artistic honesty of making film outside the miracle that he has become known. As far as the film is rated G, it's Style, Pensing and Tone Pure Lynch. The film moves in a neatly hypnotic pace and is filled with real emotions and power scenes. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is expected from a leech film, and excitement of extraordinary Montage sequence. It is refreshing to see a movie where the characters are not all friendly, courteous and inaccessible characters, which are clearly labeled "good" or "bad". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do it. <br /> <br /> David Lynch with this photo proved to critics that he could take a powerful moving picture like 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man' in the 80's. Critics seem to have lost faith after making these early films as 'Twin Pickes: Fire Walk with Me' and 'Lost Highway' in the last decade, but with this photo, she showed that the FWWMM and LH system was and the critics finally thought of her recent movie Highlighted by 'Mulholland Drive', high praise and unity for Lynch Considering the nominations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> This is a loving story about the kindness of family, friends, and strangers. I would highly recommend it.
