I have seen this movie several times and today it has been completely (in TCM) due to Geraldine Fitzgerald. She was an extremely underhanded actress and I saw her first (probably "Wuthering Heights" 40 or more years ago) I had to admit she had a crash on her. However, the film stars Paul Lucas, and the achievements he received were deserved. He makes it clear, whether we like it or not, that means the end of the correct. Nazism had to stop, and what helped to do was good. He gave his children a line because they were bad, and they could not be bad, but when he said before talking to adults before, he would do such things without hesitation. Lucas, a wonderful screenplay by a man caught in this situation, made it clear that what he did is very difficult to do. <br /> <br /> Some people think that his victim is a Nazi, but I do not think - I think he was behind the money. His Nazi associates knew this and did not use much for them. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < WWI's German-German Herchestra was not repeated in World War II, there were several opposition attitudes against Germany, and some Germans had similar interference with what happened in California with the Japanese lineage. Helmand had a dare to write a game about good German at this time (perhaps he thought he had signed the Nazi-Soviet treaty!). Finally, the United States and British Air Force carried out bomb attacks in German cities and there was no qualification for killing innocent civilians. I think, though, after the Dresden bombings and firestorm, after the release of "Watch On the Rine". <br /> <br /> The title is like a game of words, like "watch" on the west, from Germany. Actually, Watch Am Rahi Rahin was the ongoing song of a German army - used in WWII, but the Nazis used their own music playing. But Muller German and he is involved with his own "watchmah Raheen". <br /> <br /> All other actors have done a great job here; Although Bodo had too much children like him. I was surprised that he did not hide the secret of his father. In real life, he can do so very well.
