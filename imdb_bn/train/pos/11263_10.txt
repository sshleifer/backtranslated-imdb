This is a great show! I had a lot like this that high school was a US history teacher. There are many "incidents" in history which is not true and Mr. Uhall has described it incredibly well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Uncovered some well-known inequalities in the world's history and tried to influence their students on that brain. The editing of "Skits" is very entertaining to use live actors. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this section, that anyone interested in history revolving around the child.
