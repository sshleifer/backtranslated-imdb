My super x girlfriend has become a fantastic surprise for me, that I was really hoping for an awesome movie that might be stupid and expected, and you know what? It was! But this movie is so wonderful smile and a fun plot anyone can kick out. I know that this was a very Chess movie, but Uma and Anna were very cool and Steve was such a great addition which was like a great cast, which seems like they got so much fun and that's why the film really worked. <Br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (awesome, this is my real friend's real name) is not looking for your ideal average librarian, when Matt, your average man, asks him, he has done more than his expectations, Asked a date, super heroes out of the world! But when he wanted to know that the jealous and crazy girl was really and decided that it would be a good idea that they had spent some time, but Jenny would not be able to get her for the second daughter-girl Hanah and she would make her life a living Hell, I mean, may face it, he could not choose to break with a good girl. <br /> <br /> The effect was pure, but you seriously moved past them, the story and the story actually worked, and I love him in this film, that was such a step from Prime. My Super X Girlfriend is a funny movie that you should not really take seriously, it's a cute romantic comedy which I think if I can get a smile from it but nobody can. <br /> <br /> 7/10
