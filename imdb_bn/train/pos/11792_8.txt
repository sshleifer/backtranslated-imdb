I'm going out of an essay, and in fact, for a good clip-show episode, "Grade Shade" is going to protect, which is an interim deadly disease, in the life and death struggle of the warring commander William Thomas Ricker. <Br /> <br /> Flashback sequences were well-implemented, like Rickey when he restored romantic episodes like "11001001," "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder". As well as tragic moments such as "Evil Skin", Tasha's death was highlighted as the element of "Mahima Heart", "Conspiracy", and the previous "Harmful Skin" Risk of Damage. Some ridiculous jokes in the rica such as "My ancestor was once beaten by Rolatelenac ... by the courage of the fire, behind the fire ... ... 3 days after the severe pain, the snake died." This episode highlights the psychological weakness of Will Ricker under extreme contradiction. And, yes, I favor my opinion in favor of declaring a "gray off shade" like a strong episode, because during my real windfall, my face was covered with sweat, thinking that Rica would survive and live? Seeing another great, galactic, outpace spaces outside the final borders .... Of course, in the next few years, I seem to have formed the singular opinion of this special episode ... However, if the prize is "Best in Television History" Clip-show ", then I believe that this episode will be very respected.
