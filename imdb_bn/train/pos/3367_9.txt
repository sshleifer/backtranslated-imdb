This picture has great acting, great photography and a very strong storyline that lets you know who you are, how you define yourself, how you fit, what role do you agree to be a role or a break ... already there is a nice direction. Dealing with I would like to comment on the formal settings of the film. Basically, it's two people on a roof. In space and time there is unity, character 2, and acted as a radio choir. Many directors have transformed Greek tragedy into movies, contemporary stories of many directors such as Greek tragedy, as well as contemporary stories, but in my opinion, a director has become commendable as Eterro Scola to reach the purity and power of a great Greek tragedy. Storyline and formal setting. A Best Composition
