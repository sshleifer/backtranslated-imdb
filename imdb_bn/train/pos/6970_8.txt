One of these movies / pilots is that if you know BattleStar Galactica it helps but it is not necessary. What is more reliable than the story of BSG is that it is not so far in the future. It has so much depth that it is quite surprising without theatrical release. Leads are not well-selected among such experienced and highly talented actors. Eric Stoltz will do nothing to re-do her parents, but her daughter is real, and she does not even spend it. "Deadwood" fame Melinda Malcomson is awesome with his wife as well. The meaning of love or money is not entirely sure of its motives, but it makes this pilot even more encouraging. I saw a star starring Joe, the relative unknown Elsandrra Torresani and his performance. It is horrible to see how much Morales would like to see his loved ones again and what they want more than his moral objections. I declared it was not a good idea when it was announced, but I was happy to see the story of BSG Stage alone from the pilot. Adams seems to be seeing that the baby is already being influenced and influenced by various types of robots, and at this stage life started flowing. I hope that they can continue with the stories so we can learn more about how we got Humidoid typed robots. This is an almost perfect pilot and I hope they can continue to tell the fantastic story. Even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. If you have not received BSG, at least try it and I am sure you will become a fan and would like to see how the BSG story happened.
