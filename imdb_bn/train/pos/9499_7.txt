A boy and a girl were pursuing by a local fighter because the boy (accidentally) killed the warrior father (or anyone else). And they travel through nature in Africa's most remote areas. <br /> <br /> This movie is not that good at acting (except that elephant goat). But this is a very good adventure and it is not very sensor, some blood, meat and nudity (which makes the film a little light). <br /> <br /> I give this image 7 because its picture is African nature and it's action.
