This movie can only be raised in the 1970s! It's a small California employee set up a wicked action movie in the city. Some types of factories or factories are being shut down, so suddenly the bad behavior is going on in the street! The city is disturbed! So Ben Arnold (John Michael Vincent), his brother, starring Chris Christopherson, went to another town to recruit Aaron. Harun looks at a Vietnam vet and a little off ?? Balance off. He hangs out with a bunch of other surly Vietnam vet. They come to the town to clean it (they are lost), but under their good work they are actually gambling houses, asking for protection money !!! It takes a while to catch people, and in Bible Kine and Hubble Showdown, Vincent has to take his older brother. This movie has an interesting blue-collar-style atmosphere that makes it interesting (watch cock-fighting scene!). Vincent this role is too much angel ?? He thinks so much about his brother, he can not imagine the evil things he accused of doing. She finally comes to her senses ?? Her girlfriend, Princeton of Victoria, was brutally shot behind and she herself was knocked at home. Kris Kristofferson is creepily effective as Arrow. He is doing something wrong, and even slowly and Vincent's little girl (he called him 'Uncle Haroon') even laughing while threatening his father's life! Vincent and Christopherson have good contrast chemistry with each other. Burnt Peters draws Harun's attention to who makes an attractive look as a 'salon' girl. This is a good 70's action movie, if you can find it !! Is it still not available on DVD ??
