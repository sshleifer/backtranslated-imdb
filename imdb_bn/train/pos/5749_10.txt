I want to warn you that this comment is very low quality. Also, this comment will be more meaningful to you after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Although it is sad that this film deals with my life, which is genuinely frightening. The rest of you will never know exactly how this movie behaves like this and who later responds to them and responds in their next life. <br /> <br /> This can not be a fiction; It was based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My real story of how good my movie was, though, that although I saw it was one of the best movies, being depicted on the silver screen after seeing my life is a painful painful experience that I can never see. <br /> <br /> But I sincerely support the opportunity to sincerely meet other people's souls with the amount that you probably will never have before or sometimes. I really know that because my soul will observe you.
