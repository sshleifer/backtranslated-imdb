I am tired of judging them with their "historical accuracy" This is a movie man !! The authors and managers are supposed to keep their own spin in the story! There are a large number of movies that are not perfect with history .... Bravo, Wat Erape, Gang of New York, Garonimo: American Legend, The Last of the Mahi .... All the superb films that are historically gently wrong. If you want to see some great actors, they do what is good, but I do not think you see this film and the accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the movie, the story and the best actor of our time.
