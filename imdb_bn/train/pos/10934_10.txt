After reviewing this deadly martial arts movie for the first time for almost 18 years, I did not lose any mysticism from my youthfulness and was not lost in any martial arts activity. The story of a deadly martial arts instructor sent her "incomplete" student to send five past members of the toxic clan, so they do not want to look for fate that the master's friends hide. His last student did not have enough training, he was scared to fear that he had ordered five "genes" to be friends to defeat the other five. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about the choreography, the camera work. Has become a fine film on the right and most likely the best martial arts movie. A classic !!
