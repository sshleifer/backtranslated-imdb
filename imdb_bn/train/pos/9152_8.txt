This is a good movie for 99% duration. I think the film has finally spread to high praise. <br /> <br /> It is rather shot in flexible fashion. This is clearly done to create a more cool feeling in this picture - according to the technique of film, the feeling of isolation can be seen very soon. <br /> <br /> These great characters have been very well played and especially called 'nutrition' jokes. However, my (my usual) characters are very sad to be very liked - allowed, they seem to be unfortunate but this is done a little bit of it. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly (and 'B' starts uninterrupted cameras at the beginning of the movie) and very naturally but you can feel the imminent cruelty soon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> If I left the rest of the film, I could have given the movie 9, but before filming it got 'solitude' and only 7 of nail visual strength. <Br <br /> <br /> This is a watch day and the last excuse!
