Although filming on the Florida National Guard site, "Tigreland" reminds me of Fort Pollock, LA, Remembrance, Range, Manuela area, Waist-deep water and everyone. The film was fairly authentic and in 1974 my AIT had similar characters. The difference between the Tigreland year, the mine of 1974 and the 1974 mines, all the drill sergeants and trainers knew that they were not going back to Vietnam, as it was too much, so the training was very relaxed - there was no challenge. In the 70's and 80's, we ignored all the problems that I have lived till 2004. I have never mentioned "Tigreland", but in the military there are actually Vietnam training villages in various bases in the United States. Vietnam Vets Let me think the basic and AITT of 1972 is quite rough and uncomfortable because the trainers were there and Vietnam-bound men were compulsory to train the skills to make it, even though it was not always there. Paul is a drill sergeant and then one of my Vietnam vet NCOs, when we became an elementary training brigade trainer at Fort Bliss, told me that they can not do anything to get ready and people just have to find out and the image is out for themselves. High rate of this movie
