This movie was released the year of my birth and it would be like me, 70 out of 70. I saw it again last night after seeing it in high school. It was full of 30's montage and the acting was a little stereotyped, nevertheless, it was fantastic. Pearl S. by Luis Renaar and Paul Munie chemistry magic The story of Buk was revived. The novel to win the Nobel Prize for Literature has made the novel alive under the baton of Sydney Franklin, which describes the story of peasant farmer Wang Fung with a fine script, whose father received the bride for him, a slum girl in the kitchen, a local landlord. In the story of Buck, Wang's success revealed his wife, most of the time and the desire to listen to the country's love. Finally he realizes that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. In influencing the influence of events in the former feminist world, Buck's stories always enter into a complex place of strong women. Born in Germany, Lewis Renaar gave an instant but determined farmer life to the Chinese woman in the screening of alarms. Likewise, Muni was taken into captivity by the honorable Wang, and eventually the rich and the farmer were caught between two people. Other classic characters include Charlie Graevin, Dorothy Gell, from the Wondrous of Oz, Dorothy Galer's Kansan Uncle Henry, Water Conakliving Moving, Conventing Uncle and Kai Luke's Son as a Son - but this time not Charlie Chan. <br /> <br /> A classic can be defined as a movie you can not see tires in a while and again. If this is really the case then this movie is classic, no doubt.
