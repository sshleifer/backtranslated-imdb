I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 years old and got a job as a laborer and hoder carrier union member in 20th Century Fox. At the end of my first day (cleaning an air carrier's deck) I was asked to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes for a week or two. The next morning when I was waiting for a bus, about 20 people moved to San Diego south. We were small there, we were camping camp campan or camp han. Once we were living, we went north a few miles north of the Marine base camp Pendleton. There, on the beach, we started working on the foundation of the Japanese Pacific Island. It took us a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, a gun door, a sandstorm straw and a living quartet. All of these were very high salaries, sometimes 'golden times', which were our frequent trips to the frequent wages. Our food was the first rate = main ribs at lunch, etc. - which was amazing because it was war criminals and it is very difficult to get very good meat in the house. <br /> <br /> I sincerely waited for the job to finish. The film was about to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. Finally, before I came to the screen on my hand, I waited for interest within two hours of the movie. Then it is more than three or four minutes (probably less) base bombings of the movie's heroes and blown away by deceit. A little frustrating, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment I have enjoyed the movie and have not seen it yet. I later came to know that this film was underwritten by the government and Fox was awarded plus plus basis, which may be due to our extraordinary salary and living. Bob Weverka
