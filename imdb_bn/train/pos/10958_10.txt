This show is so incredibly funny that I could not stop watching the comedy Central marathon tonight (though I have seen all the episodes earlier). I saw Silverman as the greatest talent and finally this genius is a car to enjoy a wider audience. I see this event and I smile a very big percentage of the time ... I can not tell about so many TV shows ... What can you do? This show is finally something new and interesting and (most important) fun! This is a show that I will never miss and it's coming soon as soon as I buy it in DVD. You owe it to yourself to look at this event ... I predict a long run for this series ... and to be clear only, those who are offended by this show can not get it ... perhaps they lack their intelligence ... They will stop making fools themselves by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "dot" in the reference of Silverman, or who claims that he only aims to "shock" ... away from that mark ... he is exactly the opposite; Just google him and you will quickly see that he is a huge supporter of civil rights, etc., etc. If you do not know that he is taking these horrendous visions to maliciously, you will not get it. And if you do not get it, let the rest of us do a favor and be silent about it so that we can all enjoy it ...
