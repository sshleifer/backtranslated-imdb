A great message from this movie, an impressive cast, Ellen Barstein, Samantha Mathis, Jodel Ferland (4 years of the film's production), Ellen Barstein and Jodle Ferland have been nominated as best actresses. Amy Awards in New York, Peter Masters-Director - Emmy Award nominated Best Director TV drama. April 1, 2001, Jodel Ferland 'Wang', Best Actress in a TV Drama, Young Artist Award, Studio Town, ca. I can see why they have 3 nominations. The mermaid is a true story, while critits are the real family they set up, something you do not often see. You can find the mermaid in all Blockbuster video stores. Look, you'll be happy.
