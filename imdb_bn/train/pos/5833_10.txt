I can not believe people looking for a plot in this movie. This is Lorel and Hardy. Light up already These two riots were there. 70 years ago their comic talent is ridiculous today. Both were not a dirty sound in the face and they were able to keep the audience sewing. Their comedy was not sophisticated by any stretch. If a hupi cushion can not make you green, these guys have no reason to see any stuff. It was an easy time, and the man laughed at the stuff that was fun without a plot. I guess this element takes a simple mind to enjoy, so I qualify. Two people do not count comedy teams, we are very sophisticated ... we are not lucky?
