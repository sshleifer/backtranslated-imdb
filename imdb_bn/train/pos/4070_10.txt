I know anime I have had so much time before it became a national event; Many people knew that before I knew what a dragon jade was, I loved Ranma. And just so you know that I'm not bragging about me, saying this to me: I saw all the animes out, one of the best in Sky in Casele away. It is obvious that the spirited people are far away, but I really disagree. Most people only know that movie because it is an Osmmy Award. It's not a giggle - I've seen Princess Manoque and Caseyas who are seen only in the spirit, and they agree that the best of the two to three is better. Personally, I never thought it could be compared to Princess Manoukek, until I finally saw Sky Cass. I still think that two better than before, but school casals are easily equivalent to it; In many ways, Castle is the main element that Moneo was missing. In both cases, if you only watch Away in Spirit and feel that it is Miyazaki's best film, be ready to reduce your world.
