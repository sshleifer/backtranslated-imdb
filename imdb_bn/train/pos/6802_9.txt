You will see this episode better from the beginning, because if you start showing it later, then you will be confused with what's happening in Clark's life. <br /> <br /> This is the wrapping; Clarke is stuck in an alternative reality. Lana is devoted to him. Most of the legs lost the trail and the wheel was in wheelchairs due to the accident when he missed Clarke in the series pilot. Married to Martha Lienell. The only constant is his most trusted friend Chloe, who still believes in him. And, oh yes, he does not have any moral power. He is putting himself in a fabulous world, he is in a mental institution where he has power, and so is laughing for faith. Apart from Clo also, Clark has a mysterious personality that believes in: A black man, who is also an organization resident in the alternative reality, who believes that he came from good. <br /> <br /> <br /> Clarke must be true to believe that everything is real reality, and can not be annihilated by the organization's psychotherapist, in fact the fourth phantom zone escapes. <br /> <br /> This episode is totally stubborn and frustrating. Plus, it provides a fresh package from the usual kind of "smallville" episode.
