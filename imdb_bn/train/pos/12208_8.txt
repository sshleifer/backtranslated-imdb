Audition studio has seen the edited version of Mughal Harry (he took an hour): <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although it was not written for our photo, this temporary title song was a dark and painful environment that was colorful and romantic which was acceptable. This is the only current songwriter (Hinz Romamedle) The idea of ​​the musical instrument was a popular song - "Theme" - rather tiring than possible use of the system. "We do not kiss me" for almost every bridge and there is a lot of background material. Delightful, it can work very well on the hit parade - but the Lady of Shanghai is not a musical comedy .. Mr. Row Mahaleed is an enthusiastic fan of an old-style scoring, mentioned in our old bar, as "Disney." In other words, if someone falls down, then he creates the word "falling" in orchestra, etc. ... If scrubbing the lab's primary and phone numbers negatively That is, I did not get dissatisfied with the results ... before I went abroad, I am V (Viola Lawrence, Editor) To make the cut, which is said to reduce the tax-cab near accidents, and was involved in some of the dialogue. I'm convinced that this would be an extraordinary one ... to gradually keep the necessary footage in sequential order (this is not done, accounting for the main weaknesses of the opening roll of the film) ... It is not true Rita's diving is a big orchestral crescendo warrant ... What matters is the beauty of Ritter ... Gretsby's character, and the overtones of evil proposed by Michael's mockery Any or all of these items may be inspired by music. Instead, the dive is treated even though it is a big climax or silly Symphony: Some prototype of Pluto the Pip, wild wildfire by Donald Duck ... There is no atmosphere in the boat. A little wind and water is sorely missed. There is no reason to photograph in a scene in a real boat, if you make the word, it's done in front of a process screen ... at the beginning of the sequence of picnic ... at temporary squares, we're very curious, sexy Latin-American strains ... it A little "dramatic" series - replaced by a bad stock stuff ... Such music destroys the strangeness that justifies Shanghai lady just might be another musical explosion occurred after a large sunny ... grigasabira line, "I want you to kill him." It's weird ... Hawaiian guitar music coming out of the radio ... was supposed to be enough to create a certain satirical point. It stands now, on the same level as the rest of the scoring. Someone in the audience might suspect that we're having fun ... in the aquarium scene needs more eco. "Please do not kiss me" again! ... bad work and poor scoring Michael has destroyed the character below the pitch. Voices of gunshot wars were created with call-to-phone calls, time and effort spent. For some reason, all of this has been junked on a vague hullabaloo. As a result, the entire sequence seems vague ... the audience should think of Michael at this moment, maybe they are going crazy. The work of the new dubbing can only make them think that they are going to sleep ... with guns of broken mirrors should not be supported by the war music ... Close music again "do not kiss me" "... this is clear at the point of indecency, and Inconsistent injury to the image. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
