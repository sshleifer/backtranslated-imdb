I like this movie. This is a movie that you can see time and time again and still find attractive. Congratulations !! I believe everyone involved in making movies and the script should be proud of themselves. It's very eerie, you feel like watching a real-life band. I would like to see more movies like this. I'm glad they did not like the popular Hollywood stars to stay in this movie because it probably did not work. And even if Billy Connolly is well-known, he was actually trapped in the role and I could not imagine playing it on anyone else. Again congratulations, I really believe this film is worthy of the Peter Selser comedy award for Bill Night. And when you get the final scene ..... well what can I say !!!!
