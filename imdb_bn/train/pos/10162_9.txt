Ah, I like this movie. I think it was all. It smiles me a dozen times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I write this from a girl's perspective. I find it shy to score 5.2 rating only. Voting of many people? It was much more than a romantic comedy. I'm just female because I do not enjoy all the lips flicks, on the contrary I like the other style. Romantic comedy may be shallow and they do not seem as fun. But I said, this movie was almost everything to me. Great script, good one-liners, fine acting. The character of Eva Langgeria Parker reminded me more of Gabriele than the Desperate Housewives, but what? It was awesome. I'll keep this movie for the rainy days, when I feel low and need some smiles in days.
