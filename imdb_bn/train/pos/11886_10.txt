I like this movie. First, because it is a family movie. Secondly, because it accepts a refresh to work on HIV news in the family, which is a lot less vulnerable to what I usually see in movies. Brothers are very close, but not the issue. The desire to protect their youngest brother is great, but ultimately does not need to be. I understand that his choice of how to deal with Leo's treatment was probably not the most popular with people, but I believe this is the right choice for him. I can not believe that it was a French television show. It was great production value. I gave this movie ten, and think you'll see it once.
