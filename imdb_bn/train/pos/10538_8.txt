I work in a movie store, and as such, I'm always looking for a great movie. I have not been sitting in the Canadian department and have decided not to examine anything, and I am trying to support the film industry of my country. There was a surprise for me. This film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very entertaining story that has entered so much into our mind and relationship ... without doing the hard work. It is consistently ridiculous with the interaction of two letters and some interesting exchanges ("We can not die, we have wire!"). If I tell you what I can say without giving it a shot, even if you leave it within half an hour.
