I grew up in Houston and nine out of the movie came out. As a result, I do not think anything about movies. But I remember the lyrics created by Jilli's hit song "Lukin" For Hits and the sensation of mechanical lightning, which can bring back memories of childhood whenever I hear it. <br /> <br /> Some years ago I saw this film as an adult for the first time and what I can say is that I got out. Some movies hit me hard. This movie is as raw and real as you can get From Uncle Bob's farm house, the chemical plant of the city of Texas, is the dance hall of Gilly, and Bud and Sissy. And probably for that reason it's not a bigger application. But you do not feel any way about the music of the country (despite my Houston roots, I can not stand it) Urban Cowboy is a unique part of American piracy. That's why I love it!
