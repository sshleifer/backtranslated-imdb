John Schnalton's best film before the blockbuster Wanabee, like Shah Rimak, is an inspiration for this thought-provoking film, which is a great balance between the overall great acting and the three main characters in the stories, each identifying young issues. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> This film shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> An excellent thing about this movie is that it works on many issues without being messy. This is not just racism, but it can be difficult to discover a new world (college), date rape, sex and isolation. Omar Apees, Michael Reapport and Crissy Swanson provided good performance, and supporting caste Jennifer Conleyil is equally attractive as the left of the college due to a slight riot with the tail (Yoye) and the Ice cube and the sack Ramses. <br /> <br />> The only negative Lawrence Fishburne ("PaperMint?") is a professor's character. Of course, professes are lots of nutty lots. But they are not as flat. Skin headaches are also curiosity, but I guess they are just like real life. <br /> <br /> If you like American History X, it's a great part of the filmwork overall. You like it <br /> <br /> <br />
