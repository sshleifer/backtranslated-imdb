On the same level as the ring (or ring 2) but still a good Japanese awful jumble. I hope the North American awful producers will take a page from the Japanese horror template and keep them 'flukis' and their cheap flicker on Flickr. Many such good examples, scenes where a white face is visible behind a small actress, photographs of a wall are suddenly sunny, just for a second and more. Check out if you like style if valuable.
