William Castle is notorious among the horror fans as a B-grade director of the 1950s and 60s. Her hostage, her cost cutting techniques and her unique vision are legends. It is no wonder that anyone (Jeffrey Schwartz, who has made countless documentaries) will eventually take a documentary offer for his greatness. Such as "Tigers of the spine: The William Castle Story". <br /> <br /> I realized Castle for a normal year, had seen some of his films for several years. I did not know anything about his personal life, his goals and ambitions. This film really blown up the people and I sincerely thanked him for his fondness for the drafting of film production and his contribution to the horrific manner. This image portrays Alfred Hitchcock as a competitor in the cass, the artist of the hit who is praised, the Cassell is a Carnival Barker who receives manuscript but less respect. He is an icon of the second rate managers, so it is not surprising that John Waters specially featured here. (Joe Dante and Stuart Gordon also have a big role.) <br /> <br /> Her curiosity earned her reputation, and the documentary suffered great pain for her interpretation, which is very important for young people to remember. "13 horses" basic 3-D (see separate review), "The Tingala" (see separate review), "Homesidal" refund guarantees ... watching these movies outside the upcoming theater, we judge them for their content Can I feel (which I still enjoy) but the viewers can not feel any feeling at all. <br /> <br /> The last episode of the film is from the Hollywood producer, By purchasing the rights of "Rosemary's Baby", he kept a special place to discuss the release of the film. For direct management, he removed the producer to create the path of the new director Roman Polanski. During the first frustration, it proved to be one of the best opportunities in his life - proven one very successful movie and the work he has achieved. Who is better to control the wild artist Polanski's purse than a pony-pinching castle? It was its main achievement, though sadly that the film is often associated with Polansky than Casale. <br /> <br /> It is played in the rest of the years and our daughter and nephew are given a personal image. Everyone across the board, but seems to have the praise for the people. Almost anywhere, he must have bothered one or two people, but you will never know it from this movie. And I can find it - it's celebrating Bill Casal's life, or not "e! True story of Hollywood". It would be good to choose a copy of this event. <br /> <br /> I personally would recommend to choose William Castle Collection, which is not only this but it is also a very special feature in eight Kassel movies. Even this documentary comes with an audio commentary so you can hear how the shawlers are personally affected by Castle and Castle girl Terry gives an ongoing reflection of her experience with her different movies and remakes. It's almost a whole new film.
