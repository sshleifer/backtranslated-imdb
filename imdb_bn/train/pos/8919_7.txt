Who would think Andy Griffith's "Helen Krum" (Anata Corsoaut) had Steve McQueen in her past? But in the late 1950s, it was only one of the only strange and surprising things in the teenage-war-maker films that can be described as rebellious without any reason, what fulfills what God knows from outside. The rebel Steven McQueen (who will soon decide that "Steve" seems like a little princess), the attractive boy is just enough to be interesting with the boy; The very impressive yet understanding girlfriend is aforementioned Anata Corsaut. It was bad when their age was interrupted by teenage rhetors, but when they faced a gelatinous, Man-Khyber, they were more unprofitable. Right and left But the big stars will believe them? Of course, they know, they're just kids! <br /> <br /> This movie sits best for teenage boyfriend. The actors take the insulting script with great importance, many see morale in each other's eyes and the "adult" cast is probably "kids!" Say. Very third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of the film is to make its creatures, which are well-liked, well-educated, and often create suspicious surprises. And although apparently from the cheap (small sets, check out the guys!), The BLOB is actually a fairly well-crafted film - and it has been thrown interesting interesting theme for good measurement. The 40-plus crowd (included myself) will enjoy the film as Nostalgia, but it will not survive with a small set in the whole milk-and-white-bread-sensitivity of the 1950s, as well as right-wing threats. For family-movie night or more sophisticated "only raised ups" a great choice is to be together. Create lots of Jelly Cubes for movie snacking! Gary F. Taylor, Lawyer GFT, Amazon Reviewer
