One and only season has been broadcast here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love it All story lines are so good! And it's more realistic to see today's misery and family life. Yet it still sticking together and keeping the strong family values ​​of staying there for one another. Their problems were real, and it really shows you paint. The show is basically called 'day' and their life about this family. The family was Abbey Day (mam), Jack Day (father), Natalie Day (sporty girl), Cooper Day (exterior son), and Nathan Dey (son Jeans son). Each episode is a day of their lives, with coopers perspective on things across it. I liked Cooper and found that his show was just great. She was far my favorite character. With so many things that could continue with it, I'm not really another sad season. It was a great event that I missed.
