Seasonal finishing mixed message sent, I felt the feeling of joy, and feelings of lying and deceived. Rozanne told all her visitors that the whole season is not false because her husband Dan died. He admits that the family has never won a lottery, and the season 9 was false or wanted to be that was right. Becky ended up with David and finished Darlin with Mark, because Bakey and Mark acknowledged being pregnant. So I believe he is right, but it was not. So the end of the season was good, but sent mixed feelings. I always have to be a fan of shows. :)
