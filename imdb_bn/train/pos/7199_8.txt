Playwright Sydney Bruhl (Michael Caine) was a series of flop plays after a huge hit. He got a game written by a student of Clifford Anderson (Christopher Riv) who is pretty fantastic. It's a very good Sydney, he said he would kill for him. She is <br /> <br /> <br /> The thriller of a thinker. It was originally a game ... and it shows. This is mostly a set and all talk but I was never bothered. It's well written with lots of twists and a full throw to work full force. Caine is just as great as Bruhl - one of the other great performances. Reeve, amazing, very good. I never thought of him as an actor, but he is really good at this role. Diane Canon works wondrous with an underwritten role as Bruhls's wife. Irene Worth is also good (and quite funny) drop ten in Helga, a mental. However, its pronunciation to get on my nerves. Director Sydney Lumet is very good with one set. The camera is always running and keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Extreme Spider Dead! !!!!! My only complaint is that two gay characters of this movie have made the social stage exciting and I've included one of the most painful kisses I've ever seen - but these are the light allegations. <br /> <br /> Very well thriller. Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and it seems to have disappeared completely since it became a premiere in 1982. It's too bad - it's even better.
