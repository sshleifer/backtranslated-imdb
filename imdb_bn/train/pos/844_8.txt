Having a chance between a salesman and a hit man both change their life. This is a weird movie that is an impressive effort for writer-director Shepard. Brasnan plays a surprisingly obscure role in making a lot of crying from James Bond, who jumps to work alone, but he can not connect mentally with anyone to help cope with him. Equally good like a salesman's salesman, an inactive fellow colleague in his life. Davis Kinner's satirical wife as well. Originally a character research, the film is rewarded because it feels fresh and unpredictable, very dark comedy.
