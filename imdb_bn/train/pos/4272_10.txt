This is I call a great movie. It is fantastic actors' skill and an easy but empty story of human life. Real characters that can be fun and dramatic But the main theme is very cruel, as live. The bus driver and his son are digging the country (Jagoslavia) on the way to the capital of Belgrade. Funny and cruel circumstances in the way, people that travel together and pig connections. See it and you remember it for life ... It is filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Another reason for its magic: It is hard to find!
