What a superhero movie that should be after Batman is another subtle taste: Dead End, which helps us to stimulate the taste and gives us more! It should look like a real superhero movie and think what! There is even such a fanfilm of difficult. Detailed attention, character and action are unknowable. Although it produces a limited resource, it is big budget, star-pronounced, hyped, and "other" superhero-related movies. Here the main and supplementary characters work and they look like real life people. Finally, a superman actually looks "super" and looks like the real thing! Regardless of the batman, except for the splash rubber-welding, hide the skin physics for extra actors not to overlay the body armor. I'm just some sensible Warner Bros. exec is willing to just have to produce a full-length adaptation of this jewelery. I'm not worried about going to the theater or going directly to the DVD, I will not be tired to see it. Only the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this. Marvel and DC Productions look to expect "bigwigs" and see what a well-produced superhero movie should look like. And another "Batman and Robin" Fiasco, or Halk, Derdevil, etc. Learn from these short-time managers and learn that there is no reason to "reconsider" the hero for the movie, only this "bomb" theater Mr. Colore ... we need more guides like you !!
