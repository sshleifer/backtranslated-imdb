From a brilliant British author Hanif Quraishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Landrett", is a terrible, unusual piece of piece work, (from the best of what he did from this). It's not a wise person whose life adds a lot. They have squandered what they have given and basically have empty ships. The only character on the living screen is that the mother of the title is still dead inside, until a rough worker shows her some affection and stimulates him to sexual pleasures. He has his own intention, but Qureshi treats him with kindness. This is a film where people and places feel familiar, where there are characters outside the border of the screen. In some cases it's a bit like "Sunday, bloody Sunday" but it's a totally tougher work piece. Director, Roger Michael, can be naturally able to make the scene. And it is played neatly. <br /> <br /> Anonymous mother Ann Reid believes in her lost life in every gesture. There is no false note in his extraordinary performance-acting career, and the great actor Daniel Craig has shown his character's shadow even more so than Kurishi. If the film hits a false note, perhaps, the genius girl's character was caught in a dirty matter with her mother (or it could be another way) and even the messenger's life, but she is acting well by the Cathari Bradshaw, she still hooks you. The film is very great to watch (Doug Paul Allwin Kuchler) and to rank unconditionally as the British movie of the year.
