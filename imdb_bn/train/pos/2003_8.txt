The main problem of the first "Vampires" movie is that no letter was sympathetic. Garment learned from his mistakes and this time a favorite vampire hunter and used a charismatic vampire. The female vampire, of course, is the best vampire from Blade's Deccan Frost. Unfortunately, there are some good ideas like cool-down restaurant scenes (why did the carpenter not use it much ??) The film was not as good as it was. I see the action strong strong purple and at least look for a long lasting nicely corio-figured war sequence (for example a city) and some were left disappointed. Although "Los Murtoos" has reached its speed faster than its predecessor, it still drags out a bit (though not as bad as "vampires") in some parts. Most of the movie's "vampires" but the climax of this movie is not very intense at the end. <br /> <br /> Most of the above can be a bad movie like "Los Muertos" but it certainly is not. It is usually enjoyable and well-known in the style of entries. It is a non-heroic drama written by the heroine (not like almost every vampire movie) and it's not like intelligent action viewers like Blade 2. It can only use a little more excitement. <br /> <br /> I want to see the third schedule made by the carpenter, but it's probably not going to happen. <br /> <br /> The end of the spurring alert was in the very predictable way. He must stay away-which will make the movie quite unusual.
