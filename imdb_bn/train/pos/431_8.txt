It starts slowly, showing daryary life of two housewives who decided to hire a fort in Italy for the month of April, but do not give up on it. Nothing happens, but the time has passed, and there is a lot of intelligent jokes (the journey of my favorite windstorm, which I think is smiling). The film is romantic in many senses, scenes are beautiful (such as Poly Walker), and the film's resolutions are very pleased. <br /> <br /> The film has two freedoms, the book was the biggest with the Arbitrator / Briggs / Desper Business, but I really liked its version of the movie (it may be more sensitive, but I think it is more in line with the tune of the story. It was compatible and anyway I like the feeling when it is good). <br /> <br /> An extraordinary movie, especially during a shy weather, as a date movie.
