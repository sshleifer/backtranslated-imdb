This is a story about the growing relationship between Jeff Wester (Jimmy Stewart) and Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman). In a short interview with Steamer Deck in Skagway, Jeff instantly liked him and the authorities hid him in his cabin if he found him guilty of murder. They find there are some things common without attracting an animal. Both do not believe in a member of the opposite sex, because both of them married the deceased husbands. Slowly, they are learning to trust each other by moving from Skagway to Dawson. But Randa has clearly had a close relationship with the corrupt Sheriff Gainan and practiced some shadows in his Castle Saloon at Skagway. He will eventually decide between Gannon and Jeff. Meanwhile, Renny, a young casual French woman, immediately prefers to Jeff, but instead of just leaving an insulting brush. Nevertheless, he is making staff with him on his journey from Sk√•vage to Dawson and his work around Dawson. Along with cooking, Jeff was forced to give her health care after leaving Gannon's gunmen for the dead to demand gold. Like Ben, Walter Braunen worked as Jeff's longtime sidekick. She has a musical role, but Jeff's hard edges are served soft. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> along with his rumor. Obviously, he has seen himself in Jeff, repeatedly announcing that he would like him. He created the credible Avatar of the infamous Sopi Smith, who spent his last years at Skagway last year, as the oldest person in his time. <br /> <br /> Jeff is very impressive, single-Ben), who does not want to keep his neck out for others, even when he knows that he is the only right person for the job. In this case, for example, he is closely related to the character of "Vera Cruz" by Bart Lancaster. Thus, Jeff did not only reduce the work of the Marshall of Dawson, but he was determined to leave the Dawn in the clear intention of accepting the insufficient legal gold demands of the Gonan group, while executing some mines and the others advised to hurry. Depart from Dawson. Even Randha suggests that he and Jeff are still alive as soon as they leave Dawson. Then, Jeff's heart has changed suddenly, apparently Ben and his intention to retaliate for shooting. Under the leadership of Gangon gang expansion from Doshan, he changed from hero to hero. In this case, he is different from the character of Lancaster, who never reforms (But does Jeff really change, or only transfer his right to retaliation for wrongdoing?) <br /> <br /> <br /> < > 2 policies are women. Obviously, Randy Jeff has made the right woman to stop. Although he is clearly identified as a "bad" girl, Jeff has challenged his own past, shot at least five men in the United States or Yukon and stole his cattle from Gannon. Maliciously, shortly after the hero's change from Jeff's anti-hero, Randa has made similar changes in the street running to warn Jean of Gannon's upcoming expedition. As a result he died, and Jeff asked him why he was not looking for himself (his supposedly abandoned religion!). <br /> <br /> It is clear that like Coron Calvier, like Renee, it is not Jeff's heart to have a reliable alternative to the dead randra. Yet, the obvious effects of split scenes are that they come together, although Jeff never apparently does not kiss or hug him. His picture is good, if a naive, young woman makes a little compromise by her work in cooking salon to weigh her golden dust, to lower the floor on the floor and to recover it later. I am very skeptical about Ruby's relationship with Morris, who is a middle-aged mother who followed her around and made a claim with her. (He is not his father). <br /> <br /> Another problem is the gun fight between the amateur problem Jeff and Ganan's gang. If Gannon has a skill with a pistol, Jeff should have beaten Jeff or seriously injured before doing the same thing as her. And how did Jeff fiercely fired on the right, suddenly suddenly enough to hit the pistol suddenly? I wonder what Jeff and friends avalanche help to save victims. They were far away from them living out from the snow below. And why did the cooking packs of horses and dirt not be buried by the glacier? <br /> <br /> You will probably see familiar but known familiar faces between the Mines and Ganan gangs. Canadian Rockies provide an exciting backdrop to the action sequences of shot sequences. Above all, a very entertaining Western, most major flaws focus on the end. Undoubtedly, this film took some great independence with history and geography, especially in the Canadian Yukon, which was a lot more than the US skywatch.
