When I saw this movie it came first. This was an official election for the Tamikula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for it for the best picture. <br /> <br /> Justin is pristine psychic, but hot as complex Amanda. This is not your usual psycho movie. Attractive style and lots of original slots. With some great blues music mixed in Amander's fondness, "fierce attraction" is arranged for a small set, and she is married to the upcoming and upcoming blues singer, who has less time for her husband to stop her career. <br /> <br />
