After reading this book the film is a little "thin", but it is still one of the greatest movies of all time. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolt is really "vonneguty". He makes great work to reveal the feelings of the pictures from the book. Alongside the feeling of the book, Mother Night does not bother about many films.
