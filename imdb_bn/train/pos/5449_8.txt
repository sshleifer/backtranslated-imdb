Do you know that Anthony Caidis (father of Red Hot Chili Peppers) is in the film. Blackie Damit, Anthony's father I noticed it after reading "Sky Tissue" Anthony's autobiography, and saw a picture of his father. I thought, "Well, that guy looks like I saw him from eighty-eight times in the movie." Then I read more and said that his father had an actor, he had some minor role. After checking this site and comparing it In search of the net, I realized that this is actually his parents' film, it's funny because he does not mention this film anywhere in this book. The second was ashamed of his father's work performance, but do not need. I think his father, blyaki, the show has a great job.
