Whether we are running - or at least what I think the writer thinks is that we should keep the glood from our beginning, it is our intention to know whether Martin did the dirty work. Without much spoil, there certainly is a red deer and a package. But then we discover that it is the imperfections of Mart√≠n and the problem of its competition. When it is revealed - we begin to express sympathy and sympathy to him because the story is progressing as we think he is sick, distorted Pedophile, which we have been remembered. One of the problems he is going to face is the remote gap despite the fact that he and his wife are in the same roof. Of course, these problems have been confronted with the end of the movie threat. <br /> <br /> This movie has claimed your patience and it must have tried the restless young people sitting behind.

And we realize that Galilean is not as clever as we think he is. <br /> <br /> Investigator 5/5
