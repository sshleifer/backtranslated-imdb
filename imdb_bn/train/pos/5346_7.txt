Carol, at the center of the story, young girl, moved to a foreign land in Spain at the height of the conflict in the civil war at the end of 30 years. Everything is new for this girl, it's foreign. The war and his father are constantly worried, although he is going to submerge himself in the provincial culture of how old New York is his age. <br /> <br /> This image indicates by Imamal Uribe number. Carroll's family is obviously divided, with Carroll's mother marrying an Air Force pilot with leftist group but sympathetic to Franco's family and sympathizers with fascists winning contests. <br /> <br /> <br /> The story has not added anything, much better, but it's a simple movie to watch. The magnificent landscape of northern Spain is shown. Do not expect most of the performances of the little boys Carroll and his boys wander around. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays Carroll with sincerity and innocence. Mara Barranco Carroll's mother Aurora, who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarada Maruza, a teacher who makes friends with Carol Carmelo Gomez, playing Alfonso, left for America while leaving Arora. This actor, who plays leadership in most Spanish films, has nothing to do with it, because he is an intellectual filmmaker.
