World of Dragon Hunter is challenging in a 3D gravity world. Planetoid, building building, and weird flat plants are almost floating in the atmosphere, but the ground does not fall on most characters. This is a memorable event in a world memorable story, when nothing in the world came to be eaten. <br /> <br /> <br /> This time it is a huge skeleton dragon with glowing eyes. A great sharp fighter of the heroes, as well as a bizarre and greedy sidekick to manage a strange voyager with both the entrepreneurs. They have joined the world's most conversational little girl, who was terribly painful for my dissatisfaction and did not die in the hope of death. <br /> <br /> The animation is superb. The voice and the sound are high groove. Very simple story is as simple as can possibly imagine. They go to close the world, they are almost immediately reached, they defeated him. The end No real character development or story twists. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is a great thing to see, kids will probably enjoy it, but this is for this. No depth on this earth (curse purpose).
