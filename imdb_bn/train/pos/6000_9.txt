Kristine Watts (Molie Week) is absent from her lover, is broken apart; He is unable to overcome his love for lost in the past. He employed an unknown (Douglas Davis) and gave a list of his mistakes to fix things. But time is overwhelming and sometimes a painful end to pain relief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first aspect of "The Curate" is printed by stylish cinematography that changes color to black and white. The short and sharp scrapplety is able to develop a sad and gradual story of love with an unexpected plot point in less than 8 minutes. The soundtrack is nice but the volume is a bit loud and English is not my native language, in some moments I want to repeat some words laughing by the narrator. The unknown lead actress has excellent performance and is extremely fantastic. I hope to have a chance to see him again on the screen. Last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
