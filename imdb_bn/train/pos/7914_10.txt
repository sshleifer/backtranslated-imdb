I probably saw this movie in 1995. Then I returned it many times. It's awesome! I especially like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "Civilization Rising." How nice! The glory of this CGI animation was so quiet back in the day. CJI is older than me, I know that "trance" was made in my time 7 years ago. But this picture was a landmark in the early 90's. It was probably the first collaboration of several CG CG exams in music set. I liked it a lot, I would go watch it now. Bye
