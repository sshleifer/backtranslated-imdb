Peter Jackson editions are a good film from the main point of view. That said, they are not my favorite screen version of the Lord of the Rings, and let me explain why. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The whole shield faucet is very run. "Do you claim that those silly cartoon characters of Ralph Bakhshi version are better actors than real people?" One can ask. Well, they're not really stupid (save for Hobbits, later about them) and they certainly pack more personalities than Jackson's party - even during the limited time of limited dialogue. And that's why Bakhshi's higher _voice_ acting of LOTR. Take the Aragorn, for example. In this version, his voice is deep and impressive by the author (Aggression Lord) and with a fun rasp (Agrons the Ranger). Because of this John Hart's brilliant voice acting. Compare Viggo Martensen to a higher term without any spirit and the conflict quickly becomes ineffective: Martensen's hands hit down. <br /> <br /> and then there are songlifts. Probably the most dominant (and most popular) character in the overall front. This bakshi version is a real wizard from GundFell (William Schweier). And by this I can not say that he shot Bolt at his fingertips (he does not), but his presence only attracts attention. She can switch from a scary, strong and tender old man to a scary person with ease. Add to her look: old as old oak, her beard long, her body, sharp eyes, wizard hook nose and of course, the classical wizard hat. A Perfect Gandalf, Just like the book. Ian McKellen's Gandf, on the other hand, is just very annoying. He sees very people, hears very human, works too much, and does not wear any hat or even a sword. Yes a sword. In this vicious version, some bloodthirsty arc of GundFlaugh kills his sword (as he did in the book). And those stylish slow speeds are killing. Do not have the ability to mess with Gandalf. And it must be mentioned that when I was sorry to say this, then Christopher Lee did not make Sarauman alive. Fraser care of this movie also worked with very limited screen time and lines. <br /> <br /> It must be mentioned before moving away completely the visual aspects of the film that voice processing and general presentation is even better than Orcs Jackson's pretendeous bad guys. Bakshi's Orakas reprimand their enemies (or each other) with constant roar, scream and ugly language. They are more credible as monsters and in my opinion books are more faithful. And finally, Black riders - Najul. Those are the worst guys, this is a terrible ghost - not just riders wearing black. And they talk with terrible voices, which mesmerizes their victims. My favorite scene in this movie is when the Nazrul river is pursuing Fredro near the river. Peter Jackson could not do anything, but behind the party, Riders showed behind the party, Baksi floats in some cool motion scenes and in the dark of the sky. <br /> <br /> But as much as I like this movie Jackson, next, if technically, still good. And that's because of some original visual reasons. You know that Buxsh LTR combines animated characters (all habit and main cast) and mixes real actors covered with paint. I do not really have any problem using the actual people in the animation, but they do not fit very well with traditional cartoon images. This is especially true with people (Rohnar Ryder, people inside, etc.) Orcs are different, because they mean to look very different from other characters. Orcs are played by people with animation mix, look much better than the Jackson version. They have brown-green skin, shiny red eyes, flat face and sharp teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest screw-up of these films is Whitbus Visual, Huawear. Compared to Jackson, I like almost every character in the Bakhshi version, but there is definitely a higher habit in the future, in fact they are perfect. With Bakhshi you paint some annoying and rather weakly Disney Bambi. And you are forced to spend a lot of time with them in the movie, so beware. Again, the voice acting is okay with them, but the actor's face can not save "immersion damage" created by these little vials. Well, I really do not really like that half-hearted. <br /> <br /> General failure in Bakhshi script is well known. Limited time (with limited budget) and a lot of missing scenes. So this image contains nearly half the story, it does not do much in comparison to the Jackson version. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> - The overall atmosphere (it seems like more like Middle-Earth) - Above all, voice acting-music (I really like the song: Rolf Bakhshi version of LTRR is a higher: <br /> <br /> dig in and score fantastic rosenamyanera) - gyanlapha-agryagana (in the role of people in the heart of a) kim thiodena-araksa-Black riders elranda (he is not some fairy hippie!) <br /> <br /> Jackson Song Although karanati well: <br /> <br /> - because it added to the whole story - all the scenes and special effects-galuma / semegola /> <br /> balraga-habibitasa RAF link of the Lord Bakshi Even <br its well-known trutigulio, It is one of the best animation movies ever made and it holds Tokyo's fantasy world's atmosphere perfectly well, if it is not completely. I'll score 8/8 in 10.
