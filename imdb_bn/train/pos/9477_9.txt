This is a movie about deep and vague human relationships. <br /> <br /> They are finally spoken, but there is a chance to make some changes in the situation. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> There are still some weights about that history around the family. History usually contains the weight of Chinese literature and serious film. <br /> <br /> A young married couple - Lian, an illegitimate, and his wife, Uvain, lives in a large family compound, which is partially destroyed. <br /> <br> A bright contrast to Leon's younger sister can not really remember the past of the family but they accept everything in a normal way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Higher film.
