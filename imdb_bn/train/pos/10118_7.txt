I really like the movie Micoque about Yakuza, it was about 2 years ago I saw it and it really blew me **. As before such a sick and twisted thing is not seen. The story is good and the actors are not very well doing their thing. I did not see the UK or Japan version, but I must say that the German DVD is a little sensor. If you have not already seen the movie and are in Germany, you might want to see a DVD from Nederlands or Austria. The I-O DVD has a lot of hard and nasty scenes, but at the showdown I felt that there was something missing, almost one or two very brief scenes. <br /> <br /> Crazy character and high level violence with all the best distorted movies, that's what I love!
