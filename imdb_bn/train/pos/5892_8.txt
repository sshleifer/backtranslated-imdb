Thomas Incy was always a knack to bring the life of simple homemade stories with perfection and mood. "Italian" is such a film. Silent acting, especially George Buban, silent child actor George Bevan, junior, and wonderful sets have expressed the realistic sense of New York's elementary immigrant tension. The feature of this 1915 film is a fact which is unusual in these alcoholic features. <br /> <br /> The picture begins with a modern day and a man (Modern robes George Weber) began to read a story about Italian immigrants and then we transform into the stories of immigrants playing with George. He made enough money to bring his mother tongue from Italy to America, married him, and had a son with him. But times are hard and struggling to survive the family. I wondered why the mother did not breastfeed her child, and could avoid complications with dirty sources, but oh well, the initial dream factory was criticizing the political correctness for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best view in the film is that there is a chance to take revenge on Beban when he is falsely imprisoned and in the last moment he decides against his planned program. Very neat I liked the effects of the screen, it was great. <br /> <br /> I used to wonder in the light of this picture.
