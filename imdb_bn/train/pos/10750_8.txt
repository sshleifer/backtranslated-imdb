The incredible documentary kept all the furious chaos and grief throughout the NYC on that lucky morning on September 11th. Intense, personal, and completely riveting, 9/11 is probably the greatest documentary made by accident, which kind of gives it even a greater appeal. Until the morning, filmmakers Gideon and Jules Neuttee were going around the New York Firefighters team, especially going to pieces in a new piece, they were victims of a fireman shooting involving hard training. Another simple routine for filming that morning, with the help of cleanup, Zeus only hit the camera of the world trade center to record the only known images of the first plane and there was a simple document from there. <br /> <br /> Ground is given a first-hand account, such as near and near zero, as the fire fighters wonder A team has tried to navigate the stormy cameraman of this disaster. Without hesitation, Nudad follows this automatically designed heroes in the tower when their full support revolves around them. An unknown, lurking with more functionality of the raw sequence of the upcoming sequence, then we became less and less listeners and became visible for those who trapped inside as no imaginary production could ever fathom. Apparently, the older brother Gideon clearly held the whole city in a bigger and more vague fear, when they jointly testified. We see the collapse of the second tower, the cameraman covers itself from mysterious ruins, all of us have to wash our dust off the wonderful cluttered footage. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> In a few frustrating minutes we find them guilty that they have become like documents - instead of just saving lives, they knew that their footage should be saved, even if it costs their own security. Seeing 9/11 and coming out in 2002, I feel more annoyed with the recent presentation of Oliver Stone, the big budgeted World Trade Center. Many criticized the film, which focused unexpectedly focusing on eight people stuck in two rocks and even though I enjoyed the movie, it was great for small and emotional Hollywood focus, 9/11 but its film is totally obsolete. From this day it will not be the only firm conformation of the footpath, but only the middle of the intersection ensures that all the heart and character of this documentary will not have to be exciting again.
