I first captured the first movie (probably) in HBO, 1981, and the 15-year-old felt that the film was ridiculous. I do not see the imagery of Alfred E Neuman shown in the dramatic trailer. When MAD Magazine laughs and immediately pauses half the way off from the "normal gang", then pardoned himself for the cats of a cat like a cat, I thought they were enjoying themselves, which I was sure they were, but To find them seriously (and Ron Libman) so shameful to remove their names from a credit, I was surprised May. Of course there are many bad movies to be associated with. MAD references have been reinstated (at the age of 32) in the video on the video, I still came out of it. And Ron Lehmann fan is (Hot Rock, Where's Pappa?) I think it's the glory of his crown (tell it AGAAAINE)
