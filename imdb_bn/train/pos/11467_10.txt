This is the longest movie I've added most of the time. It was not only the kind of film her kind (school shooting) decided to determine the Ben Kokiso (director) film. He filmed it using teenage actors who was still attending high school. She filmed it in her own room of actors and the actor used to make the original parents as their parents in the film. Actors are also filming a lot using Camcoder which seems to be more like a video diary. It's almost saint. (If this is actually a word), but there are some slips, for example, when call brands (?) Land rover a range of rover (or, on the contrary, I saw it in a while)
