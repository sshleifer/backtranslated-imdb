It was a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein played wonderfully by Einstein, Walter Matthew, and his Cronic match maker played with his nephew (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). Between these major roles, mutual sequence is enhanced by a terrific supporter cast of well-recognized character actors. This movie is beautiful and funny ... a "feel good"! Hearty recommendations.
