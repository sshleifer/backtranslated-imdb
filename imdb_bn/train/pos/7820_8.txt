"The real story of friendship that is attracted to South Africa and the world over!" <br /> <br /> Richard Attenborough, who points out "A bridge to fir" and "Gandhi", wanted to bring the story of Steve Biko to life and journalist Donald Woods was going to get the trouble and trouble. Telling his story. Using the two books of wood for information on the data and the basis of "biko" and "problem of asking". <br /> <br /> This picture was held in South Africa in the late 1970's. South Africa is in the strongest form of the alphabet, which separates the black from the white and classifies the sadaad as a superior nation. Black cities are forced to live in Shantytown outside cities and cities, and police and army are often harassed. A Shantanayan attack was carried out in the morning by the assassination of Balartzar and Armed Police Force camps and even the residents. Then we got to know Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), who is a popular newspaper editor. After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods went to meet him. Two are conscious of each other, but soon they become good friends and the horrors of the Boko Racist system show them from the standpoint of Woods. It encourages Woods to talk about what's happening around him and makes him disappointed to present the story of Steve Biko to the white South African and the world. Soon, Steve Biko was arrested and murdered in prison. Now Woods and his family are daring to flee from South Africa to England, where Woods Steve sells his book about Biko and Racism. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about "Cree Freedom", I was in a movie dedicated to Steve Bikor's life. I have never heard of Steve Baikor before watching this movie because the events of this movie were before my time. But he did more to Donald Ouds' story and his journey across the border in Lesotho, because he tried to neglect South African officials. After the death of Steve Baco, Odds was kept in the house for five years. So to release his manuscript on Steve Biko, he had to flee. In South Africa, this manuscript will be considered betrayal and consequently woods may be combined with a similar fate of the bikes. Actually Donald Woods and his wife have acted as film consultants. <br /> <br /> Danzel Washington is only in the film for the first hour, and I was frustrated because I was waiting for her to see the movie. But he was amazing like Steve Bike, and I picked up his personality which I really read well and his pronunciation seems to be perfect. His performance earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The Kevin Kline is excellent as Donald Woods and has given the performance of thinking and Penelope Wilton is excellent as his wife, Ondy. <br /> <br /> Filming was held in Zimbabwe, because they did not have problems when trying to film it in South Africa. South Africa's Gestapo followed the movie crew everywhere, so they got bad VB and instead they went to neighboring Zimbabwe. Despite all, and racism did not end after seven years, "Cree Freedom" was not banned in South Africa. But movies shown in movies have received bomb threats. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the movie ends with a peaceful demonstration, the police shot him dead. The end of the film ends with all anti-racist films in prison and explanations for their death. Many were "no explanation". There were several "epilepsy", which was difficult to believe, and many more fell from the stairs or "hanging from hanging". No one will ever know what will happen to them, but I think it seems right that none of them died in their own hands; others died in their hands; Or to be more precise in the hands of the police. <br /> <br /> Movie to watch "Cree Freedom" Steve Biko's screenplay and a movie for the story. It's a beautiful land-split and a deadly and devastating illustration of racist isolation and brutal reception of violence.
