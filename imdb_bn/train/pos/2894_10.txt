In my childhood, I always hated "Cinderella" because my two sisters left me when my parents were considering buying Disney Movies. I wanted "Dumbo," but my sister won, and we got "Cinderella". They followed the room with my Star Wars action figures and followed the room with full slice of the movie. <br /> <br /> A lot of things have changed. My love for Disney theme parks gave me an internship at Walt Disney World, and now I have two younger brothers. I want to show Disney as soon as possible, and we recently saw "Cinderella" together. With my new gratitude for all that Disney, I saw "Cinderella" with a new perspective and was impressed by what I saw. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film, I did not quite understand why Cinderella was stuck in such a horrific accident. Why was he such a slave of his stepfamily, and why he could not just escape? I was not very sympathetic towards Cinderella, but after the story progressed, I was drowning myself in the story. Perhaps attractive surveillance or funny-loving characters hold me, or perhaps it was timeless songs. Like listening to the song "BBBD-Bobby-Bu" and "A Dream and Dream Your Heart Make", I was returned to theme parks. While looking at the terrible inspirational Cinderella Kassel, I can portray myself in an unexpected and funny atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Some of these films just reveal Disney's magic. It can blame a lot of people, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed like Cinderella who are encouraged in this fabulous world, and you know what I mean. Pictures of Cinderella and Glass Slip - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tycumber - Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the world. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is not the most powerful story, it's a symbol of Disney and movie history. It represents the fun, idealistic, and imaginative wonders that we had kids. I imagine this movie has many meanings to many people. It can not be my favorite Disney movie, but it represents the love and praise that comes with me about it. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 10/10 My yahoo! Grade: A (Excellent)
