Well, the movie is not exactly "funny". <br /> <br /> Well, I acknowledge that there are a few lines, but clearly nothing is ridiculous. For example: just before a steamy sexual scene between Elinique and his man, sh is handcuffed from the toilet and he can not remove his shirt. Before leaving the room to recover the key, he told him, "OK, do not go anywhere." See, ridiculous, but not funny. <br /> <br /> The plot and acting are quite good. <br /> <br /> But Erica Elinike clearly stole the show. She is hot and sexy and has a real steamy scene with anyone that can not help but review it again. <br /> <br /> There are some other sexy scenes with her and some exciting lines of her. <br /> <br /> Overall, 5 stars. I would rather give three if I was not for the Irilla Eliinac.
