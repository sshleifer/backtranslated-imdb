After having friends traveling to Detroit, MI, and New York balls, I fell in the lifestyle of being a member of the House. I joined The House of the Dias. We accept the same rules as most of the houses, but we were professional crackers, which will awaken the customer's card fraud and we can enjoy the fantastic jewelry and clothes we like. I even learned how to make checks and driver licenses and how to monetize them in seventeen states, until an envious queen tells me secret service and I go to the federal jail. But, I learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I recommend you show it yourself. You can even read about criminal activity at home in Detroit. My book, Identity Schemes, is available at Amazon.com or Identity Schemes.com. But trust me, it's a lot better than Paris because it's made in 2005.
