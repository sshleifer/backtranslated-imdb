Russell, my fav, fantastic in this picture. But more than that, this film covers a wide range of human emotions and sorrow. Everything from homosexuality to marriage and is tackled. The film realizes the viewer that the tolerance of another man provides the way to preserve humanity. The fabulous love story in Lachlin and Lil. I replay over their scene again. Anyone who has ever been loving will empathize with these people. All the characters are thrown and are illustrated nicely.
