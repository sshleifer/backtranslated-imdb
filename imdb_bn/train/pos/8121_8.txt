At the edge of the war a message of the world is ignored by the people; In 1940, the first historic city represented England, but it could stand against any country in the world. When the war reaches the end, its demolition does not last for five more years, but by 1966, every city was completely destroyed. Adding to the condemnation and toll on humanitarianism is "a serious illness", which is a pandemic that has been going on for four years. <br /> <br /> "Upcoming things" conform to both a deadly and future worldview, where science has a hope for a revived civilization. The concept of "World of the World" is somewhat fun, though its spokesman Cable (Raymond Massey) is steadfast in his mission and dedicated himself to the cause. If he fails, others will follow. This message has been consistently strengthened around the world, Messi is firmly back home in the film's speech. In order to test the extent of knowledge and achievement, there is no need for a "all universe or anything" psychology of man's insufficient need. <br /> <br /> The picture of the second half automation and equipment is a memorable "metropolis" of the great silence film. Evertyau was rebuilt and transformed by 2036, reflecting the city's resurgence philosophy, as a result of the bright predictive aspect of the film, as the introduction of today's modern cities architecture. Although the film was a mistake for seven years, but it was the first operation of the moon, it seemed to be more lawful than the year 1969, perhaps a hundred years in 1936. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film's tradition, a picture that you think. Which direction do you want to progress in the face of uncertainty or to maintain any condition? This is not a comfortable question, because both choices offer underlying risks and unknown results. Those who prefer to be scales, move away from the forces outside their control.
