Once when I was in college and we had an international fair, a Soviet era poster was "Ne Bolt!", Which means "Do not shut up!" For TV viewers "generations" I "have translated" as "Gladys do not get crayed!" (In reference to neighbor's neighbor in "Beijingchid"). <br /> <br /> However, when you see the results of Gossip in private. Snafu's short "rumor", you see that it is not quite funny. In this case, an intelligent soldier always raises some of the bomb attacks and immediately estimates that access power attacks the United States. So, he tells someone, who says to someone else, who tells someone else, and it continues. As "Russians are coming, the Russians are coming", the story blossoms more than ever, so that when it comes back to Snafu ... well, you know what I know! Yes, this is often WWII promotion - complete with an insulting word for Japanese - but I have to say that Pvt. Snafu Shorts was actually quite funny. Of course, due to the writing of Dr. Sauss and the mail blanks, there was no surprise that these were rather quiet. Worth watching.
