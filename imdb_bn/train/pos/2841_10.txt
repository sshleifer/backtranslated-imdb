As a fan of Paris Jataimi, I went to see New York, I love you with very high expectations. I was happy to meet with all the expectations I met. It was fun, sweet, fast, and entertaining. The film's two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha) tried to go to the same area but disputes the way they went. That was funny, and then the film goes on to some of the best skits I've ever seen. All the good ones were four amazing ones. Those four people will start talking to me. A hotel in Shiite La Bououf has a belp-like feature that finds love among an elderly lady. Later, Orlando Bloom, as a music producer who is working with a woman working for Christina Rixie. Another Anton is presenting Eelchin and Olivia Tharblick for both promotions, Theirbly's character is helpless. The best one features Eli Wahlach and Claris Leachman as an annoying old couple. I'll take a look at that Natalie Portman Directions directs a managing director and compiles a skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are a fantastic man and hooker. In New York, I love you definitely as well, 2006 is better than JeTTime Paris. Skits are well-seasoned, and movies show how indie films should be. However, the film is not as famous as Paris Jatim, so it is wonderful to live with its superiority. If you want to laugh then see some great dramatic effects, look up the great acting and only after the playback will certainly be seen in New York, I love you.
