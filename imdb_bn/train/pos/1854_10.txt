With a critical eye for the film, and with the love for the good movie, I went looking for antioxon fishing with my breath. Although I am an incredible fan of Denzel Washington, both his actor and his personal personality; I am an honest enough fan who (very few) admire when he did not hit a picture or two. And I could be wrong about them - after all, I'm not the actor. But it was different - Danger will pour out his career experience and guide, a movie that will handle the most sensitive issues known to people - the misuse of the child. As its director debuts, less. And the film indicates that it will successfully represent a man's victory. I did not want to be frustrated. <br /> <br /> and I was not. <br /> <br /> What I have seen is a film that is associated with various audiences committed, and given the inexperienced viewer a young person, but the real eye was in the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but in spite of that victory. This image did this - and the dry eyes of any color in the theater proved this. Anyone can know about the topics in this film to tell if the truth is presented. When you do not experience it you take a talented film maker to tell you the story firmly. And if he can draw more viewers, and give emotional reactions to the audience's response, then the filmmaker did his job. In which movie Black, white, purple or potted dotted That makes good movies. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and most, Antovon Fisher - you've really won.
