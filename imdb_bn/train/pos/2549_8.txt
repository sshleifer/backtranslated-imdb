Surprisingly, Ronald Coleman has been shown here like some of his films. She is literally in every scene and this ridiculous movie is fresh for her reasons, yet still beyond her. She is handsome, malicious and very clever, because she is one step ahead of her horror, lovely wife - Annie has played perfectly. The movie is based on a French game and that hunger brings all the good qualities. Most of the foremost supporters are well-known, at least not in the face ... and perfect for this very funny movie. As a combination of excellent Mr. Coleman San Connie and Clark Gabelle, he made another letter forward a step forward. Her multi-talent can be praised on the classic "Lost Horizon" which must be seen in every movie buff.
