The photography was nice but it was difficult to understand what was happening ... there were many symbols? ... 2 golden fish - did they mean something in Thai culture? There are not many plots, many do not happen and it's just the manders along. No real start, no real middle and no real end. Rather rather dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to get into letters because you never knew that you knew them ... which were fantastic and it was realistic to know. The steps felt chaotic and upset. I do not know what Pang brothers wanted to achieve. Maybe if I was Thai, there would be more knowledge ...
