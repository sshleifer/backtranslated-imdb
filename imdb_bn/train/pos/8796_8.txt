<br /> <br /> Everything is relative, eleven pieces can be the primary theme from the beginning by this set 11 by the director. That is, what may be the number one priority for people like Bush, Blair and the company may not be for many other common people, the general public. From the beginning, the Iranian teacher is trying to influence the most important thing on her younger students, which does not affect the children, such as the death of neighbors and such incidents obviously affect them more. New York, in contrast to any incident in the United States, establishes this series of documentary-style pieces that are often not equal to all men in the world trying to predict. <br /> <br /> Although, of course, the WTC's attack was not an accident, one thought that both politicians and TV cameras show tendency to blow things out of all ratios - this piece of shocking looks together. The same reaction has happened at the international level, if Lagos is attacked, say, or Jakarta, even in Rio de Janeiro? I do not think so. The news seems to be a victim of distortion based on the incident: Italy's earthquake has more TV time, than ten times more devastating in outer Mongolia. The greater distance seems to reduce the range of disasters. <br /> <br /> Eleven pieces help to keep this series in a better perspective - or perhaps, I should say, some pieces should be made, with each freedom fighter made his own story, independently translated his own perspective, Not possible, but for each segment of the eleven minutes separately. In any way, it should not be considered in any way by American anti American films: It is a very easy reading of the various messages published through the segment. However, this is not American. Eleven segments take different attitudes and general links - if there is - it is the disaster of the WTC attack that will be seen from the perspective on different perspectives. Only then will people like George Bush begin to understand this planet. <br /> <br /> In one volume, I believe in mine, I have been taking shelter for two years now: America has not learned education. And the lesson is to share this planet with the rest of humanity in the United States - it does not dominate the ruthless economic effort or simply by general power. Instead of learning that the United States can not continue printing everywhere and everywhere, his political leaders helped with the help of Blair (and even today) and became even more arrogant, even in Afghanistan nobody is doing good work. Or now in Iraq, let alone somewhere else. The White House mentality is totally rejectionable: in the US and UK, Iraq attacks and destroys all the disturbances and thus they have to eliminate the mess - the United Nations and other nations should not be stressed to help and thus there will be easy unrest in the way. . <br/> <br /> <br /> Radical stances in the United States (or even Israel) are only meeting the fundamentalist position of Islamic people, who have been awakening hardliner fundamentalists for covering their own stage for many years. Unselfishness, that is, throw stones at the death of women or dust from the upper part of their heads. <br /> <br /> The energy generated by the greed of some wealthy countries in the world does not seem to look or understand anything from a much bilateral perspective. Eleven separate pieces of this film illustrate this dull and stupid posture properly.
