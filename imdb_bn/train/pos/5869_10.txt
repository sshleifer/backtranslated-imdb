After watching only a beautiful composition by Diner Hunter, the film Jackey had big shoes. This is the same theme as the diamond hierarchy, devastating effect on a person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in the movie, like The Hero Hunter and is very good here, like Cathy Baker. But this film is based in Ed Harris, who gave a strong, emotional and influential performance. The film was based on a stage and one or two scenes where I had a clear feeling. This means that for one or two scenes I felt that I was watching a stage game. It was not a big deal and it does not really reduce the film. This film is not an epic like Hun Hunter of Die. They are of the same era and have similar themes, but they have two different movies. I thought Hero Hunter was great, and I think this movie was a great one. It's acting that makes it so great. For me, Jackinf a 10/10
