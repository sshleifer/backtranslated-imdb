This is a great movie, I've done it a while ago. It was an extra zing - it's about zing. I love Vanessa Williams like Rosie, and Jason Alexander is also a good voice. It was a lot better. The setting was very good. It makes it quite long, except for 2 hours and 50 minutes. Overall I give it 8.5 stars. They added some part, but it was still cool.
