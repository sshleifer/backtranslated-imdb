I saw film shooting several days in the film during the summer, the final result was just two scenes in the movie. The location was in Lake Seilan in the Black Hills. Bring Wagon, Wagon Closing etc. So this Dakota was waiting to see the young movie and was not frustrated. The local Buffalo heel was culled so shooting scenes were for real. (Yes Doris, the animals were hurt during filming) I think the last Jack Nicholson is on his shoulders? A great western / social comment from 50 This should be used as a social statement such as the High Noon for the true Western drama, or the blockboard for the 50-year-old youth in the same class as jungle or rebellious debate.
