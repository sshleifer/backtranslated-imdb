I like lanely lady better Give a break in Pia. She looks great and she has really nice eyes. What do you like? The scene where a garden was raped by Ray Liotta with hose was fair and cruel. Actually, there are some elements in this movie which are fairly cruel and cruel. But it's a trashy movie. The trash that many movies are not bad at all. I like it better than the doll's valve, which was rather annoying but not just the trash. At least this was not boring. <br /> <br /> It gets nude in pain and seems to be wrong as a writer. His conversation about Pushkin and Byron with a man was three times incredible as his age. I'm sure Peir is a wonderful person in real life, he just did not think of the author. She was working as a man from Saturday night fever for a man and she looked much happier when wearing a shiny disco dress. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are fun. She is pregnant while being a two-time actor and she turns her eyes and makes her graduate to "stop hanging around", she always insists on every insignant that actually falls apart. <br /> <br /> Piya's nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably wrong for a supernova to go over it (floating face and fridge-frame scream - yes!) And its next catatonic stripe type is overdone. <br /> <br /> The lecture taken is a hot, though. I'd like to see the lecture that someone plays in a class. <br /> <br /> But, again, this trash we're talking about. You can get worse in any of the weeks in eight weeks.
