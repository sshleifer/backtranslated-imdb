This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes me on a roller-coaster passion. I smile and cry and hate and love and love! These two hours a little more! <br /> <br /> All the acting actresses! I must mention Michael Nickich's leading actor. He does a great job !! I also appreciate Torr acting actor, who has played such a mentally challenged young man firmly! He reminded me of the Gilbert wine leonardo de Caprios roll! And then there are the most beautiful songs in the world: Gabriel's sng. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone to see and enjoy!
