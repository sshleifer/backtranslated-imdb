What's with all the negative comments? After seeing this film for the first time tonight, I can only say that it is a good holiday comedy that can ensure the brightness of a single person's day. When I saw that the drum (Ben Affleck) could leave alone, I wanted to cry. You want to know why you want to see movies. Also, after a while I like Tom (James Gandalfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate), if you ask me, they were genuine snobs. However, this film smiles me and thinks well inside. Before I wrap this, I want to say that Mike Mitchell has hit a pure holiday. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this holiday comedy that any single person's day is sure to highlight any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who does not see it.
