I first saw the Revitting Documentary for the first time in its first initial release in 2001 and it had a profound impact on me, so I got to plant some of my friends to see it with me in the recurring screenings. Bottom line: My friends go away frustrated (never!). This ornate film is about the Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldworthy, who uses the natural ingredients (wood, water, flowers, stone, etc.) to create the most beautiful pieces of art, which eventually produce pieces that come back in their natural form (Temporary condition in a statement Everything?). We see Goldswirt doing a number of temporary work in the temporary industry, as well as large galleries around the world, as well as some of the natural parts of its world that have long-term installations. German filmmaker Thomas Radelfheimer took photographs and edited this meditation on the creative process, which is a real treat for both eye and ear (including Fred Firth's composition and an enclosed music score performed, whose music is usually the usual experimental / sound textured guitar, as well as musicians an ensemble ). Although this movie is available in the DVD for several years but if you can find a movie that highlights the resurgence of this subtle movie, find it in every way (it is easily a movie that was compiled for a big screen), in fact, to enjoy this movie properly For a skilled sound system). There is no MPA rating, but there is nothing objectionable (if the live birth of a sheep is not confiscated or disturbed on the screen)
