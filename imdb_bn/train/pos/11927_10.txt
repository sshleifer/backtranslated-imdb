I have to say in spite of it's reviews Outfield Angels was a pretty good movie. I always teach kids to believe and will not really be disappointed because yes miracles can happen. Compared to other baseball films, it stands as a special movie hit, surprisingly special effects and good orchestral soundtrack which was very interesting. Although I love this movie, some flaws (for example, when Ray Mitchell hits a Homer when he does not hit the plate, and therefore, this is not a score.) I have to say I was really impressed with the presence and morality of this movie: Just believe, Do not give up.
