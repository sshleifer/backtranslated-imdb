I love this movie because I grew up around tide racing. My father reminded me of Pat Boian behind Slki, who was drawn to the troters because, like the jockeys thoroughly, weighing weight of normal height could be a driver. Yes, the house of 1944 in India is a good movie, but it is a very different movie. April love light and easy to see, think of a good movie. (Although the religious / moral view of Pat's banned him from kissing the girl, it is frustrating, most of the changes to today's standard rents). Indiana home with Walter Brennan (whoever shines in black and white colors) will be more satisfied with the final achievement. It will make stress and struggle better, but it will require a greater mental investment.
