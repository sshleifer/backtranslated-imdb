Zia Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not only has it shot in the year but now. This is an art film which is not even older than the 21st century. The director maintains a good narrative skill and thus makes the story so much smoother! <br /> <br /> The movie reminds me of the next French new wave movie: Frankie's Trufft's "Fame D'Kit" similar thing.
