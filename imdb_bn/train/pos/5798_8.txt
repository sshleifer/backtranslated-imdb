I first saw it when they showed the Easter time of 1993/4 and did not even think most of it, so I bought it in DVDs last summer when I got Michael Jackson (I liked his song earlier) and now enjoy more. I am old This is a good film but it will not be a classic film like Sound of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard of Oz etc. Michael Jackson was a good actor and was a member of other cast members. The little girl Katie smiled by the gangster Frankie Leydie, who played Joe Pacey. My little boy scared me when Michael became a robot. My favorite song in the film was a smooth criminal, I think it was better than the thriller.
