This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I want to publish the movie by touching the theme. I think a sentence "repeats history itself". What is shown in the film is life: when people are young, they do not understand their parents, their husbands; There is a lot of excuse for people to share their favorite time with their children until late; People always have to work hard to support the whole family, but it is only liable to ignore the fine feelings of their partners; People always change their perspective at different stages of their life; People can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their loved ones; People's relationships in this world are not much more important than blood, and their people are not too late to understand them at their best, so that they get better understanding in order to end their life, Humans should not keep their words or express regret and always have hope --- a new life. Actor and actress is fantastic. They fully understood the director's intentions. The attraction of the film is to me, the effect of bringing an efficient and gorgeous combination of cheers and tears to the audience
