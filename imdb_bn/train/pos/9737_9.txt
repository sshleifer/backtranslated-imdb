The remarkable performance from Simon Pegg gets better and better with every role. Naturally, he plays the part of a very shiny character, who sometimes wants to hide behind your cushion in his embarrassment for him, but Peg is everything. <br /> <br /> Smiles regularly and tears, and each of them pays attention. The film combines very cleverly, where every character plays very sophisticated and serious parts, where Pen is involved only with humor which is a huge achievement to director Robert Weid. <br /> <br /> And I can not let go of this congratulations to Gilliam Anderson who shone across a fast round. Highly recommend all.
