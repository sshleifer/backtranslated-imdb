ABC has done more for this event, allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spad to join the cast of this event. Initially, the show was visible and even predictable with John Ritter and Katie Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and three kids are really a solid professional cast. In the real life of life John struck my house for hours after the death. I lost my father at the age of 17 and could sympathize and understand their pain and suffering. ABC should be proud to maintain this show and should also save it as John's final wish. This show has matured and improved in such a situation as impossible. They should be rewarded with Emmys.
