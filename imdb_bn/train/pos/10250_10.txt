Guinea Pig: The Devil's experiments are without any doubt. ***** In the first scene, they have a raw realistic vague and annoying appearance in the dark side of its human nature. Does this movie reach the point correctly, what are you thinking of? The point is just satisfied with the extreme violence and fan of gore. This film is somewhat important, at least one woman is being tortured. There are really only 3 scenes that can be considered grave. Guinea Pig, though I'll tell you one thing: The Devil's test shows hostility like Street. If you think that the hostile is a crazy victim of a fatal boring persecution but you did not see half of it until you saw the Guine Pig: The Devils Exam. <br /> <br /> Movie rating 0-5, Gore 0- 10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: The Devil's Test (Uncut) ***** (7)
