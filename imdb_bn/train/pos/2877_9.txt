I do not think you would tell the story. It has been called for years and years. So I'll just share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. Since then I was a Disney child in a good way. Animations now feel pillow and old silver, but that's part of his charm now. Now, at the age of high school musical and computer-generated images, people seem to have forgotten the talent and magical essence of early Disney movies. Thankfully, I was introduced earlier this year so that I was born before that. And think of how old I am, I look back at VHS that the five-year-old returned back. Disney is the true magic
