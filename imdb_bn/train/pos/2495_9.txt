A curious, malicious and family life is a wonderful one! Writer Andrew Marshall wrote something that is funny, forboding and sometimes terrible! Yes, 2 point 4 children are not fooled by the pleasant tune and bubble letters; The show has a dark side, and can be mostly cool at times. And which is so good about the show, it's not just a simple sitcom where each character is 2D comic device (case with my family). Instead of fully rotating characters that show people's passion full roller coaster. Sometimes dark moments have become frustrated by the curse, such as the bill and Ben is waking up in a bizarre village, it is two examples of the show, which is extremely dark, which helps in adding depth. The show is incredibly funny, and is sure to make you smile. It's a real shy Eureka Video DVD stopped releasing this ridiculous gold. Your last hope to keep incredible episodes in Veoh.com shops
