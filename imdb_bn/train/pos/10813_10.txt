I came to see the incredible Athel Waters, whose autobiography I am now reading. When the dry chop and watermelon references begin, I will remove my jaw, but people can not see this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece. This is a small picture made by blacksmiths, when the entertainment industry was completely disconnected for blacks and the people involved in the rookery of their time, the old tendency is too much for humor. We see the same thing in modern black films, but the new tendencies (stereotype), "yes" and "hood" and so on. I think if you look back for eighteen years, you will see today's movies as racist. Waters should appreciate this film, Waters' talent and pint size, Sammy Davis Jr., who has ruined the contemporary, Sheryli Temple, and has seen remarkably similar faces as an adult. Everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun in it. Why should not it be enjoyable for it, instead of enjoying it?
