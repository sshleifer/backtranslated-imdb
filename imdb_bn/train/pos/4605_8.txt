This is not one of the greatest Jackie Chan films, but one of the greatest Kung Fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> We came to expect chancellors stunt, quick and creative action. Movies, and benchmarks set for others to follow this one. It is a two-hour pure entertainment, through which all the ways affect. <br /> <br /> As well as superb actions, we have an effective story and credible characters, writing chances of taking more Chan views which Chan took, combining the East Resolution Method (ie ass stick). <br /> <br /> Overall, it's fun, serious, entertaining, and terrestrial. Of course, for any Kung-Fu fan, there will be a wide range of accessible access to the film community at the same time.
