8 Simple rules for dating my teenage daughter were a happy start. Professor-talented Tom Shadidak was involved in the project. This means that the comedy will not be anything less than spectacular philosophy and that's exactly what happened: One of the newest, fun, wonderful shows ever made in a very long time. Each line, facial expression, casting choice, scene, wreaked all perfection After one episode I did not think, "The man who was not as good as the rest". Each one had a standout. Again, such perfection we came to expect from Tom. For those who do not know, Tom Shadyak, AC Ventura's director (first film), Nutty Professor (first one) and Leir Leer. Quite a resume. He is not a producer who is not here, but his magic touch is felt in every episode. Family includes: <br /> <br /> Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): Excellent, little neurotic, may be a pushover, from time to time, works as a sports writer. John unfortunately died in 2003 with a lady's memory and the idea of ​​cancellation confirmation near the suit. <br /> <br /> Mother Kate (Katie Sagal): Come on, did not you fall in love? He plays with Peggy over the kids? Al Bandy was our hero. We respect him to the audience and love he never had. But Peg's dead, parasite, without lazy lifestyle, might have probably been another Chicago father instead of Mage, which Peg created (life, in fact) him. Katey was then an MIFF and is still: Now a Brun (instead of a red head) and buxom such as ever. Kate is the conservative mother and loving wife. I know it's annoying words, but ridiculously, he fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> Datiej Blonde Girl: Bridgette (playing in perfection by Kali Cauco): Often no fools have played so well. In addition to the Grade of Grade of Grade, the bridget can be shoes for any award given by this shoes. Bridget is shallow, self-centered, very bright and her face is a tad slutty. She absolutely plays the role of fools blonde better than IMO. Perfection One of the show's high points. <br /> <br /> Geeky girl: Kerry (Emmy Davidson): A brun and a geek, she gets no love from life or circumstances. It is felt, most of the times are undeveloped and neglected. She is the younger sister of Brigitte (actually older than her), and the very opposite personality of both and the brain creates endless clashes for our great pleasure. Son: Rory (Martin Spongers): The most exciting character before the pass of the second, IMO, then John passes, new characters come and Rory is a wise-cracking oral-problem-maker that he did not use. : That mostly went to the character of David Spade. <br /> <br /> These characters were dominant during John Roberter's time. Unfortunately enough, too much sunny Larry Miller (one of my darling) will not get plenty of screen time. He played Paul's colleague / rival. After the cost of an octical separation cost in 2003 (September 11th), after the life of Rotor, the program was interrupted for some time. Nobody thinks that it can return, but it has been followed by the next few new additions. The second stage of this event began, and the new letters were: <br /> <br /> Hard, confident school Principal: Ed (Adam Armin): I saw Adam in talk shows there. This is the first time that I saw him do something. Impressed, I use the word. Her performance was very impressive. Sorry he was not brought before. After passing Paul, he also liked the potential love of CAT. Growing progress towards this point (which initially seems crazy) creates a lot of praise. It was gradually done with constant respect to Paul (Ritter), carefully and wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Jim Egan (James Garner): After the series is surprisingly welcomed, he finally completes the cannon for 'old' jokes, mainly ... <br /> <br /> 35 years Wife of unemployed, intelligent mother drunk half-brother: CJ (playing with enormous fun height by David Spade): I knew Spade was funny, I just did not know this was fun. Somehow, the familiar presence of the spade is understood inside his character (opposing his split character), which can be understood, because he is a comic and he is in a comedy show. This stupid feeling that David Spade's movie, a great deal of proprietary content from talk shows and functions (reward shows, etc.) and spades great and uncompromising disguise of the comedy style, is a great feeling. That means I understand that he is not trying to play any other or completely new character: he's a fool, funny spad we've got, and he takes this delightful ridiculous formula to the absolute top. Every line he said, literally all the classic, he was born, each sarcasm. Spade was fun-funny; So, so funny. <br /> <br /> The show's laugh and drama were lagging behind, but the audience thought, "John has passed, it will not be there". It is worth understanding, we are talking about the population (American viewers) who gave 'yes dear' a free journey, but Andy Ricester controls the world to cancel at any time. As the quality of the show increased, its ratings were denied. Soon it was sorry, and there was. <br /> <br /> And I saved the best for the last: The child was treated with married fans. And boy, what was it a treat. I still mocked to remember it It's a wonderful thing that it will be crazy for me, even if I legally do this under the "spoiler ..." context. It will be forgotten that this is something that you will never forget. I do not know me :-)
