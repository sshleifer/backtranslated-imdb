There is something in this movie that produces bad movies to show - drunken editing, little continuity, mad dialogue, bad acting (you can even say existence), continuous story lines, shots that last a long time in FAR ... and This is perfect for MSST 3K-style refining, not to mention "Corus Eaters Drink Game": Sketch Forms ... Take a shot - Please sign your name. No ... take a shot - edit bad folie ... take lots, lots of shots <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And despite his crazy badness, it's just an hour long - hell, such a movie should have been at least 20-30 minutes!
