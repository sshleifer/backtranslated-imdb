The most shiny fat guy in martial arts does it again. The hero of his character, Bruce Lee, an original Samo movie that imitates Samo, is amazingly amazing as his action and war. He returned to the style of Bruce and then returned to his own, the more familiar Kung Fu is a delight to see it and shows how successful and adaptable he is in his industry. Very kind of Flickr and all of this movie - Comedy (like some unintended, fake black guy), action and some incredible fight scenes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A great beer And friend movies are worth at any time and a half price.
