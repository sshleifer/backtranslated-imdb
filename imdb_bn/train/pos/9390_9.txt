This movie started me on Nick Kid kick. It is a story and full of twists and turns- a purpose and drive movie. Of course, Dennis Hooper was ham, but J. Walsh and Laura Flynn are the perfect couple in Bucket to catch vague people who fall in their web. Everything about this movie is good - movies, storytelling and maximum end. The best thing he does is adapt to it - it should not be an action hero, but there must be a man trapped in the trap of life.
