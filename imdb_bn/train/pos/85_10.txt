When I saw a combination of red balloon in Birmingham Southern College in 1975, I saw this image sub Both films are similar to their dream-like quality. A large part of the photo is happily swimming in his bowl, when his new owner, a little boy went to school. A cat house and his bowl enters the room where, and strongly his "hunting." The boy began to walk from school, and was surprised to see whether the visitor would take the time to save his wonderful friend. The fish gets excited by the presence of cat, and finally jumps from the bowl! The cat quickly walks towards the fish, slowly lifting her with her legs and bringing her a bowl. The boy comes back happily with his fish, no one is an expert. <br /> <br /> The end is amazing in both its hatred and its technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the film could drag technical achievements in 1959 - it seems to be another strategy for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you find it you see it - do not you be disappointed! And if you find * it * you can let me know so I can get a copy too!
