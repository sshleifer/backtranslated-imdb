"Erendira" is a film from Mexico that is rarely spoken. The film is only available in a low quality VHS format. It's a shame that the movie was not released on a DVD release. "Erendira" is stunning and pretty with its magic-realistic image. Based on a short story from "Erndida" novel "100 Year Solidudes". Erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burned down in her grandmother's house. Her ill-gotten grandmother, who played by Irene Papas, forced her to finance prostitution. The entire city gets a piece of eerdidas, so to speak. Although the subject sounds harsh, the film does not enjoy sexuality. It is done in a mature artistic manner. The film has some amazing costume. Some of the more intriguing aspects of the most watched movie are the Aurigimi bird, which is a queen of the original bird and a golden orange with a diamond in the center. Erendira manages to cast an amazing film, even humorous. It is definitely a movie that is worthy of a special DVD release. They said in Espnole, "S Mu Muie Bienne !!! Excellent!
