Just seen the season 1 but it's just great !! Different types of stuck on an island. Some people do not think and everyone seems to have skeletal loads in their closet .... It seems that Melrose Place caters to the family of Crusoe and why is so great? This is probably not a full spoon of X files, which gives a dose of "key" ads? And a big "hey" and an island which you all dream about - and in your freakiest nightmare you can be lost. The story got so much twists and makes it incredible. Great setup, with a recognizable acceptance of the release that everyone at the end (well everyone ... I think ...) is in good and bad way. But odd oh so weird ...
