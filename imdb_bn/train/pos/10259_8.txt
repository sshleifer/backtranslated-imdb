Many of the series are good creators! But most of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining, fairly entertaining. Especially Satan's experiments have some fantastic effects - not only the notorious avalable views, but a very realistic skin ribbon at the foot and a hand with a Slaghammer are very realistic - especially for the video's alcohol and low budget. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Its plot is easy to stand: A young girl is kept in a few men and forced to bear the continuation of cruel torture to see where her breaking point is. It is related to cruel violence - all effective real effects including the application of a hot oil painful search to the hand of the assistant girl in the last paragraph and to set the maggots in the Assistant Flashy Sheet. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the video is the most effective sequence, and there is a vague pillar session, where three men drop their head and kicks the girl in the second order while kissing her girl. And pushing him to the ground. These two scenes are clearly played and refrain from the reality of the other activities. <br /> <br /> Acting actress is quite convincing to suffer pain and misuse of abuse and camera rough elements. His reaction such as his headphones, his head, and his tongue were well-warmed. If any rest is given to him during any other misuse, he is kept confined in a single tree from his nest. There is also a boring scene where on her and another humiliating strange scenery where she spends an office chair and she pukes up until Jack Daniels is forced to drink a bottle. Hope you did not see this series, I helped you to determine whether you want to make this episode shot. 8.5 / 10 for devil's test.
