I'm not a big fan of martial arts, but the video shop was almost empty and Jett Lee was in Lethal Weapon 4 and when I rented the other tenants I rented it, I rented it as it did. I absolutely love, my flatmate and I (22-year-old biochemistry and accountanti student) made strange Kung Fu words and spent half an hour and threw seeds curd by each other. I can not explain it (well maybe a little bit Tikila). I never enjoyed brushing up Bruce Lee, skinny blocks, big hit throws, beat him, big bloke etc. Feel Jackie Chan with less comedy and more action.
