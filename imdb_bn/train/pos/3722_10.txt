First of all, I did not know anything about this movie, I knew that Joel Shuva did it and it was enough for me. A friend and I went to see it at the Danish Film Festival, which is known as the Night Holidays, which are shown in several movies which show a number of movies which are especially special for most movies that would otherwise not be shown in the Danish theater. <Br. <br /> However, my friend and I went to see it and how real it was and we were really surprised to see a cord with our feeling, we really plotted without taking the plot. Which is a great plus of our book. <br /> <br /> This picture is written in a style that reminds me of the Danish venture "Datma 95", which started with Lars von Tier (4 Danish directors including Dancer Inner). The Dark) <br /> <br /> <br /> The conclusion is really valuable, it gives a different perspective on how it was for American GI. Expecting to get out of school at Joe School is expected to serve their country from a long way from home. <br /> <br /> Also Colin Farrell is awesome in this movie, I have not seen her before but I can not wait more of her. <br /> <br /> Lars P.
