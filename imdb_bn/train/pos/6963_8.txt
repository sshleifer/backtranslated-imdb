A big surprise, probably because I was expecting it to suck. The reviews were quite beautiful, although they all agreed that the idea was golden: A man discovered that his new girlfriend is a super hero, and when he wants to break apart, he is like a spirit like him. I keep hope of falling apart, but it's not really that. Sure, it does not make it as great as its unmatched determination, and it can be better to extend the film's universe. But I can not blame for it. Umar Thurman is a superhero of the couple, gorgeous as G-Girl. And I discovered, after a few years of disliking him, that throwing a light Wilson as a schlub could be absolutely perfect. He got two of the best comic performances of 2006 (the other is mostly in undisclosed idiocres). When he and Tharman were first sex, I absolutely cracked up the expression on his face. It's one of the fun sexual scenes ever. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a little smiling, just as it is incredibly Perhaps with some background I could take it well. I can forgive her mistakes, though, I was really good at seeing it. Sure, undereated.
