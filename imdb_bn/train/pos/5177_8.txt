I've seen last night not to meet it over the past few years. This is a really funny little movie, most of which you do not know. Arkin always shines as See it; You will not be dissappointed. However, it was just released from the DVD and, in contrast to its packaging, it has been widescreen. Transfers are rather poor, but at least WHOLE movies are visible. ;-)
