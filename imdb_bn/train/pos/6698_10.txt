I love Sabrina Tucun Wich and I've seen every single episode. I think when I used to sit in the evening at 6pm every night and I waited for Nikloden, but when Sabrina left High School, the show started flying. The best series was when she was friends with Valerie (I'm sure that no one). From there the next series (friend with Dreamee) was still good, but it does not seem right when he leaves high school. All the main characters seemed to be the rest, which meant that the old "Dazzling" was not as high, but in the first series where Sabrina is still in college, she is still relatively good and watchful, but her aunt's vacation and Sabrina do not have it at their home. She is no longer a teenager, so the name of the show is not correct, and the show is not right, except for Hilda and Gelda and Josh, especially when Sabrina married Harvey. In the last five minutes of yesterday, he thanked Mars for carrying him. In the end, I still like to see older episodes of Sabrina the Kisses Week, but I think the authors have taken it too far and will leave High School with Sabrina. After that the show obviously lost some magic to it
