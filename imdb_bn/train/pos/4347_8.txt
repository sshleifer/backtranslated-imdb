Peter Falk's only acting role is enough to see the film. /> <br /> Most of the action film, mainly in New <br York reijarera phakka and Paul with the small 'road trip' film decreases. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very good writing about the goal of a very adult. Most reality-based comedians and some well-liked plays provide a feeling that you can be your own family. /> <br /> really say enough about this movie <br not that it is a great movie like this one is not available for more exposure, while the other is junk tryasi. <br /> <br /> Again, Folk plays a major leading role and he makes most of it. এটি প্রমাণিত হয় যে তার বিখ্যাত বন্ধু এবং লেখক / পরিচালক জন ক্যাসেটস 60 ও 70 এর দশকে তাঁর বেশিরভাগ স্থল ভাঙা চলচ্চিত্রগুলিতে ফকলকে নিক্ষেপের অধিকারী ছিলেন।
