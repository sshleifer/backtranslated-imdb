This movie defies the emotional impact of the movie. It's elegant, delicate, beautiful, and sad all rolled in two hours. She has her acting ability as Will Smith, it matures in the full range. Who knew I've been looking for happiness and thinking, this must be a must for blockbuster, the leading actor Smith. In both films, I am not sure about the other levels of performance Smith, the refinement of the talent, the selection of the scripts, but now I see him differently. Seven pounds is a movie that you have to suspend your faith in order to enjoy its essence. Do not see it for the plot, it is literally and figuratively to see the fragile conditions of both human hearts. It is a story of human crime, charity, love, and sacrifice.
