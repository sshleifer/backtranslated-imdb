Sergio Martino's Case of the Scorpions Taille 70th is a beautiful gaelo from the first day of the formula. An explosion on an airplane resulted in one million dollars of insured money for an unhappy but unfriendly wife. Later the money was hijacked by a series of killer and brutal killings wearing a black cloth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, being a giallo, the murders themselves are memorable and well-organized. Actually, violence in this movie is very strong - a broken bottle, especially a scene with the graphic. The emphasis on violence is influenced by climbing the more suspicious area that affects the Geo Valley. But like best-known movies, atrocities are offset by a good score and interesting photography. The song of Bruno Nicolaei Barber Bird with the Crystal Plumeage makes Anneio Mikeron's avant-garde memorable thing memorable, but it is also powerful in its own strength. Photography helps with the excellent use of foreign people - in this case London and Athens - where Martino is able to manage the Parliament and Acropolis homes respectively! There are some inventive cameras, the most effective is the consistent slow use where a woman runs in the door where the rug is out of the outside. Martino Hackers hacked Martino with a special knife with a knife affected by Dario Argentina's Crystal Plumez, but it is an attempt to assassinate the open latch with a knife blade, after which Suspiria in Argentina. So Martino's film is influential in its own right. <br /> <br /> This is a good solid gyaloo that can compliment both types and non-series fans. Performance is good and the quality of production is fine (although there is a flat explosion, we would say, somewhat less budget!). DVD Release by NoShame is excellent. This is a real bonus that has options for both English and Italian languages. However, in order to fully appreciate the English Subtitle option, you will have to be a frequent reader. This applies to both additional movies and documentaries. Although it is a minor point, the DVD release is an appropriate addition to a gaol collection.
