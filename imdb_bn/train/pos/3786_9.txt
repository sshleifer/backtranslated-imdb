Young, a Chinese girl who is talking about Czech, invited us to visit a Czech movie (with English subtitles) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) Department. This is the first time I saw Samottari (Lonar, 2000) and it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Like many other Czech films, seven central characters seem to be quite difficult, dirty lives; The web indicates that this theme was popular among U.S. films in the early 1990's. Their relationship is broken, coordinated, and recombining. Another common feature of check films is that a letter is not universally designed as negative, and neither is it a permanent positive character in them. Also, you can see how you can judge others' characteristics depending on the characters; This is a very real feature of the movie's psychoanalytic analysis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " How much did the woman love Hannah He is so annoyed that he repeatedly used to wear clothes like plumber to enter Holkar's parents' house - the room he repeatedly burns. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hannah has very tender relationships with her parents. He decided right - tossing a coin - with a father working on a personal radio station. Hanka does not see a good example of her parents' bourgeoisie but seems to fail to create a better environment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, Jakub from his band informs that he already has another girlfriend. Hanka became frustrated and returned to her parents. <br /> <br /> When Hanka and the stomach break, a organization of Roberts is organized by RAB, who works for the travel agency where her work shows the lives of ordinary Japanese people of Japanese tourists. Robert - also gives Jacob with marijuana - which is not serious about anything and usually sleeps with different women; Finally, her mother died in a hospital and she has her own way to deal with depression. <br /> <br /> Vesna (a Slavic word for "spring") came from Prague to Macedonia - works as a barmaid - and do not know if you came to Czechia to see his father or UFO. He seems quite confused, but sometimes other problems help him from the problem. <br /> <br /> Petra worked at the radio station and he was the only one who liked the job - he eventually lost the job. He has announced to his audience that he has broken up with the scandal - thus how the Audreyz makes his news about how happy he is. Finally, Andres Wendre's wife Lenka is always ready to forgive her and to stabilize their marriage. After asking the Undertaker to make the magician invisible, even the Undress can try to catch Hanna again. (The magician gave his loan because he was a brother of an important car accident - Jacob and Hanka brought this person to the hospital and Ondrej saved his life.) Lenkaw worked as a transport agent - as a translator - and finally he was 20 or more Japanese Those who want to translate some violent scenes for tourists, their films Shu Shu during parents' dinners Im doing. <br /> <br /> <br /> Four orders of magnitude were small in Prague which communicates with interesting and exciting approach to seven characters. Given the actual size of the Czech capital, it shows a slight unlikely that all these events will take place in seven people, but it's fun.
