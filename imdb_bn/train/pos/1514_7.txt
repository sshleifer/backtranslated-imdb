All of Hammer's stars have some features, this very functional part of British horror is turning around the house and the fate of its earlier tenants, whose stories are called Scotland Guard spy to find missing actors. <br /> <br /> One of the story numbers, which is perhaps the least impressive, talks about a writer and his wife, who has just left home and has planned to stay for a short time so that he can write one of them. Awesome novel. He created an abstract character named Dominic, who is very daring looking person, and soon seems to be crazy because he is going to see the man everywhere in search of this beast. His wife believes in seeking psychological help, a sub-plot is introduced which does not really work for me. I will not loot it for you. <br /> <br /> The next story (the best of my opinion) is Peter Pearson, who has returned home in retirement, and soon finds a way to a wax museum (which deals with McBeeh), where he found very spider Which looks like a woman in the past. Soon after, an old friend (who has history with this woman) drops his business to the town and to visit him. Two men have been attacked by a strange awakening, because they soon discovered that this woman has more than the eyes. <br /> <br /> The story is my favorite three stars ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After leaving her home with her extraordinary daughter Jane, the girl who hired him, Red suppresses her daughter and fears that she is horrifying. It feels good ... if he knew what Lee did, he would have understood. <br /> <br /> The final story is rather a light hearted vampire story, which is John Pataway and Ingrid Pitt. After purchasing a cloak from a mysterious businessman, actor Paul Henderson turned himself into a lifetime, and saw that he had been featured several times in his career. <br /> <br /> Overall, the pacing and direction were very good, performance. There was an effective score complementing excellent gothic touches and ambiance here and there. This one is the keeper, and is highly recommended.
