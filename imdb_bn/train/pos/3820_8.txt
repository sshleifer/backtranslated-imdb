This is a story of Shin-Aye, who went to Seoul's Milan with her younger son, June after the accident of her husband's death. Her husband was born here, and she is open to a piano school, but there is ambition to have some land ownership with insurance money received from death. If the film was like it, it was probably like a Hollywood movie, with the local people falling for it and happy with her son in her new home. But, this is not Hollywood. After kidnapping and murdering his son, apparently because it is known that he gets cash from the settlement. The sad process, trying to move, trying to clear his conscience in crime, all done pretty well, and the main actress is pretty fantastic. The only cave, and it should be said, it's a boring film. You have to know that you want to go through Shin-Ace's grief and find some happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood, it does not interfere in Korean and Korean movies, especially the drama. Life will happen to you Great acting, but sometimes due to watching a solid film, over. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do it
