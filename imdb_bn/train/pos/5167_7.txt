I said the worst part of the movie was in the first half hour. I was really confused about who I was. For example, Bill Paxon's character had long hair and jacket was worn. Then, when all the men reached the camp, it seemed that it was such a character that Bill Paxson had seen, but it was not. I said, where is the bill packson? Then, there was a guy with his girlfriend. He said he was 21 years old. It was a 20 year reunion in memory of the camp's director (Alan Arkin). Later, this same girl was talking about her camp experience and talking. It does not mean anything. She will be one year old. That said, the movie turned quite well. Kevin Pollack was always an excellent man who always torn. A guy was a completely narcissist, and ended up losing her beautiful girlfriend. Alan Orkin was as attractive as an old style camp, who admitted that he was out of touch with the modern youth. The best part was that the big campers did not succeed in life. None of them had great job. This takes very real life. The movie was compared to Big Chil. In some ways it was not as exciting as Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So, although the promise is not given at the beginning, the film has finally turned into a beautiful good.
