I've enjoyed this picture. It was glad to see a version of Peter O'Donell's view so close. <br /> <br /> Many people dislike this picture, but it is seen in the context of the original story that it is. This movie uses flashbacks to show young Modessee and the events that he has become. Before the Network Before Willie Gervain <br /> <br /> The speed is very slowly, and there is not enough tension in the stage of the current scene for my taste. <br /> <br /> If you like Modest Blaise, you will also enjoy its flaws, forget it if you just want to do any work with the car. <<br /> <br /> This is a franchise's feeling to be the first, but since I saw it not circulated anywhere, so there is no doubt that there is no way to follow. Sadly
