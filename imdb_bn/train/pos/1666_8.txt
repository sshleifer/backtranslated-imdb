It is a 17th-century Italian artist and especially an artist, a woman Artemisia, a time-honored film for women, and she dared to narrate male nude the details of her unique career. <br /> <br /> The camera work is basically inward for where the artists primarily work. There are some great shots. Close-up by candlelight refers to the beautiful works of classical painters and it is interesting to see the painters and their students' detailed descriptions of religious festivals supported with extensive sculptures. It is not surprising that most of the artistic elements of the film (clothing, face, make-up) are authentic because the Italian churches have preserved these details in their frogs for centuries. Beautiful Artemisia has requested for her father's wonderful Florentine artist, Taseer, who has become proficient in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new), but artworks are rendered incompatible with new techniques in painting. After making a pledge for him, Tasi rape her violently. Her father is angry. Follow court proceedings. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama contains fairly simple stories with an unsatisfying ending. His artistic presentation and detailed attention to the outstanding feature of the film. Scenes such as an air-driven scene have a surprising effect on their huge costumes with wind. Add a wonderful effect. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says that she paints herself to be happy; Let her parents draw on others. For this movie, I think it will be the greatest favor.
