Here's a nice Barbara Stanwyck double bill on a disc. First film - and I believe in less than two - MGM's "To Cree a A Lady" (1950), in which he is associated with Clark Gabelle. This must be accompanied by a star car with Gaibel as the dominant film on the screen. Here he plays a psychic racing driver who received some bad news from the feminist reporter Stanwick and the fighting for the sexes began. Of course many ado after they finally end up with each other's arms and it all comes off with an expected and lovely. A step indeed is a crack, but Gable and Stanwyck - two icons of the Golden Age - it is able to see! But this is the second feature of the original meat on DVD - a wonderful and quite unknown small thriller called JEOPARDY. Produced by MGM in 1953, it is a wonderful little gem of a movie which is not a Yota date! Here Stanny Bayer Barry Sullivan and mother had a vacation to the wife of her younger son, Lee Acker and suddenly a tragedy hit the distant Mexican beach holiday. Sullivan trap under a heavy pillon collapses a fraud wooden collar and guesses what? Yes, the tide is coming. Unable to make the soul in sight and unable to free herself, Stanwick stopped the car for help. The only help he can get after driving a few distances is that it comes from a helpless fleeing criminal (Ralph Maker) - who has come back for his help - wants more than money or needs to change clothes ("I have my husband Do something to save "). Is he or not ?? <br /> <br /> Momer went by the picture! He turns quite bright performance! Once you come into the picture, you can not just close your eyes! Memorandum is a Brando Style actor, he has not surprisingly made most of his career in the film. Manchester Stewart acted as a remarkable, disrespectful cavali officer, as the destructive strong French soldier of the West "Naked Spar" (1953) and Stanley Kubrick's powerful WW1 play "Powers of Galleries" (1957). The real demand for fame was in 1955 by Mike Spielen's "Kiss Me De Deadly" Mike Hammer. His performance in his "Jopardi" must have been surprising for him, but his film only had such a career. Died in 1988. <br /> <br /> "Joopardi" can now proudly take the correct position as the classic noor due to this release. A memorable, fresh and thrilling thriller has an outstanding performance, the strong side of John Sturges, Victor Milner's Christmas monochrome cinematography and Dimitri Timon's atmospheric score. Extra, however, there is no radio version of "Jopardi" and there is no great shake except for both movie trailers. <br /> <br /> This disc is repeatedly celebrating its centennial as part of the Stanwick box set. It is difficult to believe that if the woman is still around then more than 100 years old! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ZaPardi - an MGM winner!
