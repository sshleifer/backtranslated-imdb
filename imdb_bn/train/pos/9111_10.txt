"Capitães de Abril" is very good. The story is not a documentary about the Portuguese Revolution of 1974. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it's like us. The story is not very interesting, but it does not ruin the movie. Captain Salguayiro Maya's heroic works are not great and the film is a tribute to his work. Captain Salugeiro Mia is among the most heroes of the revolution on April 25th. <br /> <br /> All actors are very good and even the smallest role is played wonderfully. Lisbon looks as beautiful as ever. Do not miss it! I liked this film too.
