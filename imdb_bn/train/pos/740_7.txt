"Foxes" A serious view of the consequences of growing very fast in the 1980s. And teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (Porky's, at high speed in the Times at the Ridge), film keeps well up against time. <br /> <br /> Today is relevant today as relevant to its theme of teen agst 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and Skissa Boi Scott Bao (remember him?) lead a delicate young cast that is good to see. <br /> <br /> This film follows the girls of four southern California, because they go through the ruthless existence of sex and drugs and parents are ineffective. Teens from teenagers, spend outside the school on the concert or street and spend their night. Occasionally they stay at home because instant gratification is a pill, party, or boy away. <br /> <br /> Instead of condemning them, the film blames the elderly for being alone, sympathetic, blaming, and depriving adults. And it's impossible to dislike the charismatic cast. <br /> <br /> Opening the picture ?? A long and loving pan - set tone for what's behind. We define girls' girls, from Tinki to John Travola in a young age, when Donna Summer's "On Radio" is pictured below, the girls get asleep as they are. <br /> <br /> Girls take up pace as school closes in life and in life. Anne (Runway Rubber Cherry Curry) Wild children living next to the team or pill. Deirdre (Candie's Struh) son plays crazy drama queen. Majo (Marlin Struh) shy girl on her head. And one with Foster's plan. This worker should keep enough time to finish high school and keep her divorced and violent man hunting mother in line (Sally Kellyman). <br /> <br /> It's almost impossible to work and Foster fails at the end <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite his age, a pleasure to see "FOX". The date, cloth, and references of Olympic skater Dorothy Hamille do not hurt the film. <br /> <br /> Cinemology is just stunning, floating floats of floating basin floors, evenings and evenings in the night. Georgio Morodara added an 80's soundtrack, which combines Donna Summer and Janice Yan's choices. Perhaps the biggest disappointment for this film is "St. Elmo Fire" 1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). "Fox" shows why they should. But perhaps like bowling for the "1985" soup song, they hit only one wall.
