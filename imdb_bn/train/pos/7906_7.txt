Gus Van Sant has created some nice films. I'm really a fan. However, I can not help but think that Tom Robins's "civilized cowgirls Get the Blues" cerebral edges are missing in the big screen translation. Alone, Tom Robins and Gass Van Sant's incredible spectacular and tower tower. Finally though this one does not work. <br /> <br /> It was not that the characters were not well developed and the plot and materials were not alive. While reading this book, our fantasies are even more powerful. We are taking away from a different time and place and we sometimes feel the worst and / or the best and according to the accuracy of the author, it adds a complete roller-coaster to the book. Movies can reduce the frustration with total imagination and overall roller-coaster experience. This belief has happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading the book!
