I finally saw these episodes in 2008 and I had to go back constantly and actually had to verify when it was produced. They are so scary that they have fun with what will happen in the future. Parker and Stone both lived in Texas and saw the statue of Gobbash Bush, or they are the weird, cruel people who pay attention to things. Oh, awesome! Bush's bumboo bombs attack the White House Bush 'accidentally' sentenced someone to death? (Do not wait. He has done that as Gov.) It may have felt a failure as a sitcom, but now wisely, if considered, must be considered as bright.
