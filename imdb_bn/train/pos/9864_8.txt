I saw 'Ice Age' at the movie theater and I liked the movie. Many errors and scientific errors such as 'Ice Age', such as humans, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths live at the same time, and even the location passing the story (North America shows but there are some features of Iceland) for example) we can even have fun (Until you are very fatal!) <br /> <br /> This planet is entering an ICU age, and many animals become warm and migrated to the south. Sid has left behind his own family, a foolless sloth that can no longer stand him. Walking on his way, he meets Manfred, or how he calls Moody Moody, who is not anxious for extinction or going to immigration and answering. Worried that he could easily be captured, Sid Manfred decided to follow, and in the middle of their journey, they found a human mother with his child. Mother died, but Manfred and Sid decided to take her and return the child to the man. Diego, one of the sabers, follows and decides to help them to go to a shortcut in the human camp. Manfred and Sid do not know, Diageo is a descendant of all, who hates people and wants to kill the child and also dare to convince them to make Saber's food. What will happen, depends on Diego's behavior and conscience ... <br /> <br /> Ukka "A Era de Giulo" - Brazil
