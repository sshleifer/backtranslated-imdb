A brief summary of an MGM MINIATURE. <br /> <br /> The Secretary of Cole County Clarion must determine important news for his readers: an upcoming snowstorm that can spell out their crop disasters, or exciting shooting-down is a notorious gangster in the main street of their small town. <br /> <br /> This is a compelling little one-relay, which combines a good performance by selling comic Charles 'chicik'. Today's viewers will probably be more interested in the presence of James Stewart as a vendor's nephew / assistant. Slowly speaking and a bit stupid, Stewart shows many features that make him a huge star in a very short time. <br /> <br /> Today the often overlooked or neglected, short stories of one and two railroads were beneficial, on the basis of important training for new or burgeoning talent behind the front or back of the studios. The dynamism of creating a successful short subject is quite different from a feature length movie, a short story writing novel than a novel. Productivity, short stories, studio features, both in terms of budget and scheduling and expansive images of content, were the perfect complement to movies.
