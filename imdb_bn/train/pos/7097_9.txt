Just kidding, I hired 12 monkeys because I was a big fan of Bruce Willis and I heard something about this movie. Something good and bad, but one of the movies you had to pay attention to every second was there, so I was a little worried. Because I felt like a minute if it could be a movie that I had to watch a few times. But I saw it last night and I was really impressed, this movie had everything: action, drama, science, history, dark humor, even a little romance. Actors have done a terrible job, I give Bruce a lot of credit, during his time in the car with his psychiatrist, he really got me. But Brad Pitt, I'm just surprised with how wonderful I've done. He did not complete his character, who was a madman, and it only worked and was very credible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> James Cole is such a man in the future where the past virus has broken and 5 billion people have died. And only 1% of the population survived with him. Animals are now ruling on the ground, when people have come down, but for information about the virus, scientists have been sent to James in the early 1990's. James is a psychologist in his new psychologist, Dr. Catherine Riley and another psychiatric patient, Jeffrey Goynes. He says his future, certainly no one believes in him, he goes back in the future. But the scientist send him back to the right year where he was kidnapped by James, but he tells him more, and believes in him. Now they are trying to prevent the virus from happening. <br /> 12 Monkeys were an incredible movie. I said the story was so scary because it was not hard to believe that we are not far from this incident. But the whole film was superb, cast, set, only the whole film was superb. It had a terminator type feeling where we could someday separate something valuable, if we did not listen to others. What is right and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend the 12 monkeys, this is a great movie, if you give it the right opportunity, then I'm sure you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
