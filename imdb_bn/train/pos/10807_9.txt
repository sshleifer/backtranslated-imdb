I just saw this picture, and read it with love. There is a bit of bit for everyone, and it is a special release for it in the case of Lachlan and Lil 's romance. When they are on the beach, I almost cry ... The time of the strange realization is the most valuable product and when they are together it is the most obvious. These ideas are taken from different angles, finding love in at least conventional places from volunteer places in marriage. The film makes you often frustrated when you know that tomorrow may be very good for you. His role in Crav Lachlan was particularly surprising. I always had a soft spot for the pronunciation, but I almost melted with her character in her screenplay. The way to shoot this image is also beautiful, music, retreating open fields and superb acting. In sum, it's a wonderful movie that combines all of the human emotions.
