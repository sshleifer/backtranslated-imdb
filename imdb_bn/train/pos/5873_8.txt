This was the classic of a fire of choice for Abraham, the greatest of all time ever people to choose. This guy is a terrific actor. It can be a comedy, drama, tear-joker, etc. It seems to me that Priodaran also understood this, and his solo scene jumped like a few monkeys to make it a little fun. <br /> <br /> She was the only target. Couple more annoying tid-bits) Otherwise an extraordinary laughing movie. Humamah, the best comedy for IMO to come to Bollywood! Like Hummer, it is a great painter and of course a situational comedy taken on the shoulders of Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance date. He is also better in a shoe for the best comedian of the award function. KKD was always good, but he took it here at a different level. Body language, facial expression and the way she distributes each line. It is a talent performance. The packed theater movie had a lot of brownness for the entire length of the movie and I do not think that I have seen such an environment in America for a Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Garments have a "lead" heroine. It's 3 incredibly hot + beautiful girls thinking I've done a fairly good job. Sure they're everyone doing their debuts. Paresh Rawal is as difficult as usual, although his routine is wearing himself after a while. Rajpal Yadav is generally her usual annoying self (sick of her prominent character in every film). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Overall, the price of a show must be. I say it's more fun than an entrance, and it's saying a lot. John was better than a little more qualified than Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
