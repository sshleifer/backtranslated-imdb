<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweet" is a strange blend of sense and neutrality. The film gradually slowly and slowly slows down gradually Jason Patrick was never so sexy and strong (man gives real performance), and Rachel Ward is all sexy. <br /> <br /> Sex excitement, galactic heat, past pitch ... Flashback scenery, the strangeness of Patrick's character, all become a sexy mystery. I recommend this one because the more sexy dull movie I've ever seen See love scene, it's particle sexy.
