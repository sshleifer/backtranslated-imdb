I saw 'speak easily' one night and think it was, but something missing. Maybe Buster Keaton suddenly closed me off, or a leading woman labored line distributed holiday. The next day I was thinking about the movie, though. I could not find Durante's song from my head, I tried to think of Thelma Todd's first scene, I think Keaton is doing some fun crop and physical comedy. The next night I saw Thelma Todd a scene with his sexual appeal to Booster and trying to print Jimmy as a sincere chorus girl. A very funny scene, wonderful actors, their face, their eyes, their stupid expressions. So I saw another scene, their show opened at Broadway. The buster works per buster in his delightful innocence Again, I greatly appreciate the sunny, keton's clouncing and timing. So the next night I saw the whole movie again, and this time I saw this for the first time: it's awesome! It's exciting! It's great! Three great comedians! Todd dance! Singing the Durante! Keaton speaks! Surely this is not a poem ... but there are many smiles in this film.
