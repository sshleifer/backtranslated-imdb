There are some wonderful things about this movie. Marin Davis can work, given the right property; That funny role is surprising. William Henes could work, and you can see why he was one of the most popular leading men on the screen. (Until he is forced to trade due to a possible scandal). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit intense, but so beautifully managed that you do not notice. King Vidor's directive is one of the main reasons for this. Producer? Boy Jeans, Ivaring Thalberg <br /> <br /> <br /> It is about filmmaking, and in 1928 you will see a process like camera, set, director of directors and actor Emote. Let you see (short) day something big; Even Charlie Chaplin himself is seeking a swap. You can also catch the names and old photographs of Allan Bordman, Elliner Glenn, Clay Windsor, King vs. and many other eyeballs. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you are not a fan of silence, you can take the time to capture this image. It's really a terrific trip back.
