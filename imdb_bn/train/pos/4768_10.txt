I love it and there is not another season that was so detached !!! I want they want! It was the best show ever !!!!!! There is probably no possibility of deciding not to cancel the ceremony! Oh, oh my wish! I will be so excited !! I really like! I missed it And Jason was especially detached to know what would happen !! I think they should make another one .... I think its folly that you have to write ten lines to post a comment .. it drages your comment and nobody will read it !! I really want to know what happened between Jason and Nicolo ... maybe they can stop spin!
