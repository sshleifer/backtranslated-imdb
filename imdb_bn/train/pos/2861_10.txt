I love this show and my 11-year-old daughter and I love to see it together. It teaches good old-fashioned values ​​in a fun, exciting and entertaining way (though mostly with some expected stories). It's really fun to have fun ... you know, review and keep your conversation in place of actors. <br /> <br /> My DVR is set to record all episodes and I happened to take the end of an episode tail (before the beginning of the ... so I did not know which episode) but it was a completely growing mistake! Adam Sheriff had transferred a small Soviet "skin" to Kauffi, which exploded from his outer coat, because he tried to get him out. <br /> <br /> All right, Roy got quotes, so he puts it on his table and placed it right on the swatch where it was leaked. The switch was really rectangular ... which I think would be almost impossible to pull from a piece of skin (in the 1950s nugahide? Yes, skin? I do not think so). Well, the switch was completely lined and the mystery was solved. <br /> <br /> After 10 seconds of the scene, we see the quote again, still reading on the judgment desk. But this time the switch is more like the size of North Carolina and now it is in completely different places (but still adjacent to the coat holes) and the SIM (which is mid-smack-db) switch) is now gone ... as the seam in the quote. My girl enjoyed a good smile as we played short scenes again over over! This is the head of YouTube, I said! <br /> <br /> We still love Shocking and growing flaws a lot!
