"The Sentinel" is one of the greatest horror films ever made in the film industry! I think very few movies are very scary. Alison Parker is a model with some fame. He has a lawyer named Michael Lorman, and is one of the best friends of Jennifer. Everything in his life was great, until he rented for a while and rented a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is its neighbor, who is very, very weird. Suddenly Allison starts to faints with health problems and frequency; He feels some painful event about his past which makes him nightmare or illusion. But everything has a reason, and it must be done with the new home he lives ... <br /> <br /> I personally found "The Sentinel", a very unclear film, and 'Exorcist' "they already saw Two of the most horrific movies when we discovered that Alison's house was occupied only by the priest and my blood ran out! The demons are our world To be a new terrorist to keep away from the film, it is very dangerous to see the blind.
