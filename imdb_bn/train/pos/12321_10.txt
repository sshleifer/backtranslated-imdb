I saw this childhood my childhood. And after 10 years I did not think of anything in this movie but I found it, I do not even know how I was able to find this movie. It's my life My favorite movie all the time What I have for my word, I mean, will really be reduced. I followed this movie. It's a brilliant mix of imagination, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, scary and martial arts. The story about love power is quite sensitive and warm. This is a wonderful compilation of Hong Kong movies. <br /> <br /> Indusai Yaman, one of the best ghost stories made in film without any doubt. Written by the Siling Pool and managed by Sue-Tuong Ching, a Chinese ghost story has it all in it. Lingi Choi Sin, played by Leslie Cheung, is a place to be afraid to go around in deep forests, villagers, in search of a monastery for the habitat of a young man who is down on his fate. Loneliness alone is dangerous with wolves, and lives in a crazy Tawawandi monk temple. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is forced to seduce men for his wicked , But when he meets innocent sex Choi sin they fall into love. <br /> <br /> Ling Ling Sin is a fool stupid but his heart is in the right place, when Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the jungle, he tries to protect him from there who is trying to kill spirits in the forest . As he breaks into the great martial arts, even a beggar even drunken song as he performs the religious Taoist sword form. The film is very old martial art films, acrobatics, magic and flying in the air, from trees to trees, with elaborate long gowns and scarves, but the film flows and everything is effective. <br /> <br /> Tsing is married with an evil tree monster, which can not be good, and we are not really nice to those who meet her sister and maternity where we feel her woe in her house. <br /> <br /> They will eventually fight a tree wing with a deadly tongue, and in order to save their souls to go deep into the heart of the hell for a thousand years of evil war and to properly bury the link ashes may bring them home His regeneration is a chance. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that really gives attention. One is touched in many ways by this movie, you smile, cry, and have fun with great martial arts and cinematography. And in the end, Yin and Ling Choi sin ride under the sun sun in an amazing sunny day, we do not know whether Tsing was afforded a rebirth, but we know him.
