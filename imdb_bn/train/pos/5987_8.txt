Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) reforms out of school and goes back to the slum. Her sister (Anne Sheridan) tries her best to save her from trouble, but it seems she is following her. In addition to cooperating with the termite gang, GABATI follows the real life gangsters, who have a project to set fire to unscrupulous buildings for insurance collection. They need someone to blame for firing, and GABE it. The law enforcement agencies allow them to work on their behalf and to give gangsters just their dessert. <br /> <br /> The scene presented with Dead and Kid's is really good. Boys fill the new dwellers on the street furniture, and proceed to make it their own. They talk to each other with phoenix accent and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a shedding on a chair. The boys then came forward to start a new boy, but after he proved himself a good fighter, they asked him to join his club. <br /> <br /> The introduction scene is rather good, horror filled first looks dangerous, but it is really tricky and innocent. Afterwards, when Billy Hallop's son studied from the mayor, he dreamed of working at school. It's been astonishingly played, small hogograms of the kids are walking on their faces and making a question on it. <br /> <br /> Engels washing them face-to-face is a great title because it closes the success of the Angels with weak faces, and really what kids are saying. Notorious for off-set and off-the-off behavior, these boys makes this film beautiful. But it seems innocent, it makes for some great laughter. This is a preview which will turn into a lot of boys' bauvery boys series. We even got some insults from Leo Georgie.
