I thought this was an awesome movie. The theme song is sweet! :) However, the only thing that bothered me a bit was at the beginning, when everything was normal. It was very weird and unreal. Big wire companies are mainly talking about what I'm talking about. Apart from that, the film was very creative. I think all acting has been done well, the actors completely played out their character personality. Everything fit well together. It's really a shame that their soundtracks are not. It will be great! Because it's a Canadian movie, and it's my favorite because I'm 10 of the 10 movies!
