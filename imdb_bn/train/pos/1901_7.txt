It's hard to keep your finger in it. Basically I think this is a comedy about a lazy rich drunk who loves a relatively poor girl, whom he wants to marry at the risk of denying his family. <br /> <br /> This is a fun moment romantic moment, and touching moment. Doodle Moore is funny and in no way respectful of her self-centered character, Liza Minilie is convincing foil as her impressive contrasting figure, but John Gilgood steals this shot as Arthur's wonderful satirical Butler. <br /> <br /> Great fun with a memorable soundtrack, and ran for about 3 months at our local fleapit.
