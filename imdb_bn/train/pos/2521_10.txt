I have to admit - I was the only reason I bought this movie because I was a big fan of the Gate and a huge fan of the Hyde. I hope a good movie with a lot of good shots, we will say, the eyes of the woman are happy but the little Chess story. I mean, the synopsis really sounded out there. And now I've finished seeing it - I feel the need to tell the world of its brightness! Hyde and Gackt gave both heart-wrenching performances, and my eyes are still hot from the tears that the last half of the night continues. You sucked in the story, and you finally feel really for the characters. Vampirezism - which I love, but very easily or very easy to destroy a movie - rather than an irregular unnecessary addition to the story, it's just something external, which makes this setting normal. . I got the place in the first 10 at 9 ... and then I went back and did not try to figure out why I was giving the last point. Nothing came along. So ten out of ten ten After all - I'm not a critic - I'm really annoying to write a review in any way. I really hate the movie or really love it. You can tell where I'm going with the moon child.
