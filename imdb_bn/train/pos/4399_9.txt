The shortest way to describe the road with the devil is one word: authenticity. I will not reconsider what has been said about this wonderful movie, but I would like to say that the historical value of the research and growing attention has been appreciated by the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> As a student of history, familiar with the timing and setting of this film, I must say that this product is one of the most accurate movies about "Kansas bleeding". Yes, there was freedom about real events, because it is all right to imagine. But the overall feeling of the film is real. Authentic clothing, realistic attitude (no PC hedays here) even saw the actor. Even Jhel Keller (who has a small part of the film) seems to have turned into a mid-19th century film. <br /> <br /> Some visitors I spoke to have expressed their mistrust in styled conversations. They can not believe that the 19th century peasants would "speak like poets" <br /> <br /> They do not realize that verbal vulgarity in this era was a wonderful teaching of the 19th century American public and the pronunciation bunch. These people were raised in Shakespeare and King James Version of the Bible. Screenlists judge most of the time by reconstructing oral styles, time documents. The illustrated dialogue only adds to the cinematic atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the historical document, this film also works on a glue level. Beautifully photographed and performed, it harkens back to the days of the great Western epic. Many of Laurence, Kansas have done a lot of work in the past, fewer films have been portrayed with a sense of urgency, which keeps the audience on the right side of action. <br /> <br /> romance, valor, moral and moral conflict. Everything is an intelligent moviegoer in this movie. <br /> <br /> Within a year was stuck with excessive garbage like the American beauty, this great artwork was buried under the indifferent studio system. But I am sure that in the coming years, we will be traveling with the Devil. Please rent this picture. You do not have to be frustrated.
