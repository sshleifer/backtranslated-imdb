Just saw the age of IC, a very funny and especially beautiful looking film. The story is simple but effective, the letters are beautiful and nicely swollen, but how the digital set design really enlightens. Inspired by traditional animated movies than the reality, designs really give you really nice, looking for a wonderful world of color. Sometimes stirred through the touch of reality (especially water was impressive), but nevertheless, it is based on the reality of a fantasy-world. Helps reduce the cost of landscaping loads, especially with rendering costs. <br /> <br /> Pixar films are brighter with technological brilliance, they are enlightened with the effective use of technical knowledge. <br /> <br /> Enough technical bubble, the film's entertainment, family-friendly, and sometimes just funny fun.
