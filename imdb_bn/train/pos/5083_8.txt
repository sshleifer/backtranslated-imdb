This film may be stupid in the hands of fewer actors than Claudbert Clovard and Robert Ryan. However, along with these two advanced Thespian's way forward, I found "Silent Furry" the most exciting and delightful little mystery. When their marriage is hampered by a newborn, who claims that Colbert has already married, and at the wedding she was the best person, someone realizes that there are some ways to work against her. As Colbert, Ryan and his attorney set out to suppress unknown claims of an earlier marriage, they have been actually already claimed that the claim is seen more strongly with each other. Although it is not difficult to identify the original "Baddie", but it is still very fun to increase the intensity and speed of the story. Above all, a good, strong mystery film with better performance with two leading actors and great supporting cast, which often includes the implicit Paul Kelly.
