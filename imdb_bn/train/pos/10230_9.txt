People have forgotten that there are several King Kong Riffe - Congo, King Kong vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), they all surround each other, but EETI stands on their own. It only lends one material to King Kong and it attracts animals with a woman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> exists, but there is no scientific information to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but it's worth watching. In the early 1980's, I saw it in "The Dark Bubble in the Brain of the Elveir". It got a kid down the back of my spinal cord, especially when YETI got crazy. I saw it again, about 1:00 aBC 2-3 years ago. Seeing it again I appreciate more, it has some good effects (for its time) and a silent boy in the story and his dog and an evil businessman who wants to kill his own YETI for himself. Also the music is quite cool, like its very YETI. :-) <br /> <br /> Jianfrenco Parolini and pilgrims make a great monster like the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Give half of 10 votes.
