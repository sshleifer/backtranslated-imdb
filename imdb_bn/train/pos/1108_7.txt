Some recognized Altman "masterpieces" are now sadder for me. Maybe it's me Last reviewer likes, I like this "low" Altman (currently shown on the FMC), although I do not think he is targeting a wider audience. Organization of politics as a "microcredit" for public campaign Some of these sarcastic "Documura" days are now seen in Dick Cavatate, but I've got most conversations fun and insightful (eg "for the truth, that means you are not a threat to anyone"). The story is not "deep", but I like it. And the performances are funny, especially as the cavatry ("myself"), Lorraine Buckle as an elderly conservative artist, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a Member of Parliament) as a left-wing doctrine (while giving a speech to someone dressed in the first summer), and a Cabin Burnett as the case of the basket. Automant Altman style is all, although probably as impossible as usual. But quite disqualified.
