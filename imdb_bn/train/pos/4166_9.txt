Before Cujo, the devil dogs were lucky. In 1978, the Hollywood night movie "Devil Dog, Hound of Hell" became a premiere. A family has received a new puppy (a farmer that happens to sell fruits and vegetables only in the fingers) because their dog captain was killed. Daughter Everyone loves new dogs, but there is something weird about them. <br /> <br /> The parent Mike Barry (Richard Krenna, First Blood) started giving notice until it was a long time. Her wife Beti (Yevette Mimieux, where boys, Jackson County Jail, Snowbust) are different and her children are Charlie and Bonny (Ike Ejenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vises and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nani and Professor, Hello Larry, Tough-Tarf) Has also been changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? He is determined to do whatever it takes to find out and save his family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great, because Ik and Kim play their darkest aspect even more than what they saw in those dark mountains. This is one of the terrible TVs made for 70 production, which is scary for the horror film of the actually made TV. The song was vague and even last that I will not tell you to say. <br /> <br /> This movie is why Karevil (Dallas Cliff Barnes) and R.G. Armstrong (Remember that the devil could not stay away from the movie "The Devil the Race") <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
