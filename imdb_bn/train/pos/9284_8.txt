This image is described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy. Like a tranquil film, it is a great drama that portrays the common thread of social discrimination and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; Director's dark and serious lighter than the Circle (my favorite Iranian film). Both the girls and the barbarism between them and the soldiers were completely credible (as it was a documentary) and was completely sunny. <br /> <br /> The actual match and subsequent filming were wonderful. It has added a reality like Kenny of Australia, of course a very different movie. <br /> <br /> Playing all non-professional actors ?? Soldiers and girls ?? It was very credible. These girls were too running to see emotions, frustration and tension. In this country, anyone who thinks wearing wearing a Muslim sheet, will his own daughters see this movie? It will open a real eye. <br /> <br /> To me, the soldiers represented the present ideology. They started applying all of the girls to the stock-standard official policy response. Because of the film's progress, they have become more difficult to maintain this attitude. When everyone in Tehran feels like breaking into a wild celebration, everyone is caught in it and the ridiculousness of the current principles is clear to each other. <br /> <br /> It was a very running and unexpected end. , And this film gives a really nice mix of emotions, cruelty, drama and social commentary. Though it is an adult movie, but I think about seven more elderly children would appreciate this movie (since they could read the subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is remarkable that a repressive country like Iran would like to be able to promote non-profit and kirtami, as well as produce quality films. Perhaps the restriction is that the director is there to be very wealthy. Australian (and other) filmmakers can take a page from their book.
