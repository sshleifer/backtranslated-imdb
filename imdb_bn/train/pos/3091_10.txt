The entire price of watching this show. It has got a very long time to have the best cast of genius. Unique and fresh in the context of the program (I think executives in ABC are not used too much because it is not another reality show) However this show was credible with linear characters and wonderful story lines. I'm probably not at the age of 40, as I am in my 40s, but many of my friends liked it (mid 40's in the last 30) and dying for quality classes with talented cast members. I do not think this show is not given enough time to gain an audience. I believe that this event will be given too much time. Once again ABC is not giving a show with a real opportunity to real prospects. Many opportunities to be given opportunities and almost no price! They will show a real opportunity to quality and really give the time to click and gain an audience. I really liked the characters and looking forward to watching each episode. I saw episodes of ABC videos and the show is even better and better. Although I think they are one of our episodes (number 13?). We want to see what we can do! See if this show can be saved with bombarded ABC email and characters and extinction. It certainly works for Jerico. Some things are just saving the price and these shows are certainly one of them.
