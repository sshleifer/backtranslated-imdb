This is a wonderful movie. Cast letters are a great mix and story decent. The movie is mainly about a well-known doctor who stole dead deaf body and took them home. If the body is once in his home, he stops (I hate to use such a common word, but forget what he has removed) and keeps it in his wife to maintain his youth. Then a journalist, Patricia Hunter investigated the situation and why Bau's death started to find his answer. She takes a trip to the doctor's home and starts taking interesting things. Definitely watch this oldie, but if you can goody
