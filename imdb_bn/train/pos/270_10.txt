I want to say, seventeen and missing is much better than I expected. The idea that I took from preview was that it would be in danger, but I was pleasantly surprised by this great mystery. <br /> <br /> Did not take part in a so-called graduation party by Daddy Pfeiffer Emily, who her daughter Lori (Tegan Moss), but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and goes towards the party. When Lori does not come home, Emily realizes something wrong and she begins to look at the events of her daughter's perspective and its invisibility. <br /> <br /> Better than seventeen and many other TVs. This kind of, it is not so predictable. Because Pfeiffer see this movie, and it comes close as most credible. This is the LMN premiere premiered last night. 10/10
