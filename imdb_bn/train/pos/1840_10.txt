Great Platplay and any of the best actors in the world. Montand 'lonely sheep' gives a whole new level of intelligence and the most important, credible concept. <br /> <br /> When a normal Hollywood police-hero loses to kill family, friends and pets, usually giving minutes of sorrow. But when 60 seconds is over, he gathers himself, packs his gun and shoots an enemy one by one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But it finds out that she was another lover. His confusion and anger are all visible in his fingerprints where he needs to seek revenge but to find out the real culprit of a crime. So all his actions become unescapably logical. This movie puts us in the seats, but this is not the only reason.
