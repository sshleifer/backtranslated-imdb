Good story and nice animation. The effect of the fridge and bakhsh is clear, and it is a good thing. Anyone who enjoys Barbarian or New Dingzion and Dragon, that is to enjoy it. It is our hero can appear at neutral time even though the fight between good and evil is clearly cut. Often imaginative film elves are portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and globular and orchards that have dark dark skin and hair. Anyone familiar with the French, Bakshi, even the Tokelian work, knows that they are not racist. Anyone who enjoys fantasy movies should like this movie. This is not due to violence and sexual harassment for children. Welding is done well and the first rate of views and music. I hope somebody will soon keep the DVD on this egg. I consider myself lucky to have a VHS copy in good condition.
