... and if you're very good, it will be like a paradro over the moon. <br /> <br /> This picture was a bit silly story, but it was a fantasy after all, and was marked casting and acting! Dreyfas was perfect as the actors / connoisseurs, full of imagination of all the small nervous and vanity you imagine acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was nice as a girl friend - besides the real hot number: "Tonight you have to get an Oscar!" <br /> <br /> Do not forget to play Johnny Winters as CIA agent and most of the fans of the guest: Sammy Davis Jr., Eck Papas, Dick Cavatte - all done perfectly. <br /> <br /> Above all, a memorable romp below the paradroic lunar. <br /> <br /> -R
