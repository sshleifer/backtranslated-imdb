I have a lot of time for all the Columbu films, but in particular it was a very good writing, and ultimately the solution is very effective. However, opening up a scene between the film's main memory Colombo and the murderer (I apologize if I remember the complete description). This is the most striking figure of Colombo: I saw the scene inside the orbital darkness, where the victim was murdered, and outside the room, which was lit in the light of day. Columbo faces a high-sized armchair door (and us), thinking about the cupboards, and almost due to the contrast between the lighting in Silhouette. There is no sound. The camera gradually moved up from the room and towards her. He gradually deepened, puffing slowly into the cigarette, swirls smoke from the cigar slowly circuling as he thinks. Then the dialogue begins. Fantastic
