This miracle movie is one of those movies that will last a long, long-term impact on you. I guess the angry people or infant beaters are reading a review or two from people angry, and their extremist comments talk about the power of film to face people with their own darkest secret. No such part of the industry has ever laugh and tears in me, and this is the miracle of the film. The film's reality and its performance will not be missed by Brett Carr. It can often have mutually influential effects, people leave the theater or cause their own identity to be questioned. The next level movie is Bravo.
