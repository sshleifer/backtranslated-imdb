May and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren. Philosophy is not strange because grandfather and "kids" can not expect to know each other. The warmth that should be absent. After dinner, the girl's husband says that she does not feel good, she blames her for cooking her daughter, and annoyingly says she wants to go home. He died at night <br /> <br /> Now the widow is lost. He was definitely not an enthusiastic weddings or a very interesting one, but it had a purpose. She had to do something with her day, although she was in need of her, and her own need has gone unmet over the years. <br /> <br /> She is depressed and unmotivated. She will be with her daughter, Paula, who knew her mother shortly after her mother's arrival that she never felt that her mother gave herself too much. She lays off with anger on the lack of her mother's apathy. It may seem unarmed and unbelievable, even though power or desire does not seem like it to be correct. "I am your mother and I love you." What really? (I've heard it many times from my mother's way and still understand what it means.) Paula is a bit (better, a little more) neurotic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Having started conversations and hive with May Darren, doing it. Darren is a married man who allowed his wife to stay in the house due to an autistic son Nikita, but supposedly does not live with his wife in the house. <br /> <br /> He is attracted to Darren because he is scary and he thinks they have a connection to enjoy. Darren was attracted to the daughter because she realized a kind of peace and intelligence that she did not get from other women in her life. (He is also very interested in money which says that he can give him "to move away from them", although he is not particularly interested in joining him on such a journey, he ends up sleeping in the extra room and enjoys the fulfillment of the girl's day. He did not know for many years and sometimes he did not want to know. His daughter Paula often told him that she was married It has become a part of the rationalization of the girl. She is doing what is right. <br /> <br /> Paula is presented in a written group in May, but she is forced to meet a widow whom she attracts. No. In a scene where she is sexually attached to the old man, who can clearly perform temporarily, and it is really painful and uncertain because we are a total hate She can see because she faces horrible communication at a time. <br /> <br /> Finally, she discovered a lot of graphic sketches by her mother, who really has her mother and Darren having sex. This picture is undoubtedly seen in many ways. Sympathy will be divided. At one point, during the group's writing group, May published a short article that she thought that she hated her kids at the end of the day, and after sleeping, they could go to the foot, making sure to return home earlier. Her husband <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While apparently going to the local pub, one does not think of leaving the children alone. However, before the film was released that her husband does not like having a friend, so she does not have any. What he wanted to do his job He was sad but he kept it with, because he said "it was easy." So, I did not have the best mom, who wanted to maintain a sympathy for her, maybe a girl's work could only be sexual activity as a sex worker and live for "a few minutes" in her lifetime. . A woman who just wanted to hear one of her, asked her as a friend and a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Paula, though neurotic and unhappy, has probably become the reason for her father who raised her up. Surely I can not understand why Paula is being completely betrayed by her mother. <br /> <br /> This is a well-done film, which I have mentioned, with more complexity, and of course there is one who will give viewers a lot, perhaps contradiction, reaction. It's a movie discussed and controversial, and above all, valuable. <br /> <br /> Once the film leaves us, frustration and fear of loneliness. Whatever is considered to be "right" or it is considered 'wrong' by every audience, the themes of old age and loneliness, most of us express feelings of fear, are unexpected.
