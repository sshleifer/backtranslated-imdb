This Alex Guinness star is a very interesting political satirist and a light brighter character in the corporate industry. <br /> <br /> Pacing for a comedy is a bit slow, and none of which is really rolling-on-the-floor type is funny, probably without sound effects for testing. But it has its funny moments, and it is stolen too much of its execution. The largest explosion segment is probably the most ferrous material. <br /> <br /> Most of the methods of the union are drill, I am very memorable that I am right; Especially the female socialist, with light romantic crashes on the character of the guinese. Political machinations actually carry the story. Ernest Thesina is very significant as a heavy. <br /> <br /> I do not think this work mostly as well as the Ladkilar, or the heart and the heart; But even the light Ealing Comedy is better than nothing.
