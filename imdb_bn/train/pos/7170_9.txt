HOLES is not your average Disney stuff - it's also fun, even for adults, who are usually cutesy, focusing on "family entertainment" designed by Focus Group, which passes as Uncle Walt's Studio Live-Action. Perhaps the secret of the success of this film is a little more intense than your average kids. Stanley Yellnat is sent to the prison camp where the boys start, where all the prisoners are forced to dig the hole under the desert sun. But as the story progressed, Stanley's story got together with a legendary rich man, and this adventure became ten times more fun than a Disney movie. John Voit is particularly nasty and colorful, and the Sisurian Waiver is always as beautiful.
