In the old commercial field of empty audio cassettes, the tag line was "Is it real or it's macromax?" The same can be said for episode events - Star Trek's first pilot "The Cage" collection and remix. To allow Captain Christopher Paik, who allowed his first captain to be burned and paralyzed, Mr. Speak bravely took the ship to the banned Tabloos IV. Why FinalGirl? Because if there is any contact with Talsa IV, the death penalty was invoked. Why can not be explained so quickly - which has bothered me too much - but if nothing else happens, then it adds to the story. After receiving the ship for the fourth visit to Tolls, Mr McQueen (senior-most officer was present at the time, Captain Kick stopped the ship during the arrest), Mr. Spoke himself said, "The complaint is rebel, I have never received orders for Dr. Ship." A court martial which - thanks to the Talosians - we're learning why it was so important (clear parlance discounts And) until the fourth talasa for Captain Pike m. Speaking of the risk of death. The confusion of the Talosians, the background music and the whole story is fantastic. And wonderful as Meg Willie the Cape (Head Talosiyya). Call me a sexist but she never came to the woman in her role, but she was perfect! Taloshiyars leave almost all physical activity and become completely dependent on the power of illusion, they are also illogical; You can not really say it to male or female and it really does not matter. This episode makes me optimistic than any other in the series and there is another world and there is a civilization that has been developed so far! If this is such a tasty thing! This is one of my favorite episodes and how many times have I seen it (I'm even in the video), it failed to impress me. Meg Wyllie look like an alien and I do not mean that mercilessly.
