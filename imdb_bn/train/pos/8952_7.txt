Jillian Hollyd (Kim Nova) is a witch. In secret, he is attracted to his usual neighbor Shape Henderson (James Stewart). He has made a spell on the shape that forced him to dump his granddaughter and fall for him. Jillian discovers that he is really careful about these mortal people until everything is running smoothly. She decided to tell him her secret. But when Shape responded that he was "cheated" to fall in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> As far as the light heart goes to the 1950's comedy, the Bell Book and the Candle are good, but not anything spectacular. It should be an enjoyable enough watch and sit around with it to appeal to almost anyone. Just do not have to go to the movies hoping to get the greatest thing from the cut bread. The film is cute, sometimes funny, and touching at the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart have their best and some real chemistry. An understated sort of novak (others have been pointed) looks incredible. Jack Lemon, Hermione Gingald, and Elsa Lancaster's Assistant Actors are often laughing - Suddenly, the funny whisper and the spotlight of Novak and Stewart steal many. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and candle can not decide which movie it wants to be. Is it a sculble comedy? Is this romantic comedy? Is this a supernatural comedy? Director Richard Quinn was stuck with only one method, the film might have been better and more memorable.
