I was always a big fan of this movie, first you saw Cast, the role is extraordinary and it helps the film to work very well. Cybele Shepherd was given a great review for his role, and they were very good. The beginning of this movie began in the past when Corin Jefferies (Cyber) whose photo-perfect marriage ended in an unexpected death, its flashing suddenly happened. Fortunately, the newborn baby Alex Fink (Robert Doney, JR) got the second shot of life with the consent of being "recycled" back to the world. Corinne tries to get along with her when Alex goes to save her new life to forget her past life. But fate crosses Alex's path after 23 years when he meets Korean girl Miranda (Mary Stuart Mastersson) and suddenly a wealth of undesirable memory (here begins fun and gets embarrassing.) The music is great and the scenes are heart-felt and very clever. If you give it a chance you will not be disappointed, chances are you like it. Very funny and sweet!
