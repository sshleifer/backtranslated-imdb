"A thief in the night" is a movie which is generally ignored by film fans due to low budget (which was obvious) and its content - the fate of the true Christian church and the lavish behind it. Nevertheless, it was a secret story that captured the audience and of course he reviewed their relationship with Jesus Christ. It touches everyone - even showed a priest who preached the word, but did not believe it was OK to know why he went behind. This film, and its series "Distant Thunder" must be seen in the movies. Even with the new "left-lean" series coming out, the same story is saying with a lot of budget, the impact is still the same - "a thief in the night" has broken the foundation of this genre and it will always be remembered.
