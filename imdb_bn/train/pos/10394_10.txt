A magical journey concocted by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITN films in British film have compiled some excellent elements to create the best artists! Sauvie's young excellence, the theatrical and brutal villany of Conrad Waddat and the fine beauty and voice of June Duplex, which works well in all royalty, with a breakthrough sharp and intense Miklos Rosa musical score. Messrs Malson, who plays Basra's Sultan, Duprez Dad, wrote the perfect graphics which is the perfect screenplay. Do not miss this one! After posting the above comments, I got the recently released DVD and can honestly say that I did not see the image properly until I could see the DVD version - the clarity and resolution are so specific and the colors are so resilient that I was surprised - it was amazing classic once again And the charm can not fail and the visitors can be delighted. Again, one must definitely see!
