This movie revolves around the original delight. It was everything which makes a movie gorgeous ... without real actors. (Arnie Hodson could not make it alone and you know that! LOL) I admit that I killed my first video tape in this movie and I'm planning to buy a DVD version as soon as possible! This movie is so kindly, it is kinda! I said, I am moving forward behind the theme song! I love the death of Jimmy Lynch's character, and he had to win the Best Supporting Actor Award for Blackslewing, but the Oscars were never ready! It is a random film that includes crooked police, breasts, cheeses, bad edits and of course martial arts. (This is the 70's and I can say that everyone knows martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and a marathon will be shown in the local theater one night!
