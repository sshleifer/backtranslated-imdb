You are waiting to see if you are better or worse in the remake. I am a hard grader in Audi Murphy Films Rating 3 (I'm Audi (the second worst "Bloody Beach War" if you are enthusiastic) second second. I give this movie a rating of "8" (and I'm a strict grader) against North America, if you want to call them but this is the story of the civil war of "soldier" People like Quantrell, and those who rode with these outlaws. <br /> <br /> The original was a pirate version, very clean cut, yet these horror illustrations of the men. In fact, movies like the old version are best viewed by older viewers, who understand the story. The new movie gives a very honest version, because a message can be sent more easily by a child than the old version. <Br/> <br /> Since the beginning of the decade, filmmakers are proud of "realityism", but some of them are also proud of. Instead, they only offer mobile scenes, satirical costumes and satirical shows, but with the stereotype characters of comic book cardboard, Spaghetti's weaknesses. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers have realized this mistake. This is a better style in the West that we can see today. An example of this movie. It gives realistic settings, but also gives us the letters that we believe can exist in that era. <br /> <br /> There are some lulls, which can be a bit harder to sit and it has some uncertain circumstances. But unclear situations are ok until the whole movie is uploaded, and the characters are quite playful. <br /> <br /> It starts somewhat but it really improves. We can identify the main character and at least have some sympathy for him. The character of the early film Audi Morphy does not really show any sympathy, and is very selfish without motivation. <br /> <br /> The character in this movie follows the real hero. There is inspiration, and his madness is a method. We do not really think he is "right", but we understand where he came from. There are lots of activities in the film. There are some laughs. A beautiful scene is when the heroine tells the heroine that she does not lie to her, then she will not lie to her. <br /> <br /> This movie has been trying for some film makers for decades. This director and authors have decided this. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Complete success
