Although I did not really feel anything for Lance's character, and I felt that his wife could do anything better with someone else. If they spend more time on the development of character, it can be a more solid movie, perhaps I liked it better with Lance. However, I want to agree with Dewleyvar completely, when they say "and to quote Glenn Quinn's character: 'I'm a star here, I'm just the genius!'" If you look at the movie, See, even when he is in the background ... the expression of his face, in all eyes, how sure you are inspired by Ben, how he feels about the comments On, even if it is a character behind the fast track. A fair film is a great acting.
