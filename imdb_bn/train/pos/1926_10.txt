In 1967, I went to the Glider-Port Lake of Elsinor and flew a yellow-print readymade syllable. Serious television is on top of returning to Germany, and in the early 50's there was a segment of California's top Sylleplane flights. (The real life pilot was Bill Ivons, I did not know who played him in the series). That was the same flight (same n-number) in Syllele's Elsinore Lake. Since I saw that segment I am searching for it and I am amazed that it is available anywhere. (The other parts of which were unemployed ejection seats, glacier hunting etc.
