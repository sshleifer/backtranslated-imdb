If you have any formula about Jane Austen's product, you will now repeat it in every novel: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the films made from his novels are a little annoying, but I like the character of Austen, because each of them has a specific personality and common words that they want to repeat in Amatan. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good at her leading role. Also, every character in the film can not remember anything but get a better partner and does not seem to make the movie crippled soon.
