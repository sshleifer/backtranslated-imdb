All right, let's get this clear. I'm not really Sci-Fi, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Take his team SG-1 through Jack O'Neal Stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the ability to travel in the distant world. It may sound like your normal science-fiber series, but it's not! This plot is not set in remote millennium like many other sci-fi series today. I find that great It can be related to things, events and related, and you can enter the series any time without learning the names and new names of all gadgets. They have some, but thanks to O'Neal, who like to keep the simple terms, there are not many. <br /> <br /> This series is a beautiful mix of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy special effects load then you will not find it here. They do not use too much bad ones but use limited specific effects on a limited scale.
