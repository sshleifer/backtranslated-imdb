The original reason for watching this movie is Warren William, who is the head of the Shaista Preacher. He finds the way to defeat the masses in the electrical, continual greatest disaster and defeat the opposition party. William is a great actor - I think he does not deserve her. Bate Davis shines as a writer under his girlfriend. Personally, I do not think that Gemein Kebbi is right as a Lam-Brain candidate, William and others are trying to squirt on the public. She looked more like a canvas than a person. I prefer to see a character originated rather than a non-character. The story itself is incredible, stupid and clich√©d. But Warren William and Bate Davis are well-valued.
