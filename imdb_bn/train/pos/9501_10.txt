When I was released I saw this movie, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still remember the wonderful scenes that remember the great scenes of how heroes are exempt each time they face confrontation :) and the best feature films Was the villain screenplay! I think many so-called action movies have copied many "shadow scenes" from this movie !! And when I see such a copy, it just does not affect me, it always enhances my appreciation for this great composition! :) The lead actors have performed wonderful. Slow dynamic and realistic development of chemistry B.D. Hero and heroine were very natural and surprisingly portrayed. As a child, we felt that their love / development trend was very normal :) The way they faced their trials and faced their well-being, it was something that children can understand about true love, self-sacrifice and care. Every person suggests watching this movie when I give opportunity !! --Vijay.
