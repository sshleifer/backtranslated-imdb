The movie looked like through the walk for "unethical study". In most cases, I was not involved in the burning need of the female artist for destroying the male artist, and in the same way "Who has created this gender now?" Sounded a bit gratuitous. The dialogues of this movie are rather horrific, although apparently the movie has got its moment. When Tasi went on to paint a mental picture, I almost got scratched, but the movie returned to pornography. Highly recommended for those who are not seen in very short period
