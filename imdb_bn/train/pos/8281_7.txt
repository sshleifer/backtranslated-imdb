From the first scene, I was really excited. "I can say this is going to be awesome!" I think Acting was so good, I felt that I used to save the life of this people. The music was very exsetly uncertain. The plot started suddenly and then proceeded towards some overwhelming fate. The build was slow, but I personally love these things, as long as the cool practice is on track and it is not frustrating before it's ready to stop. <br /> <br /> So everything is going to be OK, and then start firearms, and before you know it, credit is rolling. "What? !!!" All I can say to my night and companion in the movie. If you understand the director's intentions, then the blunt ends (those of you who already saw the movie, with Larry Facenden, see very interesting and ridiculous interviews at filmcritic.com), but I can not help it say <br/> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> very bad. Those ten minutes could make all the difference in the world. (But for those who do not make your writing or film, you must know that it is a big pain to create a story press with the right time, and I am not making any such kind of criticism from the basis!) <br /> <br /> Wandido feels like a nice composition to me that was released before the end. But hey, I'll break into a product produced by a lot of dog-pumped pieces for a long time, with many digital effects (as the most horrible movie of nowadays). <br /> <br /> Another comment. Some of the giant scenes have misled me so that I fear or laugh. I do not know how to explain it, but Monty Python felt a distinctly concerned about this giant in his distinct "giant" forms. Although it may sound like a terrible critique for a horror movie - I do not know, it still worked for me in some tricky ways. I will not look at deer antler again! :)
