The same year overshadowed by the "Braveheart", seek to compare the two costume drama. I acknowledge my favor against Mel Gibson, yet I still have a reasonable priority for "Rob Roy". Both "Brayhart" and "Rob Roy" represent the history of Scots in bloody, romantic fashion. "Brahhart" is an epic paean of an individual magnificence and courage and a fine revenge fantasy. It is also melodramatic, spiritual and maudlin. Please note the use of slow filming cornball. His violence is both wicked and glorious. This is the next quality which makes it more attractive for teenage mentality. "Brahhett" crosses the worst level of "killing" Rob Roy (not mentioning his congratulatory time), the next film is finally more mature and satisfied. His actions also understated, yet more wonderful and clever. Her penis is less usable, yet more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a good available romantic interest. The conversation's attempted to estimate the poem of this time. The actor's face tried to assume its rotted tooth-era dentistry. And Team Roth is an extraordinary villain. Also recommend: "The Last of the Masses" and "Patriot". You can get more answers like "Blahheart" by emphasizing blood clot, with which the word "Rob Roy" is the same as before. Pretend their rating ratings for all previous movie violence
