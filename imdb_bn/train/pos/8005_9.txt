I bought this game in Ebaye heard that it was a game similar to Elite. The gameplay is indeed very similar, and very addictive. Once I played it a few times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for my kids so that they could have fun .... I could directly play this game and the story feels like this if you are actually in a movie, it's a great one. If you feel free to explore the explanation due to restrictions on the rules of single-player game, simply set up a freelance server on your own PC (easy to make and include software) and play in your heart's content. There is a large number of freelancer servers still on the internet, so multiplayer is not a problem and it is not a threat, because if you do not want it, then no other player is meant. So get a copy of this game, learn it through a single player campaign, then set an online presence and enjoy yourself. The depth of this game has been destroyed for exploring, destroying and destroying the wonderful system, as well as for discovering other things - hidden planets, insects, secret places, the list is almost endless. Excellent game and especially as you can get it for a couple quid on eBay. If you can do (blue box, Xplosiv red box) but get it with full load manual, it loads well!
