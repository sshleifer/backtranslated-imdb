Although the time has revealed how some influences of this story of love and courage are still very special. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie before, then you will be surprised how much you stole then filmmakers. I saw a friend who was surprised to see Disney's Alladin picturized. They liked the movie and enjoyed it because it was a touchstone for many other filmmakers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I gave 8 out of 10 out of 10 out of 10, which is a good part of this movie, because in the last 15 minutes the image falls into the pacing. Everything is rushed as they will suddenly get to the end. Finally the djinn appears to sketch it from the point of departure and then the painting appears. It does not kill the film, but it weakens. <br /> <br /> It still needs to see someone who likes good fairy stories, even a great movie.
