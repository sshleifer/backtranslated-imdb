I can say, the first movie got my attention on this season. I have chosen this because of actor, cue and clair, and the story seems to be committed. I saw it and I can say - I'm frustrated. Frustration scenes are true ... but which makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, this thing is happening right now. And there are some experts trying to change things and making things better and frustrated about their commitment to the reasons. Actually I can not feel "Hollywood touch" in the movie and as a result it makes it even better. Claire and Richard both have a great role, and deserve a 10 from me.
