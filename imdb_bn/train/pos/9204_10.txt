Rum Hare Krishna's story really came to the heart of Dev Anand when he suddenly went on to show his fallen value in Kanthalundu and after his protests against his previous love puja in Calcutta. He was confident because of his debut and some people burned love poster posters. But Hippi's life revived a story to make the goddess's mind again in a movie. <br /> <br /> It was probably the best director effort to give it happiness. The film is a blockbuster super hit at the box office and Ginney Aman has a tremendous effect as the goddess's sister. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the parents did not hesitate to leave the father (father) with his father and Jaasbari (Janet). He repeatedly said that his mother and brother died and finally he believed that he would never see peace again. <br /> <br /> Her mother treated her with illness and she escaped from the house. The god became a pilot and he knows that some of Jasabir's hippies are in Kathmandu. <br /> <br /> Dev K. traveled to Mandur to meet his sister and meet with peace (Mumtaz), who later married him and Jenis also actually got a new name and new identity of Jasavi. He forgot his childhood and also the goddess. <br /> <br /> Dev will have to bring his sister back to all other incidents, in which he is suspected of being a thief in Kathmandu and people after his life. <br /> <br /> It was a good story and was directed - both Dev Anand. We see something more than Janet Aman than Mumtaz. But the music of Rahul Dev Burman was well written. Devdebi's first song was composed by Sachin Dev Varman, but Varman de Dev does not want to make this film. He will be very close to his previous movie Love Pooja, although he was good, but he was opposed in Calcutta. Dr. Varman Dos wanted to believe that the highlights culture film can revive the anger of the people against Dev. But Dev Barman continued to make the film relentlessly and the film was really a success. <br /> <br /> Kanchi Kanchi was another good number <br /> <br /> Overall it is a Good movie
