Gandhi wants to see a book like my father, you read the chapter (with your eyes) and you know more about Harilal Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi. Very rarely known about them, and this film describes them uniquely. Although the title is misguided, the same way Muridas Karamchand is like a movie like Gandhi and his son, about Harry and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chaya complete their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Such films are like Leap Year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br />, if you like quality movies.
