Marlin Gory has established himself as the world's best director. This sensitive, apparently beautiful film is based on a story of Vladimir Nabokov and holds the author's mockery of the author well. John Tarturo gives his best performance as I consider (I usually do not have a fan of him); And Emily Watson is brilliant as well. See good prices
