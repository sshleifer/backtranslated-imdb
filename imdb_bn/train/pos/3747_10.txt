I have not seen most of my films online in most of the life, but if I choose someone among them, I would like Spartala Madness, like most movies using a camera, a glossy reference to Star Trupper (etc), and steel arrangement, Jason Stein in painting Achieve the ability to delete a normal image and then globally by spotulas American frame-by-frame animation in many of the world to combine. In the middle of the story begins, how happy are the managers? Then at the beginning of the middle, and so when I first saw it, I expected a soggy pixel look, but Jason, like me, looks like, so take each description of the maximum. Although I do not recommend this for kids, or someone like me would like it, but search it over the net (this is a small film, look at the movie cow), its style reminds me of the South Park, but less violent. For 10 looks, 6 for laughs, and 6 for the story, it all comes in a 10/10, good work <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I'm concerned about watching movies.
