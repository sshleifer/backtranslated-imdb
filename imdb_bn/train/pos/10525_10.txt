I have no idea that any Texan (director, Douglas McGrath) and American actress Guinness Paltrow never pulled it out, but it looks like Miss Paltra was all wrong! I've been away from the woman for a long time and still think that she's worse than the performance of the Oscar winning "Shakespeare in profit" but she gets all the bit here - she's perfect like Emma Woodhouse. He won his Oscar for Shakespeare, but he should remember him for that. <br /> <br /> Of course, he is surrounded by a great supporter cast with Tony Colette, Grey Scakchi, Juliet Stevenson et al ... Jeremy Northam is very interesting in love interest, although the script disappears somewhat in the announcement of Love to Plato ( In this process, all tensions allow them to move away from their relationship); For years, Ian's hair was taken more easily than '96 and personally, I saw Alan Kunming's fragile presence somewhat today. But without any doubt standout, Sophie Thompson (Emma Thompson's sister, daughter of the Fida law) as Miss Bates; What is needed in this version is a scene where Emma met Miss Bates, because we grabbed her fate. The film is worth seeing (its even) valuable for its performance alone. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is quite impressive to accommodate the British class system and is more agile than the extra skills. Well worth a rental (Paltrow sometimes its likely that this will be good - but we will always have Emma - because).
