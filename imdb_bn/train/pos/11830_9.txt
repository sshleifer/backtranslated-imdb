It's amazingly visible films with content done in six or seven colors. When it came out 15 years ago, it surprised the audience with its color scripts, which were sometimes different from anything in the film. Those colors, at least for me, is an absolutely impressive film to watch it. Literally thousands of scenes can be erased and I can convert them to a painting in order to study them for some reason. <br /> <br /> Characters and stories do not match the greatness of photography, but they are all above, especially villains. The famous actors played here had a lot of fun for playing "Flatp," "Princefaces," "Lips," "Mumbles" etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Betty and Glenn Headley are just as good as Dick Tracy and girlfriend Tess Truhart, and she's sweet and soft in her name. Another good addition is the Charlie Coursomeo crime young boy Dick and Tess under their wings. You have played other colorful characters from Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffmann, William Fariste, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Pattinkin, Madonna and other names but there are many numbers to be listed here.

A cartoon strip is coming to life in an incredibly colorful fashion ..... you have never seen it.
