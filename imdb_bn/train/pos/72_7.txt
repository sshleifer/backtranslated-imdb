I recently saw this 1954 film, starring Vincent Price, for the first time in Turner Classic. Price stole some of his witchcraft discoveries (and his wife, illustrated in the short introduction to the lovely Eva Gabo), when a magician / inventor Don Galico describes the price driven. Although the price is a murderer, I have actually found him, he is a sympathetic character who has been crazy by the greedy people around him who takes advantage of him. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has its "horror" factor of some of its famous roles (like my favorite, "House of Max"), it is going to be quite enough to protect the audience's interests. <br /> <br /> This must be essential for Vincent Price fans.
