I saw this movie with my children (boy, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd Annual Roger Ebert Overview Film Festival. After the movie, the audience was asked to ask the director of children, Tian-Ming Wu. He (a translator) told a number of stories about his life and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> All the tants together, my two children really enjoyed this movie. Of course, for my daughter, I had to show a lot of subtitles, but most of the films were apparently self-explanatory. I can not give anything, but the bottom line is that this movie is much better than 95% of Hollywood cats (especially children's films). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Masks have a "real" / real king that can do 12 masks at once. The film's actor trained and learned to work up to 4 masks at a time (then they will cut and change 4 new masks).
