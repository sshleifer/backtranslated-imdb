OK, that was an excellent pretty good episode. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Still the best. I love that final shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costume is great and the guests are thrown (strangle-stroke) strong. <br /> <br /> What I do not like about this episode has left many things that are left unspecified. Why does it change sex? What is the purpose And they are alien? What kind Why did not they see the next legend? <br /> <br /> I give this episode a high three stars. One of my favorites is still, but the plot hole bothers me. Still ... it does not have to ruin my entertainment.
