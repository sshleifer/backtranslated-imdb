It's my favorite of old Tom and Jerry cartoons since the beginning of 40 years. The original version of the Mammie-To-Juice shows Tom and Jerry's Spotlight collections 2 sets, discs and surprisingly detailed animations of early cartoons. These gags are not all madcap avari style, but rather more delicate and anyone late film (or radio program) keeps watching late! Tom is listening to a vague radio show, and Jerry decides to play some strategies to talk to him. Nine lifestyles have been done well here and I do not know how many times I have tried to make a vacuum and a baby when I was a child. When the owner of Tom got up with this stupid - not being a mommy, she had a home - a wonderful smile. Prepare your break button, it's worth it!
