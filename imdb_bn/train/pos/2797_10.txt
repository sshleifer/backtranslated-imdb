10/10 for this photo <br /> <br /> I'm a British India doctor, currently in India. Beckham gave me the word, 'Because I'm Liverpool fans die, and personally think the oven is really cool. Since Liverpool and Man Youtube are rivals, I was sure that I would not watch the film. <br /> <br /> But I was in Delhi to meet some friends, and I had a flight in the morning, so I thought, "what's the hack, spend time watching this movie", "It was late night show. <br /> <br /> I was there? I saw the release date of this film, I wanted to draw an audience by using Beckham's name (which is behind in my case !!!), but I really can not think of a better headline for the film. <br /> <br /> And Nagra, Nightly (Dead Drops Drop), and Rice-Myrass have done a great job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football, then Manchester United (or England's side) If you do not like it, then it's definitely a movie for you. Actually, I'm only 29 years old, psychologically, but a child in the heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I wonder why? <br /> <br /> This picture is about 10/10 postal order.
