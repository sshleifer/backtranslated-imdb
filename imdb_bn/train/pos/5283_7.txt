The basic foundation of this movie is simple and so is the script: An elderly Muslim gets his teenage boy from France to take his same old station wagon from Mecca Hajj to Hajj, so that he can fulfill his holy Muslim obligations. He's dead. Parents are definitely religious religious, but sons are unimpressed; He takes his father's obedience instead of religion, rather he wants to be his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. Baba seems lively to a lot of things which the boy does not understand, and the chicness in them keeps the device in play, although it is often annoying. However, any good road is faced with strange characters like movies; For example, in a retreat in Croatia, a woman who, after asking for Belgrade's guidance, thinks only a part of her back and a word with her hand, which they consider to be a place but does not find it on the map. Another person in Bulgaria ordered the instruction that they could speak in French, but gave a detailed commentary in Bulgaria. Sometimes there is humor - In one country boy boys eat eggs sandwiches and want meat - they are given goats, but unfortunately (probably, fortunately for the audience) father can perform Muslim rituals. They eventually turn it into Makkah - equivalent to the Muslim Vatican but on a larger scale. It's all bizarre but interesting for the West. The film is not sophisticated, but it is a charming, self-centered national jaggotic type.
