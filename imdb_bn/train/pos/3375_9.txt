This film has seen seventeen years of life in 2022. It's fun first, but soon after the viewer's perspective, the violent Future can understand how different the world is, the number of things we can accept to grant may be unavailable. <br /> <br /> characters often communicate in an extraordinary way, with no tactics or modesty or respect. I believe this deliberate, bad acting. Finally, in the 60's and 70's, a social change witness thinks that by 2022, a hospitable dude behaves like him. <br /> <br /> I did not like most of the action scenes except for death. Priest: Even for the seventy very cheap. The plot is not very polished. But great scenes and ideas - such as Sol's death, rioting and dead bodies are tackled, "furniture" - crosses the flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8.
