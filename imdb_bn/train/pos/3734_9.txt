The dehumanizing effects of war are a very study subject in the movie; Dehumanizing equally as well, but preserving possible life, dehumanizing effects of military training. Following Joel Schumacher's typical 'Tigerland' standard template, we treat men as dirty but see their commanding officers being raised as soldiers with mutual respect, and whether such a extreme process of judgment can be considered fair; To train the eligibility of the war which is being trained (usually, here in Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' takes an interesting step, focusing on his account of a coincidentist (played by Colin Farell) Bose, who understands that all the capabilities are ultimately lacking in consent by consent and in their own ability. . Around this character, an educated, convincing plot has been made, and this is not a plus that will not leave America (Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', for the same type of another movie, once the operation is lost to Asia). Although it is not a movie of strong originality, it has been added to the best and impressive viewing time: I have seen that the director's best film and his seratom are in the best picture.
