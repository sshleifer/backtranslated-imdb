Gang Ho tried to express many ideas and at the same time tried our entertainment with a wiseguy comedy. The results are uneven, but usually recreational. Keaton is quite well balanced in all its three aspects of its lead character. Wantabedde is even better One Caution: George Wendt played his supporting role very poor. Otherwise, this is quite enjoyable time capsule.
