Is this your ordinary female chain naval transport love story? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works now, the beautiful picture is presented in a photo, someone falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> I think this film follows some common story lines, but that does not say anything about content. There is a great view with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hooper and Gary Busi, although short. Some things were not sensible as to the need to go on in the sensory war, but it was entertaining to see, the wars were actually well done. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a comedy maximum, but it has a lot to feel about it. Humor is well balanced, you will not hurt your stomach in it, but you will laugh. <br /> <br /> There is no steam system for kids.
