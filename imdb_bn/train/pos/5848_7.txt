And I gave it a high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because it's bloody good rock. At that time when there were so many shows that were tied with toys / games, this show was unique that it overlaps stories. Others say here it was before its time. <br /> <br /> The program was destroyed due to sadness. They released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series. I hope more will come. <br /> <br /> This is how it compares 20 years after coming out for the first time .. I do not know that sometimes I still like it despite incognito animation, and IMHO is the only error. The writer is almost the top notch and the way forward for the competition ........ <br /> <br /> I hope to set up a DVD or all episode of the episode ... the DVD is good but I do not think the stories fit them Gradually, but despite this the show is going on suddenly.
