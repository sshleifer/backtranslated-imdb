Parrot thinks and speaks like a human and gives help and advice to his patient. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes the birds in naughty and depression fitness captures the mood in an extraordinary and expressive way. Synchronized voice is also done very well and in one minute you can really believe that this cute little bird exists. <br /> <br /> In his first film, birds give birds to the birds and say the following scenes. For many years, the story of Paul's constant struggle to reunite with his ownership. One of the most memorable scenes is when he falls in bad company and encourages people to spy on people using automatic teller machines. Poly looks like this is an extraordinary memory. <br /> <br /> is likely to end, but who else wants it. Children will love this picture and anyone who keeps a bird as a pet will be delighted by the policeman.
