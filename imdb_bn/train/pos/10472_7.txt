Anyone who loves Rivestatics music is going to enjoy this image. I have a few minor complaints, mainly pacing and Casting certain actors (not Mori) who are not really convinced in their roles, but I have no time to write a detailed review on time. I just want to warn someone who has seen this film or planned to show this film as CBC television presented in Canada: The CBC version is going to be like the Digest version of the Hello message reader --- it does not look like it. It cuts off the whole scene from the movie and mistress (if you can do them). CBC, which does not offer much of the film, Helal has hit half of the music. I do not know why. They did this terrible horror. Rent a video or watch it in a theater, but do not see it on CBC television.
