Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaption yet. Not surprisingly, since the king himself wrote the script. The action family is going to a beautiful main house. One of the other residents is Jude, a happy old man who knows some things in this area. One is the highway that runs right through their frontyard. The other is a pet cemeteries where there is a path, where babies buried by children highway for decades have buried. Soon enough, Ellie Creed's cat, the Church, is found dead. Thankfully, the family was away for Thanksgiving without Luis (father) during this incident. Judge Chamber will be buried, where the pet cemeteries, across the cemetery, takes the loin on the ground. Later, Louise was greeted by the Church (so flexibly). When she came back, she appeared to be present in her chewed chewed way from the bag that she had been buried. Probably he was buried alive. Maybe not I can not say anything without destroying the story. <br /> <br /> I saw that it would be the most horrific in all the King's expeditions. The characters are real and the situation is normal. Mary Lambert did a great job of directing the proceedings. Due to the development of the plot, the height of the film is clearly high. The scene will be in your mind forever where the gaze dies. Then, of course, we have the conclusion. It's easy to determine what's going to happen, but Lambert draws some really scary and sometimes annoying moments. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good film and an excellent adaptation. If you are afraid and sometimes do not feel frustrated by the annoying image, then "Pet Seminary" is exactly what you are looking for. Fans of non-hero will want to avoid this.
