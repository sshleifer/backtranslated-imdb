When I do not think I'm a big fan of the fairytale film, then based on Straddst Trillay's Millennial Piecefeller as a villain (especially as I was going to see him as Belie Velma von Tissle in Herpetre). Boy, he is so bad betrayed here as a witch, especially at the beginning and end of his age-ugly makeup! Robert De Niro was forced to hide "in the closet" to defend his "fame", which is also great as a pirate captain! Actors like Clear Dais, Rupert Everett, Ricky Garviss, Peter O'Woole, and many work well here. While Dancing and Pfeffer are the classic, though there are Siena Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard) and Kate Magnoy have a particularly attractive appearance, especially when we meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox was fined like Tristan's leadership, and he saw his father as a young man, which I thought was his first scene with Maguan (actually Ben Barnes). Compared to many comments, it compared to Princess Bride and when I saw something similar, the main difference was with PB, you always knew that it was a fictional story that told an old man to his grandson. Stardust believes in most of the cases that what you see and hear is actually what happens to Hillary Clinton. So note that, I highly recommend Stardust.
