Girlfight is a story about a boring misery named Diana Guzman (Michele Rodriguez). Diana is understood by her mothers suicide and living in a sexist community in a sexist father. A small mood and lots of things in the blaze of fire, for kicking from school for war. His brother, Tini (Ray Santiago), is training with Hector (Jeff Tireley) in boxing. Diana, for her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), Tania's training, he paid for that week. Diana is walking through Jim, she wants to understand what she wants to do. He wants to box. Diana asks her father for the train, but she refuses because she screams and wants to do more 'guerrilla' things. All Diana wants to be treated like any other person. She does not look down on the reason of a woman. He stole money from his father to start training. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Genius, Pure 'effing' genius. Recommend someone who needs to watch a nice clean movie with 'Monkey Business'.
