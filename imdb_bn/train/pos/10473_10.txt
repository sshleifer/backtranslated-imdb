When I first saw this movie I feel there was a bad frame. For some reason it wants to share my life with the excitement, loneliness, and somebody by clicking on all my levels. Nobody hurt it to share with you a lovely girl like Claire (Cindy Preston). I bought the sound track of this movie (very difficult). Love it and hope it will never come to the DVD
