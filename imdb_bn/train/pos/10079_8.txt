In the 1930s I enjoyed Chinese cinematographic entertainment in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An elderly male actor wants to go to a young man in his industry, but he has no child. The actress is amazing to see the face. The stories reveal the devotion and gratitude of those children who treat them well and treat them well. The film's operators reminded me of Farkvalal in my conjunction, which was more sophisticated and complex. The story here reminds me of Dickens's story when the children almost cried out. This plot is somewhat predictable and somewhat emotional to me, but the time to look for heroism, humanity and history is good.
