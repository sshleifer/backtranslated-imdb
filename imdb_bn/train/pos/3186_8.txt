I find this movie very enjoyable. The plot is simple and easily positionable, humor is light and clear, and because the story involving misidentification is quite common, I see how to make this movie funnier by myself. It turns out to be very nice. Female leadership performance is commendable; The innocent, innocent girl's screenplay was very charming, trying to invent some white lies in David's sophisticated role. I drew the dance of too, very well done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
