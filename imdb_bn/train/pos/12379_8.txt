When I came out of this movie, I was a neglected in an old theater in northern California. As well as it's DVD, it's even more eerie and awesome on the big screen. Although it has been seen that it has been almost 9 years, it is still my best favorite of all time. At the risk of crying, "They do not do that!" If six senses make you stand out, then this film is definitely for you! Great story, incredible cast of characters, insulting setting; Even the soundtrack has a hunting quality. I highly recommend you do not watch it alone. In 1977 alone, a Brownstone apartment was rented, you can gas (it will be at least 10 times the price today).
