Most Italian ghost lovers seem to hate this movie because it has no connection with the first two demon movies. And with the title "Demon III", nobody would guess it. The problem is that this film is not called as a part of the series of demos. For the monopoly on the popularity of other films, the title "Demon Third" is titled "The Ogrey", the title of the distribution. The title of this film's new American DVD release titles "Demon Third: The Ogrey" is in the title, but the film is simply "The Augrey". I do not know whether the title of the previous release was titled "Demon III", but this new release seems to be a little white. If you can exceed the title "Demon III" you may enjoy something like "The Ogre". It starts with a zero role, and is pretty spanking throughout. No gore and film movie slowly, but I still dig it out. Just do not expect it to be like other demons films. I can give 7 out of 10 "the oggs". Italian fans will try to try it out.
