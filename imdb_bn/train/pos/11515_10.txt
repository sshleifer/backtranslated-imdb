I've been through this for many years, but I feel compelled to protect their gems against those lamsters. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of views here. That's the humor I think. It's subjective. It charges 60,000 volts through your funny bone or it cools you down and why you gave it time. <br /> <br /> This show brings together Britain's best comedy actors in a story, which is stupid and overwhelming and the results are fun. Dialogue and visual comedy are nicely distributed and two leads (Cleese and Lowe) are fantastic together. They were made for this. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything else than to look for it and request you to see it. You will not be frustrated and in a world without modest humor, it is a classic mad and humorous part of comedy.
