Legendary Boris Karlf Get four cheap horrors in Mexico. This Token Moody Gothic horror entry from the bunch of time. Carloof Matthias has given a simple spree and glorious performance like the Mortwal, who is an intelligent, supernatural father who invites his small, greedy and backbiting nonreligious relatives to his lazy Rondown castle to read arbitrarily. Soon after the disgusting guests stopped vigorous living creatures with deadly life toys. At the same time, the Mexican sex symbol "Tintora"'s Anders Garcia, the notorious police officer Hero and Julissa are absolutely disappointed as the only female character of choice. Incredible, flexible (non) directional script, ugly, washed cinematography, set pieces of ridiculous kill (a total fat slab explodes right into the mouth by a small canoe!), Overwrought String score, Morbid glum-dum atmosphere, mostly Lauie acting (excluding Karl significantly), hungry light beef, poor dabbing and passionate fire-related conclusion Lebuke a particular patient, and therefore peculiarly terrible gyabhabe freak funny dirt lends charm. A real camp hoot
