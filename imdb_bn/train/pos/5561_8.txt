OK, saying, this image is going to appeal only to a specific audience; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, in fact, For that to buy their first copy, it must be mandatory to sell a copy of it. Monty Python's Sacred Grill is for Gakes and Nerds, so this film is Pohh√©des. I first saw this image 10 years ago, and I still crack every time I see it. Jokes perfectly lampled the posh lifestyle, better than the previous half, better than the half-baked attempt. <br /> <br /> There is no plot here, so to speak; The film is more of a collection of different skits; The film's novels revolve around Los Angeles. Despite this, the film has a fantastic sense of motion and it does not drag everyone. Many people have smoked as C and C's best work, but I have to say that the next movie is higher. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood, laugh one hour and half of the abdomen, laugh, tune, and let your mind float away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and free Tommy Chong!
