I think this image is bright. There are a few reasons for this reason, but these are 1) Tom and Tyler's good performance. 2) Bright instruments gun scenes which were a part of the brightness 3) I thought the last was the best twist because I hope all of the Sam Mendes credits Along with this, the movie form of these three points is also good. I am a film student in college and we studied this image in detail and it has been one of the best films I've seen for years. I would like to thank everyone involved in creating this image. Ultimately, I want to say that the best view of the film is the machine gun scene where John Rooney is killed, pure illumination only in the shooting of uninterrupted scenes, until John Rooney says, "I'm glad you're it". It's a lot better. I'm thinking that the audience makes their own words there and the word is very different for every audience. <br /> <br /> Ross Kick wrote at the age of 16, thank you for reading this comment.
