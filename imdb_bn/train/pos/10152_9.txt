I first saw that it listed its work. Finally it was available on the 2/13/02 Lifetime movie channel yesterday. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments have died on the "2 funny trickling sweet tricks". The authors probably will not receive the bonus, all others are making SRO movies. <br /> <br /> Anybody who appreciates romantic movies will have to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His smile is so electric, its beauty says nothing, He goes to my favorite list that has something like that. His TV and print interview which I saw refreshed and well worth it. <br /> <br /> God blesses her, her family, and future efforts. <br /> <br /> This movie does not seem to be available on DVD or video yet, but I will be the first to buy it and I think it will be the other too.
