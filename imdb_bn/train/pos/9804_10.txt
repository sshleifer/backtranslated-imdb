The film "Batman: The Mist of the Batman" is considered as entertaining as an animated Batman movie. <br /> <br /> If still true to the sense of comic books, animation is done with a little soul than Animated. Series Bruce Wayne looks like a lot before, but now he feels a little less applicable. Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by Team Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like live batman movies, the film dies or dies based on the quality of villain. My favorite time is, Penguin, here. Compared to its appearance earlier, Danny Davito of 'Batman Returns' is hearing more of the 60's Barge's Meridith script. David Wagen Stearns is the perfect choice for Penguin's voice. The Penguin is finally portrayed as a cute impressive, just as he is usually present in comics. Hector Eliseand's voice creates a Ben, which is far more memorable than the forgotten version of "Batman and Robin". And finally, Batman has an interesting mystery to solve, "Detective" coming back to "Detective Comics" (which means "DC"). Mystery Revolution is a delightful sticky twist. <Br /> <br /> The score has been added to the mysterious environment of this movie. It sounds like a mixture between scores and "missions: impossible" to score from "Poirot". After all, it's more entertaining than your average cartoon.
