I still think this is the best routine. Rock's "bring pain", and Allen has some other like "men's dry", which is pleasing; "Damon Waynes last stand" is a trickiest way - but this routine has no errors. All jokes are fun, and the 70 minute time limit is perfect. Just enough for 20 years. I just love how audiences give me totally and freely. I'm a fan of the classic and a guy who has seen Jim Carie growing up, seeing a more laughable smile is pretty cool. No section is established with Allen and NewHart, but you can see something when leakage. Thanks Eddie, God bless.
