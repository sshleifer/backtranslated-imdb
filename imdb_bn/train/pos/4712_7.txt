Jokes are clear, gags are authentic, and Characters are walking characatures - but I can not stop from smile at its extremely entertaining cinema. No matter how many times I see it, I still get one kick out of this one, and I highly recommend for the lovers of mind entertainment. It has a lot of quote moments, and some of the best scenes I've seen today - Gaga. If you have a bad week and need chocolate, then start your holiday well on Friday night.
