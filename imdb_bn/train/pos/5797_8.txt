And I do not say it in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the movie at the age of 6 or 7. It was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time for me and my cousins. . When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, though we knew he had no idea about him. <br /> <br /> For several years, I have promoted this movie several times, but I've always changed the channel. Even after seeing a few seconds, the feeling of that mood will come back and my heart will heal. And I like this way. <br /> <br /> So once I saw this movie and I believe it was a good decision to meet again. If I saw it today, I do not know if I could not help but played MJ's acting, plots (if there were) and criticized this and her. It's a childhood memorial for me, so my feeling to me is a child 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see my adult interference in my ratings and gives an 8 for memories and surprises. Twenty years ago, it was thought that for that little baby it must be 10.
