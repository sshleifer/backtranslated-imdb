The average of the vote was very low and the video store's clerk seemed "OK", I did not expect much when renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But on the contrary, I enjoyed it a lot. This is a charming movie. It was not necessary to grow on me, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gave a great acting role as the lead character, I think his movies are somewhat different than his usual personality. <br /> <br /> There is no such knock or no such thing, but there is some ridiculous view, and overall it is a very enjoyable and very easy to see the film. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
