It's a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again. "Amit Girls" is such a movie. In the old time of movie theater I would have kept for more sleeping. Was this story autobiography for author / director? It's the owl of reality. <br /> <br /> All star cast presents with their believing and softness. Do not want Mercedes Roule as a big sister? Since "Rosanna for" I have liked his work. <br /> <br /> With most movies, a believer stops because we know it's the actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. It was difficult to suspend such beliefs at "unmarried girls". Feeling a part of this kind of family! When his family pushed his mental life, I wanted to come to Dolores's defense. And Clarence Lichman's hair color, Lee Grant as the level of criticism. Life-long humor is not a laugh, rather it has a better quality which is far more satisfying than reflection. <br /> <br /> Imitate and cherish the love that is depicted in this movie family. <br /> <br /> It is not a coincidence that translating from family names, nominations, Italian means 'beloved'.
