Before Taskan Sky, I saw Diane Lane's flexible performance in the light of this movie. Campers are invited to their youth camp and experience it as an adult. Everybody comes back to see something lost in them, which seems to be realistic in it. Maybe you really have to be a camper to get it, but the word of one character was wet to cover all his clothes "so this camp!" Fighting from practical jokes and boys, scary lunch lady and morning bell ... It's amp. Once exciting activities seem to be dumb now. A superb ensemble welding makes one-two dimensional role well and makes them reliable. Bill Paxton, Dean, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when she first read for her !!) Beautiful scenery, bright colors, humorous songs (including the variety of Hello Muddah) and well-known director Sam Raimi√©r are looking like an old friend to turn you on. You can find out a movie again.
