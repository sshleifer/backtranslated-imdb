Freddie's nightmares are Chesi and Rip Off. You certainly do not know the best TV when you see it. Episodes are packed with drama and blood. Freddy is creative to kill people. I love Freddie's nightmare and I hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Days and Love Stins. If you think this series has been sued, you deserve your opinion but remember that this is just your opinion and it is not nonsense. Freddie's nightmare will always always be one of the best series and you will soon come to accept that truth. If you do not like it, but you can not see it, but do not deny its brightness.
