What a absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, see it, you will not regret it, it's so fun! Rajinikanth carries a movie on his shoulder and though there is nothing more than that, I still like it. A. Rehman's music takes time to grow on you, but you have heard it a few times, you really started to like it.
