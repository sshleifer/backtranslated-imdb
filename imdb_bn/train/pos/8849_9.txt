Hanson's brother-Andy (apparently his work together) and Hank (obviously his work is not together) need money. Andy brings some project to get some blade for the entire Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This picture is distributed. It's a layered, full bloody roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it's doing. As a crime drama / thriller I would happily compare with 'Old Man for a Country'. Although both films have plenty of character and dramatic characters, there is a lot more to the side of the 'Devil' thriller at a faster pace. 'No Country' is a cold and embarrassing film that you can really appreciate when 'Devil' is a little more enjoyable. There is definitely less violence in 'Devil' than 'Country No'. Performed as well as distributed. Ethan Huq, sometimes in the past, shows wood, gaiters, sweat and deer-in-the-headlights. Philip Simmur Hoffman as Andy is becoming the toughest scene in the film and the fastest actress, whom you believe can do something. <br /> <br /> There is really no mistake with this picture. It's jumping behind without confusing. The events are spiral outside the control, but the film never gives a notice - (from the first timer Kelly Masters), directing (Experienced Sydney Lumet) and editing is as strong as a drum. In many departments, this is the eligibility prize, although films like 'The Depended' and 'No Country' narrow it down beyond Limleight. If you like it, you like this.
