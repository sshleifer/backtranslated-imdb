This is a wonderful film about a prostitution in a fishing village, which can be combined with the constellation in the direction of Old Kurussa's work and the doctrines of human psychology (O-Shin - Sonia Marmadova), Shakespeare's play and Hans Christian Andresen's tragic and joyfulness. The screen is wonderful, the scenery colorful and beautiful scenes are really impressed in my mind. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each letter is very well developed and attractive - there is a small step, so if you do not like all the feelings but you will also come to your costs. It is not about mysterious gi≈°as and proud samurai, their Bushdo is covering them all, but life, work and people of different types are available everywhere at any time. Kurosawa is a lovely and interesting tribute, certainly worth seeing.
