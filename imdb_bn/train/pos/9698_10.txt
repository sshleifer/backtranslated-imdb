I've seen this movie for many years and for my life, why do not some people think that it compares father. This picture is not about the secret life of all the creatures that could secretly speak. Instead, it is a parrot who learns to talk to her owner, a small girl with a serious stammer, her heart-splitting view will only separate her from her lecture. Then start the great journey. Poly Parrot tries to find her a great friend Mary. <br /> <br /> As well as on the way, he shows a number of wonderful people and countless people. She falls in love with a girl parrot and lose her. He became a life of crime and then a bad scientist who took him away from him who wants to exploit him. <br /> <br /> He narrated to a sympathetic janitor of his story lab, who agreed to help him escape and find his loved ones. Mary. <br /> <br /> Tony Shalb has a shining look like a liberal crowd with open mind and heart, and despite the risk Polly decides to help a little. Joy Mohar is one of the diverse characters in the parrot voice and it's coming together. [<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fun and watch too much. This is a great, cute, epic adventure story and finally a great love story about a bird and her little girl. The children who have seen the wild animals of wild wild animals in Los Angeles and Pasaden will be particularly benefitted from seeing them. This film and the burden that birds, especially the pots are not wearable pets. Everywhere throughout the children, pets can see deep attachments and the love of the dog or the vessel and loyalty is considered as a gift. <br /> <br /> So there's no babies here, one more incredible journey. Enjoy <br /> <br /> <br /> and try to drag the time of the sad parts.
