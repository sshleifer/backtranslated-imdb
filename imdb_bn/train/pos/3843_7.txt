For the first time, I saw this movie for theater at foreign film festival, I thought it was an interesting, interesting, sensitive bi-sexual artist. Very European, so very Dutch! I recently hired it for a second look and could not laugh at the crazy writers with religious-sexual repression complications, that can be very laughable. Get a grip! This guy is a freeloader, living off society. The real reason for this fantasy-nightmare about "suspects" is that he suspects his crime of crime ignores the advice of the clay about going to the car (and the bed) with strangers over the years! He (probably taxfree) is not looted to create stories, but he is very cheap to cut hair, so he laughs beauty salon owner. If he complained of bribery allegations! But since the film was created, I suspect the world is very different. In a serious note, it was entertaining for John De Bont's camera work and one of Paul Verovan's earlier films. Hmmm, perhaps the world did not change so much?
