The word "superstar" has rarely worked on this day, but here there is a man who truly deserves it. <br /> <br /> I gave fingers to this whole show. The song selection was perfect - it was only during weak new songs that I really listen to songs and spend with documentary footage. I liked that there were only five people in the band in very busy environments. (With this energy song, you do not need a circus to entertain). <br /> <br /> Public shots were also amazing. How many actors can influence the actual Beatles fans (now at 50 and over), to get kids to the opening lines of "Do not Buy Me's Love" and to influence kids in them? <br /> <br /> When I was seeing, I also realized that after the tragic death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney immediately became a speculation. Paul not only lost John and George (their final relation did not matter, the loss of a person you made the world difficult to lose), but his wife Linda lost and never seemed to recognize Lenin's assassination. I acknowledge that Lennon's assassination was horrible, but now I realized that Paulo had forgotten later. I am very happy that he again got the love of Heather. <br /> <br /> Those who complained of audio / video quality, I had no complaints; Both my set crystal was clear. I think these same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format is removed; They will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity when I did not buy tickets for this event. Thanks for this video I could enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When John John Lennon thinks he will remember his song and his song first. I have now got a new perception for Paul McCartney, because if he does not do anything else, he will be remembered for his song first. And hope other rails will not change this, because McCartney's catalog is pretty good.
