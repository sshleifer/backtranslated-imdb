Wonderfully unequaled in a movie or video for a game, ARMS and The Man continued continuously in several stages since its debut in 1894 - in a small part it was not as good as a trick on nature, heroism and war business. Whenever the world falls into conflict, ARMS and Man never fly more time and as relevant. <br /> <br /> This game turned into Oscars Strauss (except for the best ideas of Shaw). In the successful opera, Chocolate Solider (when he got a Hollywood *, he paid off his last landing instead of paying for his rights - Oscar was the winner). The best of Sham was always his ideas and instead of his left plots, RMS and Man were in conversation, yet the plot shone and managed to maintain happy end to everyone associated with the master. <br /> <br /> Young Runna (Helena Bonham Carter), an officer and the richest man in her city, is married to a dancing officer in the Bulgarian cavalry, and everyone thinks he is on the altar (Pip Torrens) His army escaped from the war that had escaped from the street and came to his drainpipe. Like a satirical wave, it is not shown for the first time, and social conferences stand on their heads for easy discussion - and not so easy. There are no "good boys" or "bad boys", only people of different classes have found their best ways - just like life is just good - and naturally accompanied by soundness, wisdom is humbly honored by all stakeholders. <br /> <br /> The movie version of Shaw's most traditional and traditionally funny movie (1932) from the movie (from Shay's own play) and its first one in the end of the Atlantic, has long been missing. Shawo did not sell screen rights in his play - got license for only 5 years, and it seems that as soon as the 1932 films were developed rapidly, after a few years the films were primitive, the SHOW did not renew the license to display it. . As a result, we are finally on the BBC's loan, finally their 1987 broadcast version was placed in the DVD box with nine amazing dramas. (Somewhat sadly, PYGMALION, with many scenes as the best of Shaw, with Lin Redgrave and James Villiers, comes at least in this product.) <br /> <br /> It has also been added as a DVD. Less impressive one works, DESTINY makes for a real treasure, a man, ARMS and people. <br /> <br /> After Helen Bonham Carter cut his teeth on television like this, a big film career that will bring many visitors to this first role. They will not be disappointed, because Mrs Carter's level of innocence has been consistent with the expectation from him, but under some pedestrian guidance of James Celan Jones (and despite the BBC's uniformly beautiful and well-observed physical production) the harmful fire of the role (and undermining the last work) Its turmoil) is close to only 80% of its probability. <br /> <br /> The original star of the piece as "swissers" as bluetschly, can be said about pip trenches. This is a fine, attractive performance, but it does not apply to physical comedy in the initial geographical situation, where the young soldier can stay awake steadily despite the danger of his death. <br /> <br /> In spite of these reservations it is a solid small screen transferred with a wonderful game production. It is widely seen and ideally, Wilde's A Ideal Hussband's recent rebuilding style and enthusiasm is applicable for an even longer living screen. Literally * no * ARMS and people are cherished, and with many fate probably we'll even see the original version 1932. 'Until one or the other surfaces, please love anyone who loves this production well.
