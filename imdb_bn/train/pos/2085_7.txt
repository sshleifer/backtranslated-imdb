Sydney Franklin's "The Good Earth" has earned a timeless story and classic performance thanks to the classic status, especially from Louis Rania, who won Oscars for O'Lean's photo. Rainers performance is so complete, that he is almost unrecognizable. Very little dialogue across the whole film (and it's a long one), Rena depends on the face and body language instead. He sees and works in China, that anyone who is unfamiliar with his work can easily make mistakes like him. <br /> <br /> This image seems relevant today because it searches for billionaire stories and public themes that come with it. . Finally, after the years of famine and poverty, when the lungs and the wife of the financially received financial success, they have full life of wealth but lacked money. Every time they return to the earth after the zigzag war (special effects are still incredible and beautiful to make them) they can find fulfillment again. A common source, made by a Chinese family (especially for 1937), makes the movie classic. Without friends and family, money is not worth any value, a point that it fully enhances the film in the last 10 minutes with a passionate conclusion.
