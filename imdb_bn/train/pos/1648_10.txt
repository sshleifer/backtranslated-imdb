This is one of the best movies ever made. This was a realistic illustration of a rural ranching life which was a big part of American history. Setting was 1906 Wymming, where life has not changed much since the past century. This photo keeps your interest without the link to the Hollywood. The whole family can see this movie and be curious about what life was like in America when it was the country of most villages. In this picture, you will run away from the present and be a witness of daily life 100 years ago. In a beautiful, beautiful environment you will see the difficult physical work needed to survive, as well as the concerns and concerns of the elements and the pressure of the market that will distinguish between success or failure. Watch this movie and it is the most in our country's history as a life experience. Your time is worth watching this picture. My only question is - why not have more such pictures?
