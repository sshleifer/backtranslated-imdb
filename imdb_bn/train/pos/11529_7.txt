As a biographical film, "The Lady With Red Hair" (director / producer / drama David Belasco's story of how the infamous social divorced Mrs. Leslie Carter turned the international stage star) is definitely not in the league with another Warner biopic. The same wine, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what?), But "Lady" is an enjoyable movie of her own enjoyment - and Cigoni shares a number of features with the classic. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "Lady With Red Hair", grasping the old time with the smell of the show-business. (Among other things, both theaters have delicious theatrical boarding-house sequences as well as inevitable scenes, backstage and theater manager's offices.) Also, like "Lady" Keon Biopic, supporting cast has become known and the favorite character actor of the time, Remember for. <br /> <br /> I said again, "Yankee doodle dandy," "lady of the red hair" does not give the truth on the way to saying good story? But, like "Dandy," "Lady" - runs gloriously! - To showcase the personality of his show-business-giant hero's personality. Everyone knows that Cagney was limited to his impressive and tender illustration on "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but some filmmakers realized that Cloud Renaissance "Lady of the Red Hair" - served similarly for David Belasko. A panache that is almost equal to Cagney. <br /> <br /> Rain-as-Ballasco captures perfectly that legendary showman's galvanic personality in his extraordinary glory. Rainfall is a lot of enjoyable, well-executed and uncommonly true-life-life performance, such as once a person is called "wizard". "Lady with red hair" to see Claude Renaissance in the film "Red Hair", in the movie "Lady with red hair" is going to show David Balasco in life for filming so that he can not hold things down and then stay in Moin Stem.
