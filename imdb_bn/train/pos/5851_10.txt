* Speaker * <br /> <br /> This is the second pay-per-view I just gave a perfect 10, the first was the 1991 Royal Rumble. It was memorable, just disposable fun was full of exciting matches. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> They were okay, but Dibies deserves the best of its final wages in every match. On this day, a match like this would be a big climax for the run-ins and Roger's first big baby push. And the intercontinental title runner, Janet, can play better matches with Barghaar. But I do not really think of anyone caring. They only need to hit a bolt for television to pay televisions. <br /> <br /> IRS and Kid were great like Michael and Perfect. I could win the perfect, but there was no Michael. Notice, how it is right after this, he leaves W. F.F.F. so he will not have to work in razor. There were two great rebellions with Brett Heart's Dowen (notice how everyone is against the best hit man) and then Lollar. Their competition was a classic; That year, Fid of the Year-Breeder was in that year. How often do you see two legends winning their career fiddling late this year? <br /> <br /> Steiner-Hevei is one of the best in the body match year. Who knows that companies can ever stand against themselves in the best parties? Many people say that Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez match was a waste of time. But I like it. Remember, the old WWF (e.g., pre-WWID) was a great mix of athletics and fiq show. Are there souls who do not like the Achim? <br /> <br /> They hold Lex Luger well, but likes to keep Yokozuna belt intelligent. Superstar Graham has been the first Hill since holding the belt for more than two months. Nowadays, heels are always champions. But if you are blink with WWF from the beginning of the WWWF 90, you missed the rule of a Hill title. <br /> <br /> As a fan of old school wrestling, this and Samarama '88 is my darling.
