Itoro Scola is the most important Italian director. My parents and I saw "Siravam Tanto Amitie" together on the summer night: we liked it, but we did not like it as we like "special days". I believe Itto Schola is undoubtedly undoubtedly: we often forget to remember him, perhaps because of his latest film disappointment. And so, last night, my mother and I were sitting in our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, instruction, cinematography, scores, and production design were quiet and correct, but the thing that I liked most was Lorraine and chemistry in mastriani. They play excellent actors and Antonio and Gabriel. Antonio is a housewife: married to a fan fascist, she has six children, but her husband wants to get another child to get a reward for a huge family. Gabriel is simply an Anti Fascist. They spent a special day, Hitler came to Rome while visiting Mussolini on the special day of 1938. I do not want to hide more about this plot: Find this image!
