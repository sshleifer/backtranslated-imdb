I knew I was going to see this when I first saw the preview. Dennis Quaid was one of the reasons, but your dream-keeping theme talks to me. People talk about this as a movie for kids, but I think it's a movie for children's buyers, old age, weak parents, our own death, our kids grow up and leave us and we never thought of what we would have . <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of tragedy; What do you mean when you have a real dream? <br /> <br /> The quad is too small for a pitch but he looks good on it, and Rachel Griffiths makes a small part as the wife as a thoughtful, layered performance. The camera work is slow and sweet. When they put this movie together, they give up what they need. very nice.
