This was another great Tom Bearer movie. But some people were right, it was like another SGT Barnes character, but it was still awesome. Tom Bearera played a great sniper in the Panamanian jungle! Billy was the first non-private Ryan conservator from the conservation of CPL Upham, but eventually he became a bit annoying! Sniper was scary and action buffs should see it. I remind you that it will not work as much as a Rez action flick. I found it in DVD and it's great!
