What a Neglected 80's Soundtrack I imagine John Travolta sang some songs, but the 80-second cheese that was seen in the film seems to be a personality. There was clearly the style of style depending on mechanical bulls, bartenders and imperfect relationships. The best was his lousy Texas pronunciation. Compare to Night Lights on Friday. I recommend watching a cocktail and crazy crazy is really going to be dumbing down the film. Also, an extraordinary bad movie as a side note made in America with Ted Danson and Huepie Goldberg. I did not realize that I never saw it. Another strange genre of this genre is to include Cadillac Man with Robin Williams. Just remember that these big stars played a big role in this chess movie. Tom Cruise, Richard Prior, Robin Williams and John Travolta
