For the record, I'm not involved in production in any way. Perhaps the hidden Frontier is probably the Star Trek fan movie that has been created with most episodes till date. More than 7 seasons (this is the end) they made 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> This is almost no average credit in budget, and everyone volunteers their time and energy. <br /> <br /> Through their own admission, the previous seasons do not have good production qualities as the next production, but they do not work on the effects, green screen work and progress of all the improvements. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the way from beginning to end and starting from "so hard to dip". From the story, HF benefits are set exactly as star trecks all the best in the world of sci-fi and nicely arcs like Dovesales . The characters from the original series and "relatives" have been brought to the stories and added a lot to the feeling of stories, sometimes improving the letters on the roots. <br /> <br /> In the whole experience The site has a great web site, Bloomer Rils, a high membership forum that is frequently used by many actors and production staff and weekly weekly chat. <br /> <br /> If you look for a high definition, high budget project, perhaps it's for No, you're <br /> <br /> If Star Trek searches for the series of the universe that Star Trek credits and you think it is one.
