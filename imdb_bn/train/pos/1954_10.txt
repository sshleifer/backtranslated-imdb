I did a good job right in this movie. It was not as creative as the original or original, but it was expected to be. It was a complete lotta fun. As much as I think about it more, and when it comes to DVD I will pay for it proudly, every last cent. Sharon Stone is great, he is always, though his movie is a catwoman, but not the film, it is one of the movies that will be underground for life and it will probably become a classic of 20 years. Year Do not wait to be it classic, now watch and enjoy it. An excellent composition, or something that does not expect touching and touching the soul, just withdraw from your life and get involved with yourself. Finally, this movie is entertaining and I recommend that those who do not see it do not see it because critics and box office do not always count, see for yourself, you never know, you can enjoy it. You can I have my hat tips in this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
