Here's a great, down-of-the-bad revenge story in a relentless and rough Denzel Washington actress. He has three personalities here: a down-out-out-low-key-drunk-former merchant, then a loving father-type person, a little girl, and then unexpected answers and a cruel madness for revenge. <br /> <br /> The story is about Washington being assigned as a bodyguard for a small American girl living in Mexico, where children's abduction happens regularly (at least according to the movie.) She conquers children with children and joins the children. Our day actress, Dakota Fanning. When fans are abducted in front of him, Washington's people are responsible and do not rob anyone. Caution: This image is not for Squimish. <br /> <br /> It's a stylish movie, which is good and bad. I liked it, but most people think it is very dangerous for their taste, because the camera-work is something that can give you headache. I was interesting to look at this fictional story and see, but it is not for all the taste (shiny camera). <br /> <br /> In addition to the two stars, the continuous catchy Christopher Walken, an uncharacteristically less original role, and other fine actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is an emotional tenderness among all of us, but it works.
