In the humiliating role of Olivia De Ohwilland, a wonderful time to play effectively against Fontan with his earlier naive wall effect, the murderer Meldrum It's OK, because the fontain is nice. Charles wrote for the hitcoat Charles Bennett and later wrote classic scripts for classic British horror films Night of the Damon. The opening scene, where Ivy visited a cruel lucky Taylor, operated by the wonderful Una O'Naner (James Whale's Sketchy Sketch), a tour de force, and the film maintains an interest in numerous sinister machinations. I hope this movie will be seen in DVD, but such frustration as it seems to be a vaguely obscure film. Thankfully, I found AMC seven or eight years ago but it was not seen later. If you can catch it!
