I must admit that I went into the feather pitch with low expectations. Jimmy Fallon's last movie (taxi) catwoman was bad and the fever pitch trailer was not right, it was not a huge expression to me but it did not make me mellow. I had already prepared some cheesy baseball puns for my review ... <br /> <br /> "I like Jimmy Fallon, but in his movie career the tax has been hampered by the taxis. Now, our Steve ee e-riiIQUUUU has got another strike! And get it back to SNL! "Or" Buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks, but do not buy Fever pitch tickets. You will get out of the theater and go back The! " Then the film had to be a more entertaining way than I expected. But hey, I could not destroy my bird, right? For another reason, I thought I did not take care of the movie that I hate Boston Red Sox. My entire family hates. Referring to Pedro Martinez's name, I was sent to the bathroom only. Oh man, hold on ... <br /> ... Okay, I'm back. However, my mother, who is the fan of St. Louis Cardinals, still believes that the world series has been abusive last year. He refused to believe Saks won it legitimately. But I am quite a few people with the sorrow of Revere Sox fans, but fever pitch makes me sympathetic to me. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has passion for sports can be related to some level movies. If you do not have a favorite sports team, you can not fully understand the extreme height and low burden that you can go through a fan like Fonon. There is nothing quite as fresh as a new season's smell and a clean slate as well. Well, figuratively speaking. This is a sports fan's joy. "Til next year", "Your mantra, your ideals, your prayers are gone - and the blistering pitch influences that rivalry. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that the film holds an imaginative story and is against it Unlike the World Series of Socks, this year's real-life backdrop, I do not love it so much that I want to get married, but you know what I mean, I hope it Atom will be conducted in orderly, and when some humor is a little stupid, it is actually quite realistic. <br /> <br /> You see, Ben's uncle took him to his first red SX game, he was 7 years old, and when he died He left Ben for his two season tickets and Ben did not miss a game for 23 years. At the beginning of each season, he is on a draft day where he and his friends meet together They can go to any games, all of which dance for the Yankees Games and whenever they complain that they threaten them with tickets to play with Royals (sorry Mr. Shade) and The Devil race, this is a very good scene and it works very well. Because I really know who is "Ticket Draft Day". I must admit that when I go to dinner with Lindsay and her parents, I can relate. Red Sox is playing a street game, but it decides to tap it instead of living to watch the TV. One of the most dangerous things in life is to tap a game and then stay in the public and try to avoid listening to the result. There This is a very imaginary and terrible situation. Weil, when a guy shows up in the restaurant and shows the game, Ben enters the danger zone. Ben did not immediately listen to the result so that he started shrieking across his ears and like a banshee. Lindsey is embarrassed, and her dad does not know what to think. Yes, sports fans can be weird, I do not deny it. But it's real. <br /> <br /> Now you can be frustrated if you expect unreasonable, stylish things for overwhelming brothers. Although they say that Lynde is sometimes said to have been "stroke hunting" in his face, how likes Lykes, but overall it is more neutral, romantic aspects for bronze display. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Thankfully, when there is some dampness in the damp When it starts, Farrelli knows when to pull. Lindsay bently told Ben for a romantic moment of jumping on the field and announcing his helpless love to Ben, "Will you tell me about Outfield? Is this spongy?" Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material he can manage himself well on the big screen, and Drew Barry's romantic comedy remains a permanent source of the grave. Fever pitches are just good, strong entertainment that takes a new look in the romantic comedy style. This is a movie that can relate to both boys and gals. Especially those who practice sports fanatism at some time during the year and who are M.E. <br /> <br /> should be tackled <br /> <br /> Now if Red Sox fans are silent about "Curse of Bamboo" It will be appreciated. My Memphis Tigers did not win the NCAA basketball basketball championship, so I officially expressed my sorrow over you. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, Red Sox, baseball or sports should generally consider giving a look to fanaticism fever pitches. I will look at the first road and not go out of my way to see it, but it will create a great mother tongue. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.25 (among 5)
