This will be a bit shorter. First of all, do not listen to critics, because it is not the worst since most say it !! Sniper uses a classic movie formula, many of which spoil the film. Although the sniper does not reflect 100% truth about how our country's military snipers work, it does give it to those who do not know about a sniper in the sniper world about professional sniper. And yes, the movie has many flaws, but there is no movie? There are many good scenes and good acting by Tom Berenger. I want to say, at the beginning of the film, two bad scenes with Billy Zane in the helicopter and after Jane in Marine's Bar scene. The sniper's best scene is to remove opposition forces in the middle of a field with Benenagar !! You also have jungle good shots using the camera and some classic shots as you are looking through the riflescope. And yes, sniper mole 'one shot, one kill'. Judge Sniper for yourself !! <br /> <br />
