There is nothing to shout for Zumboni Chronicles, not an award-winning film, but it is an entertaining B-movie directed by Brad Sykes, who operated Camp Bled, which was another entertaining low-budget flickr. Acting is bad like most cheaper movies but it makes it more entertaining, especially with the budget, the zombie makeup is cool and efficient, the Gori is also cool and fair, the film is a zombie version of the Tales from crypt, we get two stories about militant encounters in militants, stories Have fun and leave you guess especially the first story. Joomla chronicles are much better than fewer budget zombies, if you like low budget B-movies or cheap Zambi flicks, see Jumbo chronicles.
