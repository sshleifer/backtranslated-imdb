The friends of Anton Newcomb and Curtly Taylor, they are both leading into their respective bands; Brian Jonastown genocide with Danie Wahhols and Anton with Antony. What are interesting about their friendships are they competing; Her love hate relationship Sometimes you both praise each other, but the next second complains about how they are stupid and self-absorbed. Although Dandy Warhol went on to commercial success, the BJMC was still stuck in the underground scene; And why good reasons? <br /> <br /> <br />! There is much more to Ant√≥n and BJM because they have too many substances. They are the most effective band. During gigs they will fight and bite each other. If he thinks he is not performing properly, then Anton will hit other members. The alcohol that they use in the amount of drug, the fight always waits. Find out if you go to car cycles to see how a huge car crash happens; Therefore people will go to their gigabytes for the war. <br /> <br /> The arrange is very unstable. Always think of himself as a musical messiah, he wants to change music and create a revolution, but he can not go underground. He is a very talented musician, with his amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill. But back to his paintings he made the world he could not escape; A black hole is a superb musician stuck in drugs, alcohol and depression. On the other hand, Dandy Warhols had their own problems. They did not find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label. But they got huge success in Europe. But Courtney is being sucked back to the world of Anton. Both Anton and Courtney needed what his interesting other needs. Cortini always wanted to be an intelligent musical genius, although Anton did not say it, he needed commercial success for his success. <br /> <br /> The film crew followed these two bands for seven years, there are lots of footage. There is not a dull moment in Digg! It continues to be growing because it does not have a slow time, because it has a lot to say, a seven-year story in 1 hour and 45 minutes is a difficult task. Andy Timer's best music documentaries have done a great job to work together in a row that you always like more. Even if you do not like the band but it is still worth watching; It crosses the music to release a great story of a successful failure. <br /> <br /> Do not be frustrated.
