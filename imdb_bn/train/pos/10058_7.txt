I'm a little surprised about the movie genre of a little child to soften the heart of her reluctant parent. I've seen them enough ?? Baby boom, kolia, a boy, mostly martha, and a little wheel rider ?? Expect to be bored by the formula. What was my attention to the King of Masks: Hate what the city of China in the 1930's. Extreme poverty was ideal, and pregnant children felt so worthless to kill them on their birthday or who would give them their black market. When Wang discovered his purchased grandson, whose nickname "cookie" was his nickname, he initially excluded him, although he showed great promise as running heir to the street. After he reluctantly took him back, he was not very upset when he was kidnapped. This image was radioactive, which was a young man, the smart girl on the street had to survive in that society. <br /> <br /> Two main performance suffers in trustworthy and social context. In a Western society, Wang will expect an indication of at least annoyance from not achieving lesser material. Wang took the station as a famous artist with her social status so thoroughly, even though I did it. While a cookie is displayed in a modern, suburban child suspect a practice and a level of strap, it is completely credible in context of a kids' continuity mode in a society that behaves poor girls like poor. And after seven previous masters physically and mentally abused by him, Wang made a serious connection to his knowledge. <br /> <br /> Small city life, two leadership naturalness actors, wonderful plot twists, and of course, all of the heartwarming resolutions contribute to a very watchable film.
