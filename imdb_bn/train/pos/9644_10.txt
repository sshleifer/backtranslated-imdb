I'm going to give it directly ... This movie is amazing. The acting of foreign gay films produced quality and the story is so fast surpassing American gay films. Although many American Indie gay movies have become popular with France, top-quality foreign films have been popular in France, because of the craziness, bad sound, amateur acting, curiosity line and the lack of nudity or erotica. Cinematography is beautiful, thoughtful, meaningful. The story is adult and complex (but not difficult to follow anyone), acting intense and professional. Both Lead sparkling, as well as the entire cast. The guys just have lots of full nudity without beautiful appearance and full of nudity. You follow these boys the whole year, until their meeting ends. All the small nuances of a relationship, read in love and outside, are performed nicely in detail. I want more of it. Look at it!
