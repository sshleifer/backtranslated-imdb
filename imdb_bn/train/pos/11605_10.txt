The biggest reason to watch this movie was the Susan Swift, an outstanding and greatest exaggerated actress. Time travel movies generally do not interest me and do not cinema about sorcery, but this movie was interesting and vague. It does not depend on deadly special effects, and visitors are not so much focused on traveling during lost and confused. It's easy to keep a really creative film and focused with great acting by all.
