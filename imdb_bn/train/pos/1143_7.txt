I do not see soap. My grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass. I made fun of them at the age of ten (it was very easy). <br /> <br /> But this movie takes parody and makes it a new way. I found the story is pretty fantastic fun. 80's stems - shoulder pads, sequins and polyester - just turn it off. Huge hair, high heels, and hawrionics - key combination. <br /> <br /> And all the actors just go to town, chew out their part and spitting them out into a good well-shredded script. Sally, Kevin, Elizabeth - wonderful! Hypo - Great! Robert Doni - Refreshed to see him behind such tabloid as possible before tabloid. And Gary: Why would he have to wait so long to see the film? Leesa Gibbons - She was not absent, but included him as a real life entertainment reporter (and where did you apply for that job?) <br /> <br /> <br /> I could work without Sally drainpipe Climb Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times? As I did not know every actress in Carroll Barnet and now what I'm doing with it, I can spit out peanuts to them. You are doing this because it is obviously fun in New York's tall building. I'm just thankful that they could not drag the flagpole bits. <br /> <br /> But it was nice, it was funny, it was a plot twist, after the end of the ordinary credit it was before, it was a second glance worthy clothes, it was a great cast and it's personal memory for me There are. Really, what more do you need?
