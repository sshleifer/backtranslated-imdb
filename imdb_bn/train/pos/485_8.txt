'Luzin Defense' is a good movie with fine central performance, but not much of the novel and the filmmaker is not enough. It was felt through most movies that the letters helped to push the story only. Marlin Goris probably tested Luizin's soul and showed that he was brutally scandalous by the cruel purpose of others, like cruel innocent victims. <br /> <br /> Attracting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially in the early 20th century novels. This picture is not deep enough in the relationship between Lugin and Natalia. Natalia's intensity with her soil brought an obscurity to her rather than the dramatic flashpoint of the movie. I think that through the pain of Luizin and the last tragic end, I was given the pleasure of the excitement of his unusual and complex personality. However, it was not an ongoing and enjoyable movie but certainly a great one.
