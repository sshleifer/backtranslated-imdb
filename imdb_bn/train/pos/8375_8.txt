<br /> <br /> Robot Jackson is a small film, well, some set is bad and the act is not awesome, but special effects are very good for this size and age of a movie. You should remember that this movie is now 10 years old and has been created very cheaply in the first place so that you can not express too much mourning about the bad parts. So just go back and see a cool film with great big robots.
