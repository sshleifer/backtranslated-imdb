I would really say, this was always my favorite when I went to see my grandmother. And it's still It is very close to the book, too. The way it is illustrated, and the players were just all excellent! I have to recommend this movie to those who have not seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hate TV movie, but this was really great! I gave it 10/10.
