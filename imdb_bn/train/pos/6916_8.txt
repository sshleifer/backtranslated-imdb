Winchester '73 relocates the film from B-movies to the bigger league, and manages the process of throwing James Stewart's anti-warring career into a controversial hero (though he had inherited the project from Frat Lange, probably the credit that deserve credit). Both men will go to many dark places - with respectable vague Satan Dowro, which was continued by MGM, until it can be released as a result of the broken arrow ?? But as a title rifle, a filmmaker is handed over to the person with the heading before one of his favorite hill shootouts is about to kill a person's own victim, but you can expect from the studio still stronger meat than that. Method Great dialogue, throw an impressive support ?? Dan Duryia, Will Zier, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shell Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, JC Flippan, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson? And the outstanding visual sense of the value can increase the bar with this.
