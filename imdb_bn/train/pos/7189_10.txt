My favorite character in the film, but in almost all, Zoro's character is a little masked, and if no one says under that clencher, they are brilliant. <br /> <br /> But Reed Hadele's "Zoro's Fighting Legion" (1932 serial) mask creates a true mystery to fully emphasize its whole face. <br /> <br /> Anyway, one of the best characters of the Zoro movie, and for this to be officially presented, I think Anthony Hopkins is a joy in "The Mask of Zerb" (1998). <br /> <br /> Interesting interest in my pictures is huge, but I have a real choice for the 30s / 40s serial .... <br /> <br /> Bond2a
