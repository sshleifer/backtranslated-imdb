I wanted to see Sarafe Buffy on the big screen, so I bought the ticket first and then checked the reviews at IMDB. I'm worried about watching a bad movie. Well, I made fun of watching the movie. Some parts, which were obviously frightening, were actually quite comical, almost like buffy vampire slayers. <br /> <br /> I do not consider it a bad movie. It is not a great movie. Just a rather well made horror movie. It does not depend heavily on special effects, but camera angle, acting, music. In my opinion, acting was okay. Sarah is very well done, quite a believer. Other actors were not bad, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The sets are beautiful (and the set is true that the sets in Japanese sets were the same). <<br> <br /> Scary moments were often hypothetical. But not all the time. I saw a lot of horror, and was not expected to be scared, but it happened at least twice. Beautiful <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie was excellent, which was almost originally, like rubbish, they had a special effect for the demons, the boy's eyes, the cats crying, the dead son of the guru and his Mother <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, you want to watch movies only for Oscar nomination but do not go. This is a good horror movie, enough mystery. I gave it a 7.
