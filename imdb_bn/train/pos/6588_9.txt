After watching different episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that television producers are completely free from any kind of originality. Here is an old science fiction standby, essentially wrapped as an original idea - and yet they can only do the most - to do it. <br /> <br /> The dialog is good! Male actors are skilled in their profession. Most characters make the hero more attractive than the special characters and the favorite side-kick. And most of the episode plots are as platinous. What could be wrong? How, female characters and cosmetically perfect actress who are portraying them. <br /> <br /> The producers play a strong role in illustrating women's characters - about a good series, in such a way that the last product is a misplaced cheerleader. Why, I ask why <br /> <br /> <br /> These episodes fall when the female guest star or repetitive character comes to the screen. These actresses are completely incredible in their roles, and you are unable to distinguish them from acting they actually do not know them. A blind person could say. Just listen to them. They give their conversation with all the plays and influences of the 16-year-old High School Promon. Who believes this woman as PhD scientist, senator, corporate executive and medical doctor? <br /> <br /> If the producers like Starkard Channing or Morgan Fairchild in a nut shell, guess who they choose - every time? And of course, the series is suffering for it. very bad!
