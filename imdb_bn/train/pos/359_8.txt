I can not believe I'm seeing this movie now - I think maybe I had another movie of abuse about slaves, and for the same reason I avoided the route - just as I still can not see Skinler's list. Do not want to "entertain" the pain of other people, it should not be guessed how accurate or informative it is. <br /> <br /> So I think that the main thing I noticed about colorful purple was that the black man was not mistreated by white. Black people were fully capable of raping their own girls - or giving them away as a slave by their "husbands". It was painful to watch, but eventually everyone freed themselves, and the acting was extraordinary! I could not play the 35-year-old Oprah! And I worship to start with hoops - it was amazing. I'm feeling lousy feeling yesterday afternoon and the showtime color was running so thinner as happy.
