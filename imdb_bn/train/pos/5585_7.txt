This was a very brave movie for her day. It can also be described as a soft-core porn for a silent era. It was a talk, but dialogue was very limited, and in Germany. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the back is forced to run across a field, he leaves his clothes on the horse. An engineer restores his horse and returns his clothes - after getting an eye. <br /> <br /> They are sitting for a while, and at a jing moment, he presented him with a flower with a bee flower above him. This is where he thinks back to the action of his honeymoon and her husband and a worm. He knows this guy is different. <br /> <br /> He returns home and finally finds out our young partner, and abnormally denies him. You can use your imagination here, but his head disappears from the view and we see his writhing with joy. Since she was never unnecessary, you can imagine ... Of course, respect for women by director Gustav Makhati, and a shock for 1933 visitors. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be made in this beautiful movie is the movie. Too much offense, and a weird end.
