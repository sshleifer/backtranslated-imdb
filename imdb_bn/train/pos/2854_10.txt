This movie has been told so long ago and I would like to join those who are praised. It is a very unique film that uses elements of different styles: drama, comedy, gangster film without its mess. In points you laugh only loudly, on the other hand you feel for those characters whose errors and failures you see. Sabur's talent can be shown in some of the films. One where three men pursue each other have a dreamy day about a young girl that they have passed on the street. This sequence has been done nicely and illustrates very well three runner characters. It's loving and fun at the same time. Another example of Sabura's talent is the part of the photo where the runner is tired. The first of them, usually the losing person between the three persons, suesusinat that the woman who has kept her for somebody else has returned and you saw them dance with each other and later they danced with herself, which is walking deeply. All runners reach this point where they think they have lost or tracked. And in one part of the movie they are following each other, running on the line, just smiling. So here we all say beauty and masquerade that will lead to show up throughout the movie. His character has failed (what they end up?) But he does not loot them. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" that he justified Sabur's claims that he was a gifted. Look at him <br /> <br />
