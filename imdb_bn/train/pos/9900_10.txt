This is a movie you wish that you do not like to graduate in schools. If you like this movie, I'll see you Valentine. I have found today that Marty (Simon) who killed himself after releasing himself after a few of his release, because he did a good job, so shameful. She wondered because she was part of the movie she played. When Carroll pushes the girls into the house, it starts as if they do the work to do it. When he had to change in the shower, Carroll's popular friend snuck in the bathroom and prepared everything, got the camera, electric shock, pole. When Marty Curtain opened the butt, she realized that she was cheated. He tried to cover up the shower but the kids opened it, grab the Marti and started being its meaning when rolling the camera. They picked him up, broke the head of the letter when it was swelling, and they gave him a little bit of electricity. When kids are detained, given by the instructor, the boys give a joint of 2 boys Marty that will throw him. Using a brick to apologize to the teacher, leave a break between the glass windows in the gym. Marty is going to the pond in the bathroom, but if the science breaks down on the lab and mixes some things like cocaine, it is not sure what it was. The lab makes him badly distorted. After 5 years, the day the children were tortured, they were invited to reconstruct the 5-year-old school in the old school, the day the boat was blown up. After one person died. I did not understand that the girl was actually drowned. After Marty left he could have gotten back. He got almost the first time to find out.
