The story of a drifter, his sheep ranch, and the boss's girl is not all for taste, but it is still very playful. It happened in the beautiful country of New Zealand, in this scene we got so well through other films in this region. <br /> <br /> This movie was the first time I saw wonderful Mary Regan, and I have been a fan since then. This cast also includes Bruno Lawrence, who is perhaps remembered by the American audience of "Smash Palaces". Terrence Cooper takes a turn as his counterpart who gives little attention to his daughter's wrong attention. <br /> <br /> <br /> They kept quiet, unexpectedly acted separately from all their mobile phones. I first saw this movie in the late night television in America, but you believe me, the obsolete version will not be missed.
