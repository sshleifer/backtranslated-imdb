It's a pleasant film, even if the authoritative fools are. It was kind of a guilty pleasure to see. Meg Ryan seems to be able to act in such a movie (another example is Joe v. Volcano). That makes her a star, its part. Walter Matthew certainly had that power, and he really made himself a role, creating a fun, heartfelt Einstein. I think you can say both good to filming boyfriend characters though loving in various ways (loving young women versus loving curmudgeon).
