In the '70s, Charlton Haston starred in various quality science-Flex flicks. "Soilant Green" is one of the better ones. He played Robert Thorn, New York's Intelligence Department in 2022. In this future, the maximum food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called Swant Green. But when Thorne finds untrue truth about this product, then she sees herself running. <br /> <br /> I think it is only natural that this movie should be viewed by us as today's date. But in spite of this, still raising interesting questions about what will happen to our agriculture. Also played leg-stars-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotton and Edward G. Robinson (in his final role).
