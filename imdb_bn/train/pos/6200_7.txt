Henry Flower is a good film. But this is the perfect way to follow up a film like Henry Flower. To take Henry very seriously, her 'lies' and her mysterious assault. Even the start of the Henry Flower's opening shot, when Simon is holding the ground, Henry walks on the hill and is fully exposed through 'Faye Grim'. Most jokes, which are less or less meta-jokes (about film writing and jokes), but their film is slightly synthesized. Also, the use of Dutch angles across the entire movie of the strike is jerking, yes, its intention, but it appears to be forced and used more, it is beyond awakening, which I would like to call, annoying This is a flawed film, but it must be seen for a Hartley or 'Henry Flower' fan. <br /> <br /> And do not listen to stupid reviews, but if you do not see the first movie, do not see it. If the Henry does not see the flower, the plot, satire and intellect of this movie will be completely lost. This is a signal. It's just stupid.
