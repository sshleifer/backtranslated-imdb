/ I started thinking of the first episode that I saw the Lost, I thought that some of those people who have crashed and are behind by a demon monster. But this is not that, it's much more than that, because they do not have any demons and it's good to see the episodes you've lost. Connection between an underground bunker with an underground island and especially those who cross the road before crashing. This is true secret. <br /> <br /> This series rules and I can not wait to really know what's going on there. I hope they will not miss the last two episodes in the theater, this series 910 out
