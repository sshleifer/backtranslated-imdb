Although I bought the DVD when I first came out, and it has seen several times, I have never written a review. <br /> <br /> I saw it when I saw it and I still like it. Sadly, it seems that it did not earn enough money to motivate anyone to follow up. I still have to control QT rights, but after the Kill Bill, if he made a movie which is as true as my name MyMesty, like comics and books, with the other difficult female lead, anyone can not see the character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The source material is intense, suspenseful and does not have any gore and explosion. Alexander did a great job about how O'Donel's character would take control of the situation. <br /> <br /> I follow the strictly necessary reboots of Batman and James Bond, and this progresses especially towards progress. After the second attempt, although not often known to the public, it is actually a resume of modest character and it is really sad that no film about him will probably be made.
