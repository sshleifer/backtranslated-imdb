The only reason I did not give these 10 stars is DVD format - a menu, extra, etc. However, if you have a dream to do something in your life, then this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dreams, nobody or anything lets you stop. This is one of the most life-assured films I have ever seen. And magical Acting fantastic, works for the purpose of the plot, and the opening sequence is fantastic. It is a film used to describe the "worship" status. I've suggested these pictures to my friends. Some love it, some can not finish it. Whenever I think, or think that something impossible is impossible, I think about Alan Arkin's role in this film. Sure he'd like to do more films.
