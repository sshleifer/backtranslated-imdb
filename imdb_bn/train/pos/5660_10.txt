I saw an episode or two when the show was originally broadcast, but when I saw 1 episode in Netflix I was hooked. I see the whole series like 2 days. :) I really liked Gary Cole's character. First of all, if you are totally blamed, start choosing the character ("There is a thousand uses of these things")! His friend Andy Griffith met Charles Manson to meet the devil. Shiny, charismatic, smarmy, and such kind of dangerous and "kind" I mean "really". When I grow up I want to be like him. Lucas black is very great. The pronunciation is very great. However, I thought it was one of the best TV shows of all time and you owe it to yourself to look at it.
