What a wonderful treat to come across late television. Before watching the movie, I used to read a short plot rundown in only one television list, I passed. The idea of ​​a film about a hit-man-see-a shrink-out-of-absence of business-and-fall-in love. But the film works. From the beginning of the film, it is clear that people put their shoulders on their shoulders, even before a word is also said. Film appearance and feeling perfect. Dark, but not unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Hit-Man touches spirituality as well as the family's views, Messi's character is involved in his marriage, and his father's control. Messi shows a sad sadness, and talking to his little boy on his bed is amazing. The young boy shows acting skills outside his year, and the correlation between father and son is very natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> I see some of the best movies. , And I can not believe I came to it late in the late night television accident.
