I saw this movie years ago in the dark series after the series of Sinamx (then when a box like a box was made), and it made me curious. Although the film has a uninterrupted view, it can be played well. Depardieu and Dairy performances are very enjoyable. They have a good chemistry together and Miou-Miou looks like a pink-colored look. It would not be like a movie, it should be made politically at the right time (at least not in the United States), because it makes things sensitive to envy, robbery, and casual sex. This film proves that there is no good movie for a genius cast and gifted film to handle a good film. It has saddened me that Patrick Deier's suicide happened and I will be examining him with Depardieu and Miu in the near future. -May get out of your chopper.
