This is an important film. It encourages audience to challenge and focus. There are a lot like here. The director seems more interested in taking away some of the tiring cinematical conventions. In contrast to the recent American film, this movie shows interest in what it means to create a movie in the first place. The DVD has many bonus features, and there are two commentaries that explain the movie for the audience, which fail after the initial view. When the movie is shown in syndication, it is uncomfortable and angry to some members of the audience. This is not a coffee movie on Friday morning, party movies on Friday night. For dedicated visitors, it is a braces trove.
