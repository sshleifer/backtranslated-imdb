I can not really say much about the plot of this movie, which has not been told already. I have not seen this movie for 25 years and I have never left the memories. I have been searching for it everywhere. In the past, I searched the net but came empty. Last night I was thinking about the movie and trying to remember who was in it, but I finally saw 10 or 12 years old and I was not sure whether my right movie was named or not, I would have another search and I finally got this sight Found I was right. If someone knows that I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, please leave me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com, I'm really grateful. And anyone who did not see this movie and it has good chance that it is good.
