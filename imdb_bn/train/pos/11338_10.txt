I saw this in "Dances with Films", and it was awesome. I really felt for Jake. Talk about the insults of the injured! Not only is your parents being divorced, but after you have a demon. <br /> <br /> It was both heartwarming and scary - there were many moments where the audience shouted in real fear. It reminds me of a Japanese horror film, except that the story was really good. <br /> <br /> And this is the "Jake's Clooget" from the usual Indie film Pablo - which is different from a nice script with extraordinary characters. Also, mixing elements of horror movies with family dramas, the film finds the best way of both types and avoids both the clich√©s. <br /> <br /> It's not coming to theater, of course, get the DVD.
