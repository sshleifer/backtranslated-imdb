Karloff and LuGosi - together again! One of these films that these casual fans will pass over and do not tend to appreciate much. This is not the all-out horror film like the two previous hits, The Black Cat and The Ren√©ne. However, it is very suitable for both the rewards and a fun movie while re-visiting. <br /> <br /> The invisible verdict is directed by Lambert Hilian, who was chiefly made in the West, but in these final days, Curiously, the Universal Lemelles regime, he himself and Lemmels' final horror film, Dracula's daughter, was able to help. Both are glossy, clear-cut imagery, which is very light in horror content, despite superb ingredients. <br /> <br /> Just as the logosi was wild in the Renen, so much about the invisible ray carlough's hammer needs to be told. One aspect of the story of particularly dissatisfaction is that the character of Karloff, Rukh, becomes so crazy before being poisoned by Radium X, that once he starts to shine, there is no change in him. This is similar to the complaint of Jack Nicholson of The Shining - a fundamental right that he originally started from. There is no real conversion. Same condition Halfway through Carlofe has an additional purpose only to revenge his mind. I still enjoyed his performance, although I used Levi's leading Antrix of The Renavine. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, LuGosi gives you a completely restrained and thoughtful turn as a rival of science. , Dr. Benit To try to catch Rook, Logosio has received some of the best lines in the film, with a memorable warning, in which I have conformed to the horror film writer John Sweater - "And if he (soul) touch some of them?" Asked the visitor. Luigi hesitatingly answered, in a way that only Lugosi could provide, "they die". Like Lugosi can be so close, so he can be perfect than an actor. One of these moments is the one. So, the interactions between Carloof and LuGosi are very good, we make Carloff's crazy antics open against Ludosi's cool argument. Karl has been going to play the same crazy scientist many times, but Logosi could play such a straightforward role. He had only one chance (Ninotacca). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And how this story completes their dark, more awesome pairs. Always the special effects by the innovative John Fulton, all of the awesome and helpful actors are adequate. Freds Drake Matour looks beautiful like a love and plays a powerful woman, which rarely can be seen in classic horror movies. When Karl holds his mark, the scene ends and he does not shout, one of the most horrific moments in the film. A horrible, fun film!
