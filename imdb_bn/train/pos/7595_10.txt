Not the best TV show in lost history, but it's not too far. It is not the plot or characterization of the West Wing or even the even the basic ERT, however, it is reasonably always the most growing show that came to me. I can not guess what is going to happen. I love the re-story of the stories behind the characters that often increase the new dimensions to see them. In some ways I want to keep the show fixed forever, but I think they can get it 6-7 seasons before they finish a glorious high. The combination of character and their nationalities coincided with the show's fluidity to move backwards and thus extends dead characters to "life spans", these shows show that this show is much different than what we are using. It's funny, surprising and (a little bit of advice for all your conspiracy theories here) is more than a little interactive - they will continue internet discussions - you're just adding to the plot ...
