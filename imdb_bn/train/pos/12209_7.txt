I was very impressed with this small, independently created picture. The story, who visits a couple of social networks, becomes friends and provides each other with a supporter system, both of them feel deprived as children, sometimes ridiculous, sometimes sad, but always provocative. In-camera angles, filters, and experimentally used underground bands with slow or fast tactics were mostly effective. Performance (Lead operated by film writers and managers) Over the past few years, what I saw is quite good. If you ever feel compelled to have a circular groove like a round slot, I really believe that you will be "hook or crooked".
