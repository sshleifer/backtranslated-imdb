My 10/10 rating is the only fun factor and it feels like you have even preferred "Slaughter High" before watching it. Yes, it's usually revenge-many years-after-a-messy-thrilling story, but how can you not like the things you have taken here? I could not predict the bathtub in a million years. OK, so maybe we can disrespect and say that the film does not offer anything new. Well, it does not pretend. The "scream" character probably saw it and contributed to its rules about survival of a horror movie. After all, who does not want to see people suffer for this thing? Obviously, it has received a responsive sensation, since people are punished for becoming the champion of '60. But still, you will love this stuff! So, with Don McLeen apologizing, this is not singed for King and Queen of Jassa!
