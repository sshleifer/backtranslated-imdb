The film is opposed to the first since the beginning of Care Bear's and Care Bear casinos. I will not deny that. However, if you look at "Part II" as a separate film, then this is a very good movie. I think it's better than the first movie (and fits between its target demographic audience) in the early 80's (and not that I did not even enjoy it, it seems that this one seems a little extra). Sure it is darker than the first, but it's probably very good. And it is deeply deep (even the kids can not fully understand), but due to the closure of the environment, there may still be a little bit scary and the adult must be fast because I can see this movie again. In my mid-twentieth century) you basically have a young girl in exchange for something else in order to make an agreement with an evil spirit / giant. Take the picture? But just watching it as a child, sure as I can be a little scary, but nothing traumatizing. Actually if it gives me another fantasy game, then I can play at that age. I wanted to hold Dark Heart in my prison, I did not tell him to help me hold care Bears, try to bring me back to darkness, etc. The movie was good for my imagination. And it got a very great emotional depth. I used to see it at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Hadlee was the perfect choice for Dad Heart talk (I always thought and I would always go). <br /> <br /> Now it's too bad that they never made the soundtrack available. Sometimes I want to hear the film grow without seeing it, as good as it is. <br /> <br /> "If love is better then he will not live?"
