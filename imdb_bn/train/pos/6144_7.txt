When I saw it on Disney's wonderful world as a child, so I do not think so much about it. I recently saw it, I was sitting there thinking, "I saw this wonderful thing". <br /> <br /> 'Travel' scenes may be seen due to LSD overdose. Animated Characters Most Wonderful Color / Voice Versions of Jungle Books and Robin Hood Characters. I noticed some non-Disney things: knife points and prostitution (during road song portbole) children's children are threatened. <br /> <br /> It was very entertaining, although the musical numbers were long and I could see the kids being bored with them. Also, the matter was a bit dark, it was set during WW2's time.
