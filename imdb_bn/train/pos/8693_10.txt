When I came to America I was very young, but I recorded it from TV and until I reminded the whole thing, I have seen it again. Till today I quote myself. The show itself was sunny and there were many famous characters from Frank Sinatra to Sylvester Stallone. Mr. T. This voice was great and they sounded like the illustrations. The doll is also doing well, though a little awesome. I recently discovered it was discovered by Rob Grant and Doug Nillor of Red Darf, a show that I enjoy. Another person's opinion was written earlier, I was also covering this great show with a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I'm sure there was a demand for DVD release for this show, but I do not think enough people heard it. Oh well, maybe i will try ebay ...
