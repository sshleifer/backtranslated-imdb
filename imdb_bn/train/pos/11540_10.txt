This Neil got a lot of praise that pieces of pieces in Simon! "Kinky couple" is one of the kind of gems that links to. You've got Felix Anger (Jack Lemons); A hypocondrike, a trickle yarn, and a big thorn next to his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Manu); Total slob These men have great work though. Felix is ​​a writer, and Oscar is a sports writer. These two men are divorced, Felix's wife is close, while Oscar is on the other side of the United States (West Coast). Yes, what can you say? Two men living in the roof together without the madness of each other, impossible and impossible It's a complete sunny and a lot of fun. I like the part where the two British neighbors who talk to the gentleman, and after firing Felix after the Oscars, he becomes lucky and is with them when they refuse to dinner with them before the night. It's almost time that Felix needs to be lightweight. I guess the light-freaks light up all light. They may be patient, but they should be patient. A very funny movie, and a Nuevo classic. Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" will definitely see a classic movie. 5 stars!
