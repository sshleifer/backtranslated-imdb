Unlike any other user who sucked the film (and that was Olivia Smile), I disagreed. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing !!!!!! Olivia Hassie is awesome in everything! Yeah, he can be older, because many people remember him from Romeo and Juliet, but he's wonderful! <br /> <br /> This story line can often be used, but it is a unique film and I will fight against anyone who disagrees with it! I enjoyed this movie as much as I have any other Olivia Smiley movie. Olivier's "my daughter" and I love her work. <br /> <br /> I saw the first time on Saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with it. It's not just an Olivia movie, but because of its unique story line and surprising aspect.
