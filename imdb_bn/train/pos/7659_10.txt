Just finished watching this film, which is quite upset to me This movie has often been twice in South Africa. <br /> <br /> This is definitely hard hit, and the first scenes have been 'set the scene'. Gradually slowly get a break opportunity, and there must be some light moments. <br /> <br /> Never again see Nigel Hathorn. She came across as a very twisted person, and every time I appeared to myself she found more of her dislike. <br /> <br /> Steve-Thump's clear and well-thought-out comments completely agree with.
