One movie that gets funnier during the mysterious men's time. There is a silly innocence and character "niceness". This has become part of our family's "culture" and we often quote the letters. This is my favorite film for the past two years. My kids 13 and 11 and we all love this picture. Great acting and comedy. We love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python flicks too. Okay, we are not talking intellectually here, only family ties!
