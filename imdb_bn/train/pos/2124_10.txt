This is a real classic movie in his story, acting and film presentations. Wonderful actors are full throughout the film, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart are the most characters. He is widely acclaimed in real life, and he loves Jimmy, and actually gave him the role of his first acting role, and the set helped him to be more calm with his appearance. The "chemistry" between the two was always clear, and so warm and enjoyable to enjoy. She was so sweet in such a beautiful, young girl, and her personality illustration. The story of these two young people, and finally how they come together together, is interesting and pure magical entertainment to see. Heart warming presentations are also given by these wonderful stories / other supporting actors of the film. I sincerely give Miss Sullivan the perfect 10 of this Golden Age movie classical, which is special appeal for all generations. Must be seen for an all!
