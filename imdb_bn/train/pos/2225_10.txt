I am completely surprised that this show has been canceled. It lasted only one year. I recently started to see it and I like it. This is a show that can go as a friend. It was humorous and extremely enjoyable. <br /> <br /> It is about two brothers and two sisters living under one roof without their parents. Cart (Joey Lawrence) plays the part of the oldest brother and plays a more paternal role. <br /> <br /> It should be much more permanent than the year as it was fantastic. Wonderful show with all the best actors <br /> <br /> 10/10
