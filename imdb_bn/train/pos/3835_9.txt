This picture is amazing - it's just like a nightmare. Wicked stories, dark decors, swarming insects everywhere, ideas jump and surrealistic dreams ... really great! People who love civilized movies or very dark thriller will find this fantastic. It looks a bit like David Lynch's film: Strange Story, Wonderful Dream, Red Screen. Nuit Noire has almost no plot. It is rather a succession of spiritual events, nightmares and meetings. That's an error. If the film was a really fascinating plot of exciting with an impressive condemnation, I would give it 10 out of 10. But that's missing, and seeing I gave this movie 8. Nuit Noire is a movie worth watching. Find that DVD and you will be rewarded!
