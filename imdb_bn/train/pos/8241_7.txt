Fidois is a very weird film. And in many ways, one of the very best. <br /> <br /> The first thought of my visit, how are they going to market this thing? Shown of the Dead is a romantic comedy with Jimmy, Fido is a boy and his dog's story mixes with 50 percent of Nostalgia Comedy with animals. The tongue is not closed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At first I thought we were in Paris Parody a La Matinee of the cold war of fifty years, but soon we were inserted into the bright primary color and the middle of fifty. -class nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinin is a lonely boy The person who does not fit in the school, his mother's social dispersion, and his father's nervous and isolated. <br /> <br /> Joan In order to communicate with Ces, Mom (Kerry-Anne Moss) has earned a zombie, but Jimmy initially is incomplete, but 'Fido' (Billy Kennley) soon proves to be a great friend for Jimmy, until his collar is blurred ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Humor is light family diversity, and sometimes the plot line is very dependent on the boy and his dog / family moments. <br / > <br /> Still the picture Ismayakarabhabe dark, truly funny moments through the shot. Welcome, Burdhaman time, which is a family comedy that will ensure him a rating ratings. <br /> <br /> The movie looks superb and plays nicely with everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Its difficult tonal problem, I hope this movie will be a special place because it's a little bit of the cats in this year's cat flood.
