Resident Evil: Code Veronica is a great well-made video game, it's a great graphics, very comfortable control, a great story and a high fun factor. This story is that Claire Redfield was taken to an island for a violation of the umbrella land and was rebuilt, they were the main lab in search of his brother. Code Veronica's graphics are very good, the effects of fire and rain are very good. The controls are comfortable, but the button pattern does not match the Dreamcast control, it makes it difficult to use, it still surrounds some funny places, and shoots from the hands of the zombies. Code: Veronica has a little bit of "romance" among the two main characters. You can also play Resident Evil 1 as Chris Redfield. The word in this game is much better than before, for example, even though I hate the new feature, when the giant spiders crawl, they make feet sound boring and the guns are more realistic. Wonderful graphics, outstanding stories, comfortable controls, and real stagnant words makes the Living Evil Code: Veronica is a specific choice. I figure it out 10 out of 10.
