Do not persuade by the Nasaiyads. This is a wonderful wonderful film. This was a thesis project writer / director, jetty petty. He did a great job of having me in the edge of my seat. I could never have expected what to expect, and for the awful horror-film gear, this was a bit bitter! The film is an old man who lives in an isolated log cabin in the jungle. One day, while looking for his cat in the forest, was he a witness to the murder of a child? He agonizes about this remaining film The most unusual about this image is that there is no dialogue till the last few scenes. I found this to be provoking. The authors hold your sense and give them a relentless tug. Give this film a go, you will not be disappointed.
