American icon Henry Fonda has published "elegant" John Howard, who is an elderly person, who has re-established his favorite big stain "Allaner" after being in a permanent hospital, his "patent". He wants to score once more, he is admitted to the hospital, steals the aliano and hooks up with the old friend Penelope Pearson (Aileen Brainnayn), which needs to be transferred to his prostitution. <BR> <br /> <br /> The wondrous performance of the Foundation is a natural anchor for a movie which is terrifyingly affecting heartwriters, and it grasps funny bones in a more humorous scene. A wonderful actor like Robert England, a reluctant young sided, Susan Sordon (who gets co-producer credit), and Dob Taylor (always the most humorous part of the film, always a lovely ham). <<br> <br /> The film finally carries an incredible weight of life-defining nature and cruelty of travel; This is a picture that you provide to it, you can remember it after the end. <br /> <br /> The promise of the open road is clearly displayed here; The village looks just beautiful Set the amazing music score of Craig Safen, it's an extraordinary picture in the aesthetic terms. <br /> <br /> It will lose some of its final work (the characters of John Banner and Austin Pendleton are a little more than intimacy), but it still maintains its best VBs to thank for its appeal to the central character. No Exposure / Drive-in scroll title from the title can not expect from a title (especially its alternate title, "The Great Smoky Roadblock"), a rewarding film experience that I can not afford Can recommend <br /> <br /> 9/10
