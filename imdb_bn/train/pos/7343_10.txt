Why this movie has disappeared in all the miracles is an absolute crime. "Canaan" is probably the only sword and Sorcery movie. Cruel violence, cool character design, and good pacing, the best imagination around this one. This is definitely the greatest animated movie I've ever seen, more adult audience targets. This is not Bakhshi's usual volcanic style. It's too late for Bacchis, and in my opinion, his best work. I hope this picture recognizes it.
