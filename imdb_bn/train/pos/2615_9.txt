When a plane, flicking through the movies big favorites, I came across the live! Almost accidentally. Oh boy <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think it was impossible to see the trailer one year ago and I just forgot that there is nothing more than a silly movie about the fool reality show. Now I can easily say that this is a journey a hell. I think last time I was so excited, not afraid. The height was not sure with my senses, but through the film gradually grown through the film, where you do not move from the screen, you can literally sit on the edge of your seat and spend the remaining nails. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Why not always?" Why "people may become so rogue" can move away from thinking. Ask yourself if you do it. Then learn about competitors, start their goals and guesswork. You will then drag the opponent one by one and the first candidate will be excited even when he is safe. <br /> <br /> Good acting with a movie experience, good guidance that reminds you of the old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still want more. <br /> <br /> * Spoolers * I could change some things: <br /> <br /> - Wrestling of the competitors. I was really moved by the farmer and we should have had something more like him. The idea of ​​a wealthy writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it seems like you have not noticed any of the competitors. Although it has been accomplished, I think viewers should be able to cooperate with most of the participants. - Game rules, a big mistake: <br /> <br /> When the 5th competitor drags the trigger, he does not die. If you feel serious the last permanent guy will pull the trigger and run it myself !!! They should give the opportunity to all the competitors to live, that is, 5: If there is a blank, then no one dies. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I did not get too annoyed by these bad points because I had a really good time. Just wanted to have some popcorn with me!
