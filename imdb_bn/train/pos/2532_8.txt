In the third collaboration with Karloff and Luigosi, Pao and science fiction progressed to the kingdom of cereals. Carloof Carfothian Mountains can capture light rays through its telescope and the creator of a device that can translate into images that create a visible history of the universe. Johns Rukh plays. An astronomer and chemist who blamed theories of rooks. As the Bennet, Lugosi, he has revealed the unknown radioactive element, there is a term called "Radium X" which fell on Earth in the darkest Africa several thousand years ago. . Carleaf joined the campaign to prove his theory, but Radium X is a complex compound - it cures long-range mountain ranges and low-level blindness. Rukh is unexpected, but the poisonous, poisonous darkening of the old Ready Brand ad! Bennet has the power to activate the counter for radiation, but it is very helpless in the poison and healing compounds. He was deceived, he found out the members of the mission in Paris, with his abstract wife, and his touch in his radioactive state means death ... <br /> <br /> <br /> The old pseudo-scientific idea The eyes of a dead person record the picture of their murderer (an extraordinarily independent Carloof!) And the radium X device symbolically represents the symbolic members Others have dissolved. And even James Wale's touch in a cocoon landlady in Paris <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The lack of motion in the film, but Is always absorbing Carloop slightly overdoes his performance but Lugosi is awesome. Compared to Universal londoseean, many drug doctors used Lone Chaney Jr. (this time made by electricity) and Lionel Atul with the original storyline in Man Made Monastery. An intelligent and cute cute film with lots of complimentary judgment. Not as famous as other universal scares, perhaps, but it works and is extremely entertaining.
