When I was about 8 years old, I had seen Walking Tall films and I thought Joe Dawn Baker and BoSwenson did a great job, they must have done it, because after watching movies, I tried to learn a lot about the actual Sheriff as Buford Pusser I can do All three parts of the movie have cooled me down and Booster was a real hero, I was only alive today and there were more people like him. I'd like to rid him of all the crimes and thank him for being so brave. I was very sorry that her family had to go through such horror and pain. My heart goes to them. The 30-year-old fan of Sheriff Possar and the 3-part Walking Tall will not be negative about the film and the actors, they just wanted to let us know what a wonderful man was the actual Buford Pusser and what he was a great family. And to all the young people who do not hear much about Buford, I recommend you to watch Walking Tall movies and learn more about them.
