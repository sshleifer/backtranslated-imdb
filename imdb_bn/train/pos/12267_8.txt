Tintin was one of the favorite heroes of my children. I got books in school libraries for every opportunity. My favorite one was "Red Sea Shark" - so much fun and humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This documentary is a brilliant expression of the hedge background and the development of tintin. In Herage interview, the story of his relationship with the artist was very running for the filmmaker's personal experience and the inspiration of Chan's character. <br /> <br /> is a very talented and loving artist. A great example of anyone who has become internationally famous and has delighted millions of children (and young people in the heart) around the world.
