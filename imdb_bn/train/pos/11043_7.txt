Most of Malfik's visitors begin to finish their intense atmosphere. Almost the whole film is moving around 4 characters in a prison cell, among which transvestite Marcus and his minor disabled boys have become strangely. Soon a prisoner has found a diary of a previous prisoner who is related to the fear of escaping from the cell and the fear of dark magic themes. From here, the book opens its secret and brings its spellings out of prison. It happens in unknown light when there are some accidents on the way out of the cell. <br /> <br /> I think the story is rather poor and the final bend is beautiful but the end is tied to me all together. However, I was thrilled till the last moment because the film's atmosphere is unique with the lowest setting and cast. Killings are raw and weird ... it does not take the poor to freeze your spine and do secret things very well and remind me of Hellraiser's hell themes. Malfic has a chromatophobic and cold dirty feeling of color in green. Occasionally you are surprised that if the real or secret world is described here ... when the disabled boy loses his fingers and Marcus sleeps on the breast, it seems normal, so how can unknown gates be strange to freedom? With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and cools the viewer much differently than the audience's shocks. I'm just willing to lead the story to be more consistent. A number of elements, including the camera, are obscured with other prisoners, and finally the toy doll is not tight in the story. However, I will keep my eyes open for director Walther's other films, though it's a cyclone that he's doing a "one miss miss" Hollywood remake, which has been mink-edited and vain.
