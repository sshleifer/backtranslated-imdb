This image stands on the head and shoulders above the huge number of romantic comedy films. This is virtually flawless! Writing, acting, production design, humor and stones are all wonderful! Even music from Dean Martin to La Bohem - even impressive and delightful! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Each character plays a very helpful role from Lead operated by Cher and Nicholas Cage - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardania, John Mahoney, Danny Iselo - even with his dog pack Grandfather Each of these actors, as the Director of Norman Norman Jewelison, performed this ensemble on their usual quality. In most cases, most of the actors, it was the first major exposure in the film, so casting is exceptional - and we have many acting pavehouses whose careers have been changed by their performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has been seen through a number of times - which can sometimes separate the effect of a movie in most cases. Not saying anything else, I realized a few years ago that whenever I used to walk in my footsteps on this film scene - a scene - the scene was beautiful and beautifully made. There are so many stunning and memorable scenes in the original meeting between Char and Nicholas Cage, where Cage tells the story of his sadness; Vincent Gardania discovered with her paramount in Opera, in the glory produced by her gold plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis blames John Mahny for his classmates on classic lines about Liaison with his colleagues: "Do not eat where you do not!"; Danny Aylow's bed to her dead mother; Nicholas Cage "Accepted" the Pirate as an Aria's Rapture in the Background! <br /> <br /> Of course there are many romantic comedy, among them Sabrina (both editions, but especially Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden's original); When Harry met Sally; Apartment <br /> <br /> someone is equal to the moon!
