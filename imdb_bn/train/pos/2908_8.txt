Journey to the discovery, this film follows the life of a living in a sleepy island town in British Columbia. Released and visionary, residents are pleased to allow young people to go around fresh faces to teachers, new ideas come and bring their life from the mainland. Gradually, their liberal state is awake, parents (and local school principal) for tension, mother for stability, the oldest daughter for love and the smallest for power. While the movie is incredible or broken, the film is quietly enjoyable and good for the tired night while the air is swollen. Unfortunately, I suspect anyone outside of Canada will find it easily accessible.
