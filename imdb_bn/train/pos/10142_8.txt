Maybe it is because of the fear of hospital and medical fears, but this is down to my skin (penal apologies). These pieces are brave, afraid to go up over and get as satisfied as they come in terms of revenge cinema. I just did not feel the hatred for the screws and did not feel much sympathy for "skin", I feel myself and feel the feeling of certain abominable abominations which are really rare and delightful things for the awful awful audience. Yourself Some parts are very memorable of "Hellraiser", but imitation is as close as respect. This is a heavy tool that does not offer enough consideration to the viewer, but I enjoy being attacked once and a while by a movie. This piece brings it and does not apologize. I liked this one a lot. Do not watch while eating pudding.
