Undoubtedly the highlight of this movie is Peter O'Woole's performance. Surprising funny funny and horrific horror. Does anyone do it better than O'Toole? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film mainly moves around the spectacular performance of Peter O'Toole, and I'm sure I would not have enjoyed half of it if I had not been there.
