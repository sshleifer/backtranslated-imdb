I saw the story of the film in TCM and let's just run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I'm pleasantly surprised to see that I really liked the movie and it seems quite exceptional. Of course, it is seriously dated, but as a period of about 40 years ago, the insights of life and lifestyle insights are worth watching only for fine subtle. The only problem now is trying to find the DVD, so I can often see it. I've also taken a lot of attention with Smith and Ustinov for leadership and the presence of Carl Lowen, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley and Caesar Romero.
