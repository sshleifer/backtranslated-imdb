From the top shelf of the great classic book, this wonderful story comes from Pearl Buck's writing. The movie is called "The Good Earth", like the movie. It is a common Chinese farmer of Wang Fuong (Paul Muni) who started his day with the 'Great House' tour, where he took a slave named O'Leane (Luis Rena) and made him his wife. From the very beginning, he consolidates a small pitch seed and begins to adapt to his generosity by planting it near his new home. In the following years, O'Neane proved her worth steadfastly by sharing her husband's troubles, troubles and fate. In the coming years, they raise a family and both feast and famine see their easy family climate. In fact, it is at the lowest point in their life, each of which invests the value of companionship, loyalty and love. Along with changing times, their growing family is threatened with both partners and friends and relatives, such as their uncle (Walter Connolly), who is a harmful and charity, but sympathetically tolerated. Wang has advised his 'Old Father' (Charlie Grapeine) and reminded of life's fragile and harmful nature. Two prominent performers in this movie, Kei Luc, who played Wang's Elder Son and Philip Onk, played a nationalist soldier. This image is black and white and is adapted from the novel unusually. Very recommend for all the audience. ****
