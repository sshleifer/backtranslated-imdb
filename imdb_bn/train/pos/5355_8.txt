Running Man shines the modern American media complex and its goal is to hit the center of death. This can be a simple goal, but they can drag less of each other. The RMM wrestler (featuring some of the Pro Wrestlers as Hunter), Network Television, Nielsen Ratings, the American government (whatever its entertainment-based direction), crime and punishment, and half-a-dozen other paths are on the way. It is a lot of crying from the original Stephen King novels, and Arnold is not the novel Ben Richards. But who? It is essentially an Arnie Flick, all good dancer action sequences and one-liners such as a undertaking.
