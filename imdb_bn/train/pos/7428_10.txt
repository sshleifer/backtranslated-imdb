I swear I saw the first scene of this movie, I opened my eyes! Star S. Bonner is a film that lets you know how love really loves, despite facing John Norman (Chris Christopherson) and Esther (Straussand). Do you also have the experience of losing love at the end of the movie? Streisand and Kristofferson together have such great chemistry and the music is fantastic! Streisand you look once more / now watch closely with songs, it's just pure magic! This movie has created a song of my favorite song, and Queen B is such a funny song. Also I like the fashion of '70 (except for Straussand's Afro.) She is a beauty. The birth of a star is my number one favorite movie. This is a pleasure to see and break a heart at the end of the movie.
