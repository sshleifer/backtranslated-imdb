Although I do not agree with the decision to leave Babi and Tammy's baby Jesse, and this is something I never wanted to do, trying to do what was good for the child. As it is written, ask yourself what is going on in your own story and asking yourself about all your questions. Patty Duck? Opposition? Almost unknown, as far as I'm concerned. But during the filming, he really believes you that he has psychological, or at least, some serious mistakes with him. His character "mentally disturbed." The movie looks like a quick end, things are somewhat unpredictable. But other than that, this movie is really great. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you just jog around and calm down and see something nice that wants to laugh at you. But when you want to challenge your beliefs, look at things from others' point of view and discover something about yourself, this is a good film. Warning: You can even grow while watching this movie! And to that end, it's worth all.
