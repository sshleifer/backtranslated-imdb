What does this movie version of "The Gahst Train" do not like, is that the question is based on one thing and one thing: your response to Arthur Askey's performance. <br /> <br /> He has almost every stolen scene in the scene, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you wish that he will be temporarily stopped for plots or some characters to be able to feature and develop (which they can do) in some way. But in any way everything points to Askey's Tommy Gander character. <br /> <br /> I personally like this picture, even as much as Askey I do not think I can always sleep and I can not find the power to see something else. It seems to be plunking at VCR in those weird hours of the morning. Before looking at the old B / W movies in the darkness of the dark which I think is interesting ....
