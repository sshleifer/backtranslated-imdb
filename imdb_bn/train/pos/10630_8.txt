I think the main comments in this movie are unfortunate in the words "weak and insulting obscurity". I think it's a very interesting movie and nice entertainment. One should suspend the mistrust that a gay man and a lesbian woman may fall in love, have a child and later live happily. But it is always wonderful to watch it in a movie and warm his heart. Is it impossible? There are many more unlikely events described in other movies. Nice acting, script funny The only negative comment is that the story can end when the family moves away from its primary house to discover whether the family maintains the remaining residuals of homosexuality.
