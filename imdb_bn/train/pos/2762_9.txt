This photo is near my favorite piece of celluloid. I do not want here to really say a lot here. Except "Watch this movie" and "Enjoy the fantastic work of Daniel and Pascal", who carries you through this handsome, funny and heartwarming story about your 'eighth day' - your own day! <br /> <br /> Seeing this picture, I am worried about how much I spend on my eighth day = how much I spend! It seems like we are wasting precious time in doing something that we think. It's a career fun or just eat TV shows and ballgames. Satisfaction is something we are doing for another person - we make a difference. Spontaneous and about taking time and time to live - now! (On the eighth day) ... at least that I got from 'eighth day'.
