The terrorist tries to steal a top secret biological weapon, and while trying to escape, when the case involving fatal agents is compromised when he is infected. The soldiers were able to recover this case, but the terrorists came out of the hotel where they tried to hide. They finally create what they have hidden and "clean" the hotel and its residents. Unfortunately, they see the resurrection of the body, resolves its body, and if you have seen the living dead return, you know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Although it is a fair evaluation, it is not without high points. Somehow, there is a large amount of bloody death that keeps happiness in the body of Gore. There is an abundance of zombies that seem to come from potentially everywhere. They want to hide the water, the roof of the house, hidden in the tree, and for some reason, they want to hide behind a bunch of dead brushes, only the hicocos may sit to attack to try to escape. There is even a flying junk head hidden inside a fridge. To believe it, you have to see it, that scene only requires zoom 3 to see IMO. It may have some terrible editing and some very suspicious acting, especially from a doctor who I saw may be one of the worst actors, but J Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. Sometimes it is better to sit back and watch a movie that does not need more than your time and an open mind. Zombi 3 fits that bill, and then something. If you pop up a few beers, it is more enjoyable and watch it with friends of some kind. I give it an 8/10, just free joy.
