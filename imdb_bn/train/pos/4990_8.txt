Other critics have mentioned, this is an unjustly deprecated Depression-era film. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Joe Swerling (hello to towers, western, lifeboat, etc.), it is a solid psychological, well-structured and -realized step about a New York City's Denizens of Shantytown. They obliged in gratitude, beggars, and prostitution of women, but they are both good and bad both with the allegiance as complex as a community of communities. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the contrast between the many characteristic attributes of this movie is the character of Spencer Tracy, Bill, and Lorena Young's Tina. He is solidly spoken, physically aggressive, and obviously fearless - but Bill is not a character that makes this film a strong sense of his survival. When he blusters, Trina is actually hanging hard (if the term ladylike can be applied to a character). His devotion towards him is obvious, and complete. When she becomes pregnant, she says, if she wants to leave, she will increase herself, or "If you are just happy, I'll leave the child." The performance of Lorete Young (at the age of 20), such a dignified character, that she does not feel weak or dependent, rather a woman who recognizes happiness by finding it and does not want much more than that.
