How does a normal day of Win Wisconsin begin ... <br /> <br /> At first, the tyrannical father of a WWII senior, sitting on the kitchen table and reading his newspaper, his overjoyed wife did it work in the breakfast. Then their skinny son Eric arrives, he sits beside the table, and his father begins to scream his daily, usually keeping his feet behind Eric (if he inserts here). When his wonderful angel was in front of the sister Lori, she came along, then shouted loudly and shouted to him, went out of the Eric family. <br /> <br /> Once this daily (painful) event is over, Eric has entered its basement where all his friends are already hanging. And when we go to see them, it becomes clear that Eric and his redhead Tomboy girlfriend, neighboring neighbors and childhood friend Donna Pincitti is very affectionate. Show Steven Heide, the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and does not often anticipate that it is not funny to see; Michael Kelso, this kind of person who thinks he will live only on his face and that cow's tree will grow; Jackie Burkhard, who thinks herself as the most beautiful girl, rich children rich children, and, of course, cheerleaders; And Fez, a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and can not be kept secret. First they just have fun with Kells, quietly and fun, but then they all sit in a circle and start the real fun ... before they do something sorry. <br /> <br /> Red goes out and meet Dawn's strange parents, Bob and Midge. He is rude, but they do not feel, he thinks he is kidding. Leo is somewhere around, an old adult hippie, who has constantly been distracted and even made eye-plays without taking notice. <br /> <br /> Are you thinking about the seemingly peaceful surroundings with these amazing characters? Of course, most seem to be "clichéd", but the show takes a new level of cliché. Now one of the most wicked story lines can offer a sitcom, can sit and enjoy one of the best TV shows ever. Which is sometimes not the same thing and what it does, which compares to most of the seamkams that are "cute fun", completely violent. If you get hooked, this show does not let you go. Hook and bounce over and over, people, you will see the sitcom genre from a whole new potential.
