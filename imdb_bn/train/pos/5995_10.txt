Although it is not sure whether it is right or wrong, I read through a comment before looking briefly. I should say that I do not agree with most negative comments or problems with people. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I read from the first timer, I appreciate the effort. That respect is respected! There were some comments about the song. I thought it was pretty cool for the piece. It was a little drone for something to say, but I have to know that the excitement created apart from us (ours), and when he started out of the gun and started for the fierce fork, we knew it as a train train, but realized that it is going on now. Yes there is 180 degrees slip / clip, but the shay * happens. Has anyone else seen that Hughes's dirty shirt turns white (in the end, in the rain) in "Australia"? I see how much money and people behind that movie! Holidays for God's sake! All I think is all very well done. I'll mention only two significant issues which are not significant - do not walk towards the frame with a shiny brass film and I would still show the splator to show the shot in the starting shots, so people do not know what it is. <br /> <br /> My experience has taught me so much that it is not difficult to create a movie, it takes time to learn how to do it, then actually it's time to do it, and then you can call it "post-production time" before calling Of course, all the details needed for the shot should take a little more time. IMHO, it looks like director / author Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this is indeed his first report card, then I'll give him "A". The principal office you report for a guard left.
