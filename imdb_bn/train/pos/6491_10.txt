World in War is probably the greatest documentary series ever. Historical research is virtually flawless. Even after the fourth quarter it is the most accurate and sure documentary about WW2. An invaluable historical work that includes interviews with the most important and interesting images of the war. I highly recommend it as a learning experience.
