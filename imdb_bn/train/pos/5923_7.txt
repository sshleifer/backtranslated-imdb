A woman who hates cats (Alice Cr√®ge) and her son (Brian Cruise) have come to a small town, and have to deal with an average teacher (Glen Shadix), their cruel relationships, a beautiful girl (Mudchen Amic) and one hell A big secret. <br /> <br /> Okay, so technically, this is a "bad movie". But who? It's so fun! <br /> <br /> Impossible things (involving chickens) happen, people are inside the cat cats, there are bad one-fishing equipment, there are too many cheese to handle <br /> <br /> so yes . You will enjoy this. Many It can not remove you, will not touch you, do not fear you, or thrill you in any way, but it will keep you entertained and laughing!
