At the beginning of the '90's, I saw this movie again at the beginning of the first film release. The room with a view was also out of the newborn. The tempting April offer was much more! I found it more real and ground, more credible for the letters 'normal'. At the end of the film I felt the same as myself when I saw Pride and Prussody's BBC production, I was shouting to find out what they were looking for in letters, peace, freedom or love. You've realized throughout life that Italy has moved away from what they already know, that they are frustrating because of the frustrating and disadvantage to take risks and behind them. But in the spring of April, everyone's life decreases and arises (in line with the Victorian rhythm) and is rebuilt for a gradual satisfaction. A film is a little gem! How is it better known?
