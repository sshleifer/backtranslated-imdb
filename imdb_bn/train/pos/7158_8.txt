Holls (2003, Dar Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When he was wrongly accused of stealing Stanley Yellnats IV, he was sent 'Camp Green Lake'. In this camp, Warden and his two Henman, Sir and Dr. Pendensky gave the command to Shibir activists to dig a hole after the hole. But for some reason? Stanley plans to find out. <br /> <br /> I have never had any intention of seeing 'Holas', and I must admit that I only saw the film because I am the fan of Shia Labov, but even if you are not a fan of it, Does not matter. 'Holes' is one of the Disney movies that the whole family can enjoy. The story includes a wonderful idea, including beautiful writing and past flashbacks. This does not confuse and really gives a great back story. All Cast is great. The young star works well and is a joy to link to John Voight and Sigarie Weaver. Shia La Bauf shows that even at the age of 17, she can work without any flaw. This is a Disney film, you certainly will enjoy as a family. <br /> <br /> "I learn from failure." - Stanley Yelts III (Henry Winkler)
