Passport to Pimiliko is a practical behavior for all fans of British film. It's not just an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy, but it's a movie flashback in the past era, which, with views and situations, sadly only with a memorial in the British life. <br /> <br /> Playing Stanley Hollo Pimlicko, Arthur Pemberton, after the incursion of an unmanned bomb attack, who discovered the medieval wealth of the Duke of Bergen in 14th century, which has been deeply buried in his little suburbs for the last 600 years. <br /> <br /> The Treasure is an ancient legal decree which was signed by King Edward IV of England (which was not officially canceled officially), that this special London street has been declared as Barbadian soil, which means that in terms of international law, Pemberton and others The local residents and the British are no longer there, but Burundi and its small streets make it a unique street Dhikara and a law for himself. <br /> <br /> It determines war criminals and poor ropes. They believe themselves outside the English law and the judiciary, so they burn their ration books in protest of drunkards, destroying their clothing coupons and ignoring them, ignoring British license laws and declaring them completely independently. Britain <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, half of London's consumers followed them by stealing ration, their quiet happy little shelter , A cave of thieves and more crowds. <br /> <br /> <br /> Because of its development it is "now a matter of foreign policy, which is reluctant to engage in his greatness", which is high on residents Leave dry. However, they declare the area as legal borders and set up fully equipped customs offices at the end of the road, primarily for the smuggling of smugglers for the safety of Pimilino residents. <br /> <br /> The border starts completely a large blockade, which causes the Bugundian residents to gradually move out of water and food, but without fighting less in the actual British style. A Bugundian resident quotes, "We were English and we were always in English, and it was in English because we are fighting so hard to be from Bugundian" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the rest of London can learn from the poor Bagdians, they are all forced to chip and are forced to help them by supplying food to barbaric cable blockades. <br /> <br /> Attackers who have fought Whitehall, can finally bring the foreigners to the knee through this new batch, especially these English! <br /> <br /> Great story, and fun all over. Can not be missed.
