I got this movie from a cousin in Norway and it had to be converted from Norwegian to American format with a copy video. Comparison of this movie (1948) with Heroes of Telemark (1965), Kamen Om Tungtwentat (Heavy Water's Struggle) played his role, carried Sabotorers themselves, although actors were played to play the role of co-operatives, after Norway's independence in the campaign Struggle given their lives. The plot is in four languages: Norwegian French, German and English (complete with Norwegian subtitles). <br /> <br /> During this period of history, the reason for the struggle was impressive. The frame scientists were interested in receiving about two hundred kilograms of heavy water from Wormer's nurse hydro to return to France for research on its effectiveness. At the same time, the Nazis were also interested in getting heavy water to build a secret weapon. The French were worried that the Nazis could advance early to attack the Nazis, and through secret codes, their people warned Nazi spy during the Oslo tour, where he got heavy water and returned it without interruption. He watched two spies as an aviator, but they did not look forward to the other where he crossed the Termac at another plane where his cargo was waiting for him. This clever trick works by using an airport which the Nazis later landed in Hamburg. However, on 9 April, 1940 the invasion of Norway, the Nazis adopted Norsk Hydro and it was near the Norwegian Underground and the British intelligence agency in London. 11 young people of Prof. Late Trendsman serve Norway; "Salo" and "Goodside" groups who will successfully damage Warmer's heavy water production. After leaving Nazi Hydro for the supply of heavy water to Berlin's rail cars, the details of how the fleet operated with the sinking of the ferrybank was detailed. <br /> <br /> The film was fair, but the film was fair. I recommend this picture to anyone interested in World War II history.
