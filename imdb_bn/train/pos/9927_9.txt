Domino is a great movie. This is the name of a young woman named Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley) who became a monster because of her frustration with her lifestyle. He joined with two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez) and started the event. The script is good. Realistic with very low earth and film voice. My only problem with this movie is that it focuses on different things rather than the characters of Domino. <br /> <br /> Even with Kaye Nightly, it gives serious performance. He shows the right amount of anger and sacrifices in this performance. Mickey Roberts followed her Oscar-worthy performance with another tough guy's performance at 'Sina City'. Edgar Ramirez does not do anything while speaking a few words in Spanish and looks at the key. Delroy Lindoi gives a good support performance. Mooney is one of himself, although he surprised me in a special scene. Lysie Liu has a great chemistry with her Kaira Knitlia. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the direction. Tony Scott's high-speed style really brings the film. Cinematography is the best, I've ever seen It takes a regular movie and keeps the acids. All black is black, pink is bright, and it has a green glove. The action scenes are pleasing. <br /> <br /> Overall: If you like Sina City and Man on Fire, you'll love Domino.
