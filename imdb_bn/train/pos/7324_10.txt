My personal favorite is the horror film. From the ultimate first story trail to the final story bend, it's the best composition of the carpenter. <br /> <br /> Halloween Night 1963, the little Michael girl killed her elder sister. All-Holmes-1978, Michael Smith's Grove escaped from sanitarium. On Halloween night, Michael again came to the house of the murderer. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, Michael stalks and kills the kids. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It's a terrible terrible environment that creates a toner ton. Like a horror movie, the events are telegraphed long ago, but they still seem to be random, they do not allow viewers to guess the second picture. <br /> <br /> The dark light, long-lasting-com shots, and (most importantly) that weird music music does not yet produce most clustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes. There are numbers in the body, but after it slew slashers it is fairly small. That and most of the murders are almost bloodless. Fear is not in death, but without knowing <br /> <br /> Performing round is good. PJ Souls gives limited humor to most of the movies (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Lumis gives a decent performance and then the young (at the time) are Jamie Leigh-Curtis. His first performance seems shy and uncomfortable, but you quickly realize that it is suitable for the character, who is shy and loyal to himself and not ready to face it. And certainly determined Donald Pleasence (possibly little unstable) as Dr. Sam Loomis has. Peace rest Pleasence <br /> <br /> If the film has a harmful error, it will be time passage. Many years ago, after the release of this movie, almost all of the best bits of movies came to pass during the countless clones, copies, rip offs, and immetrices and were stolen (usually poorly) until almost everything was known about it. One with the change for audience expectations and hunger, one raw power finds a lot of thin film. To express genuinely gratitude at this day and age, it should be viewed as something unique at once. <br /> <br /> Never less, I do not have any good reservations that recommend this movie to look good, scary time. Highest honor <br /> <br /> 10/10
