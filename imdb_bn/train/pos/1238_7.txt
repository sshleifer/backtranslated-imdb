Although this movie has many errors, it's actually a funny movie of '80. Eddie Murphy peaks during his 80's movie here. His character is different from previous films, though his time is almost perfect with partners and foils. <br /> <br /> It is associated with the charming beauty of Charlotte Lewis, it creates a fun rainy action-comedy flick. <br /> <br />
