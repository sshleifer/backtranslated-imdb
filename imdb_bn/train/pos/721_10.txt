Rock N Roll High School has a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the Ramones. I was very young at the middle of the 70th day of the band, although I was very much aware, although I had that old cousin, who was a great fan at that time. I finally saw RNRS in the late 80's on television in the late 80's, and laughing all over with it. (Does it not make children dream of dreaming in high school and it blurts, sets everyone on rockin soundtracks?) I recorded the next air of the film after a year or two and saw the order of the Ramones concert and think again, "Man, these guys donate Kicking! Some of them must be checked in the album! " The rest is history. In the twentieth century, Ramones LP / cassette / CD and three ramonos later show that they are still one of my favorite bands and RNHHS whenever I see it crack me down. Now Joey, D.D. and Johnny have given up all of us (RIIP) at least we have to remember this film and lots of songs.
