This strangeity of Roman Polanski clearly shows that he was introduced when he created it. Polanski played himself a funman who rented the Paris apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He discovered that he was scared by discovering how he led, which he was dragging and published as a means of reconsaking. The film is uncomfortable at one point, and Polanski preserves its environment in a terrific panic environment, but it goes far more often as a repetition of "Rosemary Baby" and "Rippleson", the better two Polanski films that are related to the stupid Moody's apartment. <br /> <br /> But for the sake of the campaign ... As long as I'm reading a lot more in the film, I must believe that the reaction of this polonic reaction was his reaction. Being a sexually deformed label and exiled to America. It does not judge him in one way or another, but it is difficult to prove his evidence in the film. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
