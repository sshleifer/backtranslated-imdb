Well, I've come from Bulgaria where there is a tornado almost impossible but my imagination tells me "very, very awesome"! !!! This guy (Devon Sawaa) did a great job with this movie! He knew exactly how old he was but he did not work as a child (he got better)! Now about tornado - it was not very realistic but is scared! If you want to get a nice time in front of the telephone - this movie!
