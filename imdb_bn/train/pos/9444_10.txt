*** SPEAKER *** *** SPOKHILLER *** PACKED WITH REASONABLE MOMENTS (such as the above quote, immersed by the Primus), the distributors tell the story of four people who go to wild jungle to go to white water rafts and only a big Find out that their fun is only to get away from a big city. This is not a Hollywood movie. There is virtually no special effect, setting is extremely realistic, and everything is made of sugary or beautiful. The city is like boys in city boys, and even the tough guy Louis, which is illustrated by Boo Reynolds, obviously the mercy of the flood on this trip. This is a key-if the perfect example of the film. If some friends used to rafting river in a wood field that nobody was known by them and tried to stop being convicted of the killers, would they be forced to save their own lives? <Br /> <br /> A very powerful element in the film that relates to social and class structure and relationships (or lack thereof) among rural and urban people. When four people reach the forest in the early part of the movie, they do not know how to communicate with people living there and they talk to them, as they do not understand or not sure if they can communicate. These communication blocks are most notably portrayed in the dueling banjo scene, they are trying to gas the car and the truck, and for them, drivers can get someone to drive. Although probably exposed in Drury and Porsche, and perhaps the mentally ill boy, he is hesitant about guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), but Louise has difficulty in buying gas, and Bobby comments on genetic deficit and how graceful it is. When the boy escaped from the druce, Bobby told him to hold his hand after his jamful jam session, that he would have to pay a little bit to the child, knowing that none of them could react. <br /> <br /> This is something we see in distribution which sets many tones that follow. This great scene where there was so much fun (Wondrous Brothers, Redneck Dancer 'Head Brother, Where Art Are You?) With the scene is amazing about what to do around each other. These people are apple and orange, and they live by completely different rules of life. Lewis, Bobby, Drew, and Ed people in the mountains have separated from modern society and modern laws and live according to the rules of nature, in which you will not be killed. Confused by their illogical behavior, four friends come out of the river, hope to end the odds and start the adventure. <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever they are separated from each other and move to the hillside along the Ed and Bobby rivers, which quickly become unpleasant, uncertainty about the way people live in - which was established on the scene - the scene Time comes to the game to create the most excitement. I think a good sign of a good quality thriller is that the film's tragic elements, such as attacks and actual murder, take very little amount of time on screen, but most of the film's memorable parts are there. There is no vulnerable violence here, it's for a clear purpose and it has a surprisingly strong effect. <br /> <br /> This step is a violent clash between two very different people, and when they happen to be unknowingly find themselves fighting with each other. After the attack, the rest of the river is the movie that takes most of the time, it creates some of the most effective pressures and puts it on the edge of your seat when you do not bombard with many incidents that are being destroyed. This is strange, when we know that Ed probably killed the wrong guy on the mountain, and the excitement in this film does not leave until the three living members of the party reach the bottom of the river because they did not know what happened in the river and why the deputy's father-in-law was absent Provide a suspicious explanation to the police. <br /> <br /> This is a very annoying movie, which is a rule of success, because it is quite clear that it is meant to reduce a movie like a small amount of people. The mountain bells are more humane (more realistic) versions, but similar to similar ones, in Gatere Bat and Gator Bat 2, which can be compared to a cruel film like Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their wild weekends on weekends, the natural element is so real and we know that men are so good and so subtle way that it is like us, as the listener, actually the fifth member of the team. It's often not that a film can come across.
