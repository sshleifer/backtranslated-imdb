For many years, one of my favorite films was "Last Action Hero"; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarzenegger has decided to waste my fun by becoming a corrupt Scagge politician; So now I will not be able to put any picture in the picture. <br /> <br /> Jack Speed ​​Adventure is really the end of the game with some themes ... Hero; So I was happy to find it on DVD, so I can see these themes play so well. <br /> <br /> Despite the "Plot-in-the-Plot" involving white slavery during the African nation's civil war, it is not an action movie. The plot in "Plot-in-a-Plot" is really a question that has no purpose to solve the film: Jack Speed ​​is a real person who is helping heroin protect his sister from white-maid businessman; Or is he actually a mythical character (which means that the heroine entered the universe in any way that is actually contained in a series of decorations novels)? I suggest that this film is definitely not defined, and that Wayne Crowford and Andrew Lane are quite aware of this. Thus, such a fantastic "adventurous story" of movie viewers could be a presentation rather than a universe. This is actually a rich theme, whose potential balance is lightening by the film's tragic and campi intelligentsia. The film's vulnerabilities - initially it's cinematography, the film is a TV show. <br/> <br /> But I really like this character, and I enjoy the adventure I do, though stupid. And I just made this idea interesting in the novel. <br /> <br /> Standing under multiple views - good show!
