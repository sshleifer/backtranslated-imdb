First of all I want to say this great. It's wonderful and sometimes pushed. And at least I say 11 years old and it's my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring film, but this is something boring though. It's like a trip through humanity. His harsh realism shows through this memorial masterpiece. It is a heart-wrenching story of two down and outerts (Voet and Hoffman) to build an intermediate friendship. Joe Buck (Volo) arrives in New York to make a clever Texan stud women rich by recreational. Soon he met Rico 'Roto Rijo (HOFFMAN), who was able to hire a poor person only. Ratso became Joe's 'manager' but soon both men Joe stole a job that could not find work. After trying to survive on the streets of New York, we can understand how difficult it is. They can not get Joe a girl until they meet a girl with a woman. Joe makes some money and soon Joe meets Ratso's dream spot, takes Ratso on Florida. The final five minutes of heart breaking down, but one of the biggest moments of the film. From Midnight COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes annoying urban view on life.
