I saw it in movies with my girlfriend at that time and I can say that I did not have the best time because I did not know about Nadelli or his story. <br /> <br /> A biology, it is important to know what to expect at least from the character. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the programs have been told, whether it is true or if everything is imagined. But Andy Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a warrior really wants me to believe everything. I do not think he is portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief, but it's my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult Western-type movie for everyone's taste. Heath Laser is always a great and sexy Naomi Watts screen practiced. <br /> <br /> If this movie goes on the wire, then this is a chance. Otherwise, I do not think I could recommend it.
