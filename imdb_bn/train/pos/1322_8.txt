What an impressive film Even if it was not based on real life, Forbidden Lease was an interesting portrait of a con artist in its material. And such a film psychologist can study students to learn about compulsory liars. <br /> <br /> The media for Forbidden Love Writer was published as a fraud in the media, but this step actually gives him enough chance to delete his name. <br /> <br /> Twist and movies make the documentary maker wonderful. What a patient woman! I like this movie. I did not read the book but only heard good reviews and went to see it in the rainy rainy afternoon. The journey this film takes you is cute, interesting and completely engrossing.
