I was always interested in watching movies in Hong Kong, but they all failed to fulfill my expectations ... so far! Most H.K. in Birding paradigm There is no comedy of the film, and the second-rate story line is not dragged into the film. The story is not complicated, but there are some scenes that can fill only some "intelligent" space (only the genuine intelligent martial arts film that I saw is Crunching Tega, but because of Hollywood involvement it is not a true HK movie for me). This movie contains some incredible battle scenes that are the first of the first major scenes (which I have seen sometimes, still so small). But in the mind, there are many streams of blood (people cut half, decapitated, etc.). The production is very good and special effects show that the author's imagination can be fulfilled, although some shots must be quite technical (notices: the paper roof that he threw and pins on a wall!). Yes, it's Suye Herak or John Woo that made my favorite Hong Kong film, it's Rango Lam! And I'm sure that hell is going to check out more of this director! Ace
