Before I comment on this movie, you realize that I have seen this movie, I usually expected shit, horror, B-movies and wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is not the only one, but what I've actually seen in a long time is one. Scott McDonald is like a Jack Frost, but I think that if he ever gives a chance, then there is the future of psychopaths in the big movie. McDonald was a serial killer who became a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements. As soon as that snowman began to move around humans and kill, though, you will not be difficult to smile. It is said that the line is completely upset but really funny. The rest of this photo joins the film completely, but it is stupid. Visible scene with snowball girl girl is really a B-movie, really classic in the horror film fashion. I really hope to have a single pic and I'll be there to watch it on any cable channel. Of course it's fun to watch the first few times and it's not really a good job of motion picture technology, but I just want to see the snowflakes to kill people. I give it a 10 out of 7, this is a great movie for late hours and couples.
