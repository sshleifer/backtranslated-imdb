I did not want to see this movie even after reading the reviews of Maltin and 1 1/2 star rating. I found it on the advice of my son and it was even better than I expected. I would give 2 1/2 stars out of a 4 star system. Once you understand it all there are multiple movie viewing. You do not know much about religion, you will miss a lot. I graduated from Human School since the years of making the film, so maybe I could be better connected to it. Yes, there are some protests in the film and it is a bit weird, but what do you expect in the 70's? I can see why people do not like movies; However, I do not understand people saying it is annoying. The movie is anything but annoying. You will hate it or love it. If you find it annoying, you probably are dead in the brain.
