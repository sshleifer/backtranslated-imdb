Well, is Morgan Freeman more unusual than God than George Burns? This picture was definitely better than that bore, "Oh, God". I was completely engrossed and all the way through the LMAO. Carey Anchorarm was perfect as Wangbie, and Aniston carries her portions as her usual good performance performance disappointing girlfriend. I, for one, do not consider him to be ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when the Kerry file was open in the cabinet, it seems that it can not hold its life history. See if you can spot the file in a cabinet that contains events in his bathroom humor: I was rolling over it. Well written and well played out, this comedy will go down as the best of these fun people.
