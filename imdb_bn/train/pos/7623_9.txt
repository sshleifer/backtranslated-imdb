Although I'm not reluctant to jump in the bandwagon to see "lost", I accidentally hit one episode in the beginning of the season in a season ?? Is it one with pole-beer ?? And there was my constant attention from it. Show, that Smoker beer So bear with me (hey) when I appreciate the anger, half-greetings, I can do as much as I can. <br /> <br /> "Lost" is a simple concept of a passenger flight that gives full view of the crushing people in the desert, and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premises by exploring each character deeply and unflinchingly ?? Drive them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that they are trapped on the island, working as a common fate for many things of their life, even though they have been away from some (in Soyar and Cut in others) or communicating spiritually (Lock, Claire). But "Lost" also zooms on the island itself and these mysterious awesome zooms ... and they all seem to be weirdly connected. <br /> <br /> While television actors have their absolute or flashing acting ability, most of the "Lost" appear to be the true, spectacular actor and heart and humor in their performances. There are plenty in Ikandi, but like most TV shows, plastic is not like Hollywood. All of the characters seem very real and they are extremely compulsory to see. Their interaction is rarely expected to be happiness, small arguments or cherry melodrama (although they are annoying secret) ?? These people are trying to survive the first and foremost and whatever action is displayed in the relationship is done in the secondary treatment. The reality of these characters is to facilitate an already well-scaled plot. <br /> <br /> Think about this plot ... as a tree template plot, then the branches as a subset (in this case, a branch for each character) ?? Well, adding twigs of each branch to the lost and then adding those twigs miniature twigs as other story lines. If you are the brother / sister of one of the main characters of Flashback, you can get your own story. If you are a DOG you will have your own story. The authors eventually did not manage to wear them together in some glorious end, they set themselves. I'm more worried than a little worried, this show will have some frustrating cop-out, because I'm sure most people are there. <br /> <br /> But the authors ask to drag it, "Lost" is probably the best program to hit television. <br /> <br /> 9/10
