This movie begins as generation conflict, end of understanding, seriousness and grace. This film enters more than 3,000 miles of cars with the parents and younger son through Europe. Cramping forces conflict of lifestyle, belief and life skills collide. There really is no clear winner. At the end of all the experience, it adds more than one level of life experience. For those interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a liberal and gentle view, it is not firm about the agenda. It is exposed to the advent of a little boy, his boyfriend, and rebellious nature to get more ways of life.
