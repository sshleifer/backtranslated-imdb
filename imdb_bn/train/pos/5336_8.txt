I really like this movie because in Australia, such Chinese films are not seen during prime time. I must say that this is one of the greatest serious films of all time, which outlines the difference between the people of Hong Kong and China's mainland. It really shows that there are discomfort between the two, but it can be just as good as learning the Mandarin such as Mandarin. It also showed me how China's Indie Rock scene is present in the mainland, and Chinese people know how to bind guitar and make the house fun! Does anyone say China is ready for rock music? Daniel U with his absolutely fantastic and shiny voice, honest acting, and total chick magnet. I recommend this movie that cleanses the Asian people from the common Western Stereotypes and who like Chinese / Asian movies like me. Look at it!
