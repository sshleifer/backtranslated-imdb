Caesar Montano to revive the Sijuano movie! Pangohi Sub Subhash is very good - it is drama, action, romance, and scenes that will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Although the story is not original (a love triangle - or create love on a four corners, Japanese occupation, rebellion, as the lord of America), its presentation is somewhat cool, especially its main language - for Filipino, Nigango for Japan and English for English in America. <br /> <br /> This movie will go as one of the best Pinoy movies this year. <br /> <br /> Check out this!
