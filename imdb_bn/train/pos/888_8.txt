One of the best Kung Fu movies, but I hope to give a shameless review to not be neutral. The movie starts well enough, jokes are visible that they translate language barriers (which are more rare than this era) and make sequences of non-war conversation passable (for a Kung Fu movie, this is a great commemoration). Like other Chinese action films, which always compete in plays of time pieces (in response to Jackie Chan's Police Story 1), pedicab drivers look at our contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the next 1/3 of the movie, it is a dark melodrama tragedy that I think is unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The action is fairly good, it has dual features between samo and 1/2. Shaw Brothers' only two stars, Car-Lange Lau, and then a long man with a fight that ultimately plays Jett Lee's bad guy. There is only 20 minutes of war, which is standard, but I'm excited at the clear speed of the camera frame. I have to do half-speed film to avoid injury to each other, but have smooth editing and then this is there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, you just lose reading this 2 minutes of your life.
