A very unique open-fay animated film, and obviously I love individuality that it can be good, bad or bad in any way. This French film is quite interesting to watch, the strategy is innovative, as I have recently seen "Awaken Life". <br /> <br /> It took me a while to use it in black-white style, but finally I love it, sketchy images are really fancy! The contract future is a symbol of the human race's final destination, which I worship so much. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is good for Saif-fai, not so interesting, but well, like some Hollywood products, a monster conspiracy, a little diversion and abstract endings for the eternity of humans is not so credible, some development is very easy And unclear, and the whole movie is very long. <br /> <br /> I think I love 'I just love to show this picture, others are not so good. <br /> <br /> About the eternity of life, I think most people come to the fullest that we do not want eternity because it is destroyed, meaning of life, we make our lives richer, because they are limited and meaningful, if they live forever, thus around the world A disaster and chaos will arise. Anyone who leaves your love is hard and hearty, but it is a way of showing our life to the truth and all emotions fill their lives and make the world colorful and vivid.
