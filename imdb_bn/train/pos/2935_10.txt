Eddie Murphy Restless is by the most fun thing you will ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I will give you the guarantee that Delirious is the most fun movie! This movie is about 1hr. 45 minutes, and at that time, there was a moment where I was not laughing. After a few hours you end up laughing, replaying over the punch line over over your head. Eddie Murphy has given many interesting performances in his career (48 hours, trading places, Beverly Hills Kop, Ray, America Coming, Nutty Professor, Shake etc), but this is his most ridiculous moment. I've seen this movie many times, and it's fun every time. It does not lose its edge. From this day, every great stand-up performance will be emulated from the Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
