The first von Trier movie I ever saw was breaking the waves. Sure is a beautiful movie but it definitely stands in Europa shadow. Europa tells the story of a young German-American who wants to gain a German experience after World War II. He took a job that his uncle arranged him as a follower in a luxurious train. Because of his job, he traveled through almost completely destroyed Germany, meeting with the killers of traitors and looking for members of the former Nazi Party. The society is being victim of corruption. His uncle narrowed his regrets, focusing on the job of pursuing his train. The coincidentally the main character has been involved in bomb attacks and terrorism by a group called 'BayerValves' and they put pressure on them to place bombs in trains. The atmosphere is wonderful. The viewer tries to keep the audience under hypnosis and then is taken from the viewer scene trying to count to wake up in a new scene. Just think when you watched a lot !!!!!!! Europe !!
