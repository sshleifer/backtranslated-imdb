I was praised by Edward Bourantinsky for years and thanks to the Jennifer Bechwal's documentary, I was glad to see people. The terracotta beauty of ship breaking yard, Vermont's stone excavation, huge gathering center in China, old branches of Shanghai's old neighborhoods are waiting to be broken: This landscape is so well-caught by the photographer and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought of old TV documentaries in abandoned coal mines and plastic mold factories; Staff sort of I grew up. There is great value to point out how the work of Bertinisky has shifted to Asia only, it did not stop. There was a computer scrap-yard somewhere in China - a strange scene for me - there was a threatening wind for it, when the workers were very happy.
