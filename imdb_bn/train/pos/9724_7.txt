I especially love Christine Donst in Elizabeth. I guess she's kind of actress who does not work well before the camera, but just be yourself. She did that, and she looked so natural in Elizabeth City. However, in this film, he tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, so that he looked more as a quiet editor. During the other half, he completely set himself back on his daily track, and I could not tell him to be an editor in any way. Therefore, his performance does not last for this film. <br /> <br /> The whole picture is compelling and inspiring. Young character is full and reasonable However, the film tells a big and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only big fault does not show the bending point of the love story of heroes and heroine. I am totally confused if they kiss at the end of the story, because it is not clear to both.
