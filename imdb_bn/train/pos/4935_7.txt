In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and wins a poker game by winning a small criminal criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Slan). She was dumped by Blackie and her male Raymond Fitch (Zero Mustel) and Poldie (Guy Thomson), Blackie and her dead body. At the time of mourning, the member of the US public health service Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reid (Richard Wyommark) discovered that the dead person's fibers have pneumonic plugs and need to find out that there was no contact with humans in the forty-hour period to avoid a pestilence. City Mayor Suspect Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) Dr. Clint has been appointed to assist in detecting and removing infected killers of the plug. <br /> <br /> "Panic in the Streets" reveals a simple story, but it is still effective and with a great villain. The plot did not date after fifty-seven years. Jack Palenans perform a frustrating scum in his debut, and while working on camera he is still very tempting to try to escape with Zero Motel. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Panicos Nas Rouas" ("Panic in the street")
