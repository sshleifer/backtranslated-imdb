I've searched this movie over the years, apparently it is not available here, so they bought me a copy from eBay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and three of their friends are looking for a bear that apparently killed several campers. Do they discover that Vietnam Vector has gone crazy (he has killed some of them using a glove with long metal finger nail Freddy Kr√ºger)? As soon as night falls, a girl in the girls goes for a walk with her boyfriend after a brief conversation, she dies. A group of group finds its body, they all wait for the light of day for their lashes. Once the sun rises, each of them goes out of their way, but they fall prey on one another. <br /> <br /> The seven bodies are not very poor, but some good killings, especially the girls' death. The boys die in some bloodless way (flies in the car, shoots in death, knives through the head). <br /> <br /> Overall, an excellent slasher film from the end of the International Trap 80. Nothing new, just played well, fast paced and some beautiful ladies. 10 out of 10
