I've finished watching this picture and I can honestly say it's a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2. <br /> <br /> Not only did Ga bring together the list of lists (Ish) and bring them into such a glorious character, he gave a movie with a fantastically <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Review because they expected far enough. <br /> <br /> This picture is special. Now understand!
