I gathered at least two people at TCM on September 2. If you knew that Hadki had to change his name, it was a huge scandal for being associated with being associated with this movie and I added that the original publication in the United States was so much spent by the sensor that it was virtually illogical. I saw because I only saw a documentary of "bad women", actresses of the United States pre-film censorship board were set up in the '30s. They are looking at me though they have gone far beyond the most "exciting" shots in "Exsti". Actually, Haydey looked positively silly on today's standards, and it looked nice to see her first blurred beauty. It was a nice, lyricist movie that was relaxed. I liked it for what it was: an easy romance. I saw it after recording it in a lazy primary AM timer. I would like to see the first edition published in the United States for relatively request.
