This place in England in 1940. Three orphans (Kerry, Charles and Paul) were sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). He does not want them but to take them reluctantly. It seems he is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the School of Witchcraft. (Okay - I understand that this is a family movie but - the College of Magic - Come on !!) The college will be closed before completing the course (???) and she wants to get down, Chief Professor Brown (David Tamlinson) And her and the kids turn over on a bed with the help of a witch bedknob. <br /> <br /> I saw this first at the age of 9 and remember it vaguely loving. Make sure it does not hold as an adult! The story is silly (even for a fantasy), children are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly objectionable. Rudy McDowell is also the third build and is only shown in two small scenes! Isle of Nambumbu is also a trip which is powered by animated animals. I thought it might be fun, but the animation is poor (for Disney) and it is very fierce in animals and there are many long football games. Here's some savings Graces: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just great; Songs (forgotten tables) are pleasing; The long dance sequence in Portbole Road is very colorful and full of power and the Oscars-winning special effects are still quite impressive at the end. But poor story lines, poor animation and unlikely kids really pull one of these. I've heard the extended version even worse! I can only give a 7
