If it is considered to be a screenplay for American serial killers, it can be seen as a rough average. <br /> <br /> A journalist [Dvoovni] travels across California to document the most famous murderers in America. His white trailer trash fellow traveler [Pete] is himself a serial killer. <br /> <br />, instead of the whole prediction, his actions are momentarily and Pit and Lewis have portrayed their role well, but I'm not bothered to see it again.
