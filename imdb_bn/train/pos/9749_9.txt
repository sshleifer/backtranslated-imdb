I was in high school many years ago when I saw this movie with my mother. I was definitely not at least bit interested in the opera at the time, but he changed my opinion. I've enjoyed this movie very much and really enjoyed the opera. I even bought a lot of his CD. Who was careful in his acting ability, he was originally adorable, who just played himself. He was so captivating, so merciful; I honestly just wanted to embrace him. I am very sad that many people criticize him so strictly. It was very straightforward, people did not push him around him or take justice for him for his actions. He deserves respected and acclaimed for his talents. He must definitely miss !!!
