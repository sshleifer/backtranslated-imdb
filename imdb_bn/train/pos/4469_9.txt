Generally the songs of the 1940s were the sources of a formula - and if you read movies, you know what I am saying - a fixed running length, very "usable" performance which was superb on the surface but never was in its true personality. Letters etc <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jean Kelly was probably the best in her career - yes I know about "American in Paris" and "Music in Rain". This one is different. She really has entered into her character ("Sea Wolf First"), thinking of "picking any girl during the holidays", which is nothing more than the Larke. And if you have to create your "story" to get him - so stay up - until then. When he gets "grip his legs" when sort of like music man. The last hilarious version of the film comes from the Creator's attempt to get the "girl" to do good to her and her new Paul (Sinatra) that she really falls in love with and unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was almost finished (the war ended one month after the liberation war), an appreciation that a man who always smiled in life can know that he is really a great I can not think of things, people, great songs, and perhaps some of the classic film-making techniques right now. <br /> <br /> Why? At the end - it starts to take a little longer than about 2/2 hours. In 1945, Gene Kelly created a small ballot number that was definitely a sensation, but it seems to be dated and it seems to add only a few minutes. But overall, this is a specific winner at each level.
