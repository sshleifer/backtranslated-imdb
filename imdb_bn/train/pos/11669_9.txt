There is a good story with classical Iraqi Flin's Adventure movie prototype and Maureen Wahra (what a great beauty!) And Anthony Quinn's two more brilliant co-stars, I can only recommend this film to everyone, even the least preference for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is its best!
