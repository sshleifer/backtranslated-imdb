It is difficult for some people to use in Hollywood production styles. Instruction is unclear, apparently only a film set of stage setup, and audio quality here and there bad (people's clothes sometimes compete with their voices). <br /> <br /> I started seeing what my friends and I wanted to expect, and the first scene almost stopped. It was very stagy and chessy. Then we sorted out on content tone, and really started to enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> It's funny, despite some fun. Certainly give it a chance if you appreciate the great dialog. Also, Helena Bonham Carter course, adorable.
