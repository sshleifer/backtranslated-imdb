As a bad movie lover, I definitely hit Pedder with this one. The plot is not really bad, but there are some incidents where you have to ask yourself "what is this hack happening here?" <br /> <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make it fun to never bad movies. First off, Rudi Ray Moore got so fat and slowly when the film was portrayed as the special effects associated with increasing the speed of dual battle scenes. There is a scene where there is a slow-motion instant repeat, jumping over ten feet high wall (running behind it), nude men walk outside huge letters and literally drop it under the roof (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some are doing strange dances. There is a lot of bad about this film, but they are a way to entertain And if you close your eyes to the movie, then you can miss another mistake. <br /> Ratings: The actual value for 1/10, 10/10 for the cheese factor, 10 to make mistakes and the mistakes 10 / 10, on average 7/10.
