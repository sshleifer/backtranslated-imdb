OK, so the plot is shaky ground. Yes, all right, so there are randomly inserted songs and / or dances (for example: Adam's Concert and the Hannah Stage Act). And Leslie can not tell the truth, Um, you know ... work <br /> <br /> But somehow, 'American in Paris' polished through it, as the first-rate music, it manages to manage everyone - basically Based on Gene Kelly's incredible dance talent and dance industry, and common truck loads seem to be imported into each scene, including because of loads. (He needs it, because he remembers ... the problem of emotation.) <br /> <br /> The most complete and technically intimidating number of this musical instrument must be in the final 16 minute ballet. It is illustrated wildly, and Kelly and Caron dance nicely. But my favorite number would be to sing Kelly's character 'I Got Riddle' with a bunch of French school-children, then breaking the American dance array. It turns out that you do not need special effects when you've got some real * talent. <br /> <br /> 'Rain' is not at the 'classic' level with the 'classic' level, but it's pretty up there too high. Watch price!
