Oh, this is such a glorious musical instrument. There is some confusion - Frank Sinatra misbehaves like Judas Nathan Detroit, though it has become clear only in "Suwai Mai", which is clearly a Jewish song. Sadly, filmmakers have decided to spend the best of the songs "Mary the Man Today" and replaced it with a inferior Sinatra Shoopipi. In between these two flaws, the film is otherwise superb. Gene Simmons shines as Sarah Brown Marlon Brando can not sow seeds, but it closes the way. Stubby Kaye reprises his Broadway role nicely (it was written for him). Damon Runeon's language and pence and humor came quite well. This is my visit-to-every-scope-list I get.
