The interesting combination of opinions is that it will be difficult to add something constructive. Anyway, I'll try. It was a very good action film with some great set pieces. You have noticed that I have specified the section. I do not snipe about the lack of characterization, and I do not berate. Enjoy it for people, a good above average action film. I could go but I made my comments.
