This was particularly horrific for 1973. It was actually a big box office success. It was forgotten after the 1970s, but its central message was very important to be completely invisible. It was at least fifteen years before its time ... Never before has anyone ever heard about the 'greenhouse effect' before 1985, and fortunately the controversial issue was rarely raised. <br /> <br /> Set and special effects may be a little old, but huge finance for science finances was a gamble in those times. If you look closely, you will see everything normally. This is a message movie, not for the star fighters of the world, which does not burst for more than a minute by the thought of a minute thinking until it has a million rupees explosion. <br /> <br /> It is also the best film of the hemons, its famous Dystopian Sci Fi trilogy. Then it was a tragic tragedy all disaster epic and big budget crowd. This may not be the most compelling two hour movie ever made and the last one can be frustrating and depressing, but it is hard to find a filmmaker who will be able to deal with such issues.
