If you love Kung-Fu movies and you do not see this movie then you are cheating yourself. This film is one of the only Kung-Fu Sultans which can be recommended for all movie fans. Generally, to watch something in this movie, there is no animated fan of this genre, but it has everything! The story is well said, and complete. The war scenes are great, and you will end up being completely annoyed with them (in contrast to the Crouching Tiger). Throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself a movie in a movie. See this one at all costs. Hack, my wife also enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
