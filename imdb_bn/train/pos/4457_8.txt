Yes, I'm one of the biggest musical movies with big entertainers like Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, which does not mention cathrine graysen petite and glorious voice. Music and dance fantastic I understand to take lessons from Frank Bale; And Jerry danced Kelly with the mouse, which is quite unique for the time being. Betty Gerrat played the waitress to love the senator. She is one of the great underrated stars of Hollywood. I have again seen it on e-TV and it is also on my old VCR tape. This old musical not tired. Has anyhow happened in Hollywood ??
