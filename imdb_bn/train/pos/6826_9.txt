The "Opening Night" of John Casvettes is fantastic and interesting; Excellent because it is playing with the deepest fear in our imagination, because it does not surprise us. Within two hours and twenty minutes long, anyone who appreciates the character can not close his eyes from the screen. <br /> <br /> An unsettled actress, Martle Gordon, (Gena Roadlands)), trying to combine herself for a game, to fight with her demons; "Opening Night" is not only a woman, but also about the complexity of the theater actor and dramatic world, on the edge of the breakdown. Here all characters of the Casavetes are experienced people who know about the world of theater; So half of the film takes place at a stage, where the actors perform their work or backstage, where the producers and writers and directors work on them. <br /> <br /> Cassettes are so strict with its characters that this mercilessness is active on the audience, but the audience audience. There is another audience in the film's play, because they do not know what is really happening and laugh because they think that everything is effective. And that's basically what it is; We can not see the theater audience as 'the way'. He does not enjoy the fertility of Guyana Roadland before going to that stage, but most importantly; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is an actress and she knows how to do it; And I imagine that if I had a professional actor, it would be really hard to say when telling the truth because I knew he was an actor and he could fraud at any time. What does Martel do so much during the time of the film that the film kept him ?? We suspect that he is true; <br /> <br /> Author Sarah (Joan Blondel), who does not understand why Martial can not understand the character she has written for her. Director, Manny (Ben Gaza), who can not accept the fact that his best actress might have lost it; Where does the producer David (Paul Stewart) stand and does not know Marell's co-star Morris (Casavetes himself), who can not deal with their love for each other. <br /> <br /> When she was a teenager, a fan died; All this comes together and affects Martel, but nobody knows if his illusion is for real. They do not say anything because they do not want to disturb him, but the film enters the subconscious, which only takes Murtle. Sometimes we can say that everyone has it. At this time, the bright script of the Casavets shows a terrible cruel fidelity between the words described in a non-alphabetical discussion; Not only does Mortalake say, but rather what he says. <br /> <br /> There are people who are not afraid to talk about them and change what they think, just like Cassavetes is the way to make movies. And from this point of view, performance is important here than "shadow", because the characters are involved in a big picture; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The way to shoot the character of the camera of Al-Rubon is a nice thing. When someone is talking, the camera does not focus on him, then he shoots him to listen. So we can see how he responds to what others say. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes devastating. <br /> <br /> Among all these amazing performances, although the implementation may still be there. Finally, there is an unexpected scene where Casavets and Rolandans start talking, non-stop. This was not improvised or we are not surprised anything. We just saw; And what means a lot more than what their experience of both life experience and exchange word exchange sees a conversation really comes alive? It's not more natural than that.
