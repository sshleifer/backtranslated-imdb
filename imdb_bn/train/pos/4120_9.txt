<br /> <br /> Kurosawa will be the first coloring film in the absence of five years in 1970. Dodds' C-Dane is a movie that is the center of many interviewing stories in a small Tokyo object. <br /> <br /> The title prepares the mentally disturbed boy because he thinks he is operating a train. We gradually know more people in small communities, two drones who do business with wives because they are not happy with them. The old man is the city center that helps the thief to try to steal him. Very poor father and son that can never afford a home, so they imagine their own up. At the end of the film, the stories come in all the details, some are happy, others are sad. <br /> <br /> There was Karussura's first color film, so you can see that he uses it in his advantage and shows it. Maybe too much. This film goes on various aspects and it is difficult to suspend and enter it. But do not make me wrong, Dodds C'sen may not be the best of Kuorawa, but coming from the greatest director of all time, it is much better than today's 99% film.
