I saw it after its release in '56, and after its final scene was hit. If this is the answer to 'Hi Noon', then this is an appropriate and appropriate response. The idea is that this string is "The city comes together" is 'Hi Noon' alone, stronger message than individual heroism. In this theme, 'Conco' is one of my greatest darlings, 'The Magnificent Seven'. Both Sinatra and Conrad provide impressive and trustworthy performance, especially the transit to liberate the warrior from Cyan pilgratage kid. I can only hope that at any time all the friends and family whom I have deplored my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for them.
