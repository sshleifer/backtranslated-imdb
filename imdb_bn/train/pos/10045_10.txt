I'm so amazing that after all these years, we're still talking about this movie! Clearly, this film was not bad or else the people could not even talk about it. I personally enjoyed this photo, and I still do! I guess this picture is not for everyone, but it certainly did not touch much heart. <br /> <br /> Those who think that this movie is "Overtide" or "Over Hyped" ... Well, we only thank the public for the film! lol * You see, it is not a CRITICS / article writer that generates a movie "Huge" or "HIT" with the general public. People make a huge success in the film. With the Titanic, everyone was afraid. Let's face it, a movie that has never been created before. Not necessarily to actually sink the specially influential type of ships. This movie is so accurate that James Cameron even made a lucky day in April 1912, after actually drowning the actual drowning of the ship in the film. Even for the sake of religious silver! <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not break this movie! Critics think this movie will be sinking big! When this movie actually comes out and people start listening to the word (which is the best form of advertising advertising you think) that it was valuable to a good / decent / movie, then everyone sees this movie revolving around the theater in Drove ... not once, Not twice, but maybe 3 times more! So, I did not really say that this film was "overhyped" ... at least MATRIX is not like the buildup being reloaded or the "overhyped" HULK. Haha Critics do not even think that the Titanic will make enough money for a cameraman's huge film budget, which makes it a huge film. However, the movie takes care of 200 million budgets and much more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this picture. However, this film can not be for everyone. Do not tell that this picture just sucks because of romance! That's the sexiest thing I've ever heard! It's a romance to hate a movie just because! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been good, but let's face it ... The original star of the movie was not Leo Kate ... It was a zincantric ship! I think all actors, including DiCaprio and Winchester, did a good job. This is not the best thing (I've seen a better job than both of them) but I did not see it before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
