Takashi Mike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about her children's film because I hated seeing her coming out of her lover: Visitor K, Goju, Ezo, Achi killer and Black Society Trilogy. Recently he seems to be looking for new areas and I think he is successful. Yet this was his first film I saw him in that direction, so I was nervous. I was very happy to see it and was happy. <br /> <br /> Great Yoke War is a perfect movie and adults will also like it. The whole picture reminds me of many movies like a baby: Nevrending stories, sculptures, oz returns, etc. I enjoyed these movies because they were not stupid like kids and they are not. Dark intrinsic morality is there, but it should not be a child film. I personally was not bothered by CGI and prosthetics. I think I feel well and do not think kids will be noticed. <br /> <br /> If you are hard at killing the Tacasic Mike fan then you can not like it. However, I offer it a shot. It proves that Miike as he is diverse and gifted as he suspects. He has continued his signature outside the signature Miike films, which is very reassuring. <br /> <br /> Those who are new to Tuxki Mike and want some light-hearted or dramatic ones like them, I recommend them to other movies: 'Jabrman' Katakuri's happiness 'Sabu' and 'The Bird People in China'. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Well done! 8/10 stars
