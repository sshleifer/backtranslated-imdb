Edmund Burke said that "all the bad needs are good for nothing to do." Hollywood often trashes us because it does not see enough family-quality movies. This film depicts the story of reducing and restoring faith. It did not have any violence, no atrocities, and a PG rating was not deserve. Western scenery was well illustrated, and some vistas were simply breathtaking. The actors were a bit young for their part, but were otherwise credible and talented. The music score was too loud, and in some places the dialogue was completely submerged. I am sometimes surprised by the end of the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Sometimes good guys win, and they win by honest effort. We liked movies and messages, and would recommend it to the whole family.
