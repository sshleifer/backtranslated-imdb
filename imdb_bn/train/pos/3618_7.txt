The first step to get out of the road that you recognize is that you are in the first place; Then it has become a matter of taking strong action and taking positive steps to overcome the negative effects of your life, which can lead you from that road. How did a young Latino girl write in Carin Kusama and directed 'Girlfriend'? Diana (Michele Rodriguez) from Brooklyn's project, eighteen-year-old High School faces the expulsion after the fourth war of the house at the beginning of the Senior Beginning. He influences the attitude of a 'whatever', which masks the anger of the deep roaring, which threatens to take him where he does not want to go. He lives with his father Sandro (Paul Calderon), with whom he has very close relations and his younger brother Tini (Ray Santiago). With the radioactivity at the end of his life isolation, he needs the consciousness of the spirit of extremist consciousness, which occupy him. And one day he does not find it, even when he stopped in the gym, where the little train. Wickedly, boxing with boxing does not want to do anything; He wants to go to the art school, but Sandro is firmly convinced that his son can take care of himself on the street and can pay ten dollars a week for his lessons. When Diana Tony travels to the instructor Hector (Jamie Terrell) to take her over and reach his father for money, it is a weekly weekly allowance (she does not want to know what she wants to know), Sandro turns him down and her Asked to go outside and earn his own money. Finally, with a little help, he found a way out, and the ring soon became his second home. This is an environment that he accepts easily and it seems that his life is going to get better. And in 'gender blind' competition women will have to fight against men, at least they do not get angry. Diana has found her ingredient. <br /> <br /> Writer / director for the first time, Curin Kusama, to create a realistic setting for his story, to present a genuine portrait of life in a project and it did a great job of so much frustration. So young people who find themselves in the circumstances of their own death and on the road that does not come anywhere. And it does not have any candy coating; Hector told Diana when he asked him where he came from, 'I was once a warrior. I have lost. ' Then, looking around busy Jim, 'Like most people, they're going to lose. But they all know - 'and in the manner in which the characters are portrayed as well as the honesty of the attitude, it makes this movie as good. It is an inferior world, which is gradually covered with light, run-down gym - You can smell the boxer's sweat roughly - and the idea that it is destroyed is hanging like a ball, which suppresses and hangs on these people <br/> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is so real that it makes you wonder how much it really is in Rodriguez; Just where the actors leave and start the character? Anyway, it works. This is a powerful, memorable performance, an actor, from whom we will wait another endeavor in a great context. He must have made Diana a positive role model, many of whom hope to get the light and the realization that alternative options of life are available, at least those who want to find them. <br /> <br /> This picture as positive, however, it ends some of a vague notes; Although Diana definitely has her legs on the ground, where she has no indication of leadership. Is this a short-term fix for him, or he became the Hector's female opponent? In the end, in fact (and the fact that one of the strengths of this film's power), professional boxing is not a profession that provides arms to women and it also does not open their arms. And with the content of the film and following the filmmaker's perspective, a confirmation of Diana's firmness was justified. <br /> <br /> Supporting Castes Santiago Douglas (Adrian), Elisa Bocenegra (Morrisole), Alicia Ashley (Ricky) and Thomas Barber (Ira) Although it provides a very real picture of life that will be able to detect many, there are some aspects of 'Girlfriends', which extend some reliability associated with some of the ring events. Besides that, it's a positive film that is a satisfying experience for the most part. I rate this 7/10. <br /> <br />
