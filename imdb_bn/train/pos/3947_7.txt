In 1921, American poet and humanist Walt Whitman - how a man was a man before his time, based on the real story - Western Medicine made significant contributions to man's behavior with mental problems. <br /> <br /> Treatment of people with mental problems, he started collaborating with psychiatric workers and patients. After seeing the mental system of the time (inhuman and irrationally ruthless methods), Walt rejected these procedures and treated patients with compassion and dignity, encouraged others to do the same; Walt's interaction story with psychic workers, patients, and fellow citizens is full of drama, good humor And knowledge :)
