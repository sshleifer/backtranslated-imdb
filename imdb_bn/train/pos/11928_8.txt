The movie is still a great film when the film was released in 1956, during the MGM Liberation War and at the same time, with the film's original novel, played by Jeanette Leigh. Danny Glover brought George Knox into one of his best performances, which gave his luck the life of the baseball manager in a little mood. "Stacked" for this movie is the way to add Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience works through his performance on the screen and shows a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (third rock from the sun), Brenda Fricker (a charming and well-loved) Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes he is also good in this film), Matthew McConnewey (he's dazed and confused This role was stolen, and its role may not be as important as the film, but he got the exposure) Adrian Brady (apart from the similar, degraded and confused part for the adriae), Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longgo (Messmer), J. and Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Blue McDonough (Whit Bus) and one of his final performances Non experienced John Ben Johnson (owner Han Angeles, California, morphine), and the rest of the cast does a great job, which is a fantastic story which shocked a lot, in the recesses of sadness I do not recess. I liked this film as a child, and when I see it today the memory brings back. I need this on dvd. I recommend to any parent who is looking for something that their children do not see, and on behalf of others, the matter
