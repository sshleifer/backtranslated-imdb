I saw this picture as soon as I passed four hours fast. This film restores the power and art of Hamlet, which is always meant. Even those who are so famous are doing new lectures and innovative ways. And Cast Incredible, Branhang Bright Star. It commands its role of charisma, power and film defining. It has created a complete and complete version so that many holes fill the length and allow the tragedy to realize new despite the length. Where would expect the dark, boring clichehed fortress, we are treated with a glorious festival for eyes. Hamlet himself comes to sleep only, as it should be. Good at your time, it's all four hours.
