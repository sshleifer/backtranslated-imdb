The old collection of the story creates a challenge for the production team, how this classic character can be up-to-date and reminding its past audience's memories can make it attractive enough to capture new viewers. In my opinion, their mission is completed. One must look for young children, pre-teens, teens, and their parents. All right, there are a few scary moments that have been resolved in a short time, but parents should sit tightly with younger kids, the film comes in better things. I'm going to go with the awful user critics that Emma Roberts offers us a positive role model for young people, not a sympathetic person. Nancy Career balanceens her femininity with psychological sleuthing skills Here's a real mystery to solve (you can find yourself as a bonus and favorite character associated with it) to make a lot of choices, laughs not to take it very seriously, even Nancy Drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion.
