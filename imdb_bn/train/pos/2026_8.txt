I saw this mini series of British television a few years ago and was immediately captivated by the stories. I'm not a great fan of 'Jane Eyre' or 'Worthington Heights'; I consider the former heroine as a self-righteous sister, and the next thing works as a bright clipper. <br /> <br /> 'The tenant of the Wildfell Hall', like the above work, is somewhat boring. In part. However, dark parts of the film were offset due to Helen's escaping excitement, the sensational wild and beautiful landscape of Yorkshire, and the excitement of Tobi Stephen's sexual magnetism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is successfully frustrating all women during the lifting lifestyle. They enjoy well from small home tortures illustrated by the treatment of women in Markham family. On the other side of the scale, unfortunate Helen, who has married a rich wealthy man, but with a negligence for a long time, get acquainted with cruelty and humiliation. He goes away and feels a short moment of independence, but as a mysterious woman left alone in a rural society, he inevitably becomes the subject of espionage and imagination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Heelen Markham-push. Unbelievably beautiful (despite extraordinary extraordinary hairstyles), with the help of the most amazing cheekbones, he is not able to play a central role in the film. At the same time, we are honored and unexpected to see if Helen is still dangerously dangerous. Rupert graves are obsolete, yet strange interesting Arthur Huntingdon - after seeing him, I could not imagine the other part of the actors to play. His role as a congratulatory mother of Paul Ferre's Gilbert is particularly notable, such as the actor who played his sister Rose and Simon Carter, who is reluctant to taste the good things in life, Finally, I can see this film alone for Toby Stephens; She looks very good, nasty, sexy, sensitive (but not in an annoying feeling). I am not sure whether my hormones prevent them from judging fairly. <br /> <br /> If there is a scandal in the film, the use of flashbacks that I interfere both interact with the story and make it a little confusing. Other people who saw this photo with me also had problems, and I saw that they should have some explanation. <br /> <br /> I am responsible for the public. For making this film. I just did not like the video (a rare event), but it led me to buy Anne Bront's novel novel. Naturally, it was better than film, but only by a narrow margin. I recommend interested in anyone interested in watching the movie and then read that order book. <br /> <br />
