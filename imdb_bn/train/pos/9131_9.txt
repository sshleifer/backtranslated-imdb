'I only saw laughing in the rainy rain.' This is a nice movie. It should have been re-rated PG-13. But anyway, Prince's first film and the greatest. Followed sucked up. But I have not seen it for years so here I can think about it. Kid (Prince) had to raise the love of his life, Apollonia (himself), his band together (self-revolution) and his family to excite tension. But his rival band (time of his own time) was destroying his life. Like Morris (myself) trying to steal Apollonia from the kid. Just like Saturday night feathers, flashdance and 8 miles. Really good Rent it, smile and cry and if you luv it, buy it.
