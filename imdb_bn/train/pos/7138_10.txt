John Tha has never played "Morse", "Kavanag" or "The Swine" and other productions, he will be remembered for this remarkable unforgettable performance at "Goodnight Mr. Tom". <br /> <br /> <br /> This co-adaptation of Michele Magrian's impressive novel, his comedian (young actor young Nick Robinson, his first role), and incredibly well-liked by a helpless cast, is a worthy monument of his art. <br /> <br /> <br /> When I read this story to an old widow Norfolk countrymen having a young boy from before and during his time in Blitz, I found a clear time-line error in it, and The credit must be corrected by the makers of this film. They should also appreciate the story not to be overly sensitive and to prevent it easily become a polytheistic world. <br /> <br /> If you put a CD or video library, this feeling is an absolute inclusion made for a good TV movie.
