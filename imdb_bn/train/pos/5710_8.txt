Rain clearing groundbreaking musical instruments. If you want to see if the songs are the first story, then that is the place. This is the story of a hungry young artist, who won the lottery with his drawings. Unfortunately his ticket is in his quota, which is in his apartment apartment and has been given to the criminal, who then ... Oh, but he will say. <br /> <br /> This is a light and droplet conversation where most of the songs are sung (most people think it did not happen to Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Weber). This is a movie that they do not make, and rarely when they did it. It's a film word from dramatic days like a movie after five or six years. Clayer has operated his camera in such a way that Bushy Berkeley is not working (although Berkeley is doing a dancing dance number, and the clerk is taking the "real world" despite being relatively honest of two filmmakers) This is an amazing little movie. And it's a ridiculous movie that will just smile on you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's just a nice little movie and that really you will know.
