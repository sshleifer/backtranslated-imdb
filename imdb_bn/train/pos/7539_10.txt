I really enjoyed watching this movie. It has been seen that like most people. I'm sure that I got it. Hypie Goldberg is a very funny comedian and he has made many fun movies; Like sister's work <br /> <br /> But this was not really a comedy. It's a drama with comedic moments. So if you are looking for a sunny riot, check it out. <br /> <br /> This film is taking a black family from the surrounding area of ​​the upper middle class in a good neighborhood of the city. I would say more but it seems that it will ruin the movie. This film is not only related to race relations between white and black but also about relationships with black communities. I think this is an opportunity price. If you are not interested in watching any other movie about ethnicity, this movie is not for you
