Ang Lee clearly looks straight into a movie, catching actions and letters, as they appear. The harmful consequences of the American Civil War are a standard method, in the mind or in the mind of man through the violent activities of a young militia. The image becomes the subject of personality, adultism and relationships. Lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of mid-south as a silent character, tolerating a tough parental conflicts. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is probably the scripts of James Scammas for the film; A number of good recruitment jobs that carry it pretty back off. Jeffrey Wright's name alone can carry this photo for me alone. He played a brilliant but slow role here: instead we are treated very well with a large, often recognized group (if not revelatory) performance. <br /> <br /> A great, optimistic film. For example, if you do not claim difficult, more intelligent Cold Mountain or claim but it should be seen. 7/10
