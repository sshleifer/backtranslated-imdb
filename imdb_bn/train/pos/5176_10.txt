Anyone who went to the camp, or wanted, must watch the movie. This movie takes the absolute essence of everything from the summer camp. It's funny, it's kinda, you want to see more about characters after the credit roles begin. If you have not seen this movie then what are you doing? You turn off the butt and run the video store. Well your summer :)
