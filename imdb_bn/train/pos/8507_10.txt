Ok you oj As an American soldier Simpson decided to rescue all the American bus drivers to save their own passengers and no one else is going, and playing a direct role as a train guide, does not know what to do in the mind of Arthur Johnson. They want to accept it in hardship and combine it with Lorenzo Lama because one of the three children is faced with bad boys, who want to kidnap a heir, and people can go beyond a load of people to die in dessert, and you have a job, plot twist and A lot of drama Everyone was good, but Lama saw my heart blown up for the worst of bad boys. He was not very credible, who was a very bad person who wanted to kidnap the heir only, but wanted to rape women and humiliated a man who tried to stop him. It was obviously long before he planted the image of his good guy. And believe me the 20 year old Lorenzo of tight jeans you really do not want to miss!
