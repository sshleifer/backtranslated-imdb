This is a very difficult movie, and which is almost impossible to handle. At first it seems to be a pedestrian film for a person (Trailkovsky), who needs an apartment and the current tenant (a woman) can change herself while committing suicide. Then twists and turns active. Neighbors are trying to kill him? And why are the dead tenants' clothes being turned into the apartment? One surprise, finally, if Trelkovksy _is_ ago the tenant. <br /> <br /> Speaker Speaker Speaker Speaker Speaker Spinner <br /> <br /> Ours lies in lieu of us We assume that when we look at things from the point of view of the character, we can see things like character and distort the reality. We think when the camera shows us something from our universal perspective that we see in reality - but Polanski's camera is lying to us.
