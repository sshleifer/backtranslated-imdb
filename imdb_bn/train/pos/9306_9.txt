A horrible place in the world. But this movie is awesome and it's fun. And if you do not like it ... you will not find it ... and if you do not get it ... it does not matter. If you want to play along, it's up to you This one actor was fun. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne invaluable. Bayern and Paul Uncle are doing my way, like "Vick" keeps it, "... the best version of all time". Okay ... this is not a great composition, but it's not bad. I was warned against seeing it, but I'm glad I did ...
