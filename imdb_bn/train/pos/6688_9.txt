Based on comic books, in the history of film, "mystery man" is the most undeleted one. This is not a regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploitation of a motley crew of the well-known Wannabes, of which Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), bowler (Genre Garphalo), Soveller (William H. Messi), Blue Raja (Han Azariah) and Spin (Paul Ruwan) Most of the "mystery men" superhero movies hijack questions about "Superman" or "Batman", such as cruel words and secret identity. Most superheroes are not billions like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types are men's jobs and neurotic hoses life. So it seems that director Kima Usha can relate a hero to the average audience. I found the "mystery male" aspect stimulating and very funny. Even if it does not turn out to be a franchise, but it's still a joy to see!
