I have watched on TV so long that I did not remember when it was, but it was still one of the most horrific, most incompetent movies I've ever seen. There is a fine but intense fear that you are not clearly visible in the black color hidden in the black frame of the frame, so that you think (like a solicitor's hero), it is not just imagination or not sure. This is one of the few movies I'm afraid to monitor. Good movies about the ability to create an atmosphere using movies, actors, location / sets, music, detailed attention, and imagination can be leaked "quality of production". A real gem
