I was quite enjoyable in the series as a child and then it was in my memory that one of the memorable cartoons that made a difference in the previous 80's was compared to the previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapa, Il Ittayu Yay Fayes L. 'Home ..., which I love the most). I found that other such Japanese cartoons were released later, they could not match the Mazzinger Z, because they started to repeat the same annoying pattern. <br /> <br /> This innovation can be the best, the feature of Majingzer Z. Another good point is its innovation, with many extraordinary monsters, weird devices and bizarre characters; In fact, we were interested to see how new types of failures or bad machines were waiting for us to know every new installment!
