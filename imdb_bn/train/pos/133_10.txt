A few years ago, a friend received a video of Michael Man's film 'Hit' from among his other friends. After finishing the film we are standing, we saw that there was another picture after that, the owner did not write it, what was difficult in the cassette envelope. Yet we all got separated from our seats, which did not have credit. After a few hours, I'm just wondering: How did I not hear this masterpiece before? <br /> <br /> This image is Euro. Through the death of Lars von Triia, the film woke NoÃ«r, deliberately brutal reality with a set set, but hunting often with post-war German photographs was noticed. And then cut the trick! <br /> <br /> The story itself is a neutral moral edgy which is not a happy ending. A German American peacekeeper arrives in the postwar war of Germany, his countrymen tried to make some good for bomb attacks. But he mostly meets the mistrust and self-destructive defiance. He is a foodie named Jentrapopa and a sleeping car company (modeled in Mitrogar), whose owner Nazi works with one of the Occupiers whitewash. Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later became a member of the terrorists Nazi Waverolph during the war. When he did not understand the world (or just Europeans), he got angry and flung a railway bridge under the train, which he had just preserved. <br /> <br /> As a final note, for historical accuracy: In the real world, the wave of the wave was as important as the film, as it was a comprehension, they were mostly a final Nazi propaganda coup. After killing an Acehen chief, two months before the killing of an SS unit, the Nazis announced the creation of the whole soldiers of subotaurs and terrorists who are ready to fight behind the line, Weorolf. But only a few hundred of Hitler's youth received some training, and two or three times a few were appointed to kill suspected communists or forced labor in Beijing so that permanent fear of the residents, the death of Hitler and the war ended. <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the Wehrolf campaign had a profound impact on the occupiers. They were afraid of Vernaval everywhere, suspected behind any serious accident - but after the exception, there is another reason (some recent pseudo-historians ignored). For example, when a bomb exploded in the head of a bomb explosion, a gas major explosion or when a motorbike accident in Berlin died, the Soviet military commander died. The influence of the Soviets was the most powerful, who arrested thousands of people (children in the greater part!) 'Primitive' in the wake of Veruolov, and kept them in prison, where many died.
