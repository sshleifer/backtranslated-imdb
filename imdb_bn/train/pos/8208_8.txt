I think almost all of the movies in the series of Dari Harry are liked, which I think is the title of "Enforcer". "Dedump" was very weak in many areas, but I still enjoyed it. This series is my favorite one, if "go ahead, make my day" is not something else for the great line. It has also made an interesting person who is known to kill anyone who makes a mistake in his plot. Just think that behind the murder of "Magnum Force", there is less mystery to anyone and your plot is. It is supposed to have a little more than it as a very beautiful final showdown feature at an amazing park. In it Dante Harri has received a bulldog as a gift and it features a tripping trippad in Sandra lock rather than a ridiculous scene. Clint Eastwood had to stay in medieval actress Sandra Lock instead of many of her movies. Though the movie is enjoyable to me, even though each time it brings the score to a point. He is not supposed to be bad here, but his character can be so good by anyone else. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry films, sometimes they often seem to be an advertisement for guns. Do I like the guns of the next person, but do we really need a scene to explain how many new weapons are in power and bullets of bullets? Still, the movie's Dirty Harry series is very nice entry.
