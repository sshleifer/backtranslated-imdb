From the heart of Robert Bloc's "Psycho" fame, four stories of this Amicus film revolve around, which I liked so much fun or fearful, still some decent series of entertainment <br /> <br /> This is a very skeptical Scotland-era detective ( John Bennett) related to the wrap-around story, who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor; He advised that this case was related to some people, where they all came, and our film was closed. <br /> <br /> author Charles Hillier's "Moderation for Meridates" Eliot) is afraid of his latest fictional creation, who apparently comes to life. There are some good spiritual and fairly suspicious moments in this sequence and it is bound by a reasonably appealing revelation and denial. <br /> <br /> "Wexworks" star Harier Icon Peter Kushing Retired stock broker Philip Grieson, with an old friend Neville Rogers (Josh Ackland) became obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a Macar wax museum. The most effective dream sequence of this episode, though it is always great to see Kushing. The final images presented to us in this story are quite frustrating. <br /> <br /> Another sweet star of love, Christopher Lee, as John Reid, who does not deal with an adorable pediatric child, Jane (Chloe Franks) is very generous, and it's new partner Anne Norton (Niri Dawn Porter) to find out why. The secret of this special episode is handled wonderfully; Filmmakers do not wisely touch their hand, so it comes as a real shock to find the full truth of this unhappy family. "Dying" moments are especially awesome. <br /> <br /> "Clock" is the fourth straight comedy; A few years ago Many of his actors, John Pertway, have made so much fun as a horror film star (in fact, he's the glory of this story), who are madly in the mood, and buy his cloak out of the latest low-budget movie quality. He said, Cloak has strange power, which I do not publish here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt welcomes welcome speech as Patience; There is no other than Christopher Lee, a wonderful example of humor! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> A fun mix of stories of underscores by Michael Dress's remarkable, interesting and inferior score, "The House the Dripped Blood". When I do not enjoy much, like "crypt from Tales", it's still a great fun. Possibly managed by Peter Duffell, it is slowly but sure on its cool decision, and certainly its type is a good movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
