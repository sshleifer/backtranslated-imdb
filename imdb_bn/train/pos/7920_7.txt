Full moon high (1981) 3 of 5 Larry Cohen stars: Adam Armin, Ed McMahon, Rose Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Armen) is your average general high school student. Big home coming games, prepping for girlfriend hardships and extravagant hair instead ?? You know normal. But in strange places, the hair goes out of control when a trip to his father to Trnolina (yes! McMahon) puts him in a dusty field of football. Now would I have let the world go for a young man forever, Adam will get a girl? <br /> <br /> 'Full Moon High' does not often speak, but it's a stupid and entertaining awful fool. Larry Cohen (Q Wing Supp, The Staff) has added many gags because he might appear as a writer / director. The main role of Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows excellent time. If you are a fan like crazy like 'airplane' and 'student agency', then you may enjoy this chocolate-fest.
