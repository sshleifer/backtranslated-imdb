It was obviously Mick Dundee's prototype, but Barry McCann's Adventures is fun. I was amused throughout time and laughing lots of lots out loud. Barry Croker's stellar central performance in the title role, an Australian who attacked England in an unwanted way to annihilate pomas. Barry would bother some bright by frequent cruel observations at his host. The relationship between the two countries is fork-friendly, and it is highlighted by the final line of the film, it is provided by some reluctant MacKenzie when he operates the plane. "I just started to love poms."
