Analysis of exploitation and depression (though repetitive and rather effective), where there is no way forward or forward, where you can violate someone below and make yourself better, it seems to be the only option. But even here, in a lost dream and in the ruins of the future, it does not work and a simple act of charity for some to comfort and share with others, gives some rewards, even if it is present only by rejuvenating the memory of the past. <br /> <br /> Although there is actually a little bit about screen violence, it is a harsh and cruel film of torture (political and personal), which is not easy entertainment. Clearly, based on a game with a little cast, a broader relationship with the general social and political environment helped the film reach a wider audience.
