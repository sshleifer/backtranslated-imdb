I saw this tape, repeat it immediately, saw it again and smiled twice as hard. I strongly recommend this tapes for those who hate this, but transvestites are uncomfortable around. It shows you that transvestiity is a feature instead of completeness. Comedy is not a single problem. These people are bright. All comics should be ambitious in its level of its gravity, intelligence and talent.
