What can be said, really ... "The tenant" is a first-class thriller, which produces similar suspensions and full-blown pannoyas. This is a complexly planned film - each story seems to be included for a reason - though the plot is rarely made, and most of it is not intended to be resolved even more. Therefore we have been left behind a cruel policeman who has got an apartment due to the previous tenant suicides - in order to guide us through a world of increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski) - anonymity fear and uncertainty. Trailoskieki is growing after an apartment-warming party thrown by a group of offensive colleagues, apparently being examined by his colleagues in the building; The rest of the picture chronicled his mental disaster and gave us a thorough monophole * in line with the next attempt of David Lynch. "The tenant", though, has struggled with more annoying and terrible, unexpected comic relief, good performance and genuine hunting scores. This is a movie that is well-versed in the description, so please be happy for it.
