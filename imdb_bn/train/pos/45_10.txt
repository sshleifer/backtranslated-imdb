If you have ever had a great movie in the house room if you have drama in your life. It keeps you missing more. Do not be surprised that the hidden Alicia is hidden. I think I saw this movie six times in row and lost interest. Plus I do not usually cry over the movie but this one will cry every time I make it. I hope I find more movies like him. All I had is a great movie at all. The more you see more parts with it. The very last part that I was crying when she got her diploma really got me because her daughter's name was. My heart felt that it was broken immediately. And his new friends still did not come to console him when he was not yet achieved. I love it too much.
