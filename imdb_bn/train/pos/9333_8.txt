While my whole life was in Ontario, Marlin Moore grew up in that same city, I heard her story from her parents, grandfather and family members. So when I came to know that they would draw a movie about him, and my street would start, and I was excited in my house near his house. <br /> <br /> If you read the book, Rock by Marlene Moore, you've got a different picture of her as a person, she was considered to be very weirdly, who, with her family, often raped her closely He asked him. Children, with one exception of his brothers. Also, if you live in my area and those around you who are aware of him from school, you are intelligent enough, but you know that he was seriously wounded before going to any organization, he was always defensive and what seems to be unwilling to learn in a school environment Like it was disrespectful that she was incapable. <br /> <br /> Marlon did not deserve his rights with the life he was given. It was the government and the people around him who did not understand their needs and did not understand why he did, and helped him further in his death. I still angry myself that he was kept in prison for self defense from a person who tried to rape her. His brother once said, "They did not know what to do with him, so they locked him and killed him." I believe that with my heart. <br /> <br /> Rest in peace Marlin, you deserve a lot for it.
