Fantastic, fantastic, probably Disney's best musical adventure. For 35 years I have liked this picture because it is so fantastic, cute and fun. Despite even the stupid "Flying Bed" view, other scenes and dialogues witch and fun. Can they play better than Angels Lansby? I can not think of anyone more suited to the role. This classic would be considered stupid like restoring Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> Though David Tomminson had some of his high quality movie roles, this adventure is totally brilliant. He was a comic genius who has forgotten many times nowadays. Blustering, primary and correct English - someone could really slapstick and he could pull it off gracefully as such. It would be sad to rebuild the film because Tomlinson has died for a few years and someone can judge his character from his step-by-step step by step. <br /> <br /> Other movies with witches do not just capture. I especially enjoy the parts where the Germans invade the house of Egalentine and they can protect it anyway. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Richard and Robert Sherman They all look fantastic and memorable, Road is my favorite in Portobale. <br /> <br /> a great movie today!
