Diego Armando Maradona was 16 when he was 16 years old when Argentina won the World Cup in the country. He is already the greatest star and one of the country's greatest players involved in football. Everyone requested Caesar Lewis Menotte to give a talent to the boy, but the manager thought that he was not ready yet. The record of the history that Argentina won the 1978 World Cup - surely Maradona did not really need them. The same thing was not true in 1982. Spain A list of disasters for Argentina. Menuti - Still smoking chains - this time Diego played, but such a mood was the occasion for the boy. On 4 June 1982, Maradona signed for $ 7 million for Barcelona - nine days later he played the first game in Camp Nou and Belgium scored the number one Argentine. It was not a good debut, and he scored twice in the next match against Hungary, but Maradona would remember the nodir as the place for him - a quirky, petulant foul in Brazil's second round, which ended his tournament and Argentina's reign as world champion. . <br /> But now that she was behind her Maradona spoiled his way through barricades in some barracks, and in 1984 he went to Napoleon. She was finally home, as was the case. Under Napoli, Napolio Tifosi did everything to loot Maradona. Nestled uncomfortable with millions of cameras as gifts and pockets of old money transfer fees from young boys as part of the transfer fee, and the city was determined to feel at home with him. So, for the least time, Maradona El Rey - he replaced Carlos Bildardo Mani with a new manager and a new manager in Mexico to bring him back to Argentina. <br /> <br /> <br /> Maradona Hero In this story, one man's World Cup winning machine. Hundreds of youths died in the uninterrupted fighting of the Falkland Islands in 1982; Now for a rebuilding of British press Mexico City (with the same result). Maradona is still considered specially for Brazil's spectacular performance in the 1980's tour of Spain in England. But he was still an Argie: the enemy. <br /> <br /> England actually started well, and the line ker could score only twelve minutes later. An important event happened in 8 minutes. Fenwick, the big and limited English Defender, was booked - now he was scared to make a challenge around the penalty area. <br /> <br /> After the first 45 minutes interval, the second half started with the lips. After 50 minutes Maradona could dance forward, but could not find a way out. Similarly Valdano's attempts hit only white shirts. Then the infamous moment that works as the epitaph of Defo. Hajj reciprocally brought his penaltry back to the area, Shilton wanted to demand early - but Maradona was up and standing on the English goalkeeper and hugging him in the net. How did he do it? Simple: handball. <br /> <br /> The most famous of football history has gone slowly. Every visitor waits for deception of Syrian al-Sharif (he did not). Shilton looked at the lineman, and he went back to the central circle. As long as he kills Pope or is the first man to walk on Mars, when the great man dies, this will be shown first at this moment - long, lasting, slow motion, his face in the face of greedy appearance. The next image will be his next gift - the best goal of the World Cup. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He span, and hurried away from Beardsley and Reid. This was the real Diego - he exploded through the Butcher and attacked Fenwick. Fenwick now had an opportunity to stop the attack. Generally, he noticed his boot somewhere near the Maradona jungle - sure he took a red card, but who care? Then Fenwick was a brainwave - he became frustrated, decided to undergo surgery in Maradona - perhaps he was trying to stop him? Shot as the box over Dengo Fenwick. She was running alongside such a genius genius as she had offered inspiration. Shilton Pane was charged, and Maradona roamed around him and was ready to score. Now the Butcher reminded Argentina's role, trying to make strangers - instead he gave extra shotgun on the shot, which was in the target. England is coming home. <br /> <br /> This wizard got the heir to the earth in the Mexican summer. In fact, he has always been the greatest player of all time - he was great in 1958 and 1970, but he was a great player around. Not Maradona. 1986 was his World Cup.
