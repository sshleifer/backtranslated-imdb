After breaking his toes with the elegant movie "The Strength Vice of Mrs. Ward" (1971), in the Gialo pool, director Sageoo Martino followed the same year as another twisti sensation thriller, "Scorpio incident tail". Like his previous attempt , This is a handsome Maoist couple George Hilton, who met Martino's Shantik / Giulo Hybrid next year "The All J. Color of the Dark ". "Scorpions Tile" also stars actors Luigi Pistili and Anita Strinnberg, who will be featured in Martino's "Your Vice is a Locked Room and Alone's The Key" (1972) to portray a unhappy couple (to make it lightly!). (I just love that headline!) I think Eduze Finch was busy shooting this month! However, this picture features a stylish side that Martino fans will expect, as well as a intriguing plot, some modestly killed piece sets and beautiful athletic positions shooting. At this time the story is seen as an insurance investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Stinberg, looking like a beautiful, intelligent sister of Farah Fountain) who suffers from a series of deadly crash of the crash of the crash and has inherited $ 1 million by a beautiful widow. . I really thought I figured out this picture through half, but I was wrong. Although this conspiracy has created a perfect concept in this Geyolo, I would again see this movie to fully appreciate its losses. Highlighting the image, for me, ultimately the catastrophe cat and mouse struggles with the killers, especially breaking a suspicious house, and a nifty fight over a tiled roof; Lots of good work explosions in this movie! Thanks to the great people of No Shame for their great subtitles and other great looking DVDs with interesting additions. This is a fantastic outfit, which has turned its ongoing quest to bring back the lost Italian gems from abstraction.
