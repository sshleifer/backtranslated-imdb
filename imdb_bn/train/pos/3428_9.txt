I watched this film tonight at NYC at Landmarks Sunshine. I do not know what I can expect, I did not read a lot about it because I knew that it does not matter. All in all, it is done very well. It does not focus on the generalization of "anti-war" statements, which left me politics. The soldiers talked about the awareness of the toxicity of their training mainly in the boot camp and how difficult it was to return to civilian life. Paul Rickoff and Camilo Mejia were not really good at telling about the difficulty of surviving during the war, but refused to return when they were against personal morality. Do not make any mistake - this is not a war film. Nobody sees it or does not live with the scars of war against their souls.
