Gozo takes part in a new wave of Japanese films, a very creative director, editor and photographer, and works in historical themes, which are called Japanese call "piece of time". Gojoe colors, photography, and editing conditions are highly creative. Bright, even in Japanese samurai focuses on the traditional beliefs of new wave Shamanism, Ghosts and secret power, which were certainly part of their ancient culture, but it was not really searched in the epic poems of the Kurosawa or in Zaatchi series of Kurosawa. Another fine example of this genre is Onamiogi (2001). I will establish Director Sogo Ichii as one of the most striking and creative Japanese manufacturers of new wave. Other recent Japanese episodes I would strongly suggest include Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintro Kattu Zaatichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
