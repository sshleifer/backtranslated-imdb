Let us start this review in a positive note - I am very happy that they did not decide to shoot Tony and that some people had a premeditated schedule. Indeed, the creator and writer of this episode, David Chase, is quite averse. We do not really know if Tony will live or die. He is very thin in his coma and his chances of recovery. This episode started moving very slowly, and the coma-inspired dream was related to Tony Tony's wrong identities and stole the Asian monsters shot by the SI and shot outside, it was absolutely flat, weird. After 45 minutes I became sick of some sorrow, but this episode may not be a cause for slam. It was a weird and unpredictable episode, but it was still good writing and intense. Edis Falco has given wonderful career-defining performance on this episode as the conflicting wife may face her husband. I think it's interesting to exclude from AJ school and swear a vendetta against junior, which can not be closed by AJ mostly. Silvio is now acting-boss who opens many doors to problems in the later stages. There are a lot of quizzes in this episode, and I think Vito 'Pole-Smokey' Spadoffer may meet his death if he's greedy SOB <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a great episode and just frustrated. Because Tony killed the man, we worship him as a visitor and think he is our hero. This was a necessary episode for the series, though it was encouraging towards a little graduation conclusion. Eddie Falco's performance, and writers for the development of David Chase and this whole original and unpredictable plot twist. This is the only season of 'The Soprans' where I have no F * cking needle where it's going to go. I can not wait for next week's episode. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> Line of the best episode: (PA to AJ): "Come on, Van Helsing!"
