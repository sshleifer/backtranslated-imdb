When I first saw this movie, I thought it was "love your neighbor" stuff .... the more movies were going on, the more I was involved. Acting from both actors, the direction was great, the story was unusual. For the first time in my life for a movie, my eyes closed. Must be a real serious video. 10 out of 11
