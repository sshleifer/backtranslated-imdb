For a movie that is visually visible to sex and skin, it does not have the right to be weird sweet. The story of Betty Page, a good Christian girl in the south who does not give her date until she is married to Mama, who moved to New York and became the most successful pin-up of her age, from an amazing performance-driven Gretchen Mole The photos they take with their page pornography trials (not allowing any touch, it's all fun and respectful) can not fully blend, and its images can have any impact on the world around it. <br /> <br /> The page encouraged every bourgeois artist, because he did not have a death image, but at the same time he invested each movie with innocent fun which was absolutely sexy and easy at the same time. Rather this film, actually. Filmde, both black and white and glorious technicians, is a beautiful way to spend a few hours on it.
