Based on the novel of the same name, this horror film is suffering from flawed production and sticky, amateur direction, but it is curiously compulsory. In contrast to the shocker awesome flicks as the exorcist, this movie takes on a slow slow dip still in the audience slow. It was scared of horror, which came to the viewer slowly towards a pregnant woman gradually as a dream, which was unexpectedly selected in the next Sennili. His job is to keep sitting in the gates of hell and to keep the naughty from exploding in the earth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot that is torn apart contains sublets and has not been satisfactorily explained, which hurts this movie. It's beautiful The Sentinel is not your stairs; It's also a clock-and-squirm uncomfortable. Like a bad car debris, there is an obligation to look even when it becomes intolerable. This movie is not bad at all, and still has a power to shock. <br /> <br /> Cast was enabled. Christina Rainees Allison, the weak girl of spiritual attack from both sides, was greeted as a quack in the never-ending battle between good and evil. Chris Sarandon was as good as his caring but ultimately self-centered boyfriend. Eli Walch and a very young Christopher Walken are struggling to uncover intelligence deliberately handed over to the people. Ava Gardner is realtor elegant as her hired property lies awful awful. Gant's old John Carradine, with her pregnancy-curved hand, is as good as the canonized cannibal, who needs to be replaced. The devil played charming perfection by Burgess Meredith; She is so sweet and still so evil. This movie has hidden future stars: Beverly D'Angelo and Jeff Goldlam as the friend of the poor girl, and Jerry Orbakh is playing a successful TV player as well as typing. At the end the damned souls are portrayed by the real biased freaks and geeks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He adopted his first suicide attempt, faced a wonderful unhappy lesbians, and cut a cat as a cake. Often, he is yanked behind, through the dream of dreams and wakefulness, through reality and imagination, lacking the way to cope with all the time. Verily, Satan is trying to run insane enough to kill himself before becoming his next madman. Will he succeed? In a nutshell, the slow-moving still unclear, well-played but poor direction, and a very common 70's before horrifying movies can reduce the actual shocks. (Not intended for any intelligence) This film can not work for those who work for a short time, but it can send back the spine and still provide some shock value. It remains a peculiar compulsory and entertaining deep in the domination of evil.
