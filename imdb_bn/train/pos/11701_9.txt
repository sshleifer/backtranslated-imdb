This is a great movie for all Generation X's. The 1972 United States compared the different worlds to our psychological 21st century. 1972 What America has followed, you liked to watch this movie. I have seen that the clothes and car styles now bring to us the memorable memories of a much better country. Just think ... Then there was to choose 4 or 5 TV stations again. There were no AIDS, Muslim Terrorists, Road Rage, 911, Bird Flu, Freeway Sniper etc. The Vietnam War is over. Star Wars will be there even before 7 years of departure. Private computers and the internet are still 29 years away. <br /> <br /> When the film was first released, the producer had to sell the film in the market as any other film company wanted it. So film projectors are shown to start the journey of almost small Protestant churches in the country. (It must have certainly been before VCRS). If the priest of the church wants to be interested in the thief in his congregation, you will receive a copy of the film. Then he will show it in an evening church salon or lunch room. Members of the congregation invite "unsaved" friends and family members and will be a social show of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can exceed the limited production price of the movie and it only looks for its nostalgic value, I think you will enjoy more movies. Of course I'm speaking as Zen Zenner. <br /> <br /> If I have a time machine then I will go back to 1972 and say the 21st century cesspool.
