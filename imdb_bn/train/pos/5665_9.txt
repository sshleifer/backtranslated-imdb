They were from my first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County! A sleepy little Mayberry-like place with a slight difference. Sheriff is really devil. Have Spoiler. Like you do not want to find it within 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, but not all. It turns out that there is a son named Satan Caleb. Some people are trying to keep him well, but it's an uphill battle. Sheriff Buk (Satan) who knows Caleb and teach him the way to the dark to spend time with him. Fine Ninja He always does not stop as evil. Most of the time he is a hero. Everyone gives him a big donation because he often sets up a disaster and saves them from them. So when you think that someone will eventually take him down, then a friend of it does not come anywhere from the racket. <br /> <br /> Lucas and Caleb were out of the jungle in my favorite episodes. And some guys with guns decided to loot them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Culeb an education about evil. <br /> <br /> The robbers (TED) were not hesitant to shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half of his conscience. If he does not have any conscience, he shoots them right now. If he had a genuine conscience, he would never become a criminal. So he called him Huff-Ted. It was pretty funny. He was taunting the perpetrators. And of course he is always 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted. And of course he had complete control at all. They actually supported Satan in your favor. <br /> <br /> Very nice show. It was always one of my favorite horror shows at all. Voice of the American Gothic Supernatural Twilight Zone's Night Stick Circle <br /> <br /> It is a good company.
