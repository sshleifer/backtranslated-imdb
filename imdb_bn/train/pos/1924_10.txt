This event was great, it was not just for kids that I thought first, it is for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season was about two daughters and boys with the father, he died sadly in season 2, I could hear it and believe it. <br /> <br /> I saw that they came to the show that what really happens in real life and I must mention the goodbye episode that it was so good, for them it would be so difficult for the film, you can say that they have their eyes The actual tears were there. I'm a 24-year-old man and this episode cried to me, because I know how they felt like my dad was dead, when I was like Ray at the age of 13. <br /> <br /> Season 2 and season 3 are amazingly funny, there were 3 seasons my favorite friday on Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think this display was strong enough, I was disappointed that it was over, it was not the best, since the home improvement was the best family comedy show and it could be the next friends. <br /> <br /> It should never have ended, but every day love to see it again.
