I heard how bad the animation is. It can not be compatible with what each one expects, but look at it in this way. Will you expect perfection in hell? It is my belief that the animation was dry and purposefully snowed. It was very nice to see the transformation of his character in this movie, it seems to be closer to the live action which we can get. I hope for a signal shortly. If we like live action, I think we can be good with Purity or Purgatori. I do not think Lady Death will make a good transfer to the film. But since it may be, it is my own personal belief that all the spectators of this movie are dead wrong. For any punishment purpose.
