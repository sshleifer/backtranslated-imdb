This movie is a wonderful work, which is a story of a young girl during the war, and it really happened, just like not a movie, but it's a great story, I was influenced by this movie, acting and story where I liked it because the film is a real story . It was a ghif's feeling that I was there and I'm sorry for the CA-Rector that Maruscha is playing Determes because it wants to end this life. I recommend watching this movie, special young and mother to learn something from this picture. With this movie you can compare from orange to a movie soldier or any real story in WW2.
