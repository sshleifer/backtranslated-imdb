I have seen many big films, but 'Ind Cold Blood' is standing in the class itself. It excels in every section These are some large stars that push upwards because you focus on letters and their stories instead of the character's name. Black and Wilson launched the cable performance of the killer duo. In fact, most of the films that took place in crime were filmed, even adding extra chill inside the house. Black / white photography mood darkens and photography is magnificent. There are many extraordinary cinematic works, but if I can only vote in the top of the list, then perhaps it may be "cold blood".
