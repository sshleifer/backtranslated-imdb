The movie began to sunny in 15 seconds and it continued throughout the film. I can not remember a scene where people were not laughing at me. He is the perfect actor for this role and the way he looks and how he was dressing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Comedic parts were great to see from very large or popular actors. You see people like this movie, it's currently rated 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be between 250. I have not seen this funny picture since the American Pie or the original holiday. See if you want a smile. I will give this movie the highest gesture 2, which I learned about IMDB, great movie site.
