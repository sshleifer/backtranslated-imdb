A film saying depression is not a bad thing. A point is made and if I certainly have one I'm willing to see a depressing film. A man and his family in China often have a frustrating story, because they suffer from trouble and lots of other years experience. But, you must be careful that it can be about the most depressed movie that came out of Hollywood in the 1930s - because the peasants of China wanted to say the least. Be prepared to see sections about famine, death and disease. <br /> <br /> The only negative extreme sadness in 1971 is that of Paul Muni. Although he was a talented genius, it is always Hollywood that allows the people of European descent to play Asian Lead in this era. If you pay attention, it is very clear that Muni is wrong for the part.
