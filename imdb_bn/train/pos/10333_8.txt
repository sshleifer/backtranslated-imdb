It was a wonderful little American promotional film that is very creative and both openly disclose the Nazi outrage before the release of death camps. In the end of 1944 and in 1945, they will reveal how bad and horrific it is, in contrast to other Hollywood movies, this era of Nazi outrage, the most cruel honest movie ever seen. The film starts in the beginning of a court in the future - after the war ended (the movie was created in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fabulous world court, a Nazi leader is trying for war crimes. Wilhelm Gray is completely unexpected and a witness has been called to reveal the life of Grim since 1919. Initially, it appears that this movie would be sympathetic or explain how the Grim was pushed to join Nazim. However, after a while, it became very clear that Grim is just the evil monster. These episodes are amazingly done and certainly hold your interest and think the film is less like a part of the promotion but a legitimate drama. Finally <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Star second-level actors. There are many compulsory scenes and performances - especially towards the marginalized Jewish erosion scene that can not help you but bring you to tears. It was also interesting that there were so many super-creative scenes in the same point of the movie that you used crosses without first targeting you. Overall, it will be seen for lovers of history and anyone who wants to see a better movie. FYI - This is not a serious criticism of the film, but "the paper hangers" that Hitler has to say. This is a reference to the killings that Hitler once used to earn money making wallpapers. This is not really true - previously he was a "hungry artist", a homeless man and well served in the German army of WWI. A horrible person, yes, but not a paper hanger!
