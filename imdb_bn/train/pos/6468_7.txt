This is a pretty fine film ... yes partly hair and exceptionally convenient, and the movie does not justify big stars (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor that really influenced me here Kay Kay Menon (who will not be confused with the singer). Where he first fills Amitabh's character, I thought that a person who can only watch AB, walk around and not say a word and can still look strong, of course a good actor. In fact, he proved himself worthy again for the government as well as AB, for the second time. This man will achieve more role, he is brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you read any other review on IMDB, then you already know about this plot, and I agree that Akshay Khanna's entry in Pakistan was a little easier. And the little love angle shared with "what his face" was completely unnecessary. But he is a fairly good actor (as seen on DCA), Sujjoy Datta always looks nice. And AB ... what can I say? I do not know whether I am the world's biggest fan, but I know clearly I can compete for the spot. <br /> <br /> An interesting watch considering Bollywood, though "The Great Account" inspired by the old age of Hollywood and "on the banks of the Koi River".
