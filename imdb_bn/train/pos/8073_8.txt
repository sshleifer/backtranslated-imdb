A traitor is an extraordinary portrait (Victor McLaglen in Oscar winner's performance) who is hounded by his conscience. McLaglen played the IRA Rouge who betrayed his leader for the award during the Sindh FÃ¼hn rebellion in Ireland. The scene shown in fights and crowd action is very realistic, focusing on frustration among people. Lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford has created a stylish and intense atmosphere, which is enhanced by foggy and scary illustrations of Irish landscapes. Max Stannery added dramatic music score cinematic delight. Oscar winner for best picture, nominated for best picture. This is the classic one of Hollywood.
