I was very interested in this photo. Let me guess it before it ends. I saw that one of the best movies about the partition. Urmila Matandkar is very nice. This is one of the most personal and down-to-earth movies I've seen on this partition. It's a little less mainstream than Gauder, and a truly emotional roller coaster where you start with an opinion about what's going on and get out completely on one another. It is not usually a Bollywood rental, but an art-house type film. The best part of this movie is that it does not boast part of the contradiction of partition while focusing on another story. It does not blame or conceive, but rather lets you draw your own decisions about things.
