I read a small ad in some horror magazines in the nineties about Levi des totes (love for the dead) or something similar. Of course my curiosity has risen so I ordered the injunction 1 and 2 and Dar Tudsing (death king). Uncertainty movies are okay, even if they are intriguing and unique in their perspective in Nicarpilia, even if they are intense to fear the mind of the audience, they are, of course, very awful entries.) <Br /> <br /> Todsink, on the other hand, in my opinion , One of the best films ever made. It is a sequence of scenes that depict many aspects of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a reliever, death as a very harmful distortion of the body of death. A metaphor for the film's life. It shows how fragile life and how much our life is. It reduces its viewers to kids (we) really. Actually we do not understand the nature of death, and therefore not the process of death, it is the original message of the film. This is a most realistic film. Budgetary tried to hide the death behind the white rose or whatever. No moral values ​​set you up, death is inevitable, and soon or later a fiction but your reality will not be. This is applicable to you, Dear Reader, It is applicable to movie viewers. Some teen critics do not understand this thing, which is totally forgiving, because of course they will live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is no exploitation film. Why? Because death does not absorb us humans. It's our harvests We grow for seven days, then our previous birth is brought back to Scopenhaueria, which is death. The bourgeoiste gives us its version of the oldest stories. It is up to you whether you want to consider it as "hopeful" or "selfless". At first glance it may seem too dark. Remember that something else will die for living. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I believe that the budget shows the body when they are consumed by maggots, it does not only show isolation, but also shows new life reproduction. Does it not like to die and give life to maggots and birds and eventually become dead in living dead zombies, which is one of the favorite pets of animals? <br /> <br /> You see Dr. Tadcucking in his right perspective. <br /> <br /> Death of Sieben Taz hat Watch, Siennaen Letz Steunden. Seven weeks are weeks (weak, vivacious!), Last hour seven times. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of silver, budgetary tells us, because the silver is only ripe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Seventh Seal "in depth and universality)
