This picture may be really bad, but it's a lot of fun. Bad acting and poor direction enhance the hystericalness of the film. Their Conanesque role in pairs is very interesting. If you go to this movie you will hate it first than the Canaan or Excl. If you look at it in good mood and take it as well, fun to have fun you will get a good time. Watch for the scene where they are trying to hang the brothers, this is the most interesting scene in the film. I wish to have science science theater 3000 mysteries !!
