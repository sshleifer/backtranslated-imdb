What I like about Stone Engels' on-screen adaptation is so true for the novel! Great movie! As a warm reader, I find the worst thing about film adaptation that the book is lost in translation somehow. You were careful not to let Stone Engel team do this with this movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < However, I think the Canadian actress (Christine Horni) has been selected to play Hagar in her younger years, she has done extraordinary work which is very much appreciated. I did not see Horn's previous work but I will find out when I see Stone Angel's performance. <br /> <br /> I heard that the Canadian Theatrical release of Stone Angel will occur in Spring or in the summer. 2008 I can not wait to see again on the big screen!
