I watched The Babysitter as part of the BCI Eclipse Drive in Kult Classics (featuring Crown International Picture Relations) in DVD. I think this is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie packs many stories in a very short time. Your Hippie, Rock Music, Bike, Lesbian, Sexual Inconvenience, Blackmail, and Kill, All in One! <br /> <br /> The main actor did a credible job. And, I think the intricate plot is complicated and attractive. <br /> <br /> However, supporting cast, mainly bikes, provides a steady performance, especially when asked to supply more lines than few words. Perhaps they used the real bikers instead of the actors. Especially a couple of letters were especially trustworthy. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I found a real behavior in music. In the opening credits, I saw that the film has included the song "Food", I made them Google; However, no one could find ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br>> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> trials and fatigue; And, a little help - of course) he wrote, created and actress and "Weekend with The Babysitter".
