After almost 30 years, I think this original PBS film is almost helplessly flexible. Occasionally, I check here at IMDB that there is a good sense of buying someone's rights and keeping it in DVD. This is September 2004, and I hope - deep breaths. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < On the other hand, Frances Lee McCain has played a small role here and there for a few years. But they did not do anything before or shortly after matching this little movie, as I thought, a short PBS series that shows the main screen of new and up-to-date plays. <br /> <br /> I saw it every time PBS was shown every 2 or 3 times. That was before the era of VCR, so I have no record except my mind's eye. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 Added above: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful film is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that the DVD is burned from the author's personal copy.
