This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I saw this movie for the first time in a week, since I see the opening every day, and every time I feel excited when I heard David Nivene singing the words of Sir Walter Raleigh's Pilgrim's words: <br /> <br /> Give me my scalp shell, My staff of faith walk, walk my way to happiness, immortal food, my bottle of salvation, my gown of glory, true hope The gauge; And this way I will take my pilgrimage (<br />) <br /> <br /> Why do you think that Michael Powell and Emeric Pressbuger feel completely justified for this wonderful design of life? Because they had already been admitted to the jurisdiction of the poets before making this movie. <br /> <br /> I see both of them facing trial in the daytime and say proudly in the name of God: I want your pardon, sir. So, do you want to know what we did during our lifetime? Well, you'll see: We've guessed and created: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blim, Red Juice ?? Do you think so sir? It is obvious that these two great artists have already performed their duties with God, nature's mind, or you can call anyone when they shot a matter of life and death. Although it is not clear to everyone that life of other people can be justified for their actions, I did not have any meaning in my life that I could not do anything else to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, old timers will be tempted to say: they do not do such a movie. They will be partial mistakes; They did not make such a movie as before. <br /> <br /> I have already quoted Kit, but I will repeat it: Beauty is always a pleasure for eternity.
