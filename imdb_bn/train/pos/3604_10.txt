I think this is a great movie. Because you see how Diana lives in the house. He got so much aggression, and he wants to prove that girls can also fight. I think he and Adrian were great actors. Because of this movie I'm also boxing M. It really affected me. I think the only negative part is the negative part. Ends. Because it's okay between Diana and Adrian. But how do you see it at home? And I really do not like how you're doing his dad's job and his brother does not see it. But I think it was a great movie and I think I'm going to see more :) I recommend it to anyone, even when you do not like boxing, you can see much more than boxing. I had a great time watching it.
