Since I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg as an actor, it made me more anxious to test this flick. I think he interviewed "Jay Leno" and said that he played a role in the big budget Adam Sandler comedy "The Longest Year" in this movie. So obviously, Snoop was an active mission that he has played the chaos. I'm not going to overpraise Snoop for her performance "Mercenary." Must have a good rapper / actor like Moses Def, who could do more with his role. But the point Snoop did a "good" job. He does not seem to shake some of his trademark body movement and voice inflections, but Jack Nicholson has a problem doing something that is even something. The point I consider him as a believer in the role, and impressive tension in him and Dylan McDormot. McDermott, however, gives the best performance in the film, though his subtle performance probably will not be printed by SNUP's extraordinary performance. I could not help myself as a great reader and aspiring writer, but could find letters and make a little more intriguing plot. The character of Snoop constantly tells McDront to read his work and how it provokes me by annoying him for his criticism. But you know what? I'm sure the author is much better. His character was faulty on McDermott's own path. My only gentle criticism of the film will end. For some reason, it ran very fast for me, although this decision was certainly understood and inspired by letters instead of plot.
