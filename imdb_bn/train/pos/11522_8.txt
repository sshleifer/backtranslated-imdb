I wanted to see it for a long time, James Merino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this movie I thought that it was a great follow up later, it began to pull. Acting and direction was terrific. Actually everything in the film started flowing without the script. Occasionally, the only thing I have to keep in mind is that Claire Forlani, the world's most beautiful woman. This picture was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> PS Look for the great chemists of Chi MacBride and Chris McDonald.
