Now many "Hollywood" films have been created which are not just torture to watch, but there is no effect on the life of any person. Unbelievable, movies should not always have deep meaning, but it is very good to know that there are still filmmakers who care about telling "human" stories. I will not fall in love with this brilliant film, but screenplay is certainly one of the most complex and memorable aspects of my life, and I am 32 years old! The bug got the top ten places on my favorite list, including: Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, just a few names. This "moving" movie should be one of your favorites - that is, if you have a heart!
