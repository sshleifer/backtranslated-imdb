Charles Boyer (Louis Denard) never appeared in a movie with Loren Baakl (Rose Coolen) and enjoyed his wonderful acting together. Even Peter Lorr (Contreras) had a role in this film and there was a bad reason for his bathrooms, which made him frustrated. This story speaks to a Republican courier, Louis Dernard who travels to England during the Spanish Civil War and tries to disrupt the coal mining agreement which can cause great damage to other nations. Lauren Buckle, (Rose Coolen), brought him with the help of Louise Downer and fell in love with him at the same time, and then he helped run away from the anger of those who threatened him from the wrath of English mine workers. The real bad guy Victor Frannsen, (Likata) "The Five Fingers" who gave amazing performance in this movie. Great classic 1945 film without Hamfrey Bogart.
