I heard people who say this movie is idle dull. I do not think they are watching the right movie. It's not a prototypical action movie, thank God. <br /> <br /> It is about human beings' psychological drama about ruku and his mentor that only happens to kill people. In this way it works very well, there is Birenjara and Jane (who does not snooze in other movies like the movie - she actually seems to be acting). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the action at the end - most of it was not very sensible and was dissatisfied with the rest of the film making. But seeing Jane's face, he feared, Berendor's dirty work.
