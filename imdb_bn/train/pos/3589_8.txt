I enjoyed this movie, and after seeing it, it surprised me how many 'Night Day' is available on the world. How have been victims of this kind of sexual abuse and how much pain and pain caused by classmates? Open up their mouth about it? How young people can be dangerous and cruel to each other, because this film shows that who is right, is not the most important, it is popular and fearful, which uses the minds of young people, and such immorality can happen. Tiffany Amber Thesensen gives a strong performance as a victim of rape and Brian Austin Green believes that the girl who loves her is scattered among her, and her best friend It's a kind of movie that does not get the exposure, and it's great to have a bright, TV made film.
