I will talk about the matters of film here quickly: it was a very interesting story about the destructive attributes of all the ingested feelings; A young Italian woman can not engage in emotionally with her fundamentalist fundamentalist motherhood (in her part due to her miraculous attitude and selfish attitude of living) she has found comfort and passion for a new young boyfriend whom she explicitly raises with sex . The anxiety, anger, tenderness and feelings surrounding the atmosphere of the story are equally peaceful, which can embrace two gulfs. It gives the film a restless mentality that enters the audience through one of the most lost political conflicts (unless there is no deep knowledge of Italian politics in the 80's). I think the movie is attractive ... how it has been destroyed is a somewhat surprising oral sex scene that performs on the leadership of the male leadership ... it is not emulated and leaves fantasy a little. There are scenes of other scenes in the film, which I think is because they outline crazyness and loneliness among crazy people. But the verbal sex scene, I think, draws attention to the real story. It was a smooth sailing up to that point and once a notorious sex scene was shown (which came back to Hupla in his day), it was like hurting a roadblock. It's awake and unnecessary and I'm in camps that believe the scene is removed but the film will not be damaged. And unfortunately, this particular scene can prevent people from seeing this curiosity, which I believe is appropriate for philosophy because the levels of the satellites, emotions and more noise levels are running so low. <br /> <br /> Overall: Awesome movie is interrupted by much more essential sexual scenes.
