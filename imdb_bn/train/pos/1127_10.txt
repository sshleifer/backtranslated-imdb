He initially opposed, but came closer, and cheated his wife to bring Clitmestra to the Greek camp, to marry Achilles's best marriage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Climenist and Efigenia came, sacrificing the gods for sacrifice and vengeance, and anger. Meanwhile, proud Achilles discovered that his name was used in this fraudulent, insulting way. He went up a hill to tell Ephesians that he would protect her. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Shot: They worry about their fate and human weaknesses who deceive their loved ones and wish for war. Suddenly, they are looking at each other, for a moment, we both feel their strength and beauty, and unstable - except cameras - other times of adultery, in some other place, they may love each other and get married.
