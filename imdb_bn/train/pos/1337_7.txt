......... And you steal the thieves silently. Do not make me wrong, this movie is far less clear than beautiful women (or even not), but this (Bollywood) was a new topic. Although the subject is taken, it is far from Gizm, Marade and Julie. To speak the truth, the matter is very clearly presented. But the number of the plot is this number. At the beginning of the film, it is very much represented in "filming" way. There are some very small plot holes. When the queen is in her abortion, the movie comes up where you think you are seeing something other than a normal movie. Otherwise the whole family felt overdone at the beginning of the sequence. The acting could not have been any better. Sometimes Salman Khan is fascinated, and sometimes gives you down. Here he gave one of the best performances. His role was so well written on him that every time he praised for solving any problem. Rani Mukherjee was enough. Throughout the film, you feel most loved for his character, but he is spread by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta Pictures are perfect. Out of three, he gives a run for their money. It's wonderful how he could be as believable when he was innocent. And believe me, Madhubala is far away from your daughter. One reason why this role is because of its high rate of this role. Supporting Cast is like a family seen in HHK, where their plot has no significance, but I think they are tolerant here. The song is quite beautiful Title song is my favorite friend, my heart (heart). Mehedi Mehdi (Hena) and Vakhan Ne (look at the World's Site) two songs which are perfectly suitable for the film. The number of Preeti cabet, Diwani diwani (crazy), became smaller, though Punjabi No. 1 got better dance while being boring. Otherwise the movie certainly is a clock value.
