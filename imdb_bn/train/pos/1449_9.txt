It was one of the best crime-drama films in the late 1990's. It was a great cast, a powerful story, and many players involved were filled with great performances. The passino was great; She should be nominated for some. John Cusack was very good, as long as the visitors do not remember the visitors his Louuu-Sienna accent. If you can not stand this dialect he might come off as annoying. The character of Passino was as trustworthy, dramatic, and very playful as conversations with Cusack's character. Danny Aiello was always as pretty. David Petma was a helpful role in the role. Bridget Fonda was not good but memorable. This image is probably mentioned in many letters, there was a lot of time. Remember to be seen second, "What was the occupation?" After a lot of cross-references, only to be stopped and to be remembered. The last sting does not have much. It was built for so long and then there was a bit dot. There was one of the few problems with this film. Since the movie "Big, Blockbuster" has not been billed as the Big Screen Hit, it has forgotten some people that this movie was also present. Passino and ILO were great, but there could be no nomination for the lack of "splash" of the theater in the theater. It was semi-successful in the House Market, and visitors are still learning that the title is there. Created in 1996, it still stands and will be popular for many years to come. So, some lime pudding yourself (you will see) and watch this movie!
