Yesterday I saw this picture in DVD and was gob-smacked and flabberstadt. The unexpected performance of DDL has just blurred my mind, and I was surprised by the whole cast and his extraordinary performance. All the characters were so genuine to me, I really took DDL for Christie Barnes and Brenda Fricker for her mother. Go and see! You cry out your heart, but you will get a wonderful catharsis experience! Besides, it teaches you an important lesson: fix everything. You can be a lame on the poor coast of Dublin, but you will not have any problems when you have enough heads. If you can only manage your left foot, you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer. The worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self-sorrow. You will not find it anywhere, and only one who blames you will be yourself.
