Pickup at South Street (1953), directed by movie maker Michael Fuller, is a stunning opening that causes a double complexity. Subway Ryder Candy (Susan Peters) in collision with Piccott Skock MacKay (Richard Wyommark Sinatra sinks in cool shades). He is aware that he carries priceless microfilm; Maccro is unaware of grifting it. Both are aware of being seen by two federal agents. Thus Gift sets the degree of knowledge of motion. The candy can be doubled (avoid and policeman) and so doubly naive; Avoid, overconfident small thieves, unaware, trailed by the federal agent; Feds, all cute, are finally helpless. They can not stop the "secretive" or the spread of communism in government confidentiality.
