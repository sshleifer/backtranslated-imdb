I was quite sure to expect what to do with this one, outside of the same identical positive reviews. Launched, I could never imagine this movie, because it is very close to the "White Hair Bride" very unexpected and excellent dealings. It's a furce, a comedy, and just plain walking a fine line in the story of old fashioned Scratch. There is nothing scary about it, it is not a theme, it is actually the most romantic story that deals with an intelligent man, who faces a beautiful ghost, who has many problems with other ghosts. So the main theme people are trying to save the beautiful ghosts. It is performed with wild bunny Kung Fu exhibition in ancient China, and a trip to hell (more or less). Stop-action ghosts are some of the coolest, and visual effects, top rate overall. I could see this trend in Chinese movies all day because they were very entertaining, great scenes and most of the tongue-cheeks And I'm looking forward to seeing this movie's first sigell. Highly recommended.
