Robot Jokes tries hard, but fundamentally combines a series of battle scenes - robots against robots, men against men, men against women It was possible on the premises, but the script seems to have not been given any more drafts required. Still, it was fairly good for a science fiction action movie. Part of it was because the script of Haliman was script. Helmman's award winning science fiction novel "The forward war" is not known to anyone who is not familiar with this name. It is also one of the best-released War Armor novels with Robert Heinlen's "Starshipplayers" and John Stackley's "Armor" Wright. And this movie is more like a giant-propelled war shell instead of giant robots. Paul Werhoven's "Starships Trupers", which was even closer to what the fans wanted, was based on the novel that only had a similar duplication. <br /> <br /> Despite some estimates, it is actually based on Homer's "Eliad." A couple of names they were all common. Eliad had no parallel with the feet of Achilles' robot feet, in which Achilles died. The ancient Achilles was a noble warrior. He is powerful, but retro and small Even in the first scene, robots do not die. He was called the Hercules, when the Greek Eliad was in the Heracre. <br /> <br /> The effects for this time and budget were great. True, this was not comparable with "Terminator 2" a year later, but that movie costs ten times more. The stop motion was almost as good as the Robotics Walker of "The Empire Strike Back" and "JD Return". In fact, Ray Harahiasson Animation is much more, which is highly respected, but better than a date. <br /> <br /> Do not get high expectations in it and you probably will not be disappointed. It's much less budget flicks and even some big budget blockbuster wannabes which have good effects but are much better than many bad scripts.
