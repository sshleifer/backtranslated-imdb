So far you've probably heard a little about Miyazaki's classic film, Laputa: Castle in the Sky's new Disney Dobby. In the summer of late 1998, Disney posted "Delivery of Qiki" on video, which included previews for the Laputa dub preview "1999". It's obviously the last way in that year, but the end is the end of the dub. And this is not "Laputa: Castle in the Sky", only "Casal in the Sky" for Dab, since Laputa is not such a nice word in Spanish (though they use the loop many times throughout the whole year). Perhaps you have heard that renowned musician Joe Hesayashi, who originally created the movie, has returned to rearrange the beautiful music with the new system. Laputa came in front of Neetu Taboro in front of my Nebo and the valley of the valley, which started studying the goblin and had long long hits. And in my opinion, I think this is one of Miyazaki's best movies, it's a powerful lesson in this two hours and four minutes. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a film for all ages and I request everyone to see it. <br /> <br /> In the Sky Story, it starts at the beginning for the stranger with the Castle and it does not close the next two hours. The story is made with so brazen and skillful, you see Miazaki's true view. And believe me, it's a fantastic one. The film starts with winter, in a girl Heluuvar in the past, as she is being held captive by the government at the airport. Shaita holds the key to the castle in the sky and the long lost civilization of Laputa. The key to Laputara is a sacred thread, which is sought by many, such as government, military and air pirate group, dual gang (who later became friends with Sheta and Paju). Soon, the pirate ships attack and he escapes during the raid. She falls several thousand feet, but thanks to the fall soft and her pendant. After coming out of the sky, Paju, an orphan boy, who lives in the mines, sees and holds him. Two became fast friends, but thanks to his pendant, the dual gang and the government tried to catch Shia, and the two fled to a huge adventure. After one verb sequence, we learn the characters' motives and identities that we develop in emotional and actionable climax, which will surely be pleased with all its fantastic animations and wonderful conversations. Plus somewhat twisty surprise. I think this picture is amazing and hold it for two hours and four minutes. The story is astonishing, as we are at the top of the Humayun Miyazaki animation, which has no limits. Film is a combo of many duration. It appears to be on display at the end of the 1800s, but it is some of the alternative media that has advanced technology and surgery. Laputa is an amazing photo. The film is a very pleasant moment, almost theatrical, and movie-taking steps. I think the most interesting part is a war scene where the pugilist faces a pirate and soon after the rioting is over. It is interesting that we compare their strengths compared to men and the music fits perfectly with it. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about how to rate dab. To bring this character to life in a wonderful cast, give some great performance. Tina Hartthrub James van der Baker starred in Hero Pajoo, who made more mature voice in the Japanese version, where he originally felt more childish. In any way, I think it's a nice fit with his voice piz. The young Oscar winner Ana Panchen Shetty has played from "Piano". This is a wonderful performance, but the voice is a little unusual, he does not think one pronouncement is true. Occasionally he sounds as apple pie as American, but at other times he sounds like someone from New Zealand. Acting I enjoyed most, though Karim Lichman, who played Mama Dola. Not only is this an extraordinary performance, but the voice and emotion that he gives is actually bringing life to life. The laputa movie (gb forbidden) is a live action, she can play it, you can imagine her only in the role (good, some). Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamil Moosa, and it is one of Hamilton's top rated. After making original movie stars, you can get acquainted with Hamil with long voice work, but he presented Musa for the complete evil. His voice sounds like a mix of his regular voice and junker, who has played for many episodes of Animated Batman series. Cast out voice cast actor Jim Cummins, who has done great work as a member of Dollar's gang and has done great work like Andy Dick and Mandy Patkin. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about what I'm doing, specially this dub specializing in Jozee's new song! For those who have never heard of him, Mr. Haiyashi performs music and like all the movies of Miyazaki, the music is very memorable. Each of his scores has his own personality that perfectly fits the special film. Now, he has arranged this new "good American", which I think was the goal of the new recording. Do not worry, the classic tunes of the Japanese version are still great. My score, a sound sorted like this, is a blockbuster Hollywood blockbuster. It has more power, it emphasizes more, it's clean and deep. The film's suggestion, the first century where we introduced the airship, has some new music (I'm not sure, but I believe when the ships first saw no music). But most of the music can enjoy new backdrop and more background music. Things seem to be very advanced. In a strong view, the music in the original version is more powerful. A cool scene, it's more calm Overall, I think you'll be pleased with many new mixing mixes, I've done the work myself and personally think it helps improve the film. I like the old scores, and I hope Disney will publish music rights for a complete leakage soundtrack or license. <br /> <br /> Another plus side of Dub is that the story remains faithful and many original Japanese lines are intact. On the kicks, I'm sure some lines have changed, and in the same way, the lines have changed. But most of the intimate or just the original line and dialogue Miyazaki wrote. I was afraid some nice lines would be butchered, but they were intact. Some new lines have been added which have been assisted as well. But I'm not sure whether it should be considered a good thing or bad thing, Disney did not translate the last song to Died, it was in Japan. I died while singing a complete new song for Kiki Dob, but with this version it is the original song ... in Japanese language. So I think it's still good, but bad as most people see this spoken in English. <br /> <br /> There is a bigger side under this dob and its voice matches the voice of the character. Of course, it will not be perfect in a debut, but I think that Qiki and Manoo were executed better than dubbing the match line (and it was a little bit longer with Disney ...). Some time is meticulously combined, some time it does not match completely, and in a rare case, someone says something and the lips are not removed completely (there is a scene where the cold chocolate and his face move one bit to the other). <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, this is my thought. I thought Laputara was the most amazing part of the animation. From the beginning sequence to the end, the animation is so colorful and detailed, you will only see in fear. You see the true nature of each character, their character with extreme close-up and action. These animations will give you a ton credit for attempts to join this movie. Everything is so well done and pulled beautiful hands, it's like a moving piece of art. And it seems, this was done in the mid-1980's. Animation is quite different from Disney, Gibli's own unique flare is very different, but very good. And after all these years, the colors look like vibrant beforehand. Lappas also have tons of action sequences, a few of the plain dogfights plus plenty of ground. These sequences have done so well and are so curious, it is scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film. And the end is just something you will see. Sound effects are pure and classic and appropriate explosions, good guns and good all the other well. And like all Miyazaki movies, each one monitors a different theme (e.g. Qiqi: Confidence). This one has a great lesson on greed and power. People do not realize how much greed they can take on you and how good it is not to gain too much power. People are overwhelmed with power, and greedy, and the main villian, smile, this looks broadly. <br /> <br /> All, Laputa: Castle In The Sky With a great movie starting, and now developed for the most part. I'm happy to have a chance to see this classic animated film in a mainstream audience now in this glory. With the great renewal of Joe Hesachia's music revolutions, along with a lot of voice cast in the film, Disney has done a great job in challenging this and is quite deserving. The sounds combined with the face of Disney Dibbs for Kiki and Princess Manoow, although Castle in the Sky is still a great dub and it's a long-delayed reason why it can carry a superb movie now.
