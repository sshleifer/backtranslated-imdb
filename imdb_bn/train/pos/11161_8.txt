This is a very funny movie! I have no idea if it translates well into other languages ​​or not. However, I think men in the world can recognize "Frank" and his thoughts somewhat! These ideas are very interesting and women will enjoy this movie too! <br /> <br /> All cast members perform well, and if this movie is made in England then it can be a great hit all over the world. Or the United States But for those who are lucky enough to understand Swedish, you are for a treat! <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
