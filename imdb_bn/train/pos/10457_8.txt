Campi forgot 'religious' films which exchanged the television / movie market ... This film is a real feeling. Although it can be regarded as a movie that has comfortably interesting draws, it also has forgiveness and overall good ethics. However, I do not like the light of this movie ... for a movie related to the subject matter, it was very bright. I think it has moved away from the overall appeal of the movie, which is almost unsupported sin, but the accredited cast, and their performance reflects this surveillance. <br /> <br /> DVDs are certainly valuable to buy.
