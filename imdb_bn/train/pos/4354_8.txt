At the Palm Springs International Festival of 2005, I saw this picture again and I saw 14 movies there, I'll rank it # 4. The 900+ theater was full and eventually it got a lasting encouragement. This was the classic Peter Folk if you are a False fan and show a lot chemistry between the letters of Peter Fow and Paul Reisier. The title of the film seems to me long and very weird. I did not make it into this general release amazed. Due to throwing the main studios to you, it is much better than most junk. Probably very old that it was geared to baby boomer and senior audience. Many people may be related to the situation in this movie. It probably looks at this film and it will be revived for years after considering it a gem. I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a 10 scale and definitely recommend it.
