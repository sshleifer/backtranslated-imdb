My left foot is an epic extraordinary movie, which explains Christie Brown's life and time, whose brain was a rural, had a serious disability, and her left foot was only used, but she was barbaric, she became an artist and writer. <br /> <br /> I have seen this picture many times and every time I saw it, I can see it flawlessly every time. I'm surprised how this awesome movie won an Oscar for the best picture? Academy Awards are a shambles by. Jim Sharda is one of the best directors in the world. Screenplay, music and anything else is great in this movie. If the film is going on, you will feel yourself in brown family when everything happens. Mac Alley and Brenda Frickrich Christis parents and Fiano Shaw Die Ilinen is equally bright in the lap, which helps in the fight of Christ's opponent. </ br> <br /> The Irish film industry has mentioned a lot more to me in front of my left foot. My left foot is an amazing time of Irish film. So powerful and bright movies like the field, crying game, father's name and Michael Collins follow my left foot. These Irish films were highly rated around the world and were nominated for multiple Oscars and won a few, time for the wonderful Irish movie. My left foot is a powerful outstanding movie. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Levies played Cristiano Brown very well and brilliantly, and at the same time he plays with Hui and Connna young Christian. The performance of both of these two performance of my performance, especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, which I consider as lioness silence is high like Antony Hopkins. Daniel Day-Lewis has proved in his career that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful composition in the movie, see!
