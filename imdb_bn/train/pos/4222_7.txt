I like this episode quite a bit, if Roth Gordon is not always a little hammy, he's good. As it has been said, the music is very good, and it is a mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But there is a main plot hole, so you can carry a truck carrying it. It is established that the light vault does not work. Do not you think that the very intelligent Colombo or the rest of the police think about checking whether the lamp works in the chest? If you think the very short order they will unscrewed the bulb and so the notes were not found. This TV has been conceived suddenly, and various holes can be found, but it seems very shining. <br /> <br /> It does not work in light when it does not consider Colombo to be a hidden talent, but "bed of death" becomes visually obscure for the testimony day.
