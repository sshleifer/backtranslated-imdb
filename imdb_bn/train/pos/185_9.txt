I finally bought and added a copy of "Show copy" to my collection. I can not comment any more than what the previous audience said, and I can not comment on the character, plot and overall quality of the word without repeating their own words. To see the camio, the presence of MGM silent stars outside of themselves is worth seeing and valuable. I really like the scene where Marion Davis plays himself and plays Patricia Pepper's main character herself. When Marin Davis sees what he says he does not have a title card, but "I do not like him!" Ready to go back to three-quarters of a century in the history of soil pop, tape pop and movie making.
