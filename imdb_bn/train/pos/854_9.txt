"Margarette and cock ..." <br /> <br /> This great entertainer movie keeps you from the opening scene and does not provide smiles, surprises, and unexpected moments to touch. I've had more fun than watching "The Matador" compared to almost any other film since 2005. It is an incredible film with an unforgettable character, which has been fulfilled by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Jalian Nobel (Brisson) is a beneficiary (hit-man) who specializes in high-end corporate gigs (the killing of rich dwarfs). She is facing something like a mid-life crisis. He realizes that he has no true friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stabilizes the Mexican hotel one night and goes to Danny Wright (Kinnar). <br /> <br /> <br /> Danny is a down-to-the-lucky family who is on the verge of losing the big business deal, which can only turn things up for him. He loved his wife very much, especially so few years ago he lost his little boy. <br /> <br /> Two people chalk and cheese, they are less common than the same solitary bar. The night And in any way a conversation strikes that makes a chain of events dynamic that will change their life forever. <br /> <br /> The friendship that they created reminded me a lot and Hardy reminded me. One straight man and the other is a steady fool who gets in trouble. Interplay has been nicely tuned in time and has been tuned in, in some parts of the amazing performance of Brojan and Kieran <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not make a mistake ... it's a picture of a brochure. He draws one of the most memorable and frustrating characters of a decade. She shoots your mother and then apologizes immediately and you can probably forgive her. Brooding Cinema can be the ultimate charming, but this may be his most favorite and complete performance date. I would not turn against the Oscars for this role. <br /> <br /> Consider a scene where he summoned a high school girl with ambitious thinking and pronounced the line, "All blues bluesy .. no sucky fucky". She made it with known bond smirk and managed to get away with it. She manages to tell a young boy, "Tell your mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years, then go back to me" Actually, it likes us more. <br /> <br /> This picture makes us really amazed with some tangible scenes, most of which comes to the end when the film takes some unpredictable shape. However, when Julian gets to find someone on his birthday on his birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console each other in their bedroom one night, the picture reaches deep emotional depth unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> "Matador" is stylish and energetic. It is constantly entertaining. And the carrier-determining role for brochures is naturality, friendship and as the only hit-man to find at least one good thing in his life. It is a neglected gem in 2005 and should try to watch this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
