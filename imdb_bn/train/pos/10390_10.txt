Next to "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz", it is one of the greatest fantasy films of all time. It is a real shame that it is not known as the former movies (perhaps it takes a story based on a legend rather than contemporary or scientific-fee settings and that is British, which means small market for films) but it is amazing <br /> <br /> To enjoy the image, there may be a child, an adult, or even a teenager (I am currently 18 years old), but one must surely be grateful The first classic movie. I absolutely worship this film. It has an extraordinary music score by Miklos Rojasa (probably my favorite classic film score), which is no rivalry for any William Williams "Star Wars" score, faster, but dazzling speed, beautiful set, dialogue and color use (both sets and cinematography won Oscars) , And extraordinary Oscars-winning special effects (for some time and some still stunning). And of course, June Duprez's colonists, like the royal opponent Catherine Zeta-Jones (she looks like Jones, too!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Favorite movies (beside "Adventures of Robin Hood") and it really deserves more attention. This is a wonderful adventure along with "Robin Hood", and it was my desert island movie which I could not get bothered repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (Excellent)
