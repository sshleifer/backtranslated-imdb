Another strong chick flush. This time, it's turning around Diana Gusman, who is always beaten up in school. Instead of being expelled, he took his anger away from the box of boxing. He train to be a boxer and there he met featherweight Adrian and started to fall in love with him. This movie has a powerful message to take and share with your dreams even if no one trusts you (in this case, his father does not believe in him). That alone makes the movie worth the price. Enjoy
