After Chicago, I started losing all my respect for Richard Gere and then came Flock. Just have a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you, but he has proven that he has finally retained his craft and can work with the best of them. Claire Dance was super as her "training / replacement". Someone suggested that there was too much unnecessary violence, but I did not see it. I have not seen anything from the power of this movie. I was really disappointed that I did not hear the release of the theater and I came across it in Blockbuster. Actually an exceptional film with the correct blend of action, mystery, thriller, and social consciousness. 7even as well? Well maybe And you'll see better acting than anyone ever earned from Peter.
