I saw this picture, I first saw it at the age of 7 and could remember it eventually. So I saw it, 10 minutes ago, and (I can feel like a baby as 12 hectares) I finally started crying, I forgot how tragic it is. I think I was sorry for Anne-Mary mainly because she said: 'I love you Charlie' and more: 'I'll miss you Charlie', just crying to me really. It will always be one of my favorite movies, it's only worth the price of watching a movie. Watch IT Hah, I can say XD <br /> <br /> <br /> I love this picture, it's a real classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
