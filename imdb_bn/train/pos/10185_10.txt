I was in the movie watching this movie very often. However, I can not say that this is a good or bad movie, because these simple qualifications can not be applied only. This image can be in any movie. It has a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical instrument, and an illogical self-aware industrial film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Visit the husband's parents after a boring news report. The rest of the story is held in India, where couples find themselves in the plot of suicide violence. At one point, the story stops "my child without a note", but it would be unfair to rebuild a thing to call power. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai has a dream with Shahrukh Khan, who is out of the movie. Comes. Indeed, two stars are on all posters, but they look really late in movies, and only Shah Rukh ends up as a real character. Yet he has created it with an encouraging and genuinely unexpected performance. <br /> <br /> One of Karishma Kapoor's most work in this movie, and she did a commendable job to link film twists. And active with a show of credible emotions. Another notable presence is Nan Paktekar, who played Husband Sheikh's tortured father, Narasima. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Occasionally, this violence is clearly annoying but ultimately it is highly transformed because every dramatic sequence usually follows such a ridiculous and spectacular curve which is nothing but the overall impact. <br /> <br /> I saw a part of Bollywood release, and the blend of style and incredible plot resolution is certainly their norm. But the "power" became ridiculous even raised times by absorbing a larger spice. It is a movie that achieved the greatness of Shakespeare's tragedy, where Rabble and Royalty were equally entertained by the audience. It's a good time dream by throwing into every trick in the book of Pure, Unreal Movie, and director Krishna Vamasi. Most likely, the violence of all violence was not the thought of violence and inspirational feelings of mother language, but I came to enjoy the "power". Making movies can be the most fun in the world!
