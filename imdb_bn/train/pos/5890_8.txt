'Italian' is one of the greatest or greatest films of 1915 which are available today. The feature-length film of the year, especially in America: Louis Weber's 'Hippocryts', Cecil B Demil's 'Chit' and of course, D. D. Griffith has set a new map for the 'One born country of the birth' industry. In addition, in that year, Russian filmmaker Yevgeny Boar made his two best films 'Death Death' and 'Deadrम्स'. The French serial 'Les Vampires' still has its supporters, although I do not agree with them. The feature-length movie was headed by Europe, mainly Denmark, France and Italy, but until the authority of this market and a degree, the industry was moved across the Atlantic in 1915. <br /> <br /> 'Italian' is the most overriding artistic achievement in its stunning and often innovative cinematography. Some photos have a wedding ring with a short overhead corner shot of sunset, mobile framing, Italian racing, and the other with a shot in an ongoing car, and in general, the full light of different camera angles and expert intelligent use. Especially amazing shots have become excited by the Italians, because slowly it reached the camera for an extreme tie. Griffith's 'Mag Kets Eyes of Pig Alley' (1912). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director, though originally credited with film Except, now known as Reginald Barker. Five or more of the other films made for Ines are still available today, but it is also unchecked. 'Civilization' (1916), which he worked, is a big production, but a deep flawed movie. However, I would assume that the filmmakers who worked with 'civilization' also took 'Italian' pictures. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the whole production is very advanced. Venice and New York are well-acclaimed despite the image of Los Angeles (for romanticized Venice) and San Francisco (for New York's ethnic objects). Although there are extensive flashbacks, perhaps one or two more. I particularly liked the glamorous framing of narrative narrative, which reads like a starring actor George Buban, who led the inner, main story. The beginning of the story is created briefly by opening at the beginning and closes at the end of the screen cover, the theater, which reflects the interior story reflected in the child's subsequent fate, the window screen with open and closed Parallel editing, camera dissolves and irises and is operated efficiently as well. In addition, his wife Buban and Clara Williams play well in their part. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some errors in 'Italian'. The initial moments of the movie comedy collision are rather rigid and with the later sections of heavy melodrams, the natural changes of romanticized nature from New York's New York works well, because it is supported by lighting and photography. The strong American vision of this film, enhanced by strong photography, was immoral in the classes of immigrants, who were involved in a large population of population in the film. The character of Corrigan was more likely to be predicted; His short role seems to be inadequate for the next centralization of the Italian revenge for the campaign for other politicians. In addition, the filmmakers were not medicinal enough to explain the lack of breast feeding and the lack of unexpected belief of the healing power of other children's peace. As well as due to lack of plot, 'Italian' has been created exceptionally.
