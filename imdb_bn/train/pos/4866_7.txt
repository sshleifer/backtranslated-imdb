Above all, in the defense of Joan Fontaine, it must be said that Ginger Rogers had a misunderstanding like Alice, who was the British young lady who played the title role. Fontain makes a fetching picture as heroine here, but his acting inexperience looks badly and his dance left well unmentioned. Thankfully, he went to the better thing. But here it is Fred Ostier, George Burns and Gracie Allen who get top billing - and they are nice. Supporters of Barnes and Allen will be surprised how easy they fit Astaire's dance routines. Especially interesting is the big fun room routine that Korean Grammy Hermes Pans won an Oscar. Unfortunately, there is not much to say about the slow motion of the story - not something great that calls for many. Patience from visitors. It must be said that some humorous flattens and the traditional romantic misunderstandings that arise in Fred Astaire's film of this time are given conventional treatments. Just give details about musical interludes lift lift. <br /> <br /> Some happy pop-ups at the moment of Gershwin's tunes but do not get all the treatment they deserve. A Polish comic performance as the best supporting actor Reginald Gardner, along with performer Slaves, Constance Coliar and Montagu love (such as the father of Joe's father wrongly mistaken as a pastor by Astaire) at his best. <br /> <br /> This is a lighthearted romp, whenever Barnes and Allen reminds us of our radio and television days. <br /> <br /> Director George Steven has confirmed that the number of the mountain numbers of Joan Fontenay with Fred is illustrated in an intelligent distance, but the tricky cameras can not really disguise that he is out of his element as Astaire's dance partner, some are painfully aware I think.
