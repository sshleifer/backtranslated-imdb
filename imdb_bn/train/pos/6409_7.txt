Before I saw this I did not hear about Brasier. This story helped him and the person who trained him in an African-American US Navy Diver. Wisdom is a story. The plot is well written, and develops nicely. What it seems, is usually the underdog thing, and it does not have much to wonder. It's a Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the real people, maybe it's just about how it actually happened. However, this completes the task with the dramatic scenes and disasters along the way, and anyone who has heard the word "No, you can not" can not talk about their long dream of life. Performance performance is all excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. when they both shine on the screen. Rapaport is incredible, as well. Characters are well written, credible and consistent. It is well edited, and features well cinematography. The production value is high, and it turns out to be a fair believer in our transportation of 50's. This is the only movie I saw by this director and writer, although I can now consider they are more responsible for this. A moderate amount of strong language, otherwise there is no objectionable element. I suggest it interesting to anyone, and / or find fans who made it. 7/10
