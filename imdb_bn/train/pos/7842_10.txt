So half through the season, I caught my school and my activities that I did not realize that the show had been canceled halfway, which was abolished the crap. <br /> <br /> I think folks follow this show and at least ask for the end of filming so that a DVD can be released from the DVD later. Maybe they will see how many people were disappointed that the show would not survive in its first season. <br /> <br /> I like the show and look after him every Thursday after OC. When I came back, I could imagine my frustration, trying to listen and see that it disappeared? Not saying, I'm not very happy with Fox now. Even so much more is discovered after the end. I mean, if you are going to work on a project, at least look at what happens to it. Half of the illustrated show is like a half-car made, it's quite a lot of vain. Fox, great endorsement film and show supporters to give some peace.
