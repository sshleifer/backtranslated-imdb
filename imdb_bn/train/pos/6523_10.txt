Of course, the history of this movie was "Hollywoodized" - but the only bit of history that was written for the people. The jump was better than the Americans because he thought himself to be a Frenchman and therefore hated the British, or there was no sense of patriotism for the country which had adopted New Orleans a short time ago; He broke his treaty and smuggled back, which is his sailing because of Galveston; He was a hero * or * a tiny criminal and scoundrel than a swashbuckler. But who? It's a movie that's just entertaining - and in front of it, we all wanted to go for the patience rather than the foolish daughter of the governor. Brainer emerged on medieval writing to give an impressive performance again.
