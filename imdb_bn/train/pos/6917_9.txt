An Indian will sell his own soul to sell ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Go ahead to make runs. A new, emotional depth of style. This story is seen by Stuart as Lin MacAdam, who killed his father. Riding with Dosage City, his trusted friend, Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), Lin Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally), who is what he wants. But Viet Arpe {{Zia} will take all the guns from the entrepreneurs in the city, both men are ready for them that could not be shot out. Rather than win the Winchester 73 rifle, men compete in the competition, the competition that Lin finally won. But before leaving the city with a great reward, the Dutch attacked him, stole the rifle and released the city quickly. As both lynn and rifle off looking for filling hatred, the rifle will be changed many times hand, instantly adding another dimension as the day of accounting for each approach. <br /> <br /> Benchmark, Winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent guy driven by the past events to limit the madness to become known as the so-called "mental western". Shortcuts are still in the black and white {{the only one in the western part of the world}. Lone and Jonny on the horseless horse and in Silhouette, the tones were sank in the mountains on the way to Dos City. It's just the starting point that man can use his letters to use his letters as a way to go in conjunction with the mental state. <br /> <br /> One of her best and most intense performances, like Stuart Macdham, once and for all, proves that she is America's best and most versatile actor. Cast support is not too bad. Shelley Winters is the only woman in Marshallo, when Mitchell, McNally, Gear and always add more classes in the great charity court proceedings. Here are some parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, as the Indian brave players are much more expansive. <br /> <br /> This project was originally a project for Frytz Lange, even for the script to run. But Lang went away from him, which proved to be a blessing for Westerners. Great as the manager of the LAN, Man had set these wheels in motion to change the style of the genre [and Borden Chase and Robert Richard's new script]. Not only with Man and Stewart's efforts, who also influenced them. Receives all notes like Bad Bethesiar, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller, and best wishes for the West, they follow the lawsuit and lead the mental torch further. <br /> <br /> A big hit in the box office, Winchester 73 is a great movie, which still packs a punch in the modern era. 9.5 / 10
