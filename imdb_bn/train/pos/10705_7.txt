This movie does not judge the trailer movie. And when the movie was not really going to the whole film, the first half was a light romance comedy, and the second was a more serious, romantic drama, the overall effect seems to be better than me. This movie was more than a date movie, but the trailer created it like a suspense thriller that did not really happen. Kindman, one of my favorites, I certainly favor, but this movie has been proven to be light, sensitive, and some curiosity that was well deserved. Four stars out of three 9/5/02.
