There is a tremendous opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumba as we have seen in this movie - which is much more! This image is back in front of Simba and (officially) after Kia's birth. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "They're going to start watching, because Timon will take part When he and Pumbaa come and Pumba wants to go back to the beginning, they have settled to see the movie of their own story, which is waiting ... It starts with Timon's first home ... <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> Enjoy only the first movie of any age, "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
