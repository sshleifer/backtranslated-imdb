In the beginning of Peg's "Shawn of the Dead" in 2004, there were a few hits in the last few years, the "Hot Fujus 2007" film, at the beginning of 2008, came out with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now it comes "How do friends and isolated people To lose "which is one of my favorite comedies of the year in many ways. <br /> <br /> This picture is about Sydney Uddh, who wrote a failed magazine, which is most fun of celebrities because he is not one of them. However, one of the most successful magazines (played by Jeff Bridges) invites him (outside of Nostalgia) to work on his magazine. Sydney must be encouraged and moved to America, where she now fills a girl who is writing a book, and the humor occurs. <br /> <br /> This movie is great and I hope it will be better in the near future. Pegg has once again given the other good film people and I can not wait to see the third part of the "Paul" of blood and ice cream trilogy. I rate this film at 81%.
