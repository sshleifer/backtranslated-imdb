This is one of the best animated movies in my life. This is not just a fun movie, or a specific movie. It is a landmark in the animation industry and if it is not, it is the only technical expertise that went into it, it will give it a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stop-motion movies about beetle secret life. With a slight phenomenon like jobs, houses, nightclubs, movie houses, even posters and bicycles and painting, he imagined the world of insects compatible. <br /> <br /> In this film he told a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beatle has a relationship with a dancer named Dragonfly, which is very close to the character of grassroots. But he decided to shoot a cameraman and fling. Mr. Beetle returned to the country and Mrs. Beatle felt herself a matter. Mr Beetle left behind her boyfriend but she forgave his wife. Two up and go from the movie. And the movie they saw is Mr. Beatle and Dragonfly. It has been described as an outstanding sound, but once it is seen it becomes a secret work of movies. Along with Emil Kohl and Jiri Trunkka, Valentina Starvich has mostly invented all future animators everything used for their work. That's why he will not forget.
