The name just says it all. I have seen this movie with my father when it came out and served in Korea, he has great respect for it. The frustrating thing about this movie is that it only draws attention to a short period of human life - the funny thing is that the whole life of man makes so epic bio-pick that it is surprising to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> Some posters stay away from the man's faulty features, which are cheap shots. The film's "Duty, Honor, Country" movie theme is not only a tarnish word from a high-brassed officer's lips - it is a deep declaration of Almighty God of his country. <br /> <br /> Wicked Pek was lenient that he had garnered a good understanding about people. He's a great work people look terribly ordinary tempered with the human body.
