Here is a real weirdo for you It starts with another off-off of the PSYCHO Shower scene on the campus, when several cods and their Dufai boyfriends turn to the south for the spring break and become crazy. The problem starts when they drive Redneck County, ruled by hate Sheriff Dean. One of the expatriates of college goes to the forest, witnesses witness to Sheriff's murder and his head becomes open. Then it's Dean Stalks as Macon County line-type, slaughters by trap and arbitrary witness one by one. Shotgun, shotgun-happy Dean, as evil in Tony March. The movie's overall tone is really annoying. Finishing is so casual that you think the director runs around the film; It is a study of frustration. GRAVE is essential for global misanthropes, misogynists and nihilists.
