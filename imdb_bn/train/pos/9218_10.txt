First off, tell me I wanted to watch this movie for almost a year because I knew Angelina Jolie was in her and I loved her. But for me there is nothing in my opinion about my love movie. However, it does carry a video store but less and see local libraries. I saw it and absolutely loved it. Yes there were Italian stereotypes but it has been done well and fun. It was not frustrating in any way. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress did a fantastic job. I have a very funny smile on sex humor. Overall, I think if you can find it, it's good to see this movie. It's adorable and just plain fun to see. I rarely rank the movie as 10 but I give this one 10! <br /> <br /> Find it and see it!
