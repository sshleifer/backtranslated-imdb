I watched the movie and saw the trailer in the DVD, and I think that anyone who saw it before watching this movie will be very surprised and possibly frustrated. This is the movie "Director of Cuebure" and it became like a horror movie, when it was actually an unreal comedy (IMDB's spell checker does not think that a word is unreal, but it is), Rosenthal and the memorable dead of Gildernstein. <br /> <br /> I like to first slowly develop the story, then it gradually increases. I enjoy this enjoyment that there is no explanation for what happens in the film. That's basically the only drama in a set that the story is true is that this image is the same respect as the Cube. I recommend it
