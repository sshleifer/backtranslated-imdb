A movie made for contemporary viewers. People want to see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and certainly sensuous scenes as well. This is not a movie that the whole family will feel comfortable with. It's not for the eyes of children. I was ahead ahead of several scenes. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for just entertainment, then this movie has all. The songs are interesting. An extraordinary product, I must add. <br /> <br /> However, the movie message is not universal. It emphasizes the idea of ​​Karma. That is to say, if you do well then you will get good. And if you do evil, you will get evil. Good works are good fruits, evil evil fruits. <br /> <br /> In real life, it is not always true. It is well-known that most people do not get justice in this world. Although it is true that some evil people meet with the temple, so many flee away. And then there are many good people who work well, and yet they meet with the tragic end. <br /> <br /> If you do not care about this message and you want to be exempt from worldly reality, this movie is an entertainer right.
