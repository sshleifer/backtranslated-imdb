After watching the film, Walt Disney came to me in real sense of movies and I realized that it was a long time ago that I saw 'real' magic in a movie. <br /> <br /> The combination of proper music, lectures and magic effects brings Disney feeling to your body again. In the Indus, the castle started the unknown effects of the movie with the converted Disney logo and I saw special things that ended with the story of old-story tales with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> The magic came back into me. I out 8 out of this movie 8.
