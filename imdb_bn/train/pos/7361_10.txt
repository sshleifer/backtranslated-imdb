This film is usually classified as the production of the worst movies. Ever. But in my opinion it's probably funny. Awesome direction and screenplay makes this image invaluable. I bought the movie when sifting through the tender DVD at my local lb's shop. I and some friends then saw it, admitted it was rather drunk. It soon happened that it was not a normal movie. Instead of an endless adoption of James Cahill's last film. At first we were distraught and screaming for the DVD player to stop, but in our unusual circumstances no one can get annoyed with it. Instead we saw the film correctly. In the end, we soon realized that we had a dream dream, something that you could well be able to ridicule for hours, when all can cause laugh. We soon showed our other friends and they too agreed, that was not the work of unreal film. This is a movie that you can really laugh at yourself. This is a film that anyone can enjoy This was the genius.
