This movie came and went to the theater. Because of its nature, you can see why it did not get well. Compared to real movies, it was panned worse than content. Higher education is not spectacular, but it was a good film to talk about the terrible things in America: Racism / <br /> <br /> Most of the higher education is owned by the owner (operated by Omar Apex), the central perfect track star is not fast enough, And who has to deal with a harsh professor (played by Lawrence Fishburne). She is a fantastic lady friend named Fudge (Ice Dense) as well as Deja (Tyra Bank). Afterwards they end up tackling some skinheads on the campus. Remy (played by Michael Rapaport) is confused with the kid until the end of some local skinheads on the campus. <br/> <br /> Opinion: Higher education is not without its flaws: Character development low, Omar Apees, Tyra Bank and the leader's head (whose name I forgot), Boasta Reimis is not suitable for this movie. Women were hating women after torture, before this photo you know that I do not like that part of film with Christian Swansea. Other than that, this movie was not half bad. Lawrence Fishburn was good as Professor Phipps (although I could work without utterance), Fuji Ice Cube's best performance and Michael Reaport was as good as a misleading ramie. Above all, it was one of John Singleton's best movies, and the rubbish I've come out of now is one. Higher education in the movie, Mississippi Burning and American History X, and fewer movies such as Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and Shafts require a very uninterrupted remake.
