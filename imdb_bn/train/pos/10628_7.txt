Regardless of the length of the story and the "Bar-e-O-East" story, it is a fairly compelling film. <br /> <br /> It's mysterious, giant scenes actually quite vague, some visual effects are fantastic and best of all, for many frustrating from the ridiculously ill humorous film, many (wannabe) horror films have them now. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not the greatest film ever made, but it actually attracts you and at least attempts to develop the character. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see it.
