This movie was nice, a bit scary, but that's nice. Those who have heard of Colombian people and know the story, what they did to you and why they gave the idea about what these children did. Behind your mind, you know that people think about this thing, but you can not understand how bad it is and this movie realizes you. It's really good to do. To make sure that you think twice before making fun of someone I read a book about the Colombian massacre and it started to haunt me, this movie worries me and fears me to die. It's like killing a guide for serial killers in Downside. I recently received a threat, and I blew off thinking nothing about it, but after this movie I think you will take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you do not really know what they are, so take it seriously and do not under anybody's guess.
