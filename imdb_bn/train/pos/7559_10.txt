This movie is just so good! Despite Carmen Electra, I have been one of the better films I have seen right now. Jamie Kennedy is just amazing, and Lorraine Dean plays an insane spoiled movie star very well. The plot is as good as well. It's all too real scary. It has been said here that it is a drama, but it is one of the greatest plays I have ever seen. Check it out.
