We saw this in the category of health of my community that how women are abused in many societies, and I absolutely love this movie. I plan to try to get myself a copy for the visit. The story is very sensitive and I would recommend it to anyone. I was a fan of different cultures and this movie was exactly what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. This is a movie that I will show my children. Our class was also primarily for educating women for the professor movie, but this film was more than that. This is a movie that will be spreading in my mind forever and loved.
