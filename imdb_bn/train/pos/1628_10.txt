This is the most ridiculous movie I have ever seen. As soon as the Winnberg Military Academy starts sending four offenders from their parents, the tone has been set that this Gobble always runs throughout the film and does not release it for a second. <br /> <br /> It's hard to describe this picture; Humorous elements are so spotted and nicely that it is not seen as something more than a stupid 80's teen shirt comedy on the first statue. But oh so much more! MAD Magazine has created a new formula and style from the minds of those people, which I have seen many similar "funny" proposals coming out of Hollywood many years ago. Originally this movie is full of infantile cornball material, which you can guess is that the writer was a 14-year-old couple. If you love to do "strangers", then watch this movie. A classic. *****
