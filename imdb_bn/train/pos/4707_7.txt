"Johnny Dangerously" is a hit of hit and miss comedy that laughs and "yes?" But I recommend giving it a chance. I think it's widely looked on. Many people do not allow this movie. It works. Just remember it as a little parody of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton's role is very interesting. And he does it well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go to higher life. She just works out her way to a beautiful wife from a big boss. And certainly a lot of crowd movies, someone wants him dead. 90% joke gets smile Like it, I said it was a chance. Just take your favortie gangster movie and mix a comedy. You have "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
