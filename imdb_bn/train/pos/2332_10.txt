"Imagine if you can bring things back only through one touch." As soon as I heard it, my attention was locked in the trailer, and after the first episode I found my soul through this show. A modern day fairy tale that puts my spirits up and keeps my attention across the whole show. I think acting and casting is just perfect, each character brings something unique to the show that adds to it's perfection. Even villains also manage overflow with a unique idea, they do not seem to disappoint me from the bees who can swallow the cats until they sing. And deaths that are naturally recorded in a frustrating moment often end up with a pure smile (like an exploding scratch and sniff book) <br /> <br /> We have a few days of crime even now, Daisy is really standing right from the rest, Not just a mystery but a love story, a comedy and a fairy tale which is made with an indication of the drama, all the one wondering Kara ..... pie looks wrong. <br /> <br /> Was it really a surprise to me that it was in ABC, for years I had no reason to start an ABC, but it laughs from my face and brings me back every week. It was Pushing Daisies brought ABC back to life for me. But in two seasons, a few fans have been excluded from awards, a big fan base and positive feedback shows from critics. It seems, Ned has surrounded the ABC again and killed me forever. Although I will always be a fan of this show, and I recommend this to someone who likes to talk and loves many people from the show.
