Pahahahi, whose previous films, The Circle and Crimea, ranged from Gold Door to Grim, had a fun, annoying, delightful glittery piece of shoes that ended up at the end of a note of free and heartwarming fun? Still, the movie has done something that is most challenging and relevant as it did. At the Tehran Stadium, the former World Cup focuses on a group of strong supporters of the girl in the Bahrain-Iran match, the Panahi questioned the national spirit and independent mindset and conflicts? And sheer stupidity ?? The modern competition with the majority of young population and urban girls is a world-class religious racism that is increasingly concerned for themselves. <br /> <br /> When we open the picture, we definitely join a bus to a girl, following a lost girl, a father. There is a camouflage and the national colors are war criminals, but we are crying with the knowledge of what is going on: he's still easy to see. The thing, most often, does not care for men. Nevertheless, rules and rules, and once they try to make it through different checkpoints on the way to the big stadium, football girls or some of them roundup and keep a small part of the stadium, mostly young, green, and rustic soldiers - There is no idea how they can deal with independent ideas, but rather they see the game ?? Whose boom we constantly hear the background ?? Themselves Each girl is different ?? The rules represent a different set for broken absence in different ways. Wore a soldier's uniform and went to the officer's department. One difficult and intelligent and gag and provocative (he might pass for a beautiful boy, and tingly indicates that: "You are a girl or a boy?" "You want me to be?") One does not pay much attention to football but honors a dead comrade. One (Aida Sahedighi) is a football football player herself ?? And so These Tehran girls are suddenly and smart and they carry out the safe guard of the extremist rural lieutenant (engaged in their care). One of the rural police (Mohamed Khairabad) is a male footballer's girl football player (of course no woman), forced to wear Italian football starter posters as a mask. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The violation of sex separation rules qualifies as vice. Is a man mixed with them ?? A child who is guilty of smuggling firewalls in growing games. The van is not so sparring: Radio airplanes are broken. But a police keep them in place so that they can hear about the growing heart-stopping report. Police and detainees are now joining in a common tension. There are no scores, the game goes to penalty, and the winner will go to Germany. <br /> <br /> This is a real game in the background, a real stadium and the result of these events of real people crazy people. The excitement is awakening, and a car with a car and flag on the road and praying for an Iranian victory by the road is jammed with crowds and united with their tension. <br /> <br /> This movie is so good, which can be clear, it turns out to be almost everything that's shot at a real end that is a real game evening shot. It is in contrast to the comparative fantasy trajectory of Panahiri, making spontaneous film movies that progress with realizing a background of real events and make you excite a lot of excitement. <br /> <br /> Is the top of the offside different from the soccer craze in the modern world and the inverse social restrictions to suppress women ?? Later, there was a time when young Iranian women are becoming part of a global world, where women participate in sports and participate in the spirit of national team. How much do you consolidate the ambition of achieving the modern global power with medieval social attitudes? Many Offisde are surprisingly real, everything along the way tries to find out everything. The direct decision to inject the young actors into the actual sports mega-event suddenly creates an unusually effective combination of the documentary, spine and fiction which seems to pick up the bones and it ends in such a way that it is bright and moving. <br /> <br /> < br> I had reservations about drinking coffee, but it took away the donkey. Panahi has something extraordinary here. He criticized his society, presented a great drama and touching our hearts with the ideas of a nation's desire.
