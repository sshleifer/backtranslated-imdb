I saw hundreds silent movies. Some of them are always classics (such as Nusafratu, Metropolitan, General and Wings) but among them, this may be my favorite film (it can not be the best - but dear, yes). Actually, when I saw it at IMDB, I noticed that I immediately laughed because the film was so beautiful and orderly. Marin Davis had a genuine talent with this film and he was not only the concubine of William Randolph Hearst. <br /> <br /> As soon as a hierarchy of Georgia in Georgia comes to Hollywood, he will be suddenly an instant star! The interesting trick of his experience and era elders makes it a real treat to watch the movie buff and a must!
