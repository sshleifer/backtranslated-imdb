This movie was violent. I do not have this hard smile long time. I mean, this is not "Good Will Hunting", but was it supposed to? I actually went into the modern screening of much less hope and was pleasantly surprised. Comedy hit hard and fairly constant. Amanda Peet is hot and awesome. The audience that I see with it, I've been enjoying the movie.
