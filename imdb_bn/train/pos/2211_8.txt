Office, Wade, Intezes and E! Without the soup, I do not see many TVs. I think I have kept this program in a good show. <br /> <br /> I like the quick review of pop culture. The soup can help me in talking about Sanjay or Heidi Montag (Span?) While talking about what office people are talking about. The best part is the soup showing clips of their highlights, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (in common, most people insist on watching American Idol due to the furious scenes of the auditions), due to which most people demand to see . And that means, more than 98% of "funny" or "shocks" of nickety talk shows or "reality" shows in my mind. Soup is not the only reason why my opinion is 10, sketches are not funny and even on rare occasions, the commentary is not always the same. But they can not run all the houses, if so, soup will not be! <br /> <br /> Joel's quick wit and soup writing team (which includes McHell) creates a great show. I will enjoy smile and comments from the crew who are off camera. Even when they are occasionally becoming obviously clear by courtesy, it is still ridiculous because it is mandatory. They are obviously ironic. And that's what makes this show fun.
