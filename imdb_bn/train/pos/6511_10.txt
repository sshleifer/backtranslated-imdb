Like many people, I grew up with the schoolboy. Many people here are different, I love this show! I think it has worked very well and has been thinking. Everything about it is marked as a spin off which is not taken seriously. The formula is simple - it is a parody of other cartoons that tries to get a bad guy good guy. It's much easier to add to parody humor from the beginning of every 30-minute episode of the audience using well-known Saggy and Scuba-Doo characters. <br /> <br /> There is always the spin-off spin that fans are disturbed. Scuba-Shaggy-Scrapbook Short Shots from the 80's are classic. These spin-offs had their place: They allow new items to be sold, they create new fans, and keep the Scuba-Doo merchandise on the table. I would agree that "Chaggy and Skubu-Doo: get a defective!" This traditional role is not fits, but I always wanted Scuba-Shaggy-Scrapie shorts: This is a action packed show which focuses on the best / funny scuba-do characters! Feature features of the show: "best friend" relationship between animations, voices, detailed attention, bad guys, saggy and skub-doer, constant humor! Bad feature: None, although the restored mystery machine is very close to several times. <br /> <br /> Well, Warner Bros. Animation! One of the longest cleverest cartoons!
