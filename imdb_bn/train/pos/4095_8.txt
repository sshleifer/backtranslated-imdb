Now my friends, films like "La Bate" (Ukka "The Bist" or "Monstro") can only be done in the old continent :), in this film we all see: horses are dirty sex, nymphomaniac type gorilla off, non-sense Dialogs, etc ... ... on serious terms, it is a fairy tale, that sometimes men can be sincere, sincere and cruel, Wallieran Borougiz (Director) is rude among us Shows violence, sexual violence, rape and murder. Brutality. This is a wonderful movie experience, full of bizarre and diverse scenes. For all fans of European Shock Consumption, I recommend this movie. If you like it, then I recommend: "Auralph against invisible people" and "changed the United States".
