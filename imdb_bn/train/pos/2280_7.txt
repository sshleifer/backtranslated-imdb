It's hard to classify the film - perhaps it's a sophisticated guard spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good vanguard novel, and of course, one of her most easy novels to adapt to the lengthy film. The main book of film adaptation is very faithful. The "indie" method of how this movie was produced is probably more effective than financing the Hollywood studio. These days, I suspect an intelligent novel like Mother Night will ever get the green light from the big Hollywood Greenhouse. And generally that's not too bad, but in this case. Mother Knight has a tight direction and a solid throw. Nick Nolt, who seems to be playing a good role in old age, still has a "universal" personality that lets him take a wide range of characters. Sheryl Lee is always as beautiful and great. I always deserve better than coming out of the entertainment industry. I think your debut as a small girl (Twin Peaks) is not the most preferred role with a little wind time, even the TV show is a minor incident. However, this film is completely enjoyable and you do not have to read books to understand the film. Indeed, today's geopolitical realities have been given, the date can be displayed in the context of the novel, and some young visitors with little knowledge of history will be confused by the events that are completely disclosed (I'm talking to you, fellow Americans who are students and have the lowest score. Geography, history , And know about other things in the industrialized world of Lord!).
