I saw my last day at the festival, and I was stuck near that extra few days. Poetry, moving, and most amazing, funny, it's its own weird way. It does not seem valuable or without imbalance, it is able to find real curiosity and humor in a hyper-realistic world, it is very rare to see the managers working in this style. Both improvised, yet managed to feel completely controlled. It does not hesitate to compare because these filmmakers have digested their effects (cassettes, owners, lobbying, altman ... normal suspects) and found their own unique style, but if you prefer the modern director in this tradition (Lin Ramsey, David Gordon Green), for you a real behavior. This is a wonderful movie, and I hope more people will see it. This picture plays a festival in your town, go! Go! Go!
