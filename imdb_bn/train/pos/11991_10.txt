Oh, Tesolpin! Can I say that this great show has not already been told? There is nothing! It's never been without any doubt, one of the best-written shows, live-action or animation. The new stuff is way too dumbed for my taste, and for some "mature" ingredients I have to shoo kids from the room. But not the tailpieces. <br /> <br /> The stories are compelling and very appreciated. Some of them may extend up to one or two hours for the movie. Stages like Stormy weather and its dream possibilities are very dramatic and still enjoyable for kids and adults alike. Then pure comedy episodes such as Blast of the Baloo Blades and Steak on You, where emphasis is emphasized. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Going, but Balu believes that it will be very dangerous. In the biggest battle of this episode, Balu Diarying shouted at the kit to stay away from Dan, no, you can not say what to do! Your * * * MY * * DAD *! "And his pillow buries his face, and the next day he leaves for the wind circus, which is one of the annoyances of the cartoon, and the most welcome among the people who have been present here. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of characters in them. Like most of the way, only a few degrees of plus or laziness. Rebecca is a clever business woman whose meaning means money making, although the theory Well, good practice, Molly is a cute little girl, but you can not be deceived by that. She can sometimes be a real hellion. Kite is a dark character than Claudia's rest. She believes a lot on adults until she appeals Do not, and have a tendency to stop his relationship. See his expression in the Plunder and the power station when he is Holds the hook: He feels that he is ready to fix it through a pirate. <br /> <br /> Finally, the play that matches very real chemistry is in my book, in this book # 1 character. Balu and The relationship between Kit is very real, almost father and son. Al Hall is in Hello, which ends in Hello, when Balu accepts the words of Kit, Semur is misusing animals instead of living with other adults with his adult children. Balu and Baki's relationship is also realistic, Balu's inspiration is not to help Reelka, but rather to bring back the call of the ocean. But something tells me that if he comes back after calling, Rebecca will work for him. <br /> <br /> All other planes in the ocean are not able to mention the sea dock is quite well-designed. Aircraft tasks across the plane do not change at once (continuity like this can be difficult), and unlike most other cartoons, it is not the only weapon against "super-planes" (unless you count the grapes!), And instead of going out of trouble The driver depends on the great skill of the pilot. It's hard to think of a hero car, which does not have any handguns in any type of gun burger, laser cannon, or even on board. And they are very hard to find cartoons nowadays by using their heads to make trouble. Plus it's just a billionaire design! <br /> <br /> This is certainly the best cartoon. Ever. Duration All ten stars are sure!
