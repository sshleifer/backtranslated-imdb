This is a fairly small crime drama that packs a lot in the 65 minute running time. It has all the correct elements - there is a mysterious corpse, a tired middle-aged police Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his rook Sidekick Tobin (John Miles), loose love of interest for Tobin and a shape-shaped Tobin female botanist Mary (Patricia Wright) Those who help solve the crime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Before doing so, she revealed that she had a tattoo (confusing) ?). Afterwards, when Tobin was back behind the murderer behind the yard, he suddenly saw the wrong way - no wonder he did not catch him!
