Treatment is an amazing film ... so suspenseful and so real! I was lucky enough to get the screening of 'The Chuir' in NYC premiere and it blows me completely! I heard it won a prize from that special festival and it definitely deserved it. The first thing to look at me was the cinematography. Eric Geovan did an amazing job. Half of the film scenes of shooting scenes were amazing. This picture was needed in a love scene, and the grill covers the point but the scene is delicious Geovon and Jafri have created an excellent creative team and they will definitely work together in future projects. Judy Mother's story was so real, but the heart twisted together, it seemed to me the feeling of a main character. I'm a very critical critic, but I must say that one of my favorite movies is cure. Just love! If you have not seen it yet, check it out!
