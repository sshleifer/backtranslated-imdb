Page 3 A great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Once across the cinema I got to see myself moving around in space. Kanakana Sen did a good job in the film, although I think someone was better with more glamor or encouragement, but she did a great job. All supporters were very good at the actors and helped cinema along. The bomb did a great job by the Iranian. One thing standing in this movie is that the story is great, and very realistic, it does not hit Bush around, it's very straightforward to send his message. I think more such films should be made, I see the same candy floss films, they are more ill, they are becoming hard to digest right now. Everyone will see 3 pages, this is a great movie. - Just my 2 cents :)
