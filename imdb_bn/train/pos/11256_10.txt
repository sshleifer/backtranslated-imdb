Without doubt, the best of John Le Carrue's novels has been transformed into a classic film. Peter Egan (Magnus Pim, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weiengng (Accel, Original Name Alexander Hampel, Magnus Check Intensity Controller), Ray McNally (Magnus Con-Man Father) and Allan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus Consultant), Believers and British Controller), the person is responsible for throwing them together with the rest of the letters so perfect and natural together, Who should be given. Even small parts, such as Major Memorial, are performed in perfection. It is very much for the power of the performance and the power of the novel characters, which, unlike Magnese, can not worship compared to Magn and Axel and Grant Ledarra of the US intelligence group, apart from Jack Brotherhood, the characters of the novel's characters. I read the book at least a dozen times, and often saw the movie, and both became mild. If I have a book to go to a desert island, then a perfect spy will be preferred over everyone else.
