My expectations were quite high for this photo. I know everybody has seen this movie in the movie, told me that everyone has touched so much because the credits have touched so much. My expectations could not have been any higher, some of the wonderful things disappointed me. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this movie but I had some. I like how it deals with hard issues without going through normal steps to include Hollywood films. They worked through the problems they faced for decades for the film's characters, they worked through ancestors, they learned to open. But it did not come easily, not just singing a song or two. It was painful, it took the argument, it took collision. It felt like real life. <br /> <br /> Gabriela singing her song was a scene that was really stuck to me. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is lovely, and you can say that she was not only syncing a previous recording lip during filming (which I often found in other movies), she really sang with her whole body and soul. You might feel Gabriela feeling that scene. Whether this movie was made in Hollywood, it's probably being sung in the end, and it will open its eyes to her husband and see the mistake of his way, as well as other people in the village have to understand one thing or two. Instead it came through half, and it does not bring any solution. Her husband has not been frustrated and she understands what she has given her, and she can not remember anyone else in the village openly. It was beautiful, it was pure and it was touching but it does not have all its magic problems. It seemed to me real, probably what happened in real life. The whole movie was felt to me in real life, nothing was nicely covered, but everything was a feeling of joy and happiness. You rarely find a movie that seems so realistic. <br /> <br /> Some things that bother me, but hey, no movies are perfect. If you are not already seeing "as in heaven" and feel happy for life, feeling of hope and touching a level movie rarely reach the feeling. You will find sad, sad, happy and a dozen other passions. <br /> <br /> Some people once said that if every person in the world used to sing to the church, there would be no war. I can not agree on seeing this film.
