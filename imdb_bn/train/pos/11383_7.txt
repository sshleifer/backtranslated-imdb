This is a fine musical instrument with a timeless music of my favorite songwriter (Garsuen) and a wonderful 'Parisian' atmosphere, which gives the film a lot of elegance, but in the context of a story .. it is not really there. Or at least, do not work very well. Acting is also not so smooth by reason. But I like some dialogue, I like the scene at sign, like the character described by Levant; And of course the dance, which is quite pretty. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 seems to me the point.
