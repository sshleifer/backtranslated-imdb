This movie is amazing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this movie, a young soldier comes across a vampire, Kai (Hayd). Over time, they form an impossible friendship. Half the life of a vampire because of how he is forced to save others. <br /> <br /> This is not a sad movie, but sad. The plot is very unique, and your typical vampire rift was the opposite. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I got the unfinished version (I'm lucky that I understand it preserves all the Cantonese), so I would recommend getting something with subtitles. <br /> <br /> The movie was great for everyone.
