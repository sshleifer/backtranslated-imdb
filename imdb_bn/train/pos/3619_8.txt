Despite Disney's best efforts, it's an enjoyable movie about following your dreams. I was surprised that it does not make me feel more sensitive; This movie played fair. Dennis Kaid played a great role, saying something for a sports movie. I can not remember how many sports movies bothered me and made a little joke; Here, everyone shows part. This movie is astonishingly well, and I'm predicting that it will be a wonderful business because it's a g-rated movie that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. In contrast, this movie is a success.
