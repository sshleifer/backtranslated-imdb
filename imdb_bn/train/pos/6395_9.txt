For me, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Struggling through life and prove to yourself, he is not just a "cookie", but an excellent character in Carl Brasier, who somehow puts him in his best light. , The best acting of his life. De Niro, who is living legend, gave some of the film. He has hit his character in the film, but he has performed very well for the film, has done a great acting. And the look of beautiful Charlie was always a big plus for every movie. So if you have not seen this movie then I recommend for the brave people who love to look for inspiration, greatness. You must see this great drama. My vote 9/10
