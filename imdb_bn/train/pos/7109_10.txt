First off, let's start with negative points: 1) The huge, awkward sculptures of the story lines and the raised questions are not answered near where; 2) This movie is not for all people, so visitors will get unrest and start yapping during filming. <br /> <br /> Two points above are important because the movie is very cool. In an old type theater (like I went), you can hear the rock running repeatedly through the projector. I like that. The movie does not keep you busy with music, it's busy: it reflects on what's happening to you. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of Lam which creates an atmosphere that is absolutely enjoyable. Aye Wide Shot The same type of environment created by Stanley Kubrick. Not for all people. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend cinema fame as a cinematographic work. Those stories that fully appreciate a movie in the story will be disappointed. This is a kind of story that you have to create your mind links later. (Its my version is pretty cool, but most of the off-track!) Is a great part if you go to capture the movie: when two policemen are talking to each other on their cell phones. An ultra cool sound effect that really keeps you at the moment Think of this job that the person shut down.
