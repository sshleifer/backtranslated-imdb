At first, the movie was seen in 1990 and it was completely smiled. It became my favorite with the circle of loved ones and we will quote it from a hat drop ("I'm going home in a bag!"). Needless to say, humor is still there after 15 years. Halloween has become a heritage of Halloween time during this film to show my many new friends (the best thing is you can still take it off eBay!) I saw that Halloween candy with your tongue has been planted more effectively in your cheek. And this The film provides all the pathos, secrets, strangers, talents and lists. The Royal Dano provides an amazing impressive performance as the Old Man Ranchmuler. I've seen bad guys with bad people in mind, seeing him "seven faces of Door Laurence of the phone". Here, you really feel really for the old guy from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, then you will miss some levels of humor in this movie. The makers of the offhand got real delays in many ways with comments, dug a little fine outfit in other ad films, even if the will. A view of the quote from the page! <br /> <br /> Do not spend too much of a lot of thinking methods, people trying to analyze a movie - it's fun to rent without the need of nicotining, and do not have to be objectionable (well, maybe stupid people, but they do not know that they Joking ..) <br /> <br /> - Now if you forgive me, I'm going to get a 'jag-nut' bar. <br /> <br /> - Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, Caroque DJ / Entertainment
