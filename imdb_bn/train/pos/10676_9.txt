This image was based at Liverpool's Gerard Gardens and it was the UK's answer to the film 'Blackboard Jungle'. The film still looks very well, today's moral stories (or even more) are relevant. Some of the notable British actors such as David McCallam, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Hyund Unemployed is a Liverpool police who carries children, which you will be able to catch the children at a young age, they will end up with the adult adults. <br /> <br /> There are also significant decreases in this movie: Freddy Star (Fred Foal) and Melvin Hays (Gloria). Sassi Chin and Michael Chao are caught in a firing web who brothers and sisters (they play real life brothers and sisters). Tasai Chin is still acting and the latest Nikol Kidman film 'The Interpreter' can be seen in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a feature of gun block in a school playground, so the same programs on the TV are not seen in Scotland / Russia <br /> <br /> I'm in Gerard Gardens, where this image was shot (though Not born at the time), and the area has tender memories. I recently completed a documentary at Gerard Gardens, which is impressive from 'Violent Playground', and there is a small UK film 'Cost to Coast', which includes Lenny Henry and Pete PostLowet In 1987, the tensions were broken and the films took some means to save memories. <br /> <br /> There were some accusations from the residents when the film was released, because the film depicted the area in bad light. During the time the wound healing helped. <br /> <br /> A film is a little gem, I would suggest you find out this
