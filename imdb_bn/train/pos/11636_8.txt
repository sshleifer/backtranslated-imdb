Beautifully portrayed, well-played, tightly scripted Susense movie. The edge of my seat was mine. I liked the lead actress a lot, and I thought Wilne worked very well. There is nothing much to chew here in the theme, but if you come to your seat, then close your brain, watch the fancy camera and enjoy the plot, it will be a great time. The plot is well-worn and can learn less or less of what the movie girl can expect in almost ten minutes. But it does not bother me, because I enjoyed watching it. In the old days, they probably did not pay too much attention in just two letters and there was some exciting moment when I hoped that they would give some other lines to some people. But these people could probably keep such a strong focus. The plot got me very quickly with the throat, and never let it go. It is not a good idea to think too much during or after the movie. As I'm not sure it makes a great deal of wisdom. Just relax and enjoy.
