This has always been one of my favorite movies, and will always be there. In the last few years, I've been cautious of 50/60, who are trying to collect all the good things that have been reproduced. I like several things about them that how technically some of them can correct them properly. Great colors and sets are going to me too. This is a sorrow when it re-relapses some of the old movies; They almost always stuff it up, - Just look at the recent repetition of the day standing on the earth, it's completely rubbish !! The forbidden Planet is always one of the benchmark space films, and they are still trying to recreate it, and I wanted to think about how the new would be! For my mind, some things like superb classic movies can only be what they are, a classic example of great efforts to say common stories, and this process should make people thriller. Once they add all the techno-broof that we've made available now, the film looks more like a dog-meat than a Hollywood sausage factory - it's not something special. However, I noticed that the uniforms of the Forbidden Planet's astronauts were also used as "the queen of the outer universe"! It just tells you that the budgets were a little behind, right? Hey, less money and good movies, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> Leslie Nilsen plays a serious role in this film, and Anne Francis, Walter Pizzadon (who is always my favorite actor), Earl Holiman, and of course Robbie the robot! <br /> <br /> Special effects are fantastic, and the story is not too remote. This is a great science-fiber experience!
