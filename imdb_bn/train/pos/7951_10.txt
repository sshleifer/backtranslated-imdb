This is a beautiful and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. It is about two dogs and a cat that is taken away for a while to stay with someone else but the animals do not understand and they escape and find their own family. The cat is named Sassie and she keeps her name. Chances are small dogs who know a lot about life within pounds Shadow is the old and intelligent dog which is the sense of things. Put on a adventure together with a three and makes it for a happy and fun filled time. The head has no special effect, so it is not chessy. It's the best thing I've seen so far in animal movies. It's really a good movie for the family
