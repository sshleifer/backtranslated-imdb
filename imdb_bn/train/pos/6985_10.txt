I would like to say that I could not think of this event as a BSG fan. I saw it on the big screen of Arcarty movie tonight (as part of Playie Center screening), and cast and filmmaker spoke in the ward later. Ron Moore said that they wanted to make a break from Battlesler and did something different, and yes they would lose some fans, but hopefully they would gain others. <br /> <br /> In addition to even their conversations. I am now a fan of the new show. But what I think about this picture is here. <br /> <br /> I like it. It was really very good. I suppose that I really like science-fie (or syfy '- what do I really need to type?), Because I want to see this series as a whole. It's a strong and wealthy story, and kept my interest. <br /> <br /> This is a group of thirteen year-old boys, which is the weakest part of me and a bit confusing. The actor has played the role of "Ben" and we should show more of a glimpse of his intense faith. It was rare to play acting actor "Joe", but he was playing a teenager (and I'm sure that I was not the only "Joe" a cylinder, who considered the danger of being a BSG gaik). If they expect that this new bumper / halphar / park, they can think it again. Surprisi ngly, it was the adults who attracted the attention of viewers. <br /> <br /> Ari Stoltz has given starred performance like Daniel Griston, a man is so scared because of his family's sorrow that he jumped into the first opportunity to leave her. Are not sad and let go. He has an intelligent knowledge of his character in the internal and internal world of the computer, especially in a scene where he spots a web of a young teenage friend of his daughters, trapped him, then fired him and released him. There is no sign of 'serial killer', he has acted in Gray's Anatomy, really acting actor. <br /> <br /> Although equally strong, Palla Malcolmson is not his wife Amanda Griston. He played very nice and well written and beautifully as part of the Stolts, and I completely believed that they are couples, and couples stay together forever and have a strong relationship, so little is seen for some time. I look forward to seeing what's going on with this family, and hope they'll give him a lot of things like BSP's Rozeline - he's strong and smart and when he blinks his child, you cry, it's really cool. Not to mention his eyes, which could have magical powers, that is how intense they are. Where he took the government agent - a very small scene, but acted nicely - really gave you an idea about his power. <br /> <br /> The other part of the show did not work 100% for me. The Isai Morales scene, and his mafia type tribe. He did a good job as a whole, but I do not believe this public power, and are scared by their threats. I've found myself willing to think that this whole story line is more mysterious and difficult; The way it presented is a tribute to Godfather, they hit you on the head with a bit. But at the time given, I can see how it develops in an interesting "sub-low / low level", unlike the planet's rich people (Stalze et al) with the poor minorities (Morales et al.). And to be honest, I enjoyed it while talking about the origin of his name with his son - this is a very good acting scene. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind the BSG fans, the boy played 'Willie Adama'. Do not really look like Olmos, but he's just a kid. He will look more than this photo or he knows, who knows? I can not say for sure. But he did not bother me, because he was not as interesting as everything around him. <br /> <br /> playing Polly Walker 'sister Claris', and in all the scenes she is cool and weird. I'm not sure where he or she will end, but I was very impressed with his performance. He was next to this photo, but perhaps the most important part is being set up to play later. He was nothing like his character in "Rome", I always found something fascinating in the actors. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful surprise - the music is really good and fewer than the BSG, though it is doing the same guy, Bear McCreary. It is a hunting and unusual way of accepting me by frustration, if I get the chance I would like to buy this score. <br /> <br /> As the 'panel discussion' after the ceremony, it was hosted by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very intelligent and clear, David Eck was cracking like his cricketer (like his video diaries), told a long story about how Morales was cast, and Ari Stoltz was very funny and did not really answer questions (but I did. Always have a thing for her). Palla Malcolmson was difficult (she used to tell Seth Green that she was 24 years old), and the girls who played Juhi and Lacey were both beloved. Grace Park and Tricky Halfway as well as answered their questions about visible scenes in BSG. Overall, a very interesting and wonderful evening. <br /> <br /> I am giving 9 out of 9 shows, and look forward to seeing more. Note: I just saw this for the second time and hopefully they will discover how the Holland was originally created. There is no idea what I might be, but it is a great act of fascination to me.
