The team of Marian Cooper and Ernest Skodaac created a documentary of 50,000 men and their animals in the summer migration to winter pastures. The basic value of today's movie is "forgotten ones" as a time capsule and in the West we know how "living twentieth century" was how they lived. A more rigid contrast can not be imagined. The crossings of rivers and empty birds are brutally realistic and underwater disappearances are actually invisible. Sure the time viewers believe that the story has happened, the signature signed certificate is finally passed. The version I saw was an Iranian fascinating music that could stand alone and be praised without the film. After saying all this, the picture is probably more valuable to anthropologists than a casual audience in search of a beautiful evening entertainment. The crew has just got enough stock and multiple reloads to take their recorded shot, as there is no fancy camera work. Western Inter-titles are frustrated by the experience, but in fact they as part of the record show how Hollywood tried to keep their spins on the indigenous people so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day. Duty entertainment by desert police is a "police force." The producers made the Doku-drama Chang (1927) and the entire commercial King Kong (1933). The migration theme is again used in People of the Wind (1976) and Himalayas (1999). Recommended for those who are making advance - and then highly recommended for them.
