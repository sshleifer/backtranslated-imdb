52-pick-up was never supposed to be respected. It works on many levels, and has a complicated yet follow-up plot. The actors involved give some of their best performance. Ann Margaret, Ray Skider and John Glover have completely shot and provided deep-sketchy screenplay. Vanity is notable, who turned it into a serious acting career with unexpected skills and Kelly Preston, the character who bothers you for a few days. Anyone who likes the action combined with a great complicated story will enjoy.
