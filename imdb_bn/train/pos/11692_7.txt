I'm not saying that just like Chris Rock's fan, I'm telling a person who has low expectations in this film and was proven wrong. The first error was that it was all-finished work that everyone saw coming. The empty number two found that chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seems to be fake. Eventually, the film starring Sub-Par, Best Actor, Regina King and the Worst Mark Adie. But I saw that error and saw a tough comedy. A head-up scenario, can wait in heaven instead, it's good. So you see this movie everywhere, for Chris Rock fans, you will enjoy. There is some good stand up in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall: 7 out of 10
