It is the first American film to successfully accept European style, especially French and Belgian, for a decade, and it's not about time? Following three high school girls from Brooklyn's Crown Heights, during the last days of their summer, during the great breaks in the last days of the summer, it does all the good art to do: it is universally discovered. Although girls' practices are externally popular - boys, sex, popularity, money, independence, and clothes - though we see universal interface between the size, character and the fate of life, how we look. <br /> <br /> Natura is complete, complete. The film breathes, lives in the moment, lives in real time. Say the story itself. The mediocre and its handmade, for once, is not the message. The film unbelievably expresses the childhood view of her character; It does not impose its own adult money or morality. The details are not pushed to their own emergence, and thus feel all real and powerful for their understatement. The true social reality of Crown Heights, Captain Heights, is the biggest blackhouse in New York City, and painful as part of the most dangerous violent places in the United States, but this satellite is not a childhood, not Ghetto. <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the camera is very close, very close, a patient, intelligent, and disobedient If ksaka. Language is rich, spontaneous, acting transparent. Some scenes standout, such as lolling about girls, each revealed its deepest fantasies. Confessions of Lionsa acknowledged the death of the most violent violence, the deepest aspect of civilization. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mother, only one, Linsar, turns a father in her life (and, eventually, the three she most Emotion is stable and sympathetic to others and not with most self-respect). Two of them suffer from asthma, an immune system in the inner city. Gunfire, an acceptable daily event, only interrupts their conversation at the moment. Girl's only, win, hopes, there seems to be control over her future, the other two different degrees already have taken disappointment. <br /> <br /> This is the best dramatic American film ever. I've seen in the year. See it, see it, see it.
