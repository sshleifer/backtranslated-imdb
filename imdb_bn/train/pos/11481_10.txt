High school friends Andre Craigman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plans for a terrible attack in their high school. In the final competition of revenge, they started deadly calculations, two started a video diary for explaining their feelings and chronicening their mission. Another similar movie called "Elephant", like <br /> <br />. Why did I bring this up? Of course, to compare the two movies, certainly. I want to say, even though I like "elephants", this is a good movie. What is the difference, you ask? Well, for beginners, it was shot differently with "Cloverfield", "Blair Witch Project" and "Dead of the Dead". It makes the movie even better because it is more painful to be realistic. <br /> <br /> How did I wish to see how this movie was "to show other aspects of the story". You learn these two free, "elephants." I actually cared for one of the missing people and understood their work and why they did what they did. This film actually makes you sympathetic to these people and it's a good thing because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, that's why I almost cry about this movie. The real reason with the reason behind the characters argument and reason behind their action. You have to understand them They do not want to kill people for attention Overall, this movie is emotionally sticky and much better than hunting and "elephants" too.
