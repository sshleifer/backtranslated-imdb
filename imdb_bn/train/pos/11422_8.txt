Claire Dennis Chocolate is a beautiful but frustrating movie. In a very interesting look at the family of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, this picture gives viewers a more informative perspective on the characters and their interaction. However, development of these characters is often maddeningly inadequate. For example, the central theme of the story is the inability to build a strong relationship with others in France. Although this film is brutally executed, Dennis frames the story with the returning scene of his childhood home in France, due to his lack of close relation with other characters in the film, it is difficult for the viewer to invest a lot of interest in his development. Or its lack) as a drama. The general suspension of film character development makes it difficult to be involved in planned plots. This image has created mostly excitement among characters between Aya and her life men, but does not completely solve this social friction completely with the viewers displeasing. The final few scenes are strong but depressing Dennis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical perspective, but if you look for a movie with adventure or drama, chocolate is certainly not the best choice.
