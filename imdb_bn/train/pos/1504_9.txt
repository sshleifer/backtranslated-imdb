Master Robert Bloch's four great stories, adapted to the screen of the best actors in the seventh century, is the basis of this excellent Amicus' production. It was a kind of movie that was very popular by the mid-decade of Sikixi and it is one of my favorite kind of horror films. Especially this sweet sweet stirrings create sweet, where Christopher Lee inherits his mother's little girl from her mother's heritage. Great fun from the beginning, and very well the other three episodes (at the end of the comic side, with some nice additions to the most famous vampire in England's film, Ignig Pitt.
