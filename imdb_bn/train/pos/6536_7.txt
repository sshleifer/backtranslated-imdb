Let's tackle it; Nancy Dru was never literary. This is the category of Babysitter Club, Magic Tree House, Guysbung, ABC Mystery In fact, it is one of the main thread stories. Nancy is perfect, beautiful, thoughtful, "beautiful", there is no internal conflict! And do not change. Ned is quite the same. The film was true in that style and I want to say, I liked it. This would not be a great movie, but the books also had the same nostalgic smell. This was just the right amount for my kids (8 and 10.) There was almost no offensive language. I like to push for more conservative dress. <br /> <br /> Corky was something of a boring. He had a little place in a high school campus. I did not get quite why I was in the first place.
