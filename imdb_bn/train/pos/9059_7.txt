This is a good movie, if you have something else to do, it's a good family movie to see. If you expect this movie to sound from the book's words, you will be very disappointed. I was a little disappointed because when I read the book in the primary school, I used to read books several times. <br /> <br /> This is a new baby in the town of Bili. She makes a bet with school rape and bet is not like most bets. Billy was forced to feed 10 teenager in one day or get a fatal victory. <br /> <br /> Actually, maybe the worst part of the movie is. Much more than the over-the-counter actor If they do not eat pests, they think they are universal. Although Halley Egeenberg has done a magnificent job <br /> <br /> Plot line is good as a movie, but it sucks as a book adaptation. I could see while viewing this picture .... Sometimes <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good family movie with a weak point. I rated this movie 7/10
