This movie is a very interesting and heartwarming story about an orphan in financial problems. When the director goes on a holiday, his father agreed to run something temporarily. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nilsson's never-so-good is positive. His idea of ​​filming for the child is immediately innovative, and his sales strategies will certainly force you to laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know that I will never forget her. . Just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> This great family entertainment is so rare today so much. If you are happy, go for a little bit of the photo, but go for it! I over over, and I could often! My only complaint about this movie is that it is very difficult to find a copy.
