What do you say about Schmaltz? The beauty of this movie is that it is not American. It is a morality about America's high purpose and how they are raised on this occasion. It is passionate because it is about the bright purpose people. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film, to me, is the teaching of Fannie and David Farrelli (Bate Davis's mother and brother). Fannie says, "We're going out of Magnolius." <br /> <br /> In today's political environment, where under the leadership of the President, we used to lie to us ruthlessly and used 9/11. The characteristics of the bad people, we have leaned towards 9/11 killers' level of revenge for bloodshed. Mr. Bush is not to blame everyone - finally, we allowed him to lead this direction and he was re-elected even after he was proved false. Now, with full logicality, we revenge Americans. <br /> <br /> Today, we have seen this movie with a new awareness: the emergence of Nazi empowerment in Germany is not a defect. German character, however, is a mistake in humans that allows us to make things justified that justifies our immoral and abhorrent acts. I'm not likening George Bush to Adolf Hitler. But, I see how a leader can whip us into the fury of terrorism, hate and high nationalism for hateful things. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the Blackmailer has to do what it needs to do. For the sake of its own corruption, how immoral, like the leaders of our country, those who support them and those who have imposed their head so heavily, can not be bothered to vote for them. </ br> <br /> A movie like Watch On The Rhine reminds us of what we once wanted to be - a power to improve humanity - and we have it in order to achieve high goals again in us. <br /> <br /> Geoff
