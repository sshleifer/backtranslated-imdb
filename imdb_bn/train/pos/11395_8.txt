I dig out some old musicals from my garage and this is another of my favorite. This is written by J Alan Lerrar and directed by Vincent Minley. It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Screenplay for the year 1951. The story of an American painter from Paris tried to make it big. Nina Foke means a sophisticated woman and is very eager to help her, but soon she loves him. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls for a beautiful lover, Leslie Cause. Its main dance partner, and I must say they are superbly fantastic on the floor and otherwise. Famous French singer Georges Guetiri also sang. So if you like Oscar Levant's glittering piano fingers with full smooth dancing and fun filled scenes, George Gershwin's song will always be in this colorful gem. 8/10
