Usually I like some light and fun, so this picture should not appeal to me. But it caught me from the beginning. The story of family choices and challenges seems obvious, but it raises the question: "What was my family, my choice?" When I started crying aloud loudly loudly. It was difficult to watch, but to turn away is more difficult. The story is true, and life is hard to see sometimes! It shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: A good story is all a good story. The best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones. Like real life, you do not know what will happen next, or why people are doing such work!
