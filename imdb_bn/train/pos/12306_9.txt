China's Ghost Story late, a great tax collector named Leslie Cheung, who decided to spend the night on a street temple as Leigh Choi Sin, where he met and read for a beautiful woman named Tsing (Joey Wang). When Ling discovered that Tsing is actually a ghost who is forced to scream the hunter, who can eat the 'f' (vigor), he is forced to hunt, he decided to try and free the girl by trying to bury the girl properly. Swordsman Yin (Wu ma), enrolled in the aid of a mad Taoist monk, Ling successfully defeated the spirit of the tree, but the bad Lord Black is fighting Tsang, who will have to fight in Hell. <br /> <br /> The first Hong Kong film I saw was not entirely martial arts action, a Chinese ghost story Asian eye fantasy opened my eyes in a terrible world, a magical field inhabited by beautiful female ghosts, bombed innocent heroes, The sword Taoist beggars, monstrous spirits, and underworld wielding dark masters; I immediately fall in love with the film's exuberance, strength, humor, innovation and visual excellence. <br /> <br /> Two decades later, and this amazing movie is still one of the best examples of her style that I've seen? An extraordinary, exciting essay combining blues, comedy, fiction and romance with glorious glory. Excellent performance of Sue-Tuong Ching, a completely destructive special effect of David Woo's excellent editing, amazing painters, and super-special effects (sympathetic killer tongue, a much durable monster and multiple flying heads!), A Chinese goose story is a completely unforgettable from the beginning and Thoroughly enjoyable experience
