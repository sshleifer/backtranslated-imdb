Allow me to go to the bottom line here: I have 3 kids, 5 to 10 years old. I talk about a trip to the theater when there are no talking creatures. I have seen videos of at least 72 times in our collection. I can tell you when the film is a tragedy with the Wizard of Oz, the opposite of the 18 el Dodado sex trick and the end of Rudolph's red-nosed riders. I can probably do nemo storyboard from memory. <br /> <br /> Do I support a child who recommends me in the evening for a family movie? In one word: Sherman. <br /> <br /> The moment of silence <br /> <br /> * Smile *
