In the last few years, very few chess movies have been made, but it is more than just a chess movie, the need to choose it and more than the story of the need to win it, John Toturo works as a psychologically challenged person, nothing is his 64 squares and 32 The piece is accepted, the game legitimizes him as a person, when he hides a game, then he Lose a thing that he understands and John Tarturo reveals it in a beautiful fashion, even a woman did not have the love enough to save her from her sad existence. It makes you wonder if there are other people's games without hiding there, but I'm sure they are, if you are a chess enthusiast, then there will be no harm to see it. This is an intelligent part of the work well presented and well educated, it has achieved its purpose, unfortunately I doubt if it will be leaked there.
