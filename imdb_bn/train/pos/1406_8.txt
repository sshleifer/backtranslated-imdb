H. Yes. Do you remember the "invisible people" in Wales? Well other movies like here are just more extreme. No one stories about invisibility as weapons like "Hole Man" Kevin Bacon played in Sebastian Kain, a scientific genius who went into the world of invisibility and implemented it for military purposes. Serum was the easiest part of the making, so people did not get back. The first attempt is to end the most unstable. One night, when he is perfect in the formula. And who else, but Caine Lab must be rats. Gorilla was first and almost dead, so when he came, it was a close. So when Caine did, she decided to use it for fun. Then he did not see tired, the team tried to bring him back to the world of meat. However, the way the visibility formula should work, does not work and the kines get mad. So he ended up being a crazy invisible killer. Instead of living close to you, it is best to come out of the city. I'll care less about who I've made a mistake. Great movie, lots of fun 3 of 5 stars!
