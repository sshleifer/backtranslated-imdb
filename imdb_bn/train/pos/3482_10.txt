This is my first comment on the IMDB website, and the reason I am writing is that we are talking about the best movies of all time! 'Gariyu!' You will laugh and cry at the same time, if you fall in love with the tradition of singer song in Georgian (if you are not yet a fan!), And perhaps you will acknowledge the difficulties of your own existence and just feel good after watching it :) I Like many things about the film that the actors of non-leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and Kink Like the central character is interesting and important. The film is playing Wahtong Kickbaidze (who is superb), but you have to remember all your face around the movie. You will find yourself quoting their lines, which has become the name of many Russian-speaking people families. Living with a film. Simple, yet deep, you'd see it again and again.
