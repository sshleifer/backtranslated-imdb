Perhaps the movie is not one of the best Jackie Chan movies, but I think everyone will agree with me that the Battle of Mal is one of the best war scenes. There were also some memorable stunts, which was so impressive that they made this movie a classic of action. This movie has influenced many action movies and I think that action movie makers will have to learn from this movie nowadays (like they can rebuild that chasing scene, I can do better with modern technology). There were some funny scenes that Jackie was not fighting that made this movie enjoyable. Althu I think they could have more battle scenes in this movie.
