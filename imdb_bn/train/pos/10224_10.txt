... and I do not mean it. If not literally (after all, I have never seen each movie ever made!), At least, obviously, the one who, I know a lot. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The rule of thumb with IMDb is: Sometimes movies are considered extremely high (for example, Kansas-Compilation-Crude-Korean-Crand, which is known as "Old World") may really be bad. But rarely a movie is actually rated less than 6 years ago. This film is very valuable to watch. An insult. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I protested to give it a 10. The movie is not perfect. Her true rating should be 8 or 9. There are some flaws in it (especially in the Belmont), the script often runs around. However, what we have here is the greatest director of all time, check John Kader, the greatest actor of all time, the dear, greater life, Zero Motale, and acting / poetic / moral tour de force. A pair made in heaven! It is true that this film does not spread to some individual audiences, but those who show the film a great deal of excitement (who are not out of criticism) are interested in watching movies that give us "The Shop on the Main Street". (The best movie ever about Holocaust) should not be missed because some innocent IMDb ratings system decides that "American beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine". <br /> <br /> This is not.
