I saw this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to know 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Lewis Renner was eligible for his Oscar. I wonder if I smile from the film Yes! Munir was seen in the only film, where he was very hammy, I would expect a similar performance here. I'm glad I'm wrong. Although some may criticize Hollywood's idea of ​​Hollywood in a very small and intelligent way, I thought that role was right. Whoever Luke, if he was given the opportunity to play a major role, could play him the same way. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed by using camera work and crowd scenes, especially when O'Leane was a slave when the session was dismissed. The graphic and graphic atmosphere of the firing squad and the dread turned the episode simultaneously into one another, where it was all glitzy and shiny. I watched this movie from start to finish, enthralled. I can not say the same for today's "epic".
