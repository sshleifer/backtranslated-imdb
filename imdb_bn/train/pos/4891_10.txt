A great idea, a great cast, and what did not have more time to meat out the story of sorrow. I liked it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis, and Laine, now have some real women! Nevertheless, Danch and his character had enough material to carry the script in a few moments. I have tape and will continue to see it, hopefully there is a source that suggests there will be a signal there. <br /> <br /> Top drawers! - No questions! - No arguments! <br /> <br />
