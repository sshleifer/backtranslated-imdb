I thought that Mr. Dreyfas was perfect for the role of actors and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, played her role equally perfect. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfas was reluctant to replace the dictator against his wishes. But over time he became more confident and comfortable with the role. Since everything has happened for a reason of life, I believe that he was forced to replace dictatorship because he wanted to stay there for years to stay there. I guess he lived because he saw how good his life is compared to his paradore poverty. I think he has taken a lot of things for life and as long as he did, he is seeking a serious reality test in his country. <br /> <br /> But ......... .. anyway ... ..for this reason I gave this image 7 out of 10.
