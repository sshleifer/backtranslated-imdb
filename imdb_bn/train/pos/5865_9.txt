I saw this on the wire and liked it in the early 90's. It again saw it again until the cable was seen. Still find it a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why its high rate I found everything about this film compulsory. Like Vats (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situation that came with both Harris and De Niro. Now, I think this picture is even more mad about our situation in Iraq. I wish this often to be given on the wire for people to see. Human Toll is not deprived of the battlefield on our soldiers. Brought home for the rest of his life. And this film is one of the many which it is very difficult to grow. Nice movie.
