As the baseball die-hard, this film goes against the expectation of a movie movie: the famous sports activities, credible characters and an original story line. Although "outfielded Angels" failed unfortunately in the first grade, it was later well-successful. "Angels" Roger and J. P. Keeping the story, two Anaheim animals love children's baseball, but search for the family, the Angels franchise, draws fans and struggles to win games. His death promised Father that when he wins the pants, he will be a family, Roger will be requested for some divine help and the spirits of the diamond will look at the opposite of the lower spiral of the franchise. And, when the short-lived manager George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover) starts to believe in Roger's view, the team has the chance to change their seasons suddenly - and Roger and JP can believe something. Performance, and Tony Danza, plays a washed-up pitcher, well despite venturing out the pitch well despite having ZERO idea!
