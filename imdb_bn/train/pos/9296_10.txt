I like this movie. It's painful, funny, violent, too, a crazy man acting on the head, and of course your normal comedy is not. <br /> <br /> If you're not enjoying the movie, I guess it's not for your taste, so it's a hard write to write. <br /> <br /> For reference, Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride, and Zundandar (anyone who received me almost twice) I like another comedy. Others have, but my taste is definitely for abnormalities, and I want to admit that most people do not like to like these things. I do not apologize for the unusual feeling of humor - at least I have one. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The overall package makes for fun, fun, watchable still violent entertainment.
