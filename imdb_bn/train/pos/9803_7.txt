The Batman film The Fantasum and Batman and Mr. Fritz Sejzeror's Batman is not as good as a mask, but it's still a good installment for Batman cartoons which I say is just as good as Batman the Movie. This film is good for all the same reasons. The storyline is not as good as the other but still quite good. The cartoon effects are good at this. Actors' voices are really good, like Kevin Conroy / Bruce Wayne as Batman, Barbara Gordon as Strong, Ephraim Zimbalti Junior, Eli Marithanal Robin. Clara as well as Sedgwick Batman, David Ogain Stewers Pique, Hector Elizandro Ben as well. So I'm not sure that you will be frustrated with the mystery of Batwomen Batman. So make sure you rent or buy Batman Mystery of Batmanman because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ******* ********* * <br /> <br /> *** *** ****
