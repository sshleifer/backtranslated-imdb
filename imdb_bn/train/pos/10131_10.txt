In the first episode of "Friends receives a roommate" on 22nd September 1994, there is a song in the window at the end of the Rachel Show in the window, which played the line: "If you want to hold .... I know it's a great song ... I want to get a copy, thanks for the help. /> <br /> The show is available to listen to me <br times and enjoy the show. It just seems to be credible ... to thank you for providing entertainment over the years.
