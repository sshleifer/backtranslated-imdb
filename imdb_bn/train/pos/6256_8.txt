I'm moving myself here, but the film was a technical skill for my time, but I saw pieces in TCM yesterday, the question was raised to me: Why did they do it? Their lives were in danger, many of them died in the truck, why they would be so deadly to find food after reaching their life (!) "Milk and honey" They just stay there? Do you have to look for food for your life, and your whole community, just a rabbit? Since it was dangerous, to do this alone for this purpose, the intrinsic simplicity of such people shows. Risk of Death for a Cure ?? I better than them!
