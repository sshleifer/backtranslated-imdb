I still have grains, late nights, no-cables, cheap VHS dubs back to this WiiAa, late-night-commercial and all, when I lived up to an awful hour, they would cut this show - so I could tap it. <br /> <br /> The series was not really for Freddy Kr√ºger - the first few episodes of the first episode were actually something other than the Rod Sterling-Esquier Announcer. Instead, every episode had a different nightmare using terrible childhood, dating, cancer, dating, money, death, dating, and ... hmm ... traditional horror themes from dating. <br /> <br /> Where a teenage boy wrongly tells the wrong girl "I'll love you forever" and stuck with them (literally, at least for a moment, they grew together ...), where a young Stewardess Go home with a weird guy, just to find himself in his cabin, where he has a trophy room with his other stewards, and only I am only vaguely The reserve, which hockey (and with the injuries and penalties) compared with the blind date - on the series was definitely the most horrible thing. <br /> <br /> One episode was as Jeffrey Combos (re-animator, etc.) with a delicious new secret element as a motivated pizza businessman. Not real, but still unclear and fun .... Even <br /> <br /> Some episodes were great. My personal favorite was "This is a sad life" where a young man is trapped in working with his parents' burgers, when he wants to go to college. Talking to yourself and doing small dolls with old cheesecuts - until a big night, a strange guy comes through a drive and suddenly his life is not the same. No, not a Freddy, a cold-filled mind-splitting episode with guns - the last moments that go through the head of the kids ... a <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > The second half of the same episode (Freddie's nightmare was originally two short stories tied vaguely) followed his girlfriend, who was injured, but did not die on the drive, and he was taken from "hack to hospital" - They try the nightmare of the most horrible hospital, and after some time - stop closing your mouth - or wake up during operation - try your dead lover and try to send you to the morgue for a little groin. <br /> <br /> Again, it was my favorite. <br /> <br /> There were several dumplings of episodes, as they were not found in the video. They make the series out as a crummy out, and then someone likes them, the show feels stunk, and then they are not even more on the video. It's a sad life only available in England's Paul DVD - but I'm still going to buy it.
