This show is one of the greatest shows of all time ever to be on television. I played great, suspense, drama, comedy, everything, and with such a simple story: An airplane crashes on an island. Character is great and Evangeline Lilly is hot !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us that he is a great actor, Josh Holley is so cool, George Garcia Hilarius, I could go away. Also, unexpected plot twists, stories behind the characters, that are music at the end of each episode. J.J. Abraham again proved that he was a great writer and producer. I mean this is better than ALIAS, and I like ALIAS. Anyone who is not watching this show, must be considering DVDs and viewing it because they are some of the most desperate ones. This display can probably be the best show in television history !!
