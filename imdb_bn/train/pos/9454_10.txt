Controversially, in the best outdoor adventure films of all time, four dude encounters nature's anger in the surviving story. The setting is in the west of Georgia, with its forests, hills and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> Director, John Burman, chooses to use local people not to act as the locals to identify local characters. These locals portray the film with the in depth characteristic of the film's history. No central casting "actor" could ever come near the extraordinary face, voice, or action of this man. I do not recall a movie where the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. As for anything else, this is a great reality that makes this movie so amazing. <br /> <br /> Another power movie theme. Nature, in the wild, can be violent. How appropriate should the setting be South American. Very few places in the US are violent as the Redeck country. In a story about Darwin's greatest survival, the film speculates that people are part of nature, not different from it. <br /> <br /> Like today, "Liberation War" many products of its time. , Americans express concern over an invisible desert. Combines the beautiful scenery of the film, the bird's sound, the frogs, cricketer and the absence of the river Rapid's roar civilization, all promote an environmental message. And that film is another power. <br /> <br /> At an entertainment stage, the increasing growth of the plot, as the plot revenue. Half the path of the film does not become tension and the final credit rolls it until the roll. Only a few shadow schemes can maintain intensity levels for such a long time. Finally, the technical quality of the film's topnote. Directions and edits are defective. Cinematography is excellent. The dialog is interesting. And acting is awesome. Bert Reynolds has not been well. Ned Beatty is throwing perfectly and makes a fine job. And John Voight should be nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film, it is the music, which hit me horrible. <br /> <br /> Overall, "delivery" often likes outdoor adventure, which will attract viewers. Even for those who do not have enough characteristic, acting, and intriguing excitement for this film, it is good enough to see this movie, one of the best in film history.
