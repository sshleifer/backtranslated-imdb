You think that you have come to see some of the most spectacular places when the movie is primarily in two letters, such as they travel 3000 miles or from Saudi Arabia to France, most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey before reaching the Middle East. But this is not a tour, and there is no stopover for emphasis in philosophy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, walking and taking a cage After the question goes out, he likes to travel to Mecca by car. He can not drive, and so helped Rada to protest against his son, to get there in his broken car <br /> <br /> <br /> But Rida did not see him go beside him when he Parents could opt for the plane. He thinks he can not keep his personal life for this private pilgrimage. And so, we have stopped on this difficult journey with our father and son, not the best of friends. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this movie is the testimony of the development of the father and son, the challenges they face, the strange people they meet, duke it out in different weather conditions, and the rest stop in motor and motor sleep. We saw a clear generation gap between them, the parents are trying to communicate with each other, the father is trying to put pressure on his son, and the boy is trying to claim himself as an adult, but what we saw shows, the radios are out of water. Pretty fish . By having many faces, they actually work quite well despite their differences. <br /> <br /> This photo is suitable enough to meet Hari Rai Puja in the past week and other pilgrims join in their custody to see our plays. Seeing the final scene of Mecca is really a sight, and you too feel Claustrophobia and fear because Raida tries to find thousands of people to find her father. The sights of Europe may not have been deliberately inhabited, so that the prospect of final destination can be increased and focused. <br /> <br /> This must increase the thinking of showing and showing loved ones. For those who are they Do not miss it, and yes, initially book - I was satisfied that this evening's session was still full house.
