BASEketball is one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. It is an off-the-wall movie starring South Park manufacturers Matt Stone and Tray Parker. They play two Slaker friends who make a sport on their driveway that becomes a national sensation. Most gags are really ridiculous but the most interesting part of the movie is when the players try to make the opposition team "confident". There are no rules that are not allowed, so naturally they can do crazy things. An error in this movie is that the speed is very fast, and after looking for almost half an hour, I asked myself "Wow what is it already?" How else is the hilarious part of the movie Joe and Doug constantly envy Skikka, who is a hippoday little man BASEketball is a comedic classic with a very low quoted line, and it's so fun to see!
