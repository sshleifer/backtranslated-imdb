I first invented the Alexander Corda (1940) fantasy, the bill in Baghdad's "The Wonderful Show of the Century" in the early 1950s! Both Corda Technikola's films, Baghdad and Jungle book themes have never been shown in the forgotten program. Miklas Rozza's music has enhanced both films. The technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! Baghdad's novel remains on my list as the best fantasy film of Seratom. Over the years, the color of the film becomes more difficult to enjoy in the original form. True technicians gave an Eastman color process in the mid-1950s. Key No and Samuel Goldwin both re-released theatrical and video film. But Eastman-colored prints muted the vibration of more pastel and key technology in nature. There is a palace appearance in the Laser Disc release of this title - nice, but it should not be. Now comes MGM DVD (3 December 2002). Baghdad's Theophthia again has a wonderful technicolor, it is a DVD that is nothing to reduce it !!! It was good to see again that once I was watching the DVD, I saw it the second time. Only "extra" is a Spanish dubbed version, both subtitled English and Spanish and a well-executed core theater trailer. Thank you for this awesome DVD release MGM Now, someone can expect that the four features of CARD and the recovery version of the Crosby's Jungl book (for transferring bad domain prints in circulation) will soon follow the DVD.
