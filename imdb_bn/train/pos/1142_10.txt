Until HBO started rerunning this month. I returned to the theater in 1991, laughing loudly, and now again in my living room. If I see it is on, I have to see it. There are only any questions. This is more entertaining than the other, more popular like airplanes like Spuf! (Which I really like, BTW). Kathy Moriarty stole the show in my opinion. Opinion "Sudden speech! The last symptom of the fever in the brain! He can turn around at any moment!" Keep me on the edge And this is not funny from the hype Goldberg jumping 'Jack Flash'. Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Doni Junior introduced all the anticipated superb acting. I started giving out 9 out of 10, but then I realized that this is supposed to be for such a movie, there is not anything I want to change or improve. So 10 is it. I have to get this to DVD, that's just it.
