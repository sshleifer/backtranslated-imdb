Sunday Sunday is not without an action movie, and when you want intense warfare, then you go to Tom Berena (Platoon). <br /> <br /> Here he plays a sniper in the jungle after rebel and drug officials. Life is a bitch, so he found a green office type (Billy Jane) to help the mission. <br /> <br /> This image is in the hands of Louise Losser, who has pushed Anaconda. He does not do much better here, but Bearer does the film proper. <br /> <br /> Of course, it might be a little longer - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle, but the time is right, when the time is the action of the time.
