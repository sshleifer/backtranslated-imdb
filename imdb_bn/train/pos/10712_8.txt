This film is best described or compared with "Big Fish" (film by Tim Burton). But it's a less fun and more you face the story. And of course there is no father here, but his grandfather tells the story. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie goes further behind (so you can tell more than I can tell you before reading movies). It's funny and compelling, even though you go from one story to another and get some dramatic moments. The things that you do not expect here are astonishing to you here and there. Then a nice small movie, that deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like that! Hey)
