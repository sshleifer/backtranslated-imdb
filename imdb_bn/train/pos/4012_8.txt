After some difficulties, Johnny Umaah reached her sick uncle's farm for daily operation, only to find out the old man was killed by his gold digger wife and the terrible brother of the woman. <br /> <br /> Good production value, preferred performance by Mark Dammon and a boring action packed script, makes it an entertainer, though not deeper than the average addition of Spammt Western. <br /> <br /> Co-star Rosalba Neri screen grace is one of the hottest European babes ever. Here he is absolutely perfect as cold-hearted user (and abusing) of weak men. <br /> <br /> Suppression and Neri appear together in at least one other film, The Devils Weekend Night, a superb horror movie. Special interest for you who want to see what Rosalba's dresses are at the bottom.
