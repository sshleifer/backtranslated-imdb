I think you have to be so much fun to be in the US. But if you like Princess Bride and Forrest Gump, you would love this movie. You certainly can not compare to the quality of the movie, but the Cameraman trip is definitely done. The killer tomato is better than that of the Napoleonic Dynamite. Only my opinion. I'm sure French people will not appreciate the joke of the French. So this picture is not for the world viewers. And I'm not a trained movie critic, I know what I like. I could not stop smile through the whole movie. My side and my jaw were hit at the end of the movie.
