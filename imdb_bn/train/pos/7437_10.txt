Recently, when we were growing up in the 1950s, a friend and I were discussing education and moral effects. He mentioned Samuel Taylor Colliery, who wrote The Reim of the Ancient Mariner in 1798. Both of us were part of epic poetry in high school and needed to be sent to the college's English Literature syllabus. My friend said, "His message may even be called metaphysical in today's context." <br /> <br /> We tried to read it and just remember the bits and pieces. (There is a problem to remember Dr. Sais.) I said I received two copies of the poem so that everyone can read. It was easy enough, but I wondered what made it a film. We look forward to seeing the film to see how the film has been interpreted. Lastly, the old Mariner's Raim is not just light. After reading each poem, we saw this movie together. <br /> <br /> We considered this movie as a remarkable achievement, especially in the 1970's, before the computer, the so-called "Why Burners Before Effects", "Special Effects" and often began to compensate for the lack of substance. The th and the 20th century image "Less Known Artist", which was initially highlighted by Hollywood designer Wiley Pogani. <br /> <br /> This film is titled Sir Michael Redgrave It has been told that when he was a teacher in the school, he taught poetry, the poem added the authenticity and authority of the verse. <br /> <br />'s skills are published in the layers of clear messages, without the "instruction", or an oppressive and obvious The story of morality is going on. Today's 'in your mouth' and 'pressed over the head' mentality let us make it a fresh change. Most of today's morality messages in the movie are bi-dimensional: extreme violence, murders and Mahmood bad: Bad, really, bad, and good super heroes, seems to have no shortage of human character. The Raima of the ancient Mariner is a celebration of the character of the person, Expressions of gratitude for celebrating the life of prosperity, in a broader context of humanity, that is, to be given to others The ability. <br /> <br /> While proud to find this "unknown" gem, we learned that it has won the top five categories of five divisions in the "Name" International Film Festival six times in five. Another surprise was the film's director Raul de Silva, who wrote the first award winning author of animation and six award winning books about the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo message is relevant today, if not more, but Colliery wrote the original epic poem and when it was translated into film by Raul da Silva. If I was still studying in high school, which I did for five years, I would catch it and show it to all my students. In fact, as long as there is a spiritual element of humanity, there is a level of discussion in the light of the big and important issues facing all of us - 17, 9, 1978, or today. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
