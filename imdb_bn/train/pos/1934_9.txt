I watched the Big Bad Suwim at the Tamikula Film Festival of 2006, and guided by how much I grabbed it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> Swimming classes for different reasons. A ridiculous idea for the right to own, the class acts as a catalyst for big changes in student life. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the fact that this picture is real. Seldom the ensemble pieces are very good treatment character. I enjoyed the scene in the class scene, and the drama that took place outside was very shameless. Nothing seems to be out of place or character, and in the end it has left a very strong feeling, to attend school or summer camp - where you find fast friends, build strong ties and discover yourself, but soon to leave soon <br /> <br /> <br /> My only complaint was that Paula's character was a very strong and unusual role, To be published at the end than you want to know more about him. I think you can not meet everyone in the class, though <br />, I got this movie very well and was quite enjoyable. See it when you get the chance.
