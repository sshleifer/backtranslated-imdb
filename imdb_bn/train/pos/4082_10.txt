Hya Miyazaki is not the same as using a hand-drawn animation as a story, but it is often compared to Walt Disney. It is very unfair, because seeing Miazaki's films he became clear that he was the best actor. He has given an exciting gift to both the big and the big kids, and Laputa is really a great journey. <br /> <br /> But I can begin to describe a movie so early and exciting! Miazaki's work never surprised me. Laputa is a great adventure on a grand scale and wonder how I packed so much with a film detail and imagination. Ask yourself this question: If you see a child with such great glory of opportunity and so wizards, what will it be like? The answer is to have a bit of whip on your seat and see Laputa, because it is really a childhood imagination true. Every minute of the movie is rich and stimulating ... from amazing aviation-flying sequences from the train's chase ... and a wonderful sight of the floating fortress. Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Haseyi! You probably want everything from an adventure movie to here.
