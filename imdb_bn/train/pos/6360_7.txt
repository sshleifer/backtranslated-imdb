I read a direct written comment for this photo which is in front of the result of the vote and below the cast run. <br /> <br /> Why not take pictures of some people that are supposed to be it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is light hearted, cheeky, family comedy, laughing kids and Creating things for adults, and this movie is exactly like this. /> <br /> I opened my nuts in this film, I thought Keri was a great performance and the whole picture (if seen on Christmas) really lets you celebrate the festival. <br /> <br /> So all of you are from film critics Trying to sound like it and threatened every movie because it is not "taxi driver" or "the godfather" and they are supposed to be Get movies for her, entertainment !!
