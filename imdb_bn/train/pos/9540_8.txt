Most of the opinions heard about the Meatball Machine were mixed quite well. A couple even said that they "sucked it". Well, to the people I say, get some F @kkine and go to your own @ck It was a very entertaining glimpse. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical bug that attacks and in some way transforms its hosts into the deaths of Good-CommNeam, called Good Roborgs. Finally you will learn that these mechanical bugs attach a little parasite on you, which enables you to control your activities due to the heating of your nervous system. Unfortunately for two young adults alone, they love to go along with the mechanical bugs, and you know that it is happening and blood is being lost. Is there a way to stop conversion? Perhaps the way to stop this mechanical bug threat? Why Necroborgs Will Fight Each Other? Do the two great units do not express their feelings for each other and make them nasty? <br /> <br /> I was very careful due to mixed reaction to the meatball machine, but it became a wonderful phenomenon. Some unforeseen questions, some of the average acting and a little confusing finale at some point I can only think of weak points. Feeling that from an anime, parasites are becoming lesser characters, and even in the face of low budget, this movie hits a much more accurate sign than miss. An all-time evolving story that is interesting enough to ask yourself questions about the mix of great make-up effects and blood splitter, it should be a check out of a fascinating fan of Vijara / Awesome / Tetsuo / Splatter fans. 8 out of 10
