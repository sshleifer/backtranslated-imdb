I was lucky enough to see this without any pre-watching hype. The next day, I was a ghost in my mind and the next day I was surprised. I've seen it 3-4 times, and every time I appreciate more. The settings are gorgeous, evening loungers have beautiful lighting effects, Marsh's long shots, and the house itself is raised with enough cucumber. The main hero is so liked and well nature, that he is easily sympathetic. To the complainant who did not have enough 'spark' in this movie, I would say that because of this, the entire fight against ghost is being done by this one person. It is a fairly slow film, it spends an unusual amount of time, before and after the Scratch attack, its character with family and career development. SPOILERS Discussion / <br /> <br /> I like the bending point when I return to the main city and explains the help of people and watching the ghosts. He described the black woman, and then at the end of the conversation he said that he was going back, because after all, what did he do? Other people say, "You will not be back ... alone!" And the hero lends his dog. The cute little dog gives a short break from the comic refresh, it is also out of the house and even in the locked room. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It shows that it is not afraid of the church and it is not shameful or even confined to the house. All at the very beginning of this. Another incredible memorable scene was with the children outside the church fence, watching the funeral. As the pan on the right of the camera, the women are seen in the background in the gravestones. The elderly people do not even look at it, but all of the kids are yelling and taunting. Crreeepy ... is usually hidden in the shadow of Scratch, specific locals or people hunting. As mentioned, Scratch's scruples and anger are scared, and I had to attack it and finish was perfect and completely fair. At the end, this deer highlights that the hero has made a big mistake after returning home. Or perhaps he stores Gypsy girl, no matter what was identified. The person playing the hotel manager is so trustworthy, and really plays a good role. I have spread the word to my friends about enjoying this movie, and reassuring others to think the same way. I can see that people do not see the same wonderful composition, especially if they go with a lot of review analysis. <br /> <br /> I think another person says that the film determines whether the ghost can physically harm humans or not. Whew .. I followed this by tonight Changling planned to see it again, aaww yes Any other pictures to recommend? <br /> <br /> Thank you,
