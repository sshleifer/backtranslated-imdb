Overall I want to say that I liked the movie. Some of the war scenes are really good. Especially fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One thing that really bothered me was that they used Asian to play a black man. I really mean that. Talk about bad taste. During a battle scene, you see that one of the fighters on the floor smiles. Otherwise, Sammo copes perfectly in Bruce Lee's battle. 5 out of 10.
