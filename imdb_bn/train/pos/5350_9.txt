I have seen Running Man many times that I have Stephen King fan and all his movies, but now it's better because I did not know about this website until 2 days ago and I did not understand that Paul Michael was the same as the Glazer associated with this film, Paul Michael Glazer I grew up in StarSky and Hutch television shows. This is an amazing surprise for me because I did not tell you how many times when I was hit by Starkey or Hutch, wept. Starsky (Kiel Straski) This episode of death was about to escape from my dad's show. What do you expect from children at the age of 12? Now, I deliberately look for movies and programs involving Paul or David Soul and there is no hand in Steven King's hand so I'm there !!!!!!!! Just say happy birthday Paul !!!!!
