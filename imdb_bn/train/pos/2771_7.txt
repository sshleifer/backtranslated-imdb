David and Bathsheba are Henry King's Dirtyl F. Gravory Pack [King David], Susan Hairdress (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kiran Moore (Uriah) and Jenny Midos (Michael), created from the 20th Century Fox of Junk. <br /> <br /> This image is based on the second Old Testament book of Samuel from the Holy Bible. It follows King David, who killed Goliath as a child, and now we find him as the second king of Israel in adulthood. A solid and assured king, because of the heart of David's heart, is causing great problems. Once he is spying while bathing Bathsheba; It starts a journey with adultery and betrayal. A journey will end in the end of God's journey. <br /> <br /> In general, David and Bathsheba are producing a massive, grandoja. From his excellent set design, in the positively superb technicolor photography {Leon Shamrows}, it has enough quality to put quality alongside, which offers quality as the standard of production. Curiously, this film is a little intelligent and based on the 99% price, it is fully driven by dialogue. None of this action requires that fans to swash something or go with their bucket. This is a very human image, actually does not hurt the flames around here, it is a biblical love story blurred with the sin of heart. But this is not a bad thing, because of breaking it we found it very good (a great, yet weaker thing of pack is going well and Howard is pushing it most) and it's a well-known story that often forgets Henry King. And although some of the dialogues are narrowly inspired, then Philip Doon (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) never misses the character flow by drawing attention to the characters across the screenplay nominated by Oscar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the conditions on the forgotten picture of the Bible / sword and sandal styles (perhaps it is a piece piece that has heart as its main selling point), but in fact, one of the most sculptures of generation is of value to anyone who is interested in it. 7/10
