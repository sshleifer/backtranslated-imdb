Even though critics are disgusting, Johnny Desgersley is one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. This is a movie which should be closely monitored; Some of the fun bits are passed and they do not have the usual attention to the attention. For example, monitor the use of Michael Ketan's pet store-bought gun and the appearance of surveillance style years at the beginning of the scenes. This is one of the rare movies where you've oddly joked, though you know it's a comedy. Director Amy Hacklerling, really sharp here - if you enjoy his famous movies (Fast Times at Regemont High, Claus, European Vacations), you have to give it a look. <br/> <br /> <br /> Michael Cutton's title role is very much liked in the cast and supporting cast (Gryffin Dunne, Mauryne Stapleton, Joe PiscoPo, Peter Boyle). Highly recommended.
