It's been about 5 years to publish this stylish Action Flick. I saw this movie about 10 times and it is a great effort by Gautam. From my point of view, I think this movie is virtually faultless. Sun ACP Ennavilvan - No doubt ... Classy. Jayathika played her role as Maya. She loves the character very well. Panda was the attention of the audience in the role of the film. Life played the role of Pandya very well. The barbarous and frightened IvFA achieved the Best Life Award for Best Villain Award in 2004. Courtesy of Daniel Balaji, Devdharshini and other supporting actress Gautamam Harris Gerez heard all the charts-booster and BGM movies very well. Ardis Rajsekhar painter is rich. Peter Hin stunts the best screenplay. Anthony's edit is correct. All of them, Kakha Kacha is a perfect film which is a perfect dose of action and romance. <br /> <br /> Even some Hollywood movies can not compete with kakhacha ... undoubtedly.
