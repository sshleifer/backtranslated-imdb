The film was made several years later, but I wanted to score one or two points because of being poor rather than sound quality. Occasionally, the film is sometimes seen as a silent film during scenes (the usual ambiguity sounds are absent). However, given it in 1931 and a French movie, it is quite apt. In particular, it is also seen in the next French films - which should work entirely on word problems (eg, from L'Atlant in 1934). <br /> <br /> Well, in addition to some tiny word problems, it's a cute little film about a missing winner lottery ticket and a long list of trying to get it. And, there are a number of small songs that you can not help while searching. All in all a beautiful charming film.
