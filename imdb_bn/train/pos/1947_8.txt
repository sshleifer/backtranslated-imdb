Spoilers Like other posters, I felt that the end was a little unexpected. I have liked to see the return of crew back to life on earth after their return. I guess the writer had anticipated this problem by some vigas "Front loading" in Earth's sequences at the beginning of this episode. (Of course, that time limit has been eliminated, so it's all awake.) I like that Admiral Janway died for Viejo Cruz. As a fan, we get our cake and eat it, both of Janway make the final sacrifice and live. I acknowledge that Janegree's scenes and his old-fashioned conversations were intimidated and could easily penetrate the camp. Fortunately, Malgra pulled it off.
