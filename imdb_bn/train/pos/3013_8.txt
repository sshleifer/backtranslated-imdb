Gifted Detector Mr. Filho Vans (William Powell) canceled his overseas trip to investigate a apparently cut and dry case of suicide, suspecting that the suspicious reason is really much, rather spontaneous complicated murder! <br /> <br /> As far as the murder mystery goes, the film does not get any better than that. Because it is very difficult to combine it or cover its head around it, it is really difficult to see what the boy is looking forward to, because of the good reason for the murder of suicidal victims of suicides, associated with suspected characters, and to kill suicide victims. Even police, duties and district attorneys have proved to be colorful, adding unexpected bitter reality levels to these characters and increasing its overall "fun" factor. I especially enjoyed the anecdotal scenes (played by Atteni Giraadot), who always thinks that he is unreasonable and inadvertently interrupted by the discovery of corpses or wounded men during this ongoing time. Also Eugene Palat's Intelligence Sgt. Heath welcomed, often humorous at the expense of his later, critical commentary during vans investigation. I can not think of any criticism of this movie, perhaps it might not be particularly good. The film does not stop just plain good fun. See and see if you wrap your head around this one mystery. Highly recommend you try!
