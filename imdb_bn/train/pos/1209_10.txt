In an era of such horrible cartoons, I am rather shocked to see a movie with good morals, it makes the list of IMDB buttons ready for animated movies. <br /> <br /> This movie opposes the first. I would not deny that. However, when I was in the target age group for this movie, I did not even notice it, and if I do it, it would not be full. Those who created it may use the "new generation" that it can be another way to care beer family. Perhaps we have decided how to start the Care Bear family. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite movie at the age of 3-6, and it does not frighten me or confuse me. <Br /> <br />
