This movie was really a great glimpse of something that influenced us. I know I personally have run into this many times. Thanks to Honesty Will Smith Driving While text messaging has run onto social problems. Man, do not do it. There is not enough time for one hour and forty minutes. Personally, I wanted to throw my cell phone after the movie. I was glad to see other people in the theater and dumped their phones with empty bags of popcorn. I have decided to disable all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do the same. If you care for your family, see this important public announcement announcement in sending text messages while driving or they can kill seven people. Thanks for showing us the way.
