Val Kilmer ... love or hate him, sometimes he gets under a skin of the character and pulls a performance which you go to 'Hey! This guy is a great actor! He went to Jim's skin pants at the door and he did it again in the public skin underpants. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What Kilmer encourages low-life so easily? Celebrity, anyone that it was overwhelms it and then lost it to do something of that hunger. Look at him, you know what I mean.
