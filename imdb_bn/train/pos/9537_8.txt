Someone may think that the rating I give is a bit more liberal, but for this movie I think that the directors have done a good job of providing them, this is also a movie which is a movie of taste! <br /> <br /> My immediate thought was direct connection to the classic culture film 'The Thing', that is, parasitic alien from outer space, where attacking the human host, then where possible is <br /> <br / > <br /> You can see that this movie is a film and a ghost / gore reverence to others, still maintains its own originality as well, as well as this genius S fight for each other, and then began to eat the endangered opponents! Just kill a person and pick up when needed a new host! Then pick another war with another infected host! And even if this picture throws a story of love, I will not say it otherwise otherwise it is too far away. <br /> <br /> Great! But I said a received taste, so if you do not like the film, do not be surprised. It is a low budget and yes it turns blood thirsty, animal / alien / things into their raw weapons, such as fox, drills, blades and even strange guns, but decimates the opponents. I saw that I was shown, but I was glued to the screen, wondering what was going to happen next day! <br /> <br /> So if you like Gore, you like Alien, you love war and maybe even somewhere somewhere in love, I must definitely see this movie. I just wish I came here before I am!
