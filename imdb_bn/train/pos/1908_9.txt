This show is done beautifully. Although it came first when I found it to be a light-hearted family comedy with several good-one-fishing boats though. With many concepts of parents and children, many families really started to express themselves, but as I said, I never thought that it was even better in the evening. However, my view was shot to other windows when the legendary John Rotor suffered a tragic death. The show was her role, and she really appreciated the life of the carotetry very sensitively, for which to be done, talented talented talent also touched the heart of all the complimentary novels of John Rotor. When the show next to the reiters was broadcast, I really wanted to embrace my father and wanted to tell him how much he had given me to me. I thought this shadow had spread the acting talents of three children, especially the character of Bridget, who wanted to recognize him as the last word. It reminded me that I do not say any terrible things to my dad, I do not pay them and it is very important that he knows this. Great show
