The show is about two sisters living together. Holly A little boy has some teenage problems, his sister-in-law's job is, boyfriend, mothers, like most women, women of this world. They sometimes try to support each other by mistake but they do not give up and continue. And show friendship too. Priority of life. I like this show so much. It's funny and the actor is so good. I'm really sad that the show is over. I still watch the reruns of time :) :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny can be new comedy, but she really plays well. She is one of the actress to act like. I like Vince and Holly's relationship, they are very normal. Gary is a natural talent and he appears to make you smile up the bar. Tina Holly found a real friend with and I really liked hanging them. Lauren's character is so funny and she is a natural talent. I want to see him more This show really takes you and makes you smile. I have not finished the show.
