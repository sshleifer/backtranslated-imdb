This is not just a great movie, but I appreciate the writer and director for doing something a little different. The main theme of the movie is fate and small, seemingly obscure things that can change in the future. In some ways it reminds me of the sliding doors of film, although instead of focusing on a random event, seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly, and each one helps in the beautiful conclusion. Plus, a strange lip guy understands all this and he discusses it during a brief scene - as if he is some kind of Almighty, but there is no explanation in the film (as the two boys fight each other) clock timer in PROXY) <br /> <br /> DVD jacket just shows Audrey Tautou. It is the capital of its success on AMLA, though he is one of the film's actors and has no role to play in his role. Speed ​​intense, acting fine and conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I did it was to score more, some of the characters were somewhat unusual and I think the film might be strong with few other concubines.
