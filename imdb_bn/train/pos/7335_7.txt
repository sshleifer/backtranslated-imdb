Most of his films with Ralph Baksi are like two sharp swords. You'll get something awesome from it but you keep it with stupid and unnecessarily cheezy. The Lord of the Rings is a great adaptation of the story, which was probably not always bright in the animation section. <br /> <br /> The fire and the groom from Bakshshi from the point of animation is a great achievement. Rotoscoping has much more detail and animations, it has a vibrant look. You will still get some slow-cell and little blogger background painting, but the last fiction of Buxi is all better after the epic. Animation is almost realistic-style, and unlike the LETR where this style was weird with real content, here it enhances the film's unique environment. Unfortunately, the film failed to create a meaningful story from its simple setting and indeed most of the letters of the letters are quite unclear. Although Lorne and Tigre were simple events, it was very difficult to follow the main villain Neckrun that the Guy was not even mentioned (also known as 'The Guy)' with the Fry Fash Mask. Although the voice actor was mostly good, there are some strange jokes in the audio section, and whenever they are screaming, they often listen to the terrible sounds. However, I believe that the intrinsic entertainment value of the movie unnecessarily crosses the plot lines to the foolish execution. A small part of the character is something that you will never end, but it helps you to remind yourself that this film will not be taken very seriously. It's still a hello cool and really fun.
