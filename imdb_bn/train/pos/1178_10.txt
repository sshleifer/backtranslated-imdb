It was a good dream it could be WWE's second best PPV after Wrestlemania! John Senna had a nice match in which he bothered Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained his IC title in a small drunk match with William Regal. Bobby and Spike Doodle won a fairly violent table in Benoit and Guerrero. Jemy Noble had a very good match with Kidman, which I had. Booker defeats beauty show in a doc match, at one point, Booker gives a big show to the cass and send him through the table. In the stupid conclusions of WWE Christian and Lance Storm, disgusting anti-Americans defeated Hugan and Edge and provided much support from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock were filled with great high marks in the night match and RVD managed to hold their IC title through a DQ, so I was happy to win the title. Triple H also signed with Irisch Bischoff and Raw which means nothing of little means. And in the main event Rock became the first 7-time WWE World Champion, with both Kurt Angle and Undertaker defeating the threat thrice. Overall this is probably the second best PPV of 2002's WWE! 7/10
