Another critic thinks this is a horror film. This is not just true and a little inappropriate. <br /> <br /> acting is a good quality and the direction continues with a balanced fluid. I do not think there is something wrong with tarantino-esquire way of interlocking stories together. Perhaps it's just a new tool to try for managers. I thought it made the film more interesting. Perhaps some of the script's components need to be rigid, but it's only about what I'll find. Mistara Cantilana gives a great performance like Sylvio, also Antonella Rio is exclusive and the value of admission is valuable.
