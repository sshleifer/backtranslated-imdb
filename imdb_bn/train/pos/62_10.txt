I absolutely love this movie As soon as I could find a copy of it I bought it. This movie was so much emotion, and so felt real, I could really sympathize with the characters. Every time I see it, the last makes me cry. I can really recognize Phil's character, and if the same thing happens to me, then how will it take? <br /> <br /> I think all high schools will show this movie, maybe it's the same thing that people can ignore. I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone else. Especially those who were affected by school shooting. <br /> <br /> This is truly one of the greatest movies of all time.
