Seeing Charlie Burman in Long Way Round with Ian McGregor I was very interested in what Charlie would look like on her own show. I landed too Charlie and came across as a lovely guy who is down on earth. Celebrities are great to struggle with their weight and fitness, it also shows their people! I do not know a lot about the bike, but this show has pushed me right from the beginning. Preparations and organizations for this event seem extraordinary. The event itself seems very dangerous and why I'm Charlie and everyone else doing it and fascinating to see how far she gets. I love the show's speed and upbeat music fast. I can not believe he broke his collar bone, I really hope the end does not end, I can not wait to see the next episode ...
