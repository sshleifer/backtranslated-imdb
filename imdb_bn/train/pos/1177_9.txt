I saw many PPV in the past but it's the most entertaining, intense PPV and I saw that the most complete DVD. DVD extras are valuable because it gives a different perspective on how the audience works after the show (such as Chris Benoit interview / front interview), Monday's Night Warrocks give some attention, the first title of Hogan's winning tag is Gold and some promotional talk. There is also a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Tag Team Table Match: Bobby Ray and Spike Doodle vs. Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoitte 7/10 It was a pretty intense match to start this show. Does not hold too much and just pure raw physics. Spike can hold on to his table matches, and Gero and Benoit have good wrestling skills on the mat. <br /> <br /> WWE Crucierweight Championship: Jamaica Nobel Will / Nidia V. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd did not really care about the wrestler and did not get interested until Kidman's shooting star was pressed. Generally people expect to fly a lot more in the Cruzer Weight Championship, but it was very little. Actually it was so bad that when the Nobel hit its end, nobody cared or did not know it (you can tell by the lack of flashing cameras). The end was fast though. <br /> <br /> WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy V. William Regal 5/10 I never liked Rasal as a wrestler, lacking his intensity and style. Hardy was impressive but did not have the opportunity to show off his high flying job, though he has still done some good counters and added that fast needed speed. It is perfect for this match which is fast closed off. <br /> <br /> 4. John Sena V. Chris Jericho 6/10 Sina's first PPV, how she worked, how she dressed, and how she was looking (see her interview, it's pretty funny) looks like fun. It was a great match, including military, handsets, counters and some of the different types of sky show. Jericho was a sub-par, but clearly Sina helped start his career. Army wins. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontinental Championship: RVD V. Brock Lesnar 8/10 It was a very intense and good match. With both broker pure power and raw power versus both the skills and speed of RVDs, both wrestler styles really match well on the screen. RVD was excellent in this match (better than his next match with his side and the army) and the whole match was in quick pace. In the end, it works perfectly because it still preserves unknowable strokes of the brakes when RVD is giving her only dessert in her home state. <br /> <br /> 6. No disqualification match: Booker T.V. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacks a certain intensity as RVD match but still a good follow up. Although it started slowly (which was always with great shoe) the booker was great and the announcer took sick steps on the table. The Finnishs were horrible, finally there was a big disaster and a big step for Booker. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge Wei. Christian and Lance Storm 5/10 It was a medieval match. Hogan comes out like a huge pop, but it lacks the intensity and strength of his moves. Then again Christians do not have the power of the greatest athlete themselves. It ended up being the best one middle match but was still just right for the PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple threat matches for indefinite championship: 10/10 Rock V. Undertaker v. Cart Angle <br /> <br /> Easily match the year. This is by far the best triple threat I've ever seen. It was close, lots of finishers, stolen finishers, raw power, intensity and speed was fast. Can anyone predict who might come to this forecasts? If you are going to buy this DVD then I will buy it strictly for this match. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although it's hard to find (I had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD), it would certainly be worth your money.
