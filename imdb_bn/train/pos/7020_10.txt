* I identify where the spoilers are! Overall comment: If you can take a serious movie, check it out. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Do not leave the theater because you are confused! The second half of the movie nicely fits together. When I open the film openly, I will take my mom to see it again. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see it in screening a few weeks ago, when the will was near the promotion. He was great - I spent a lot of time with fans. Thank you for the photo! About the performance of the Will: Sometimes you see an actor film famous for any other movie / show, then give them their opinion about their current performance and you feel like them for their past performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this film. When I was watching this movie, I did not see the fresh prince (lull). He was completely and fully convincing about this very, very serious role. She has been highly raised as an actor. I think he'll get an Oscar for at least this performance. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben has a lot of conflict and pain. He is sad ... criminals-terrorists ... very strong, but very scared. It is very true to yourself. There is a lot of depth in his character ... and anyway, bring life. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario has done a great job by illustrating Emily, a woman behind her behind. Maybe he will not be a star in this movie, but he was very convinced. I think his character was not enough to work just like a will. <br /> <br /> About the plot (no spoilers): I admit that I do not like the movie until the second half of it. I did not know anything about this about the film and did not understand anything until the second part of it. But finally things fit together, wow. Wonderfully good writing and good thoughts. This is a very intense movie that really batches with you. <br /> <br /> It really takes a lot from you. I was in the theater, most of the people were crying - even the old man. When you understand what Ben is doing, and why, this is a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* Talking for the reason at the small speaker ***** is really the main thing away Plot without I think too much about this movie knowingly it really destroyed. Although I enjoyed the movie there were many symbols. I'll mention something here (without trying too much). <br /> <br /> - Bane kept fish in his hotel room. At first, it makes no sense. There was a lot of stupidity in the movie theater when people realized the reality of fish. <br /> <br /> - I hate Ben at the beginning of the movie. Finally I love him and hate him. That was how the believer was will. I thought there was a huge quarrel in Ben-Izra, a blind man trying to make his way to the earth. He became so clearer after the movie that he was doing Agra treatment. Although it is waiting. Everything in this movie: wait. <br /> <br /> - Ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he does not forgive himself. It was still unclear if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to free himself from his crime, or if he wanted to help the real man. I think this is a little bit of both ... I think he wanted to help the people but would be free from their past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you understand that what he is doing is not surprising. In both physical and mental situations, he is doing himself (as a very good person) because you hate him. Excellent work will be done.
