In this movie Judy Garland in 1943 thinks that she will not be ready for a big time by the person she loves-van Halffin. This film must have had a major change for Halflin, especially after winning the Oscar's "Johnny Ezer" previous year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Could not be the mother of four of their grandchildren? <br /> <br /> The singing and dancing is just wonderful, but the romance romance between Halfline and the Garland is shown on the left side. It was like a gigi where a young girl finally trod her legs with her joke.
