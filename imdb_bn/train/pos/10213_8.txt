This strange movie was very popular "Amelie" was unfortunate to release at the same time, both of them played the central role of strange Audrey Toyou. Laurente Ferod, talented director made one of the most enjoyable movies from recent memory in France. <br /> <br /> This film is related to the scope, as it refers to its English title. The French title refers to the butterflies that fly as they fly, along with the Atlantic as well as the cyclone in the Pacific region, these colorful insects can not be believed to be seen only. From the beginning, it is difficult to imagine the characters that the director sees in the film and how each one has connections, but it seems to work well in the film's context. <br /> <br /> Setting the voice for the film at an opportunity meeting in the Metro. Irene, who is going to work, is asked what she has on the Russian streets and what does it mean to read from her paper? Irene, it seems that he will cross the road and find the partner of his soul the same day. When Irene left the train, the quiet young man sitting next to the woman told him that his birthday was in Irene. Looks like they are lucky to each other since the beginning, but alas, they will not reconnect till the end of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fauldler does not have much to do to the end, but he has shown that he has presence in it Playing Gifted young custom made a valuable contribution to the success of the movie, which is lighter like butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We are looking forward to the future films of Laurent Ferro because he is a director with the heart. An ear to connect with the right place and the people.
