I wanted to remember the 10th anniversary of Marcelo Mestrianian that many of her inexperienced films owned by her VHS; However, given my ongoing light heart Christmas marathon, I would just have to do with this one! As it happens, it features one of the best performances - and it was nominated for the Oscars only (the movie was also honored). It was also one of the most widely recognized star 14 co-operation from Italy, Sophia Lorraine; Both, incidentally, are playing against the type here - as a helpless housewife and he is a gay! However, the title of the film has a double meaning: the top letters are collected on the historic day, in which Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event is shown in long archive footage), but it is also more 'friendly' The moment ', which they share in friendship, expression and brief, emotional moments - although everybody knows The inevitable return to their normal existence, which is the end of film abrupt bitasamyanera. It is about two-elephants (with all other characters - save for the apartment block's noji concierge, which completes the story - in which Lorraine's hatred and sincerely patriotic husband, John Vernon has been amazingly performed, only the beginning and closing sequence in it); Still, the narrow setting does not interrupt Skola (for record, it's his 7th film which I saw and owns more than 3 VHS) and filmmaker Pasqualino de Santis, that result - at least the keys - even though far spread: The camera allows to inspire different sections of the big building, the situation deeply or unexpectedly monitors the situation, But the situation is always aware. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Impossible); However, it was interesting, but Lorraine went with the prize under their home, but the people of Maurianian are still out of bounds (Films, some suspiciously, their anti-fascism seems similar!) Who have generally influenced international audiences!
