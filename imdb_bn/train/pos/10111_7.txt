Hounded World of Edward D. Wood, Junior is not a special documentary. Aesthetically, it is relentless and looking perfect, people go to Tantt, which makes it very inefficient and monolithic, but it adds to its kiss. I say this because it is a strange documentary film that created strange pictures and surrounds itself with co-workers and thus, there is no other way to document people's life and career and crew. Both insights in talent and timber discrepancy have some insight, and both credits illustrate the virtues of a documentary genuineness. Overall, it's a watch price for wood fans and ordinary movies, but do not expect brightness here. A documentary hope made after the wooden own heart.
