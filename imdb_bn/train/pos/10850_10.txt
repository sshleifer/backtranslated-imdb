What a good movie! Finally a picture of an unknown side of the rock: the illusion of fame. The well-known Rockbars are old and forgotten, not music. And with a good sense of humor. <br /> <br /> However, Crazy is probably the best movie I've ever seen about Rock Naylor. For example, a lot better than a spin tap. Why? Because still crazy, people are mature. They have a different aspect about love and life, about the rock. They want to miss too much with their crazy young people. Over the story itself, we see the characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
