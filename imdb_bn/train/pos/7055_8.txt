Although Cinderella does not have a clear choice of love for Jack and Gass, I did not hesitate. Cinderella was an inspiration in writing a mouse for writing books. I enjoy the story writing and hope these children will be encouraged. Three stories were cute and funny, though the song was forgotten. Jack and Gass were my favorite characters but I also saw Lucifer, Bruno, Mouse chorus and everyone else. Palm Palm proved to be the perfect partner for Lucifer and I like the coverage. A signal correct for a change. My rating is 8/10.
