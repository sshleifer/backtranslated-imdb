The 700 club gives a great perspective on the world event. Many have described it as punk or sticky. I find the program to be informative and inspirational. Many have proven natural for mud firing in a program that has proven to be so successful. There are a few shows that can indicate the 40-year track record of television broadcasting in the world and 700 clubs are among them. Although Mr Robertson said that someone seems to be killed, I find it strange that many people literally travel on themselves to criticize the bandwagon. I certainly told some foolish thing in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr Robertson because he keeps out a great show.
