The flower house is a great family show. However, after seeing some episodes again, I realized that they are incredibly annoying and they seem to offer shelter outside the outside world. Yes, there are many comedy, but in many cases it is incredibly chessy. It's not like I hate it, but do not meet again over again because they get older faster. Probably the best season is the first. <br /> <br /> Full house widow Danny Tanner (Bob Saguet) and his three daughters, D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jody Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley) Danny's wife needs some help when she dies. So, his best friend Joey (Dave Coolie) and the girls' aunt Jesse (John Stams) came along with them. Once they live together they find that they can not live without each other. <br /> <br /> The Flower Foundation reminds you of how important family is and you can always go home again.
