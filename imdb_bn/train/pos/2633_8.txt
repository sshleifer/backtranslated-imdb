I have to be honest, I was waiting for failure, because it's really trying to feed the original movie for money. But that was not the case with this beautiful funny (sometimes weird) movie. I like the story of Timon and Pumba, Simbara's story and how it was so funny to have him asleep. Zacci bubble, and when Pumba leaves, bubbles stop. It's all good for harmless fun, kids and some adults. I think this movie will last for a while because it is good for direct video and DVD movies. Although the film seems somewhat strange and flowing towards the edges, it works. 10 out 8
