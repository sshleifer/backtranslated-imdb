"Lost", "24", "Carnival", "Depressable Housewives" ... is in the list. This, and a bunch of other high quality, shows that we are in the middle of a golden age of television history "Lost" is pure genius. Personal, and mentally effective, incredible level, glorious cinematography (incredible to use this term, while describing TV shows), a killer score, great performance and editing. Nobody is hooked on this, television is the most important creative expression ever missing. It can be a problem, when viewing only one episode weekend, the DVD format is actually an incredible way to see it. They hope to keep it (I'm sure as they do).
