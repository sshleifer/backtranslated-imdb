One of the more irrational aspects of that era is a wonderful illustration. I liked the visuals - very suitable for a story related to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> I think Tom Hans was really big, he was very good at seeing someone who worked hard with his work (which he did not like for himself entirely) but still wants normal life for his family . He can do better to see that happen. Do not want to plunder the plot - but if you are looking at this movie then you are a person who wants more than a normal shot from the movie 'em up action / gangster format. (Although it is violent.)
