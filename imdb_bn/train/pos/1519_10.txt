You should think of how funny these movies should be given to you. The film focuses on a house that is strange enough for people living there. Residents were: Author Charles Hollier (Danemal Eliot (by the hair!)), Who was deceived by one of his creatures; Philip Grieson (Peter Cushing), who is very close to a wax figure; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's hypocrisy apparently is a mask; And actor Paul Henderson (John Pertway), is very much on the edge of the character in the role <br /> <br /> "The House the Dripped Blood" is really valuable. (Good duo; it plays Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Besides being pure as well, there may be some undertones: it may be a true horror versus dire horror problem calling. Like "The Shining", we might ask whether the house / hotel itself has some memories of past events. And if nothing is absolutely nothing, Ingrid Pete (Paul's co-star) is Hot Hot! While out on this occasion, he starred in "Countess Dakula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she - like Barbara Steele - will be known only as a queen queen, but mark me: she's a great screen queen! I want to see something like Ingrid Pete and Barbara Style Co-Star. <br /> <br /> I guess the only peculiar scenario (say so) is where Danelle Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket. You read that right Whatever is a name "Denholm"? Well good A very cool movie.
