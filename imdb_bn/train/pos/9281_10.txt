I do not know how the Iranian directors have the inspiration to come and how to get such a plot. Actually, this is a very simple plot that can come with many directors --- but it can not work like Jafar Panahi in a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is about two world rolling simultaneously, combined with one-on-one match between football matches and stadium walls. <br /> <br /> It thinks you are in the movie and you are one of the characters, and while watching the film, if you want to see a glimpse of the football match. As the female actress of the movie you feel the same excitement and feelings. This is the one way you want to see the end, you will want to find the verdict, you will die for the girls to see what will happen. <br /> <br /> I sometimes like intermediate conversation smoking smile and one of the military trainers. It's like VNS Mars, it shows the difference between men's thinking and women's equal struggle and women's struggle for equal rights and opportunities, especially in ancestral society like Iran. The second I saw was the movie of Jafar Panahi (first Crimson Gold) and I look forward to seeing more. <br /> <br /> I have already hung finger with Iranian film and it must be seen!
