I am not a professional film critic, and I do not want to comment on how well the movie was or what was wrong, because there was not enough knowledge of filmmaking. What I know is a great achievement of making such a movie on your first shot and I want to congratulate the director on this. However, in some reviews, which I read, critics have complained that his relationship with Hiralal's brother was not highlighted and his brothers completely deleted the story. Now I want to point out a point that the name of the movie seems to be, not a movie of Hiralal's brother, it is a film about Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi's relationship, nothing less. If we start to complain about the character of some characters in the movie, it would be a little wrong because these characters are not suitable in the film, how relevant they were in real life. So I think if it is good then we will think well and would like to satisfy one of the critics among ourselves. Enjoy <br /> <br /> !!!!
