I have a special need parent's father and I've enjoyed the movie too! It was loving, warm and fun. I learned a long time ago in some time to look ridiculous. I especially thought that all other characters were worried about Frankie and who would take care of her after her grandmother died. Before the film was edited, I was present with the attention of other parents for the special screening of film with children of special needs children. Everyone has enjoyed the film and it really inspired the wonderful discussion. We talk about how our kids make us smile and how we will get worried about them. The painting writer discussed how it works as a volunteer for children with autistic children and other special needs. She is based on the character of a real person. Our family has been blessed with the feeling of humor which has imposed us a lot. I give up two thumbs in the movie !!!
