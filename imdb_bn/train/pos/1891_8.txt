When you look at this movie, you understand what the poorly used resource was late late Moore. There should be dozens of such movies in our archives. <br /> <br /> He went to Halloween and both comedians and musicians were highly talented beforehand. But in most cases he was associated with Peter Cooke for his pairing, television and one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps this was the best 'Bedazzled'. <br /> <br /> He would always turn away from Cook, who jealous and nonsense removed his partnership and enabled Moore to realize his real potential in America. 'Arthur' results <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie. Moore's clownish comedy as a drunk is undeniable. The script is a bit ridiculous, almost perfect for its spiritual interaction with its compression. He has something about British that I am really surprised that he has found such appeal for American taste. Tommy Cooper, draws a blank in an anarchic comedian after the same fashion. It's Moore's often child's weakness which is so much respected. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Liz Minley and John Gilgood continue to play a direct role against him, but there are still some nice fishing. John Gilgood distributes him especially with a satirical and asbestos authority, which is a treasure to watch. He always steals a scene which he deserves and completely his Oscar. Correct me if I am wrong, but he has not played any other comic role. <br /> <br /> Here there is a follow-up movie called 'Arthur 2 - On the Rocks'. It does not achieve the status of a glorious level that it can reach, but it is still good. Guilgud only gets started and gets a cameo appearance as a Scratch. It's dark And there are some interesting soul searches. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Come on, depressed and apparently die. <br /> <br /> A sample of what could be 'Arthur'. We can only imagine that other big films we wanted to make. <br /> <br /> Your sad Missed, Doodle.
