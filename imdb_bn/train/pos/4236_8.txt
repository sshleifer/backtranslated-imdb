Repeat this movie for it, but accept the same concept with a completely different approach. It's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. Apparently, it's incredible. All else was okay. <br /> <br /> For this, I think the movie is awesome, but I love everything I have done in Burton. People will have to be calm and stop playing, as it is the end of the world's B / C. It was not supposed to rebuild, and it's not. <br /> <br /> The end was calm. . I took it as a parallel universe.
