This film is scared of my shit! I admit that I see most of the film through my fingers, but what I saw was really scary. During the show I cried loudly or two or three times. <br /> <br /> My favorite side was the sound and photography of film making. The sound was especially great and the setting was really vague beautiful. I read somewhere that this is something weird husband and wife who did. For some reason that makes this stranger even for me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy jerk and jerk of a terrible movie, it's for you! Very curious and love to see a great movie curled movie on which shout like a small gold girls fare with a bunch of friends!
