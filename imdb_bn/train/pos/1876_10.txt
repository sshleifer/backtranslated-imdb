An adaptation of the book Finding Fish. This story is about the frustrated young sailor, Antobon Fisher (Derek Luk), who told his past painful story to a psychiatrist, Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Derek Luke and Danzell Washington have always played a great debut by the stunning performance. <br /> <br /> This movie was incredible on many levels and I was disappointed that it did not win Oscar, because I think it was because it was ignored why it was released at a bad time. I firmly recommend this movie to everyone, you will touch his story and it really makes the audience sympathize with this young man of Antobbon Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like inspirational truth stories, <br /> <br /> <br /> Thank you
