I was surprised at an improvement in an animated film. If you are sitting near the screen, you can see the detail of grass and surface structures. The detail, colors and galaxies are better than the circumference compared to the Tio Story. How they were able to pull off the films, I never knew. I hope to provide a documentary on how the Pixar film was produced so that I can know how it's done. Based on this picture, I think future animated films will be judged on this film.
