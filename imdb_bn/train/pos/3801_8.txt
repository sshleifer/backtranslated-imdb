It is a CGI animated film based on a French 2 animated series. This series was briefly running on the cartoon network, but its rig was so brief that I knew most people because of being among the nominees of this year's best animated film "Hu?" This is the story of Lian-chu, heart muscle and Guizoda, the story of his volcanic dragon with hectare fire in the brain of this operation, he is like a dog. Dragon hunters travel around the world to offer their services but never to be paid. Joe in his life, the legendary boy going to the dark is the story of the boyfriend fairytale. It seems that the world is being destroyed by a huge monster, and the enemies the king sent is never returned, or if they come back, they will come back around. Frustrating the King recruits dragon hunters to stop feeding the world. Must be sure to tag it with the tag <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it is a really small small film that has been completely closed from Radar without extraordinary Oscar rivalry . It's a nicely designed, superb looking movie (which has floating land and crazy creatures in the world that has happened) which continually "wow" me. Lean-Chu with Phonest Whitaker (which I have heard is one of the best singer's performances) and Rob Palson (Steve Booksy thinks) as Guizoda's English voice casting with the first English rate. Equally sophisticated scripts that do not talk to viewers, use some real expressions that are not generally heard in animated movies (not Disney or Pixar). It's really all good. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some bits go too long, but at the same time it is very modest. <br /> <br /> If you see the chance see it. This is one of the best animated movies since 2008, and I have a wonderful surprise list for 2009.
