This animation has a very easy and straightforward good vs. evil plot and all about the action. How it sets out from other animations, it animates how good people's movements are. The lady lady looked around moving from left to right on the screen and saw that her movement was so good. Why do they use these rotoscopic techniques more on these days? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Someone may hate this and consider it as another distinguished male sex fantasy May, others (including lots of women) appreciate the traditional values ​​of this. I was not sure! Bully can be seen only in the cool world, such as the great curiosity, loves animating, and I do not think it will be distorted by adults for most of the animations. But I had enjoyed this animation as a child and I forgot it. <br /> <br /> It was only special, the price is different from Disney or Anime rentals, and that's the reason only the best price of watch is probably Bakhshi's best. For those who love animation with delightful women: Try the Space Adventures Cobra too. <br /> <br /> I am giving 8 fire and ice out of 10.
