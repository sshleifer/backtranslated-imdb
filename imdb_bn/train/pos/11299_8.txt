Well, I've heard somewhere that the continuation of the Osceti Italian film, and especially my favorite 'gaello' ... but in reality, it is different from the thrilling adventures made by Italy. There are two very many relationships. In the sixties and seventeen years, Italian filmmakers will gain a reputation for the hijacking of every successful American film of their liberation war. They did not do it here, but as a credit without the author of the Osseini book, James M. Cain, so many American films have followed the same story as 'The Postman Always Rings Twice'! However, the plot is the Gino Costa, which focuses on a handsome drifter, scratches a stamp in a cafe where a female named Giovanna Bragana works. He learned that he married Zeuspe; A big fat boring man, whom Giovanna can not even stand to touch. He wants to run away with them, but he is not so interested in this idea. However, the fate ends and the plan to kill her husband is successful ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> The director Lucino Viccanti correctly applies the silent style of the film, and in this way I love the atmosphere of this film in larger American silent classics. The story, as you would expect, is very strong and Wiscunty manages to pull good performance from her cast. Viscounty drags a little more cinema, but with about 135 minutes running time, I think the story was very thin for this type of length. I am almost guilty of criticizing the criticism of Ossean because it is a good film, but it is not a 'great' film. The relationship between the two central characters is not really investigated properly and it seems that the film wants us to confuse us instead of the characters' head. There is not much secret to the plot because we know almost always and always does not focus on letters; As the film it can not be interesting. Nevertheless, it is made for an interesting viewing and is recommended for those reasons ... although it is not as good as the same version of 1946 as James M. Kine Classic.
