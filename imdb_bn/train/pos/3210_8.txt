SOLDIER is not as bad as it has been made as. I found some ridiculous humorous comedies like Paul Vernon's Starships Criminals. The lack of dialogue and the top-notch activities add to the deliberate and comic book atmosphere. <br /> <br /> There is a certain triangle-bit standing for me - the name of several of the spacecraft's spacecraft tattoos' dee on his chest and a tanhauser gate between these battles. For the unidentified people, the tanhauser gate is mentioned in the striking end lines of Blade Runner's Roy Batty. To imagine, like the Toyod Roy, Android soldiers can fight as well, at least agree to say. Perhaps the script writer David Peoples was Nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I will give 3 out of 5
