The film was the first of Torrent and the end for Greta Garo. It is his first American-made film on MGM, the only studio in the United States that he ever worked for. Last time someone else paid the bill on his credit card, which was his top man in his Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the entry of the popular Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez, based on Entre Narnozos. It is concerned with an isolated lovers, a pair of garbo and cotage, which can not be mixed together, because of Cartes's mother Marta Mattox's strategies. <br /> <br /> <br /> Mattex is a mischievous woman, who has certain ideas about her son's marriage. Remember this Spain and marriage arrangements are still right even at that time. Mattox Gertrude Olmstead is remembered as a daughter, She is the descendant of a man Mc Swain rich in raising the hack. Swain realizes that in a few moments of virgin relief, with flexible concern for her children. He grew up before the big hugs went out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Imagine with Rudolph Valentino in leadership. This may have been interesting with Valentine Garba, but after finishing it was still out of the making of the film. At any event, a Ricardo cortez of Valentino Vanbasz is filled with men. <br /> <br /> One reason Valentino did not want this movie is because the main character is just as different as the previous two works of Garbo. . When Morton and his adviser Banker Tony Marshall found the dirt of the cortage when he told him, he left Spain and went to France, where he became a great opera star. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a political career in mind for her boy. Coatage is now running for the Spanish parliament, which is enthusiastically known as enough cortes. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a flood and a dam, which causes all types of damage to the countryside. Cortez is actually trying to rescue Garbo from the way of damages in a row boat torrent braves. When they meet together, they have a brutal discussion, brutality comes from proud people. <br /> <br /> Although they feel special effects here, they are quite extraordinary for their time. They appear very similar to the 20s used shots in Fox's Rennes Cam which came in 1939 and won Oscars for special effects. Unfortunately, for Torrent it came a year before the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I will not go away anymore so you have to find out if the coatage and the Garbo will match together. At the end Garbo had won the review for his performance accurately and an age when the gesture was an ideal role played on the silent screen, he was significantly subtle in his role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> American holds the very big screen and very good for today's audience.
