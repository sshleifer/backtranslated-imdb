Based on a true story, this series is a jewel of its kind. The slave has become a queen holding the heart of the strongest man in the village. <br /> <br /> In the city of Tijukoro diamond mining town, Heroes Commander - was appointed the king of Portugal - the final authority. When grown up with relative security in his home, young and beautiful Xica da Silva in the city decided to sell her to a whore prostitute, threatening her world, a black maid refused to accept that her daughter could be daughter. In a desperate cat for protecting himself, King Harry steals diamonds for the diamond to collect the king, to use them to escape. The King's army comes to collect diamonds the next day, and when the loot is absent, the diamond commander is taken to the chains, his family hijacked him into the street and only dressed on their backs. Martin, son of the boyfriend, sworn to take revenge! Xica and other slaves are sold at auction and Xica sergeant ends up in Major's house, an old man who purchased his own passion for slogan completely. A new diamond commander, near the Tijuko city, elegant and brutal-savvy Fern√°ndez comes. With the beauty of Jackar, he used to use sergeant Major to sell him. And thus begins a love story, filled with danger, conspiracies and emotions, into a deliberate nobleman and a clever slave girl who one day becomes queen. <br /> <br /> The rich history of this series is filled with beliefs, prejudice, politics, fashion, etc. And it really guides you to maintain your attention every minute. Occasionally full of fun, suspense and unexpected twists with a satirical and dark humor. "Xica da Silva" is certainly a must. I wish I could buy a full series of DVDs.
