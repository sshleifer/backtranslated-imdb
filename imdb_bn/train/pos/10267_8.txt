A lot has been written about the "house of games" of the case; It's pretty good. After 17 years, I decided to review FICA for how it was held, and how surprised I was to see it again. The success and stability of the film is probably the two main elements that are often fun; A good story and a good scam. MAMAT manages our signature mood and the film's obvious painters, when scams, ours, the audience, and the mark simultaneously. Then he explained the artwork to do it again and again in the making of the story. "The House of Games", is now a Freeberry cable, a look for the first timers and just for fans of the mind. (B ++)
