I've finished watching this picture in my GCS history class. It was a brilliant insight into what happened in Steve Biko during the adventurous and racist law. How could somebody say that this movie was the most annoying or lazy, I do not know about half an hour of their life because it forced me to finish from the beginning. How did Denzel Washington painted him and showed how he was fighting against racist laws and earned equal rights to black people. At one point Steve Biko tells a policeman that you are weak and just like us, it must show that he and all other black people in South Africa were not different from white. Donald Woods inspires me because he did not believe in castles and complete racism for what he believed. He and Steve Biko developed a very strong friendship against South Africa and became awake around the world. I enjoyed this movie and firmly recommend it to these people. It helped me see that racism is not correct and everyone is equal, their fate should not be determined by some of the skin's skin. N
