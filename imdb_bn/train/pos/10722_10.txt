Spacecam is a movie that kids love children, and having fun watching mom and dad I enjoyed this movie in the 80's, its plot and all actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD, when I have my own kids, they can watch it as much as I can. Plot fun, a group of kids, started a journey that they never expected, when they were trapped in space by an elated robot. They were first in Ahuet, but when they realized that there was not enough oxygen to panic. When they recover enough oxygen at the space station, they come back to Earth as a better friend and new honor for new life.
