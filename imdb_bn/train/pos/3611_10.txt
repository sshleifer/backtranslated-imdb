I saw this movie differently from other movies of Blue Crash and Mitchell, I thought he had a great future in his business. After watching his role in "Girlfriend", I was very wrong, I was surprised to catch one's emotions. A warrior, but a warrior. In the way that he hit his father about his or her brother's treatment, he expressed his anger. While learning his letters in his film, he never laid the wall and hid it from love, or he would not win because of his power. I believe this role was perfectly fit for Michelle, even though she had no previous experience, the director looked at talent, I criticized myself not to see her talent.
