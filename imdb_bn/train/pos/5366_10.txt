I'm sitting here in November 2006 and I still can not help to rave about this movie. Arnold's best movies came in 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator, and Total Reykal (1990). All 3 amazing. In this movie Arnold's Chasey One Lineer will force you to laugh at multiple events. As I was in the case of the Predator and Total Recall, surprisingly well this acted in this movie. They did a great job to create future scenes in this scenario, in 2017, but you can not help with sniper and hairdressing monitors on the 80's style hairstyles on the men and women in the crowd. In 2006, we all knew that Man Studio is in the running flat panel and the emergence of HDTV. Also, in the "Running Man" computer graphics game of 2010, presentation graphic graphics will not be shown. But the story is absolutely fantastic. During this movie, I did not want to get up and I was not worried about the end, which I often do with today's movie. I really think Arnold's performance is better than that. Now I did not choose him governor but this is for you in California. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero as well as the fantastic "stalkers" and I do not try to overkill the fight scenes of the manufacturers. When the broker dies ... he's dead. It does not go for every 20 minutes. Stalker views are fast and entertaining but they are not tried and overplay it. I call this movie 10/10 and somebody is coming that day who does not enjoy many movies these days. If you get the right actor and the right story, future graphical displays that you want to see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
