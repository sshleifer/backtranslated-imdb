Charlton Heyston was wearing a coat, James Frankiskus wore a dress, but Mark Wahlberg decided not to wear traditional shoe clothes. I hope nobody holds him as Tarzan. Linda Harrison put bikini in the first 2 Planet movies, but Estrela Warren barely shows the conflict - her hair is always on the way. Tim Burton could make up this Simian Saga sexuality and the audience could be given to see some of the adults. Even the healthy Helena Bonaham Carter does not get out of his suit which looks like a big screen. She is cute but all love things are worrying look and a little bit kissing at the end. Just as artificial intelligence that discusses interpersonal sexual relations between robots and humans but never distributes - the planet of apps indicates romance between inter-species and humans in apps, but it only indicates. Lisa Marie is the only app that dares to be sexy. This movie has three great actors Tim Roth, Mrs. Carter and Paul Jummy screaming screaming as three impressive and they are having fun watching. The supertilative Make Up (a specific Oscar) dress, set, music creates this 2001 summer film.
