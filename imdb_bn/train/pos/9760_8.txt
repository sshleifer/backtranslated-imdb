I met my little sisters, when it was first shown in the theater in 1977 and I was eight years old. Apparently it is considered a failure - and is now virtually forgotten (Pan-Scans and Video Cassettes - which do not ever judge the picture or its aspiring panavision compositions are now printed out.) The film is very styled (yellow shadow SUBMARINE) and admission Incredible Some characters and sequences are fine and others are somewhat inferior and inferior. The tragic blue camel (shade of Yayor) and its blue songs are really heartfelt. Joe Raposo's song is just for the most beautiful part. Certainly a suitable curiosity will likely fall into total obscurity (sad).
