Because of the crisis in Apalakia, Slicker's influential film in four cities has become synonymous with rural barbarism. Four businessmen face each and every horrible fear when they face a challenging whitewater trip, will be replaced by a dam on a river. When the local people of the street decide to choose "their way" with the interlopers, then it comes to surviving many deaths and people who are infected. Every outstanding of the traveler gives Voight lead and strong performance, though. Rural scenery and culture have been well-received, with exciting dual banjo sequence. I came to it when it came, not just the perfect date movie (although I both enjoyed it). I remember the break-out dramatic performance for Bart, Voight was already established. Not every type of movie you can watch every week, but it's a powerful punch and beautifully illustrated.
