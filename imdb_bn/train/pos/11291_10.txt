Has anyone been able to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real pilot who saw his wings legs in the air and then hijacked him with his fist because he was given his pilot bird. <br /> <br /> She has a few seconds of screen but my family would like to get a movie. He was killed in a dogfight on Italy, when he was only 24. Do we know in the studio we've created it? <br /> <br /> Did anyone watch this on a video store like Blockbuster? I hope they will provide complete catalogs of these old movies as it is so cheap to make DVDs <br /> <br /> If you know what I can buy, please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com. Thank you.
