The role of this title was the series of six "Classic Tarzan" series by Zuni Weshmooler and second genre of Maureen and Sullivan like Zen. <br /> <br /> Naturally, this series was a great movie; And probably has been a progressive "intermediate" film that can illustrate the development of the film in the early 1940s early in the 1940s. In this way, it showed good speed, though not as good as the next movies. Similarly, cinematography is less complete than the next Tarzan films in this series. The stock I saw was of unequal quality, containing some grainy scenery and some underground open and exposed scenes. The shining display of the next Tarzan films is needed here. On the other hand, too much of a scene, very quickly, where the cameras are playing with swell switching behind the camera, the Safari men have shown the scene in front of the jungle, it is almost the same as the modern style, and the remaining parts of the movie compare to static shots. <br /> <br /> Related to Plot, there was an interesting feature of Jane's close intensity and lack, when he was subjected to Martyn's Flirtcius. Kiss And Jane is terrified, and partly guilty, reaction ?? In the future, we predict something in this movie as well as Jane. For example, find a son in Tarzan, compare! Jane's unexpected activities cheat Tarzan and give the boy to his family. Later, he admitted to Tarzan that he was wrong. There is nothing quite clear here, but our Gen Generator Zen Generator is "coming back", and almost in the sequence of the rehearsal series, Martin and Harry hide the gown in the evening to make him swim. <br /> <br /> There was a series of imagery and series continuously illustrating me in this picture. <br /> <br /> In this case, the domestic life pictures of Tarzan we got here, violent death is always a combination of sensual idyll with the possibility of near. To me this is the main part of the Tarzan experience. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see some violent scenes on today's scale. <br /> <br /> The scenes gave me special pleasure: Tarzan is taking elephants to the graveyard of elephants; Rescued from the death of water by Tarzan Hippo, and then dedicated to health by apes; Jane and other people are trapped in the espement's footsteps when they are going to find a known Tarazan; The image, especially in the picture, crossed the river. The savages and lions final battle scene of apes in the land and savages and trees. Jane, showed us that he is demonstrating his zealous wood technique to work with a real Tarzan world to work on a line of fire to keep the lion right away. <br /> <br /> The final series of scenes is fantastic: suddenly on the scene of Tarzan, flinging savages from the trees and taking lion charges, and rescue the elephants rescued! That's the final tone of Tarzan, a happy Zen in her arms, a dance and a cheerful cheetah next to her, a memorable picture and a subtle short story of Tajan and Jane. <br /> <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another wonderful classic Tarzan movie. I would strongly recommend this movie.
