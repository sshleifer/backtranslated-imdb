Sure this movie was not like this. 16 blocks, inside people, an American hunting. Etc ... <br /> <br /> But it was a great mystery that can happen to some of us .. I found this movie really awesome and scary. <br /> <br /> I live in the place where I heard, based on the movie "San Pedro, California" and the film's events, we heard the real story. <br /> <br /> If you have heard about the famous boating boat, "Queen Mary" is frustrated. I believe spirits, delusions, and parallel or anyway that you spell that. Really Everyone in their universe <br /> <br /> And mind is a powerful thing. <br /> <br /> I suggest watching this movie. This is not a great and bad instruction. <br /> <br /> For those who rate it 1. They do not understand the movie. That means His plot, his view And how much ocean life can be bad for each of us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Victor
