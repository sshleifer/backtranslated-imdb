This one is one of the fun series! I laugh till I split my side and rolled around the floor. Only someone will be released in America Region 0 or 1 - please, please. <br /> <br /> I know you are getting released in the UK but in addition to that region 2 and Pal! Let's have his fair flock in this series. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I like Tracie Bennett's quirky, this fool's role. Of course I like Fianna Gilly! But the tragic was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Release this show in America! Or show again at PBS station. I started to laugh again! Please Please Please Please! <br /> <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
