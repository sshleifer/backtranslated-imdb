I think this movie was reasonable. It's strange that now the Olsen twin has 13 and boyfriends and all. They were small kids in the full house when I enjoyed them a lot. However, the welding was good and the movie was somewhat funny. I got mixed in all the switching places and their names. It's just an old version that takes two of it.
