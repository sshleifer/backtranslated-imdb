Surprisingly, Disney is not submerged for a sequel and a good animated live video. Like the previous Siegel (The Lion King 2) I'm very happy that Disney brings back most real-world voice actors that make a big difference and they keep a good standard of traditional animations. The plot revolves around for a while, but we are confused by the surprising addition to the sunny days. They have given us some stupid musical sequences to break apart plot and jokes, which are so much fun, from entertainment to freezers to quick trips. In most cases moments like MSST 3K will be full of soft and unreadable feasibility and will not add any film other than working as a car for an hour long flashback. New characters are at least preferred, and old characters are doing their thing out so I can not blame them there. The film is not bad at all, and it creates a wonderful incandescent filler among the more serious lion kings titles.
