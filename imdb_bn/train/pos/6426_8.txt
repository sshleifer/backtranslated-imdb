I like one of the best "Return to Amitabh" movies. This was when Gobinda was tough with Dhawan. The song was awesome and we typed it as "Mashti" completely. With the likes of multiplied unmatched khara, they entered into an evergreen entertainer. There are many fun twists and turns in the story line, which is known for David Dhawan's Potbali. With the timely attendance of Mrs Madhuri "Nine" Dixit, it was a total riots in the end. It was good to see Amit playing with this kind of strength and humor after a long period of exile. Although someone might consider it a standard "Bollywood Massa" movie, I would like to see it any day. I'm going to make 8 of 10 out of 10 for just saying Bollywood.
