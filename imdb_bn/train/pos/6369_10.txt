I love this movie! I'm in love because I'm a huge Disney fan, but I really enjoyed myself. This work is going on in the beginning of the film and it's going on! It's a bit of departure for Disney, they do not spend much time on character development (my husband highlights this issue) and there are no music numbers. It is strictly action adventure. I've enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend it to everyone who likes Disney, whether they are young or old.
