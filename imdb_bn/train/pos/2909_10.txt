I love Paul McCartney. He opposes me, the greatest of all time. However, behind the US tour, Tacoma Dome could not afford to have his concert ticket. I was really upset to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as well being there. Paul is still man and I will enjoy this for years to come. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. I want to hear all the Jews. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
