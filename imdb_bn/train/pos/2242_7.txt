From a partially felt need, one believes that 1950's film incorporates a traditional love story of the plot to make the movie more marchable. <br /> <br /> This film starts with high quality bureaucratic foreign officers, with some humorous characteristic characters - British who just amaze the British in such a way that the British can shock themselves. But then, the film goes on the path of a conventional missile plot. Terry-Thomas is always worth watching, but Cast's wonderful talent (Peter Sellars, et al) has largely been lost. <br /> <br /> is not a diverse, but great movie.
