This movie is very funny, and it's a great set of performances like William H. Messi who always plays such a role, perhaps the most representative of his, Fargo; And George Clooney, who is a very good actor, his brothers have played in the movie "Oh brother, where are you?" Which never be one of my favorite movies! But here it is difficult to find "Welcome to Collinwood" in Mexico. The lack of good places where to buy some good movies in my town. I tried to buy it in Blockbuster but they do not know the original name, so if the name given in Mexico is available to me, would that be easy? Do not remember! Cheers A.
