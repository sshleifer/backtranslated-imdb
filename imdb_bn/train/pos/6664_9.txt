I do not understand why this movie got beat up here. Tell me It's stupid, it's not smooth and it's lost (as I'm reading) in some way. Cast of this movie plays their characters in 'T' (yes if you have seen Permanent Midnight and are a Ben Stiller fan, yes you will be disappointed). These misunderstandings, sculptures and perseverance try to do better intentional misfits in order to save the city / world except for nothing. The problem is that they do not understand their limit until the big limitations and that is the point! This spy ho shagged me was penned by this same demographic group 3 times, probably the same person who felt the first AP movie to be compared to CPL. I just do not get it. Jokes work more than one level; If you did not find it, I know what level you have.
