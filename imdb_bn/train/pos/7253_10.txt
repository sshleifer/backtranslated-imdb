It is not certain that it can call as an anti-war film, it shows an elite level war. These elite soldiers who know what they are doing and take great pride. Even when they are pacifist, they enjoy the level of skill and defeat their enemies, even if it goes against being peaceful. Movies are gradually and unreasonable and in many ways it is sophisticated as compared to war movies, so no body parts are flying like modern movies. This is cruel in any other way, however, even if you see individual scenes of murder. This is a thoughtful people movie more. Once you start to see you do not want to miss anything. Think of movies and their interaction men, what about movies- not itself in war or a big exciting story It may be called a war troller. <br /> <br /> If you have the skills of fighting, if you read or see a program on SAS, then you want to see this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> Top Star Hill, (1965), a star star, The Necked and the Dead (1958), along with San Conanie, 49th Parallel (1941), with Mr. Robertson. All their way is unusual and show a personal fight war. Enjoy!
