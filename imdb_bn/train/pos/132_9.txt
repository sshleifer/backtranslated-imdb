Storyline: Max Van Saino's voice-over description combines heroes (and listeners) in 1945 where our hero was young American academician Leopold Kassler (Jean-Mark Bar) in Germany in 1923 after the rebuilding of the damaged country. Uncle Casler (Ernst-Hugo Zergard) provided Leopold with a job in the big Zantropa train corporation, but soon fell in love with Leopold Catherine Hartman (Barbara Succoy). The daughter of Gantropower owner Max Hartman (Gorge Rainberg). Leopold quickly caught on the web of corruption, took advantage of losing his opinion, and was forced to choose between pest or cholera. <br /> <br /> Mysterious, gentle, captivating, silent, hunting, beautiful, and ugly. Some of these, Grandios, the descriptions that think when Eurasia thinks of the 1991 Best Works of Lars von Trier; Europa Quarterly Final Chapter. In the United States, it was reintroduced in Gentropa so that the audience did not get confused in Annecia Holland's European Europe (as well as the WWII drama) from 1990 onwards. In the Europa Trilogy, the Forwardlesses Element since 1984 and the epidemic (the infamous test of selling 900 tickets to Danish films) since 1987. The triangle behaves consistently with hypnotism and idealism, although the themes of these triangles are not necessarily as visual. In the opening shoe of Europe, we see a locomotive running on our side, when we literally mimic our unknown statement: "On the mental calculation of ten, you will be in Europe." Stay ten. <br /> <br /> A metaphor for the film using europe is a strange but highly effective visual style. <br /> <br /> This famous Russian director, Andrei Tarkovsky, is believed to be the main influence of Tia. It is sometimes associated with black and white images in red blood, red dress, etc. This inspired Steven Spielberg has refused to use similar effects in the Syndylar's list since 1993 (historically WWII drama). Furthermore Triare uses the so-called Dutch angels and recreates the background-projection by adding the co-operating layer separately to the layers, but using older Hollywood films such as for financial reasons, the trayer uses it for artistic purposes. This strange visual visualization technique has been devised that we are in a dream-reality, we are hypnotized; Europe's universe is not real! Often criticized in Europe for the advanced technology (such as multi-layered background-projection) on plots and letters, but Hey Stanley Kubrick's 1968 Visual Masterpiece Criticized 2001: A Space Odesi for it - Nowadays it has a compulsory place in the movie -History book. <br /> <br /> Europe is also accused of a historic mistake. Clearly Trier Nazis' Werewolf alloted too much historical significance to terrorist groups According to various online-sources it's right (a fascinating thing - try to google it yourself!), Yet Trier's goals are not educational and history does not accurately portray. Europe is a never ending nightmare. Leopold Kassler is hypnotic, so the universe facing the audience is a distorted reality. Equally it tricks us into our memories - a 100% correct reconstruction is false! Although Europeans experienced young people are very young to WWII memories, but it has a collective memory from our various BBC documentaries, so these small mistakes actually serve a purpose: they tell us that we are not Germany after WWII. , But it is in Leopold's memory <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Fluididals Element and Europe's skeptical ending are idealized by the idealists forever in their hypothetical realities. Before and after the European shooting in Poland in 1990, Lars von Tier and co-authored Nils Warsel were very interested in WWII. It shows. It is packed with very nice shots to catch the spot-on atmosphere of the period. At the end of Europe, the old Polish church (primarily for economic reasons, Europe is shot in Europe) is a great example. Like 2001: Space Odessi I think Europeans will have the right place in its movie history. The old film-silent love-love clichÃ©s and visualization techniques are so unique, weird and totally different from today, or any dream factory for anything. <br /> <br /> Europe is an indispensable film in Lawrence von Trier catalog. Write it as some pure commercial speculation, but that would be disastrous. This is another triayer classical and semi-classic such as Forbridels Element since 1984, TV series series from 1993 and Dogville in 2003. This is a unique experience before its unique actor and DogMeab 95 manifesto. Look at it! "Ten Count ..." 9/10
