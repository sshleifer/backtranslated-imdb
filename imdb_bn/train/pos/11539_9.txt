ODD COUPLE is a classic television version of Hollywood's most famous television drama FÃ©lix Unzwer's most famous drama. This is Falix Inger, who bestows his breakaway best friend, Oscar Madison, an athlete and full slogan, and his wife Frances throws him from his apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and at the moment he pardons. Neil Simon's classic comedy The First came to Broadway with Art Cornie to play Freddix and Walter Ouder Ocker. Jack Lemons took the carnike in the film's version, with memorable performances, such as Ficus Enzar. Lemon is not only very funny in the role, but it is obviously true that he came with an element of sorrow for Felix Unger's grim personality. Fortunately, Mtau was allowed to revive his role as Oscars, this is a kind of brain acting that laughs constantly over. This team of Lemon and Matthora is going to be Comic Gold, which was again visited again in nine movies. These two actors are no longer with us, this classic look became more sensitive but less sunny. Simon's game has expanded nicely to the screen with an uninterrupted suggestion, a winner of the frustrated Felix suicide attempt. Among the supporting cast, Herb Adman, John Faydler, Larry Henes and David Shiner have included Oscar poker players and Manisa Evans and Carol Shelley as Pidgin sisters, Oscar and Felix's blind dates. Of course, later it has become a nice TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klogman, but there is nothing like the original. Finish a joy from the beginning.
