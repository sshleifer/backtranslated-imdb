Sure, Titanic was a good movie, you see it for the first time, but you must first see it and your opinion must definitely be changed. When you see the underlying love story of the first movie and think: Oh, how romantic Second time (and I'm not alone to remember it) it's just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie, when the D ** N ships are drowning ??? And even when you see it many times this is not as impressive as this. This photo is not bad acting, but definetly is not great. Did I not win an Oscar for DiCaprio for this film, that means I think who he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He made half-best films and did not make less than $ 20 million films. And then everyone has recommended that there is no movie with him. But enough, in my eyes, the worst character in the film. On the other hand, Kate Winslet's performance was astonishing. I tink the very talented director to put together a film in such a level. There is a lesson to learn about this movie: it's a lot of love stories, filmmakers do not try to add a miserable romance to every single movie !!! Possible 100% out I give this image only 71%.
