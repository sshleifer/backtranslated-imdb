Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. This image is very malignant film that relies heavily on fancy genius. Without Doodle Moore, John Gilgood, Liza Minali, and a few others, this movie may be disaster. This is not always a good shot, and sometimes there are some very intelligent music that tries to make a mood ("wedding" like a song like a song in a marriage), but the act surpasses it. Character Arthur is ridiculous, with his drunk comments. But he develops well in the more mature, good rounded characters, because he learns to live his own life. Although the finale is fairly corny. I do not have to give it away, but it can be improved. Many times worth seeing.
