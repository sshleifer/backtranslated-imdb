This film is a way of masculinity for a gay man, and how he has to deal with everyone. Her mother disappointed, her younger sister was a pain, her older sister was taking a bit. The relationship looks good with his boyfriend / enthusiast and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy screws around him and says it really does not mean anything. Our young gay man gets bonkers and ends up in looney bin and finally leaves, dumping his new lover and starting. We start with him and see, do not participate, happiness. So maybe it will be better for him in the future. The finishing was a downer but the whole movie was completely realistic and so I will leave this real finishing slip with a high rating.
