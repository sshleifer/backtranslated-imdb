Suraj Barjatya Best in wedding films. And here he is; Vivaah returned to his originality. This story goes as a story from this wedding instinct. In a movie you can see with your entire family around you. In a movie you will hate hatred alone. The story is simple, but music is good, cinematography is excellent, direction is best, everything about the movie itself has a class of its own. There are so many scenes that will make you cry and make sure that if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart, you both are going to catch each other till the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Amrita Jodi gave us the movie like Ishq Bishash and Shikhar. Although the peak was a good movie but was not well received by the people. Truly Shahid and Amrita films
