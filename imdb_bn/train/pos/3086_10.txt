Here in Italy (I write from Venice). Why cancel? ABC should have given the opportunity to build an audience. Cast (WP / Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erica Christensen, Joe Saladana, J. Hernandez and Breedgate Mannahan) I recently saw the best. We need more shots that viewers think that they are not stupid drones like intelligent people. I hope ABC will reconsider its decision or it will pick another station.
