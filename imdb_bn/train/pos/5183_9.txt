<br /> <br /> This photo is one of my favorites far away. I was in college in the early 90's, and when I did not recognize the film's thirty-statue, I thought stories, characters and movies were the best. To those who have spoken negatively to the Indian summer, be free to intercept your comfortable Armageddon-type films and leave the movies with a great, wonderful story that they can appreciate.
