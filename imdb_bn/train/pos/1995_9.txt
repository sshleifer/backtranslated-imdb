I have seen this recently, after almost forty years. This is good, especially Lionel Bart's extraordinary song. ("Who will buy" with his witch counterpoint, just one of the many standouts.) <br /> <br /> I disagree with another post which excludes his G rating. The rating system, when the new brand, the G (general) rating does not mean "absolute conflict". <br /> <br /> It has been marked as inappropriate for the kids, which I once saw reminds her story of the Wizard of Oz: A girl comes to a strange land and she is killed by the first person she encounters. Then he goes on a road trip with three male companions and murdered again.
