Frustrated medieval Deputy Commissioner of Police George Maxwell (a fine performance of George E. Care, who made this film) can not stand his newbie, stupid wife Edith (totally wickedly Anne Belammy). Worse, the poor George is more saddled with a stranger baby sun and a shy lesbian teenage girl (Sensational brunette Sheri Jackson). George is an immoral flirtation with the beautiful, seductive and free-spirited swinging hippie The Babysitter Candy Wilson (Joyfully played with Sexy Uplopbong in the pink noseout Patricia Wemme). George Georges believes that he has blackmailed by Freeman (a great toxic spin of Keith Williams), who wants George to sit down with his psychic biker boyfriend Lawrence McKee (a terrible Robert Tessier who plays here hairstyle). Jail Director Tom Lallinn (yes, the same father of Billy Jack's illustrator) and screenwriter James McCarthy breaks the impressive and extremely entertaining surreal story of delicious women's nudity, soft-core sex, and raw violence in a sea story. In addition, they correct the strangulation sensitivity of 60 full youth culture, and they add to the plot during the 75-minute running time, thus ensuring that the film does not exceed its reception. Candy is invited by Maxwell's home for an incomplete basement bash, to invite potent smoking, rock music, and of course, to be completely invited to hot nude girls. Robert O. The Finny score of Rugland hit Hitler Spot. The black black and white painters of Stanton Fox add extra extra edge to the oddly running lanes. Above all, this impressive rate is an amazing showcase for the most charming and freshly-faced Pixie Patricia Wymore, who positively illuminated the screen with its sweet, bubbling personality and impressive beauty. Total trash treatment.
