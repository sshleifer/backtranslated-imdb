Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really do not know why it's a slow motion. I thought the speed was perfect. The film is based on Tom Hendes, operated by Tom Hendes, whose accomplishments like Hit-Man / Assassin, worked for John Rooney (Paul Newman), Michael Sullivan He disagreed with the job, but Rooney paid for his home and helped financially. She had nothing to do with her and Rooney gave him everything. However, his children do not know that this is his work, and when someone is seen as a direct witness to cold blooded murder, he is kept undecided. And when a persecution occurs, he leaves with his son and keeps looking at retaliation. They hijack and build a lot more and a bond. They are the perfect team. Hoods always acts as well as Jude as the law who plays her unclear role in perfection. It shows a beautiful story and how widely it shows in the 1930s is highly recommended.
