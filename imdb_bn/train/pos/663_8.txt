I've seen this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, it's enjoyable. And it's quite scary, but all good, ghoulish fun. A woman kills her second husband but is driven into a problem when a companion fleeing from a celebrated Santa Claus proportions decides to take her and her little girl a visit at that moment. Mary Trainer, who thinks of me from SNL or any other TV comedy skit show, is a bad wife, and Larry Drake plays crazy across Danny Santa. I forgot that Santa had played Drake for many years. Her Santa is a troubled power and quite awesome at times. You can guess how Santa finally gets into the house. Episode played for sunny, but it can be quite intense at times.
