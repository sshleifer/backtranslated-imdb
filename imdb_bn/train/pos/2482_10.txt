The actors play fantastic, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams has received Oscar's comedy role, otherwise it might be wonderful to see him in such a product. Deciding to use the full version of Kenneth's writings is a great one, it certainly will not happen most often ... Thanks, viewers can see the whole, not elected - the director - by part. Also - thank God that the film is a classical form; Stylish fanfaberies do not! Yet "Titus Andronicus" was still impressive, but Hamlet is still a different story, at least it's my point of view.
