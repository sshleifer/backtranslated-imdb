I did not like to like anyone in this movie. Central characters, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, whose daughter disappears outside the Australian Outback night, is not a bad person, but certainly not all of the people we see across this movie, or even the most, are not. We knew them well. Although we are sure that the film wants to be Chamberlain's crime or innocent from the beginning of the sad debate in our lives, the film comes to know about Gospp, news media, crowd, people's popularity, or social society. And guess. This is not a film about Australia's erodicated society; It's just a fact that an event happened in an account. The Society's message is much less evident than we are sure of. <br /> <br /> When a warden insists on killing an indigenous dog due to the unreasonable action of a single wild dog, when a randomly destroyed magazine, newspaper and TV shows mostly spoiled the tragic truth at a stage due to the drama of its consumers , Even if there is no sign of sympathy or any signs of showing anything outside a person. His own unknown perceptions, those who strongly influence left and right by the loud and vibes around his life. Because I appreciate the film because it makes the focus inside the victim. <br /> <br /> The prototype against Lindsay Chamberlain was suspected in most cases because of its suspicion. Jeep-fuel was formed in most cases. In public eyes, she did not feel annoying enough because of her baby girl's death. Why was he able to keep his cold, even the miracle for the TV and press kept his head held? How can he prevent the downward spiral if he behaves even more about the public opinion of the media? Meryl Strip, Unless today's best actress, who is working, may not have such a performance, which is especially standing and no other actors in the film making category. But she, and the screen writer, Lindy understand What is disturbing is that it is not that difficult. Apparently, he was not naturally prone to showing emotions in public in any case. We are naturally inclined to be sympathetic to his situation as soon as he is accessible to a loving character in an instant. <br /> <br /> Whether its acting is as beneficial as Sophie Choice or not, The Devil Who Spit, America or Other Angels, is a win. It's an audience hard enrapture when you deliberately deny the insight into them. He disappointed us because we do not know what he thinks or feels. It took a while for me to feel my feeling, but this movie's way of reflecting the public's attention. <br /> <br /> She is married to a priest, and they both practice a religion which is a small minority and thus misinterpreted most. Initially, they responded to their losses to restrain themselves with God's will, spreading rumors that their daughter's death had some kind of genocide in their part. Anything happened to the little girl, her parents were part of a margin, with most of the media's intake was not immediately detected, so their first trend would be to go after their hungry pack ... well ... <br /> < br /> Merrill Strip and Sam Blue are continuously on screen, but the Australian people play real lead here. Like every rest of the plates for the advance, the director has removed from the Fred Skpc restaurant to the tennis court from the dinner party to the salon, where the public tries Lindsey to try and take them to their own sensual project. <br /> <br /> This Golan-Globes document is not particularly memorable. The setting's atmosphere does not compensate enough for the face of a performance or production. But it is very successful in complaining of collective awareness of the people, it is very successful.
