I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen years after the film came out and I could be related. This will be a movie that I will show them to their kids, their feelings are normal. It is very interesting how we could have been so vulnerable at such a young age ... who knew that we will bring it back ... .... again a great movie !!!!
