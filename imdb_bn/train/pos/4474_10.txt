Famous for a famous music sequence for this picture (such as the Royal Wedding of Astaire - which was shown last night on Turner Classic Network), which earned a place in the record of jail Kelly: Fred Ashteyer's dresses danced with clothes and later dancing room walls Roof, in this film Jerry Kelly is doing a cartoon sequence with Jerry Mouse. The sequence is done nicely. What is forgotten is that Kelly is telling stories behind the cartoon sequence of Dean Stockwell and her colleague's students during the break of the day, and because of being in Stockwale, the stage set and sets off the eyes of others. Background veterinary type Kelly also changed the naval blues, actually she was wearing a white "Pomeranian" Navy uniform dress with a blue buckle. Jerry Mouse does more than dance with the genes. He actually spoke - he did not repeat for the first few decades. He finally put Tom Cat in his proper place - Tom briefly appears as Jerry's Butler, trying to scream him with a chestnut dish. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < More of this weird movie has ended with the story of Hollywood's lost four-day pavement Kelly, and how Kelly called Catherine Greson and (along with Frank Sinatre) Museum Studios, Hollywood Bowl and Itaberi José Iturry. Own home Except that there is no harm to the two sailors, this picture can be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Kelly has saved the life of Sinatira in Pacific and got the medal as a result. They are both of the four California cricketers who are getting four days off. But script writers (to promote what a small film will be - Kelly plans to spend four days on sex with Hollywood, an invisible good time girl "Lola") Frank hugs gin with Frank. It seems that Frank is one of the mushriks who use social media films (especially musical jokes) socially after filming and "female instruction" letters about girls meeting). Frank Jeans helps, "Teach him" how to get a girl. Only then a police took him to the headquarters to help the police with a little boy (Stockwell), who strongly advised to join the navy (and not give the police their real name and address). When a protestor directly asks this information from Kelly Stockwell (no police can ask), they forcefully said, Kelly would take the boy to his aunt (Grayson) home. Still protesting, Kelly gets saddled with increasingly complex problems (mostly see Sinatra's simple spirit view). The next morning, after Lola slept, Lola found out - Sinatara thought she was sleeping so much that she did not wake up. She is dragging back to Greson's house, because Sinatra thinks she is the right woman for herself, but she needs to train Kelly to love. <br /> <br /> I think this plot may disturb the fans of ANCHORS of my presentations, but I find these stories annoying. Kelly, Cynatra, Graceon, and Itururi songs and dance and concert music are the first rates, but it is annoying to accept someone like the character of Sinat. In the real world, Kelly had to beat her from the start of the four-day Fool's Beginning - did she stress (as in Sainatra) that anyone who protects her life will help her to learn how to date? Such frogs always affect me for a musical instrument - until the number of musical instruments is so superior that I have to forget this kind of fool. <br /> <br /> Iturin stalks are similarly annoying. Kelly tries to get Graceon to love Sinatra when she says that Sinatara can get a meeting with him to listen to his musical skills with José Iturière. Try it for most of the rest of the Senator and Kelly, and try to keep it bright (one moment - not for any good reason - Grace breaks Kelly's attempts to interview MGM with Iturir). It is only very lucky (Ittori feels sorry for Grace Grace) that she gives him an audition of his talent. <br /> <br /> Kelly, to the end with Graceon. Inabri prevented Cinatra's conscience (after which she could not pull enough Kelly) to shame her, and then eventually prevent her from seeing the waitress (Pamela Britton) from her native Brooklyn. And naturally, Kelly, fall in love without any help from Sintra and Briton. Ah, "unity"! Your name is not necessarily "writing the screen"!
