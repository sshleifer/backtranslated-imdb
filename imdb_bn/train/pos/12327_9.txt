Through the 1987 Hong Kong album, John Ur's icon 'It Better Culture', 'Zoo Warriors' and classic 'Mr. Vampire' gave world-wide films like 'Spooky Caid' Chau Yun Fat of Sam Hing Hong. Jackie Chan's video had international success, but it was with a Chinese ghost story that hacker hit the West's first real Crossroad theater for many years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a film that has been used for many years in Hong Kong cinema (Flying Terrorist, Wild Artist, Martial Arts and Supernatural) and mixed with a film that was unique in its appearance, feeling and execution. <br/> <br /> Director Siyu-Tung Ching (still one of the best actors in the film, 'One Better Tom Tom' / 'The Killer'), has created a wonderful composition by the legendary producer Sue Hark's fantasy / horror movie. . And the possibility of such a skilled expert (less than 6 martial arts coordinators) is likely to be astonishing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bride with wonderful surprising David Wu / White Hair 2 'Directed' and 'Better Black 1/2/3', 'Hardboiled', and Culture's hit 'The Club' edited classic titles) is quite simply an act of talent. The image of perfectly danced high-flying paintings, their best h as a result of the war on the shore of the tree. C. The movie has been created. Fast moving, resorting but they are never confusing, even today the top of their industry. <br /> <br /> Cinemographer Cruz did a miracle. This is a movie where each shot is a skilled painting. Where the wonderful blue tinded night sequences, covered in an existing geological fog, exciting platform to reveal our story This is a movie where everything is used to make beauty like dreams. Even the Hissia Tsing becomes the living part of the silkworm dresses and dresses clothered by, whether romantic sequences or flowing current silk across the screen in the battle scene. Even Hosios Tsing robes set a simple scene where beauty is turned into a thing, each skill set combines to create a most memorable scene from such an easy task. The set also provides another global sense of hell for the amazing, amazing end, and the filling of the fairytale, the flag gives the landing and hardness of the landing. Production design by Zhongwen Xi deserves maximum praise. <br /> <br /> Another major reason for the success of the film is the music by Romeo Diaz and James Wong. The Hong Kong films gave us some nice songs and songs that added a sequence to success, but the song 'A Chinese Ghost Story' is quite simple, essential. The opening of the opening song became important as the character of the song. <br /> <br /> Score is the perfect blend of modern and traditional instruments. Drums, bells, and guitars influence dominant action, but it is a slow, bumpy romantic piece that it comes in itself. Here; Flute, strings, and female cognitive effects probably make the best parts of music music in the film. This woman's voice, a beautifully beautiful song that plays on the love of Shau-Shane and Haseo Tsing (nothing is seen, but the effect is excellent, it is a romantic film romance romance) and a brilliant example of your strength can be a film's music. . <br /> <br /> And of course there are our acting talents. Leslie Cheung (`a good tomorrow 1 & 2 'and a very popular singer) is outstanding as innocent tax collector. (Gratitude) His work is never the top in Comic Crick, and in his view, Joey Wang is only played with perfect emotions and innocence. <br /> <br /> To support the role of films like Joey Wang (who later disappointed most often), Chou Yun Fat / Andy Law classic "Gambers Gauder") how he did not see much brighter here. He is the title of divine beauty. The tragic Haseo Tsing stunning his illustration He expressed regret for his character, which he has done and for what he has done, but gives subtle lover to those scenes where he is tempted by men in their serious death. Intelligent actor Um Ma ('Mr. Vampire', 'Swordsman') is wise, brave, but always scary, so She treads a fine line in the wonderful and annoying with unprecedented comfort. And it could easily have been a character that could damage the film; it is surprisingly entertaining and memorable. <br /> <br /> But what about the monsters and the animals? I heard you crying. They rather than tempered but surprisingly effective Lord Black, rather than temple dwellers, rather than the weird but fun stop motion / animated zombies limited (thus continuously endeavoring to continuously fail to move on the uncertain Tsau-shen). A messy flying head is complete with a surgical, and quite outstanding wire work. Most of these are not top-notched yet. <br /> <br /> But the most amazing effect and creation is the killer tongue of the tree's soul. We first face it with the 'Evil Dead' style with the effect of a camera effect, because it gives the ability to deliver fierce French kisses that make fun of their victims, making the victims as a junkyfied whistle. But later it is shown all his crazy glory. It is so big and long that it shoots through the forest after hunting, separates the trees, covers themselves around the house and thrives around their surroundings before throwing them around the trees and throwing them down on the trees! It can even split open to express a fan filled face! It is a terrible idea that deeply romantic should be given the main plot. But it's superb and unforgettable effects. <br /> <br /> So the sum of all this is a great example of making Hong Kong movies. A real party effort that gave us the real ground breaking film. It is most important, with intelligence, innovation, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, gorgeous ideas, lovely visual, beautiful music, and its most permanent charm, one of the most running romances.
