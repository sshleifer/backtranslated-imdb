This image is an excellent military movie. It can not be a superb Hollywood movie, but it does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for better entertainment, but that is not the case with this movie. Other critics found this movie to be too slow for their taste, but ?? As a retired soldier ?? The movie crew praised the speed of two hours and nine minutes deliberately to tell their stories as much as possible. The story itself has been called and has been retold on many times, but it remains for a professional soldier ?? And that's a African American ?? Report about the story presented by the film crew, and it represents the US Navy in the world. Brashear's work became a navy, and after his graduation is not the only story that is presented in his life as the Navy Diver. There the Master Chief Petty Officer denies the illegal order of his commanding officer on Sunday that the Pet Officer's second class brusher did not pass his test dive, no matter how good he was and paid the price of one strip and the appointment was a change. It also tells the fact that during the 1950s, Brasier lost the third hydrogen bomb in the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of Spain, and how he saved the lives of another voyager, which was shot in the line of the snapping current line, Brasier shot himself without firing him. It was a complicated story that was worth mentioning, and I would admit that it was not enough to say two hours and nine minutes full story, and I can tell from the deleted scenes from the DVD that the crew tried his best to tell their story as much as possible. As a professional soldier, I am proud to be known in such a comprehensive story and to see the heritage and respect of this natural and fully protected navy.
