All right, so the musical pieces were badly written and are usually sung badly (though Walken and Marner, especially Walken, had quite well). And thus they broke the king's fourth wall and praised the king and senior people for singing "war" and attempting to push them into boots when they can not tell about the rights. <Br> <br /> Care? It's a movie based on Christoph Freakin 'Walken, a fairy tale, and he's singing and dancing. His acting style fits a very nasty, nasty side roles, which seems to have deepened his master deeper, but the plan really thinks with seven or eight steps. And if you've ever seen Vernon in his volume roles, you know * ogrets end up clotting the dust while the Wakeen him in his trap. <br /> <br /> An interesting movie, and a Christopher Walken will certainly see for those who enjoy the unique style.
