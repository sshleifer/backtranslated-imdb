Some people think that the second series in which Skobie was destroyed. I totally disagree. It shows that the quality does not go up or down and scraps, my opinion won as a very good rectifier. I saw a poll at jumpedtheshark.com and 72% said the second series of Scrappis was the Scabby Downfall. He said so many loads yes but 28% still can not be wrong. I pay attention to most episodes in the comedy. I believe if the show is a holes, then believe it. The same formula. The secret of 5 people / dog solutions in scrappy shows. There was a breath of new wind in the sun, some people showed, but when the scrapie was shown, the images were shown in Doubleday. Go back to the show. All episodes and sections were very funny. I was intriguded by Yabba Shorts. But at the end of the day it is a matter of opinion if you do not like scrappy matter of opinion, certainly involves no incident. But in my opinion this was a great series that started a tire starting a new formula and life lease show. Saif said.
