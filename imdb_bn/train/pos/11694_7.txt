Chris Rock star of the rebuilding of Warren Batty's Heaven Canrit (this 1941 movie here's James Jordaan), before realizing his dream, a comedy about his events before and after realizing his dreams. New (though temporary) body. In the BT edition, the novel was the fourth time of the backup for Los Angeles Ram. In the Hiper edition of Rock, our lead character is a struggling young man - and neatly less talented - stand-up comedian. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting that the razor-sharp rock watching bad comedians. Tom Hendes looks like a bad actor. Lance Burton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a miracle night. But every time he tried his material, he was slowly booed from the stage - so much so that his nickname "Booie." Her joke is hairy, her delivery is painful. In short, the lance is not really the true Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a bicycle messenger and he is trying to find more things when he is walking around the street on the road! He was hit by a truck. All right, so perhaps one-tenth of his body was taken by a little incapable angel (Eugene Levi), but hey, he was going to get hit. There is no dice, it seems that the lens is not in heaven until 2044. So what to do? Mr. King (Chase Palmintery), "Manager" of Heaven, reluctantly reluctantly finds Mr Burton as the body of a new body. The problem is that the body they find is greedy, old white people. This flaunts out (one Mr. Wellington) owner of all kinds - he is the 15th richest person in the country! What a fate! You can imagine how the lens will turn things around. <br /> <br /> But of course, for the rich Mr Wellington, Lance is recruited for a fantastic hospital worker (Regina King). Men know how difficult it is to find a woman given to our body, but when you are a stupid, old white man, try to conquer one another! And it's even worse when your money is not affected by it. <br /> <br /> This is the main role of Rock's first character, and in my opinion, he plays a commendable role. There are still many stopup comedians in it - and, of course, if they ever want to take different roles, they have to stop adding standup routines to the script - but this is not really a bad thing. Rock's personality - its drive, its delivery, its demeanor, and its passion - this film is fuel. She definitely has a lot of fun in the role, and she feels bent to make sure she has fun to see him.
