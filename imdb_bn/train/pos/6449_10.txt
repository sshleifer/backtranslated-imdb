I was taken to this photo by a friend and had doubts about a Swedish film with subtitles. However, I enjoyed every minute of this beautiful movie perfectly. The unimportant cruelty that people have enriched with incredible images - although animal lovers can cover their eyes for a few seconds in the first 10 minutes for a few seconds. In contrast to the atrocities, a traditional story of suffering and humor was illustrated with a simple angle, using a spectrum of characters with very common errors and features. I especially liked that the film led to more than one aspect of biological behavior, discrimination and terrorism concerned to handle multiple aspects of human behavior. The jewel of a movie that I will preach to everyone who will listen.
