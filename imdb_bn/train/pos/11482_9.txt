This movie was originally shot on the camera operated by the actors. In some ways, a video diary from a ridiculously murderer is full due to the "Colombian" style attack. Although this movie does not answer all the big questions, it gives you insight into how easy it is. Through the film you have shown how the actors shorten the shot gun, create pipe bombs, and bring an action plan for "Zero Day". Actors (if you can call them) were brilliant, perhaps they borrowed a lot from their lives, but at some point I could not really play them (some have to try Tom Cruise). The use of CCTV and 911 operators was genius, but I was not sure if we needed the last scene. Overall though a really difficult movie is a really good movie.
