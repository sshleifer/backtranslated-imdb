In the first five episodes of the series "Hammer's House of Horror" in Hummer's small race, this fifth episode of "The House the Death's Blood to Death" is the most controversially highest maximum. For many years, as a great fan of Hammer studio's Gothic Horror movies, I have taken so much time to start watching the series recently. So far, I have only seen the first five episodes and I have a strong feeling that the best will not yet come, but I would be happy if the series is as entertaining as the first five episodes. The second and third episodes were excellent for their appealing and impressive playful darkness, this fifth entry must have been the first five out of which the most real horoscope is available. The episode begins when an elderly person murders his wife outside unknown motivation. A few years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davis) went home with their little girl Sophie (Emma Ridley). However, after proceeding, the family should find out that there is something wrong with the house, which is apparently scary ... the second episode managed by Francis Megahi is far better than the previous entry between the "rising torment" (episode 4), and roughly unknown actors Provide good performance. Film effects, cinematography and score are well-made. "The House to Blood to Death" is a tough episode that my fellow Hammer fans would like to see in a short story story. The film is a wonderful environment, delivers truly awesome moments and intelligent twists, and suspicious and extremely entertaining from the beginning to the end. Overall, this Hammer fans are highly recommendable.
