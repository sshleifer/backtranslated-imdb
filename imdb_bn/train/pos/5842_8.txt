Do I just "I like it" can be easy and primitive in my assessment? It's rational by bit funny, it got bigger and looks fantastic at it. The songs (almost two repetitions are there) are forgotten, but they get healthy harmful treatment (such as tender handsome Mr. Fairbanks explode in the fanzed Wagnerian version of Tender Ballad Miss Grable); There is not much dance with the 1861 Crinolin covered around Miss Grab, and the comedy can be a little more handy, but the result is still very uphill. Photography (including an exciting thriller with real outdoor shots) is amazing, lots of heavy gold playing with different shades. Miss Grable is a little bit in its main and front a bit, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental "olde worlde" comedy. With Rita Haythth's line of "down to earth" it's pretty cool, and many of them do not like it. So I think many would think that "Lady in Ermine" would be old and stuffy. But it's a fairy tale, and this tend to move along a certain paste in anyway. My suggestion is - just offer artwork, clothing, malicious script and everything else in this movie and stop the complaint. The movie was released in Germany and DVD in both DVDs in Germany.
