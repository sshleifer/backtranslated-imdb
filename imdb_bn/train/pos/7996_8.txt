Money is confident, ugly, nasty opposite-action thriller, a bodyguard who is determined to find out (and destroy!), The girl's killers asked her to protect her. This picture is almost an immunity to the politically correct atmosphere of today. Director Scott has no intention of apologizing for the inherent immorality behind the dramatic structure of the film. Scott is not conscious or does not care for 30 years of social progress. I do not really think we'll see a violent movie soon, so you can go better and you can do it. Despite its intense intensity, I think the film is a powerful example of the most cruel, exploitative and effective time of the movie. Scott has a hard thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. It's very useful for me to ignore the extraordinary technical aspects of this film. Scott's directory choices are simply amazing, and he pulls out a great performance beyond Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls should stay away from this, but I recommend to the audience that it is looking for a great, action-filled movie.
