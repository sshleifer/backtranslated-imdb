You watched this movie, you came to Puerto Rico. I live in Puerto Rico throughout my life, and shamefully acknowledged that we (PR) have maintained a genuine disorder now, the main reason for the killings of drugs and the main reasons for the killings. These people will shoot at any time and anywhere, and as a result many innocent lives are lost. We do not feel secure anymore, as well as our so-called "justice" is not removed by truth and justification, but by money, influence and power. "Ladronus EMantirisos" is based on real, reprehensible events and portrays the three main problems of Puerto Rico: Drug-related killings, securities and power plants transform into our courtroom and innocent people and children are corrupt and even die because of this. Ricardo and his wife Poly, their real life plots and their award winning title (**), were brave enough to present them as bad: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country, which does not seem to last a nightmare !!! ** At the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival, he recently won the "Copper Wing Award" as the best director of the world film competition.
