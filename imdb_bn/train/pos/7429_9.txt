He is such a great singer who thinks of something else !!!! That final scene shows the best moments of the show all the time - one of the times !! I'm glad to keep the camera on itself for ten minutes - it's worth the historic status - just like voice power. <br /> <br /> I saw this image at the age of five years and it had a huge impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I see some flaws (as Esther wants to give up his Grammy's right as a reward). <br /> <br /> Some other user comments are simply plain lies - I mean, where is the naked nudity - maybe we saw different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing ability is memorable, and if he has a big ego - fine! <br /> <br /> he has earned.
