Just two comments ... Seven years apart? Proof of power of uninterrupted plying power of the film! As mentioned, the telomovic status of a 13-gantry less budget budget is a lesser reason for its limited appeal. While saying that the thing is not merit - either as entertainment or scared of competition. <br /> <br /> In fact, the plot is the most important part of the restoration of the Amiviwil Horro - except for the most horrific. A case of conspiracy! If Heilfax investigates some investigations involving the apparently unrelated murder of "home" as the main suspect, Gibini has made it even better. The scripts are average and better than the overall production of a high quality. This fails to connect with viewers in particular at what moment. <br /> <br /> In my regular video store last week, I can not afford to get disconnected from taking DVDs for just $ 3.95. $ 10.95 will be an acceptable price for the film. Just do not expect the fireworks!
