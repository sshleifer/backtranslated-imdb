So Broad Pitt and Juliet Lewis, who joined Demo Dvoovini and Michelle Forbes, traveled west on the road, played his role. The next couple is researching the infamous murder site for an upcoming book; Pitt Lam's serial killer (Dave's unknown) and Juliet, his poor, non-all-mate partner. It comes with a good cast and story, but Pitt is not terribly scared like a serial killer, though it is one of his previous roles. The best thing here is Michelle Forbes, who always plays the role of 'HumanSide: Life on the Street' or 'Wonderland' in a short series.
