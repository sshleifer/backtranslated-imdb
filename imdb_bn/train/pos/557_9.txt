I came from Yosem Square, Alaska from Dasun City a few years ago and was visibly impressed, I can not help but I can not expect whether this picture is also shot in beautiful colors and beautiful scenes. Canadian Rakis Jasper is a great place, but there is still no such place where the film is made. When the story takes Doshen, I think Anthony Mann, who used so well outside places, could have made the most of the film if he was actually filming in the real place. James Stewart here again is a man fighting himself, some of them do not want to be involved and do not want to help those who stand in the way of earning money, and on the other hand just can not stay away from killing people. Ruth Roman is an aspiring woman who does not depend on whom she does not care, Corin Calvert is an excellent girl. Man is shooting a nice shootingout, but how well he is in the outdoor view of the movie high point. He uses as far abroad as possible and he helps with green trees of green spinach, by the winter scenery, with the dominant white, such as "nakad spur" and "lammi to man". Like Man-Stewart, it is a traditional western, a difference between the expansion of Stewart's character, which is more complex.
