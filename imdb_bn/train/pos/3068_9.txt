I went to the cable directly to this film that gathered to read the previous comments. Well, I've paid for watching it in a theater, and I'm glad because I apparently had an interesting movie on it. Most settings seem to have been made in the 60's 60's (without shrinking the office, which was dated on any other date), and if you leave Neve Campbell sequences, the entire film was washed in the early 60's. And the use of the restaurant in the movie was impressive. For the first time the director, whose background I believe, in writing, he has a great eye. In the first ten minutes, I thought that this plot was not sufficient, so I voluntarily suspended my unbelief and went on a journey. Acting and father of son, mother-son, husband-wife, screenplay of parents-child relationship, the film was spot-on. William H. Messi, the pleasure to see, it seems to have forgotten the remnant of Tony Parkes, if it and Magnolia give any indication. Tracey Woolman is a minor runner as a negligent wife. This is a three-dimensional illustration of a character which is often seen as bi-dimensional in society. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add to his collection of his unforgettable paintings. Parental screenplay (Bine / Switcherland) reminds me of Vincent Galoor Buffalo '66 indirectly, though quite a bit down! I must pay to see the second movie from this director. He is the self-discipline of the 50-B-CrimeField Director (some will never have P. Anderson!), But he has a way of interacting with actors to give a visual style and attention.
