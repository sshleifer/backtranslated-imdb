I was not aware of Steve McQueen in 1958. I just knew I was going to see this movie. (I was devastated by the movie "Tantula" at the age of seven ... but I was ten now). The first scene where Blob crores the farmer's probing stick and holds his hand, so I forced me to leave the theater. But I live and suffer through the attacks of our giant. Steve and his daughter rarely came out of the doctor's office (poor doc) and when I entered the movie movie theater and ate a large part of the audience, I still felt such a horror feeling. . . So many IT wows have been done from the front door, now just to fit in one. It seemed integral and unlimited in the probability of growth, and when it was stopping the poor Steve in a glamorous diner, he seemed to be sure of a dinner. <br /> <br /> Tell me that the blob was colder than the modern day, but in the end, the snow is better than the terrible and mentally broken little kids. <br /> <br /> I think that my uncle Nik, in the evening, trying to do brave work. He knew that I was in trouble, and when I went to sleep that night, I could not feel alone in the house, but when I looked downstairs, I called for courage, there red rash, hungry dood like heart sitting and waiting for me to go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I am 57 years old now. . . I've made it <br /> <br /> Surely the blob did not destroy.
