I saw the dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this film is not for everyone, especially people who do not like poor scenes, such as a dentist has a large number of scenes. This is why it has R18 rating. This is about a Beverly Hills dentist Dan Allan Fiston, who cheated his wife Brooke with Pullman. If you see it "before" your dentist is better to go to the doctor. But if you do not already like to go to dentists dentist, it is best not to see that going away for your life can be stopped. The best bloody retaliation in the dentist I saw was. Who ever saw a movie whose a doctor has thrown his right cheek wife's teeth and drunk his tongue? Overall terrific blaze, but not for everyone.
