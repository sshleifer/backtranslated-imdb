Director Michael Taqi is one of the best. It's very good to keep it in words. It's thrilling to me from the old age at the age of fifteen years more than the target audience. <br /> <br /> This reminiscent of the movies of the 1980s reminds of movies (unlike today) who are not afraid to panic - there are some nasty details that I initially found in Jarring but soon realized that I would grow up Not something different. The film is a compilation of the 80's movie conventions. You name it, it is: A small boy goes into another person's own unhappy / dangerous world, which lives through myths and mysterious people; A search for saving both the world from a naughty power; A beautiful heroine she has a crash; An adventurous pregnant (go-go ubri 1 from bill bill volume); It can be related to such a prominent villain who grasps his evil power from everyone on earth. But all these General Conventions are given a new spin and extra depth. <br /> <br /> One of the IMDB reviews starts with "Where was the movie when I was young?" And it's a feeling I sincerely agree. Even while watching it, I made it big that I did not grow up on it; That's not part of my childhood, such as laboratory, the universe's master and much less, the Nevada Story. Others like these movies and The Goenje are remembered but not copied - Michael steadfastly offered us a new new proposal. <br /> <br /> Poor CGI is the head of many of his films, sometimes due to budget constraints. Often an artistic choice - a desire to present ways in a lazy way. Here CGI is mostly average, due to budget constraints, yet he does a fantastic job on a philosophy. CGI effects combine with traditional dolls, animatronices and really amazing makeups that can create a world full of rich characters (and characterization) that often cross the borders of dreams. <br /> <br /> This is one of the largest children ever made. Not for young or more sensitive kids. <br /> <br /> Just jaw blurry is wonderful. See it for yourself and if you think that your kids can handle / appreciate it, show it to them. Great Yokai grew up in battle, because of some small compensation for what you can not do.
