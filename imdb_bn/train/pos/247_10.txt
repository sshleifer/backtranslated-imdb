I love this movie because it shows that they are not killing fun but to save their preferences! Heather Ledger and Orlando Bloom have done an excellent job that illustrates Nude and Joe. It has some fast inappropriate scenes, but it is just fine. Language is very light and sometimes even does not know it. This film shows that they are not just law enforcement agencies because they are violent killers! I hope people will see this movie and know about it during important times of history. One of the things that impresses me about this movie is that they got inspiration from their book for a dancer book! Also people remember their how, from their armor. I hope people will watch this movie and will be interested in me as well.
