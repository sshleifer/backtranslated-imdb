I enjoyed Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for his chin action and semi-critical scripts. Many complain about the "misleading" plot in the first film, perhaps it is stupid like a stone plot with the same super-action to carry it through "Nemesis 2: Nebula". <br /> <br /> This is the name of the first film hero, Alex, a very super-woman sent in the past for the preservation of the future. She is raised by a tribe of Africa. A good part of the film has a dialogue with African tongues without just a subtitle, which I like because it seems a bit pure (often trying to do movies in this genre?). It does not take long for the evil cyberbugs to spend time in time to spend time and try to kill him. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong, it's a nasty thing (not that the first one was great). There are sub-plots involved in African political instability, hunting, and tribal warfare. The picture is very small on the brain, so any one of these things gets very good treatment. A drawn-out war with some chases that boils from the musically-musically versus cyborg. It has a quality of entertainment, not only quality or the first movie does not expect anything.
