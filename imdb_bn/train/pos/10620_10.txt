After seeing the first, I think this story is less boring than other Canon movie tales. After a lot, I think it's the best. The songs are quite bad, especially the songs of love, but two things that make the film, even the song can sing. One industrial aspect Like other Canon movie tales, it's a beautifully decorated piece piece; Each part of the cloth and gem (both of which are the main part of the film's plot) looks fresh and new and the farmers face flat cloth. Even during the song of love, I studied the prince's clothes and hair, surprisingly done it. Other things are comic timing. Most of the movie is Chess, but Emperor Vantaa (and finally making fun of her), the suspect's guardian, Nicholas's keeper, and the stupid prince were all very funny and seemingly ridiculous. . And Wave-O created this song sequence for songs that were not so good.
