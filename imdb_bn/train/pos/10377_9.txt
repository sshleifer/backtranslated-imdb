A film I expected very little, and only to pass a quiet hour pass - but what has it turned into an hour? If there is no serious story of 'Country-boy-losing-big-town-made-good', the roll is awesome, it is impressive, respectful of characters and speed correct. << br /> <br /> With Toby Malone's picture of the real star Matt Lover, he said that the country's boy and local Australian roulette football heroes came to the big city to try for a big group of big teams. She is nicely supported by John Bythele as John Gangster Tinny. Look for these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
