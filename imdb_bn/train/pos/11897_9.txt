This is a nice little awful flick that fans of the indie film will be really grateful. It's well-played, plenty of fun, and has a decent plot. Movies like The Hills House Is and Pumpkinhade will be remembered. It is obvious that the budget was not so big, but the film has really created it for actors in the atmosphere and for strong performance, which seems to be the lack of special effects-perfect films of today's big budget. The film has really moved along and has excellent aspects and good camera work. There is no lost scene, so the film's length is a little short. In addition, it looks like an opening for a sequel like the last episode, which will be very interesting as well. So grab some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy this one.
