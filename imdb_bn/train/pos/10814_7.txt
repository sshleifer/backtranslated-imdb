In the reverse circumstances of 2009, where the reality is that we have a black President, this film takes a very strong historical significance. I think this film is both compelling and hostile for entertainment. I came back certainly by satire racialism in most of the time, but found incredible music and dance. Also very young child actor Sammy Davis Jr. looks quite calm He played Rufus Jones, a young boy who comforted Mammy. He is called, why can you be the President? It was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was considered ridiculous and beloved, charming and funny. If most of the film is driven by a black story, an imaginary sequence like the government. They represent government seats just like a revivalist Baptist church. <br /> <br /> One day I was disappointed with this movie. It was really good and was very entertaining. I believe if we look outside of racism we can bring this movie to us. Actually I realize that this is not ridiculous to the black President, but it is normal, only makes this movie more relevant. It clearly identifies a moment for our collective consciousness.
