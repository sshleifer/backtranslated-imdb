Nothing else (3+ out of 5 stars) Another strange determination from the movie "Cube" director This time there are about four main characters who carry themselves and their home from a mysterious white spaces. There is literally nothing beyond their two small stories in the house. Quick to be sure, but I think the established comedic tone for this movie became very sick. Of course, there must be some humor, of course ... and I have no problem with this humor which eventually arose from the misery of our two heroes (their final "showdown" was definitely hot) ... but I really think this movie is in reality it It's a lot better if it's more stable. After watching the movie, I saw the "Making Off" feature in DVD and at the end a small trailer is not completely complete with "silier" comedic aspects ... it looks like a completely different (and slightly better) movie. The last half an hour in the movie where things start to come together ... the latest movie "Primer." The actors are fine when they are not overdoing comedy shtick. They are really quite credible in their more "normal" moments. As a failed test at midway point, I was probably ready to write this movie ... but in the end it won me. (And watch out for achievements for the final scene ... just do not ask me to explain it.)
