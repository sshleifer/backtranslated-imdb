By purchasing the first season price (Canadian release) from Amazon, I took a chance at "Hardcast and McCarthy". When I got this, I started with the pilot, and after that I rush. I rated it 5 stars in Amazon, and I'm rating 10 stars here. It's just that good. Open and closing themes at the end of each episode and of course Stephen J. I like the logo of the cartoon, but in most cases the relationship between the judge and the mark works with the crack in every case. I was so strong that I bought the second partner as a partner, and I also enjoyed it. If you do not have this awesome series of disks, I believe that you will buy it and keep it in your collection.
