I love the new episode with CJ and Grandad - I like the story with the fall of the Chief Principal of Kate. I would like to find out what happens between Rory and Kerry and Breedgate and the next family. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scene with Grandad. I always love James Garner all the time, and one of his achievements is that I do not think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and believe in him as a father. This family is so real and fun It was very sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessy died, but how it happened in real life and how it was written in the series, and both funny and sad and always behaved extremely sensitive and lovingly. But usually a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun.
