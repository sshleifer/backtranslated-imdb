Kim Novak is a witch and a choice of James Stewart for a deadly boyfriend. From the Broadway stage, graduate entertainment trick; James Wang White Witch paint shots, and performed by a sterling cast. Arnie Kovacs is absolutely wonderful as the undisputed writer Redlight. I love this movie, although few others think. Kim makes a winner in my book alone. Haha My # 5 1958 film.
