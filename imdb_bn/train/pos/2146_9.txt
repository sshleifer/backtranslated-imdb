I saw this delightful Japanese feature film on the 5th anniversary Roger Ebert Overflow Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theater of Champaign in Illinois. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is subtitled in English, its heart is dancing ballroom, this picture shows how the world outside Japan shows the strict structure, employment and welfare of the families in modern days. <br /> <br /> The author / director Suo Masawiki [I follow the Japanese custom of presenting the family name (last name) first and given name (last)] does not use so popular themes of ballroom dancing to show Japan's social structure. <br /> <br /> [I do not use the name of the film's character when the world reader may not be familiar with Japanese formal names that may be confusing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> dancer Potty Tamio is her first and so far, only motion picture . He is a dance teacher in his father's dance studio. Nevertheless, his real ambition was to compete once again in an international dance competition which he was disqualified from the past. No, I would not say "why." Watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie's main star Salarman Yakuzo Kozi. Since 1979, an experienced man in 25 films, he gave some of the 40 companies a starling performance <br /> <br /> with a lovely wife, teenage girl, and her <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, to become "involved" with the Bollywood dance Check out this movie and secretly read it <br /> <br />. Most dance characters are freed from tradition <br /> <br /> Japanese classification of social structure. They are friendly and warm and inviting. Of course, how important is the Japanese society in terms of how it is formed with the philosophy of "for everyone and its place for everyone". <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of fun moments. About 1,500 Theater Girls During Comedy Moments <br /> <br /> The spontaneous smile is gone. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> that comedy has no foreign language. <br /> <br /> Gentleman actor is not funny, bright and bright, and Erico in Watanabe. They are two funny character actors. <br /> <br /> Someone can buy college textbooks related to life structure in Japan, or you can see this beautiful movie and understand how <br /> <br /> The people of Japan are getting bigger in a fairly strict social structure. Seeing the movie "Are we dancing?" See more rapid immersion in research and see other <br /> <br /> Japanese Movies. <br /> <br /> I recommend this picture to everyone. It's funny, it's charming, it will make you cry a bit, and it will warm your heart. <br /> <br />
