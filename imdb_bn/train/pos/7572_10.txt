I can not believe that these games can be so good, but they do. Unfortunately I had to hire a dreamcast to play it, but I could not wait to buy it for PS2 even if I could lose it. The only series of these games that I want to keep all of them in their own hands, even if I fight them many times. I hope they will not be able to stop this kind of game even after the series is over. <br /> <br />
