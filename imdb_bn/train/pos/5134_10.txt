This short was nominated for the Academy Award and I want to win it! Originally a featured Jam session among some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood often embraces jazz (especially animation, does not believe it) but it is an irresistible jam, a rare look in the film. This film has been added to the reservation list and so deserve. TCM routinely manages it as a filler, and it is paying "31 Days of Oscars" every March. From the city of Buzzer, snihs, without the net, the shot is so smooth, the net was not removed just yet. Most strongly and highly recommended !!!
