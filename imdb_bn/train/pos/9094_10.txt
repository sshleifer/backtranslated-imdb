When I watched this independent movie in Philadelphia and it was a beautiful surprise. I leave the theater with a smile on my face. It was such a funny thing that it was based on a real story - ridiculous! It has some great character actors too. Mindy Sterling is it and very good. I liked her on the power of Austin. Howard Hesseman is also awesome I remember him from the head of the class. I'm all tired of dark dark movies that are tired. It's fun and light, and I can see it with my family and can not feel embarrassed. Keep checking to see when I will be out of the DVD. I would definitely buy it.
