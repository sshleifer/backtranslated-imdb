The first is to consider the time to create this film. The rappers were in 1995, and it was added to its mood. <br /> <br /> Remy is not trying to find a socially painful teenager and could not, until she got friends by the Nazi met. They take him away The Nazis are not weird, but like most gangs, they are ineffective, socially, emotionally, whatever their lack of it. Michael Rappappan plays the whole part. <br /> <br /> Omar was a star on the Hot Shot track track, it was a suspicious working principle and a chip on his shoulders. He tried to feel sorry for himself and his woes, and wanted to straighten his girlfriend and professor on him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Christen was trying to find himself and trying to fit himself. She was raped the date. Then he was involved in his own sexuality, and politically involved. <br /> <br /> This picture is related to racism and dealing with racialism, like most things, people's own views come into play. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of comments about what was not a 'bad' black character but bad white one (Nazi). So what? Rami was not portrayed as bad, he was trying to find his way, and failed until some skinheads took him. He was afraid, he saw how he worked. He said before he himself killed himself, I did not mean to say, I wanted to be an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Icecab and Butt Rami were black male angry, Ice cab was somewhat intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was just pictured as a stupid bang. Both of them did not face any consideration for their roommates, and generally do not like white people very much. They were angry like the Nazis, but in the context of overall evil, there was no stage in the Nazis. Sorry, if it seems inappropriate, but is there a black group like Najis? <br /> <br /> <br /> People say it looks white = good black = good. Not true, only bad white characters were Nazis and police, which are few or really true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (Omar epps roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just confused. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Dense and Busta were serious flawed characters, angry and inconsistent. Although the police might justify some of their anger on their constant harassment. Rama's disqualification seemed to fix his anger. Good movie, good job. Just like the movies that work with racism, it's a big part that is going to start discussions. <br /> <br /> I do not think that Quebec and Buena Kana defeated those Nazis.
