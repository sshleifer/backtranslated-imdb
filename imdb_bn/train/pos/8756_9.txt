I caught this movie by accident in the wire in the middle and it was rented to see it in fullness and I was glad I. I was immediately drawn by the story and cared for the girls involved. Undergraduate high school graduation, good friends from childhood, take a high school trip and take a severe fate by a con man named Nick who is taking it. They are used as sturdy dirt in a heroin runner's ring. The girls in custody learn to adapt to their jails while trying to find their way to the pain. Thai criminal looks at the judicial flaws and their American lawyer loses the trust of "Yankee Han" and the girls end up suffering more and lose their faith. After betraying by Alice (Claire Dane), Hannah was tried to protect them. However, Han's Thai Native Wife smells a rat in this case and gets more of the investigation and finds out what the girls are really hunting. When Alice did selfless work to save Darlin (Bacinsel), the movie was over. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
