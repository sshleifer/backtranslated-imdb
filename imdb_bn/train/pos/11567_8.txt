In the 1930s, studios will use small-scale films based on experimental testing for newcomers, their relative production will be easier compared to full-length features, so it is interesting that it will star the Sheryli Temple, who has long established itself as the most famous child star of all time. . Then again, perhaps he was not tested, I used to imagine that Frank Kogal√°n Jr., who starred in the movie Sheryli's Sonny and distributed a relatively less impressive performance. Then again, the 9-year-old Sheryli Temple was probably not an easy task. <br /> <br /> This image is open with a lucky ceiling with an unseen visual scene, which I think designed to create the Shirli Temple. To give a terrible appearance on the roof, portray the status of the working class in the family of the film and provide a clear transformation in the next scene, which Sherly Steeping in the rain terrifyingly. <br /> <br /> This is Sony's birthday, and her father sometimes makes a secret and awesome effort that she wants to give to Soni the dogs she really wants for herself, but Sony is afraid of the dogs because she once hit And went out forever. From It is very excited that when his father advised to force the dog, Sony decides to flee to the house rather than the dog in the house and escapes without any destination in philosophy, it is also strange that what the movie looks like <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Will be given, but no matter). Sony leaves her smile after receiving breakfast from the person after sharing the breakfast due to the scarf, she continues and the homeless man disappears from the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Skin covered in dog skull down.

We already do not expect an epic plot in a 19-minute film, but in the passing moment, the Pups in Powordan still pack a significant amount of story and character development.
