When I hired to watch this movie, I knew that it was not going to be a Mandabandara movie. Instead I'm going to get serious fatal to someone where it has been thought of as an unbelief of reality. And you know what it does. What Curt Russell did was, I played an extraordinary role in referring to the impossible soldier I had shown. If I want to see you out with the boys and see a good action film then this movie recommends.
