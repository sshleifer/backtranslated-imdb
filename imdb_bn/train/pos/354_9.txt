The San Francisco model model-a group of Cali, who has become friends from elementary school, is suddenly threatened and some of them have sent a strange Valentine's day card. Who is the killer and why the killer after them? <br /> <br /> My rating will often change in the next scenes of a movie - sometimes slightly up, sometimes a little down. However, I can not remember another movie where my rating has changed greatly for Valentine. For the first time I saw it, on its dramatic release, I thought it was very awful - I gave it a 10 F4 equivalent to the grade "F". Last night to see it for the second time, I could not think about what it's like to hack. I can only guess that I really was in the wrong mood to see it, or maybe I did not find it. At any event, I like it, it gives 9 out of 10 or "A". It seems ridiculous that I did not get a movie like this, but there are some things to get there. Valentine is almost a comedy / horror Responsible for the 1998 Urban Kingsend director Jamie Blanks became so popular in the late 1990's in the context of Scrum (1996) and Valentin's deliberately absurdity point around Chess / Campi (where a positive style of absurdism is the word). Above him, he gives a film depicted with ridiculous commentary on our romantic relationship. Humor is unusual that teen has the same exaggeratedly camp tone as horrible direction. In most cases of the film, and villain's gravity operation, ridiculous or not, it is associated with Valentine's Day theme. <br /> <br /> Many visitors will probably reduce the points from the movie for their different clicks. Revealed but incredible situations and the development of the plot. However, in light of the above, the film deliberately clich√©d, impossible and ridiculous. Generally, the conventional conventions of Blacks (and mostly successful) can exceed the small slash through fun / spoofing. It's a celebration of the horror film on Valentine's Day. It is an inconsistent film that is glossy throughout the film, and it is in the heart of Slashar's style, making it the main cover for Valentine's extraordinary lamp. The horror element of the scramm was a similar target, but the twist was "self-aware of the film" Valentine's Day is not deliberately self-conscious; Visitors will have to rely on relevant sources for wizarding. Some feel that I am "reading too much" in the film, in a black interview that Black has said that he does not want to film another slasher after "Urban Legend" and producer Dylan Sellars says that he wants some "more adult" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Other viewers may dislike the idea that Valentine's Day is a lot different from its durable source material, Tom Sagez's novel of the same novel. The novel's character, setting and plot are very different from the film. Vendors said, "It was a fine book, I do not think it's the right story for a movie". Instead, the novel, which is used as a lot more dryer, more serious, as the launching pad, is a motif to create variations for the horror / thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. Although these phenomena will not help purists who are familiar with books like film, but the film will help to understand the reason for its varied plot and attitude. It is most likely to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> Blanks' direction is visually impaired. There's a lovely look across the complex, deep colors, interesting sets and good staging across Valentine's Day. Simply keep his villains and the scenes are not too dark to attack, clearly appreciated for the stated action. He directly directs his actors with the support, often imitating ridiculous ridiculous performances. David Boris, like Adam Carr, is involved in a very funny moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> -Gal hope but you can appreciate yourself a lot more.
