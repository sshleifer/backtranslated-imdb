After a classic Martin adaptation of Versailles's Warsaw Wards' classic Berlin radio adaptation to the real Martin attack, a group of deadly Martins shows on Earth that they want to win their plans only to awaken their plans. Elements and in reality all alone. <br /> <br /> This is really good and fun, some decent lines (just check memorable quotes) to boot. This will probably appeal to sai-fi supporters. It has proved to be a lot better than it has been with me in the past as well as the time tested for me. Despite a shield made of no number star, this may only be the most interesting Monti Attack on the film. Interestingly, Martians seem to represent almost every classic action hero / Sai-Fi Hero stereotype (cool 50 teenager, warrior pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and cookie scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "DH ready! Thrust the world!"
