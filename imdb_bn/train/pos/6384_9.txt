It's written in stone that Disney Animation Cable ~ ~ should be musical instruments. Right? Where? Show me Because I tried to make it a lot more enjoyable to not be able to make Hawkey ~ five year old standard Disney Musical Rental. <br /> <br /> Although the story was not so bright that it was still quite good, enjoyable and brave. I expected a little more, yes, to consider the subject, but this movie is not frustrating or it was billed due to complete failure. <br /> <br /> Animation quality is average, but the conversation is quite strong, like story lines, plots, sub-plots, and extraordinary creativity found in this product. I'll refrain from outline the plot, as it has been done and done, but if you're a fantasy fan then it is good to see this movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best Disney Animated feature length film. <br /> <br /> This rate is 9.4 / 10 ... <br /> <br />:
