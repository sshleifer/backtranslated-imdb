At first this picture will be considered as your Western Western film, but it became very interesting and gave me the spell till the very end, which became very unusual. Experiences of past experiences with Charlton Hesson, (Sam Bargad), "Midway", "76, James Coburn," (Jac Provo), "Deadfall", "93", and Zach never forgot Sam and he was sure that he was caught With and return him. Unfortunately, Barbara Herssey, (Susan Bergd), "The Portrait of a Lady", was caught in this situation and found herself in sexually-disassociated men, who never asked her to leave alone. Sam Berger had to make some difficult decisions and I was pretty surprised at the conclusion. It was a very entertaining film and outstanding acting.
