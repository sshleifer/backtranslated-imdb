I must admit directly to the right, I'm not a big fan of the "family" film these days. Most of them, IMHO, are feelings shit. But it's a lot of fun like Tower Story before Pixar. The two main characters were probably very little scarred (especially in TNZ, compared to two cycles, but otherwise the film was even better), but it was made for the rest of the film. Animation looked great, though huge, though consistently good (I especially like the line of Hooper) "If I do not promise the mother that I will not kill you at her death, I will kill you!") And the actor is doing voice two, Lead Except, all was awesome (Dennis Leary doing an animated movie; no idea). And love everyone, love! I hope to have new videos.
