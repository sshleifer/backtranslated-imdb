Jane Austen must approve this one! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is very foolish, yet elegant without fun. He has very firmly expressed British accent (not myself as a British, I'm probably not the best judge, but he made me fool ... he was also nice in "Sliding Dors" ... I've sometimes forgotten him America !!). <br /> <br /> Bates also includes Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and the Philida Act (Emma Thampson's sister and mother) as women. They almost steal the show ... and there is no line of Miss Law! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
