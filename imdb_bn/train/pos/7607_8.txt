It's not good shot, well-written or well-played but it will be the most addictive show I've seen since Twin Picks. During each single revelation it is so good that you will see the episode for the closure of any next phase. They even slowed down the speed of the episode where they only reveal the information of each episode, but it seems that they just say what they want to tell you. But some of the acting is just awful and some duologue is cruel brutal. Some characters are very two dimensional. Jack and Keat, Saeed, and so many more experienced actors like Lock and Echo are really standing up for the actors. The development of the event can also be frustrating because the following episode is not seen in the previous episode. The annoying side plot is sometimes the story of telling you something. However, the back story where the second season was developed from a point of view further reveals more about the island than them. All her is a great show but not perfect.
