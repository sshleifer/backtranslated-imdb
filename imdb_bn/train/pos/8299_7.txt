Scientists and family members Matt Winslow (Robert Uriich) finally accepted an invitation to work on a micro-digit corporation in the space suit project, when he was married to his beloved wife Patricia (Joan Cassidy) and their son Rabbi (Barrett Oliver) and daughter corporation compound in a huge modern house Chrissy (Soleil Moon Fry). They adapted their friends, Tom Peterson (Joe Rigalbutto) and his family with a whole new lifestyle, and invited Tom Wingslo's family to join Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom is trying to challenge Matt to tell Matt that every member of the club has a detailed professional accession of Micro-Digitake, but is not tempted with the Mats offer. After that, the club's director Jessica Jones (Susan Lucy) friends Patricia and she is determined to join the club with her children. Matt felt the change in his family's behavior and decided to investigate the club, finding an evil secret information about Jessica and members. <br /> <br /> When I saw "Invitation of the Fire" in the 80's, I would love to partly remember "The Stopford Wives", with which people change the composition of the colony. I saw it today, and I received a great metaphor message against big corporations, when people literally live near Satan and sell their soul by earning higher salaries. I'm not sure if the author wants to give this explanation to the story, but I believe it fits perfectly. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convert para and infeno" ("Invitation to hell")
