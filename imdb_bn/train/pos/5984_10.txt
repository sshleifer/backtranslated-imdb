If it is seen in the right context, it is a great movie - it can be a parody of teenage-horror-devil-worship films (and they have seen lots of '80!)! When I saw this movie it came out first, and soon loved it. Being a big fan of KISS, it was very good to see the genes in the movie. And with a OZZY as a metal-hate preacher, something can not be worse! Also, Fastway was already loved by me, so it was very good to hear the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The real VHS (this pre-DVD) trim or cover for the cover was Sammy kneeling, playing a guitar with a "monster" a ring of his guitar. It was a special order, and at that time the price of VHS copies (about 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but that's not ridiculous value. The 'Ozaji-Gene' cover was made for only $ 5 release. Perhaps it is believed to be the only recognized person of genes and Ozzydi movies, so they cover it well! The same thing with the original "Little Shop of Horosc" - Jack Nicholson was in it for five minutes, but now he has covered him as the main star. <br /> <br /> I have a "trick or treat" web site, and it's amazing how many people were true people of Sammy tax! Fastway made their soundtrack album permanent to 'The Thirty Caraar' and made that mythology permanent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a good time, Rock-n-Roll movie. Of course not to be taken very seriously, but just enjoyed!
