Yes, following some plots is a bit difficult, and the bill has a tendency to be violent, but it's actually a great show, which I do not try to miss. A huge majority of episodes is very exciting and quite exciting, and the performance is fairly good, although I miss Roberto Taylor as Inspector Jina Gold and Todd Kirsty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I like the older episodes in new episodes and it's a shame that the program is now watched after the waterhead, I saw it easily at 8.00. Still, why I like the bill because it is not only harmful, but ultimately the caliphate makes the next episode unacceptable. Although it is true, it is more precise than that, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to take it very seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
