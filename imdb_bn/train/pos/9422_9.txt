When I learned about the death of Sir Alex Guinness, I saw the first of most of his films. The film is a wonderful drill comment even available after all these years. And guinness helps to make the charm in every frame. His eyes and face were bright, he put on white clothes that he wore. He and the film will be considered for both lifetime favorites.
