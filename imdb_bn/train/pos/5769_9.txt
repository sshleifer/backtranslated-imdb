Will you stop the Todd sheet? Let's give you $ 30,000 to create a movie and see what comes with you! The guy got 735 zombies and regular work for free throwing! The acting is surely ridiculous at times. Yes make-up is the greatest you should always see. But this is not the worst, if you want to see it, see the Zombie Nation with its Raquin zombies. <br /> <br /> This is a completely old fashioned Garrila film! Todd is a consummate professional, and almost all of a nice guy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems to be fetched away. But what the hell, I still love this movie. I want to get out from the secret of Tod's sheet and want to rebuild what he was going to do. Anyone ever tried to make a movie, they know that it ends, an achievement and itself.
