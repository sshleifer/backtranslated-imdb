I just want to say that I have seen this picture twice and I like it! Acting is fantastic and even though it's the same plot as "Increase Your Voices". I think plotting for those who like this kind of thing is never annoying. It has some great lessons and shows us that if we try, we can do something. An incredible film. I'm sure that this I will be watching for a long time. Though Britney Spears can write the book, but it is not a matter of realistic plot, possibly being part of love, but it is different and part of the struggle, but the best thing to come out of the end is really true in real life. The reason for the little criticism is that the main girl of this photo is always beautiful? Do you really think that if he was ugly or average then Holly could have met the perfect man in his dream? I suspect it ..
