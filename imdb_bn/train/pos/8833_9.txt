I was curious by the title, so during a tiny decay of insomnia (fuel by my curiosity ...), I saw it up and down. I then checked my TV list and saw it again! Despite the politics, heritage, culture, etc., seeing this movie, I have received a very clear perception that it is the same everywhere. Children's characters from Belgrade may be born, say, it is impossible to separate the differences between language and the language between the same time in the middle of the American Midwest. They must have been the same growing pain and introduction, politics apart: music, sex, movie figures, music, drinks, sports, music ... In fact, the same thing that was my time growing in Southern California in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> <br /> This was a diverse story, but the joy of the young man makes it much more enjoyable. Characters, especially young actors, were completely credible. I would not say Yugoslav "American graffiti", but I would say that it fits nicely with 50 themed movies.
