I recently watched the movie's version 54 with Judea, and when I praised the story and the music, I saw that the film failed to catch my attention. I hope '76 repeats will be the same story, except the Barbra Twist. I was glad - it's a lot more realistic and modern look than fame, money, love and its value. This version is '54 more than real, intelligent good music, good acting, more robust plot lines and of course, in deep love. I do not understand why the previous movie is on the top 100 list of the American Film Institute, although this impressive rimak has failed to make a mark in the critics list.
