Yes, it's a chick flick and it keeps moving slowly, but it's really quite good - and I think myself an intelligent people. If you want to love Judy Davis, she does not matter, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural, credible performance. <br /> <br /> Small, coastal summer scenes are beautiful and beautifully played. Main theme of the movie. Unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actress lend the reality to the movie that attracts you and keeps your attention. Overall, I give it an 8/10. Go see it.
