I do not think most people give as much credit as they claim to have this movie. I like low budget horror films and it's especially taking cakes for originality. Yes Scarecrow is a Kung Fu war, but why not? Anyone else who is willing to go. I really did not have this much fun watching a movie from Candyman. So the city calls this child a scream, even his mother does not care about it. Then he died and the soul is infused into the scarecrow, then who goes on a murder spree. It's easy to guess the death of the film once it's gone. Eventually the sacrifices go straight to a bunch of horror directors, but Dario has really hurt me with the most dedication to Argentina, these people who want to create a new genre film. There are many Arnold Rip Offs on the film, with one lanor you will definitely laugh about the stick and he will kill the sheriff with a stick. I would say, grab a Piza with some friends, close $ A $$ with this movie. I love it for its originality, the most fun.
