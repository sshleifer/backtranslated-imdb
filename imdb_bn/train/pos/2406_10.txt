This is best shown in what I really thought was like Jesus. Most movies show Jesus as rash, lobotomized or oppressed. This is Jesus who was laughing, playing, and critical when it was needed. This type of Jesus may be attracted to people, not usually the Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> The film takes some freedom, "trying to fill the empty places". But fillers seem impossible, even impossible. One thing I can argue was that the Romans did not really explain what Jesus did (the film shows that the Romans were the main drivers of Jesus' death, the Jewish authorities are not against this idea). <br /> <br /> Looks like the movie has been well researched. One example was a teenager called "Mark". It is believed that Mark (or John's sign) was pulled in a piece of cloth in the garden of Gatsman garden and was nude (Mark 14:51). I got the feeling that they tried to make the film as appropriate (even as a soul) as much as possible.
