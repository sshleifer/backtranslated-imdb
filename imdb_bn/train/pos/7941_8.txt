This little viewing movie is a languid and laid-back giallo. It moves away from some parts of the style and accepts a thin method. It is searching for a woman about her missing lover; A psychologist who suddenly disappeared due to some apparent reason. His search leads him to a villain populated by a group of wicked people. In real gyolas style, killing is not far away. <br /> <br /> Cast is really good. We have Alodofo Seli (Thunderball), Alida Valie (Suspurea), Harry Frank (Cat's nine tiles) and a very small cygling dancing (queen of 80). The main actress Rosemary Dexter and when I'm not acquainted with her, she did a good job for the film's leadership. <br /> <br /> One of the defining characteristics of geographic eye sight is its music. Atypically it is a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack feature for a giallo. His score in Roberto Nicolasir's work is Miles Davis's memorable, especially in a silent way. This is a nice soundtrack and this film really gives a different feel than most gialli. Fusion Grove maintains a poor environment and congratulates the beauty of the film, which is mostly made with the film, visible beauty in front of the ocean. <br /> <br /> This is a gaelo so we need to talk about genocide. Well, this image is a little short on this topic. It is certainly not their fault, but they are less and far away. Early dream-killing is perhaps a memorable burning car order along with the proposal. But this is not really a particularly violent film. Nevertheless, I do not think it will consistently disappoint fans of many choices. Mystery is fairly mandatory and it has enough bright letters (fool boy Saro and that illogical inappropriate dubbed act?) And satisfied with seamless moments; When the nudity across the sludge-factor is fixed with a smattering. <br /> <br /> The eyes in the fairy plays like a gaggle version of a mystery of Christ's mystery, because it features a group of disparate characters in a villa, suspected of killing all. Our compulsory flashbacks (very disrespected) detail their links with the final hour of the murder. Although this is not a grade-an example of this, it is certainly an abnormal one, because it does not lend too much to other movies of the sub-section. For Giallo enthusiasts I hope this is a thumbs up and one day it gives an excellent DVD transfer. It certainly deserves treatment.
