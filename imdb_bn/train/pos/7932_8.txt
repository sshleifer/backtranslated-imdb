When I see a low budget movie I know what I hope. I hope the acting is not good (budget reasons), I hope the light is not good (due to the budget) I hope the term is not good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget movies like big budget movies !!! I'm a filmmaker myself, so I understand the budget budget of low-budget movies. Stolen places, shots etc ... the list continues. I do not want to say bad acting at all. Jose Rogette, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza Raul Martinez is a natural one. Carl Washington is not yet sold. He realized that each line is not important, some lines are cast away. I say, if a film wants to see what you want to see next but it is a good movie. I like this movie. I gave it a 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Great work Quiroz brother!
