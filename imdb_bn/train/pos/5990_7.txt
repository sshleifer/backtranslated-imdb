I do not have much to add to what I have been told before, but it's a movie of its time and the first (and perhaps only) the studio has completely faded the film on Dead and Kids. <Br/> <br /> Warner's director Roy Enrique and played a lot of support for the boys from the 'A' budget, almost a witch actor supporting the actors. In each escape, we get one of those gems performance from real professionals. They are many for listing, but it seems like many of Warner's films (Suns are too big) walk through this photo. (See if you can spot John Redgli) <br /> <br /> The only top performance is always like a view from a trusted Messienic Complex from Eduardo Cienelli. He plays just about this character as a Thugi leader in "Ganges Dinna". He's looking for something! And Marjorie Mine is excellent and she gets her best role from "Dead End". <br /> <br /> This is the second feature of a double bill with something like "bid win". <br /> <br /> Hurry for Warne!
