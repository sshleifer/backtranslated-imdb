It was not intended to be a movie made for the TV set in Italy and Demo's Lamborghini as Lamberto Bava, but it was not mentioned in an interview with Shirke Shaw on DVD, but Demon's third was mentioned as part of the Demon series. The music of Demon and Demon 2 was rock music of 80 and it was more obscure music and the first two poor horror Demon III: Ogre is an architectural scare, so Demon's third is not the perfect creator for the demo, but I still like this picture. <br /> <br /> The music is unclear and adds a tone to the movie that is set, another topic I like about this picture is why I like it. There are two more films to be classified as the third third and it is the Black Giant (Demonie 3) and the Church (Demon 3). A good film in Ogre until compared to Demon III: The Drugs and Demon 2.
