If you launch the plot, this is your movie. It is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen in the future. There is nothing as seen or ending as you think it is. Characters are all ray and compelling. The cage is its best. Dennis Hupper again shows his delightful sinister side. Jetty Walsh has perfected her last performance. Laura Boyle sizzles Daiyit Yakum debuted a movie nicely in a cameo. I'm called this movie "really, really, really bad day". This is not a slow minute film. A real sleep This movie is underserved and, sadly, is ignored.
