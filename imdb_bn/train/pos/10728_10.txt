The perfect place fantasy film. A group of kids will suddenly go into space and get back, but they are sure, they do not. It would not be a family film if they all killed. Then it would be all sad. If you do not want ket capsos, the leading lady gives a Golden Globe performance, but sadly, he and Lee Thompson have won one. That sounds so bad. I can not say enough of this, this film is so big, Lee Thompson-O Lord, a perfect girl for this film. This film is good for sure. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars has so much ratings and space camp so low. It should be one of the best ways <br /> <br /> Excellent 10/10-0 or 11/10. I'm not good at math
