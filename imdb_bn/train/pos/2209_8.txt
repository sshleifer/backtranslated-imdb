In my opinion, this is a pretty good celebrity skit show. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as the host. I have that many reasons for that reason. Although Hell Sparks was a great host, I would never want to leave Greg Kiey. If you ask me, it seems that no one else is with the TV show throughout the show. Yet, I saw spoofing celebrities of different hosts and other people. If you ask me, that nice darn was fun. Before I wrap this up, I would definitely say this kind of missed show. Now, in conclusion, I want you to follow this shot to everyone - fans of hard sketch show. You will really enjoy it.
