Night listeners paid attention to me, Robin Williams shines like a New York City radio host, which is shocked by his friendship with 14-year-old son (Rory Kullkin). Williams did not meet the boy personally, because he was familiar with the telephone conversation. However, Williams's ex-boyfriend (Bobby Kannaval's excellent work) doubted the boy, who asked Williams to arrange a meeting with him privately. He does not expect a way to make permanent effects on Williams. I'll let it stay as it is. Tony Colette is also big. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this image, with Tony Colette's memorable script of the adopted mother of Kulkina. Sandra Oh also acted as a friend of Williams. The night is inspired by the actual events of the audience, and it is a fool, almost almost unclear silence around the whole. Occasionally it is predictable, thanks for watching some of the reasons for watching the film and for the reason, but I like it. I enjoy Williams like this land, more than his comedic characters, so this is an extra bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
