I saw "El Mart" yesterday and it seems to be a great movie. It starts with the childhood period of 3 major characters: Ramalo, Manuel Toul and Francisco. Then we will jump to a hospital for almost 10 years, where three friends meet again. <br /> <br /> Religions, illness, love, violence and sex rage across filmmaking and intense and exciting movies. <Br /> <br /> I see the film is becoming very serious and I think they missed the story point. This is a violent, intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. The mole Get hurt Shed blood And I think what this movie looks like is not presented for pure shock-quality or unexpectedly. I know that some people like their films "clean", even with violence. But sometimes, a movie will make you feel uncomfortable to work. This is one of those movies And it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> movie, made in all sense. But for the overall story, it was not a matter of importance, so I can still give this movie 9.
