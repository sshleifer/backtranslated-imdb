This is a movie that actually my dentist recommends me, and I'm glad he did! The essence of combining British humor (I am humorous) and a lost, middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle was frustrating. Add the reality of the mix that it actually takes to increase the bowl (those trees below the bush are not going to make it without TLC), and it's really a ridiculous, yet sensitive film. I repeatedly conjure the sight of all-time patrons sitting in their lawn chair with sunglasses on the flame of sunny light! Maybe it's just my Mendocino County blood, but Bright definitely got this one right !! 10/10
