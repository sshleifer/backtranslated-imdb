"Sky Sky" is a movie that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid imagery and raise your soul. Homer Hickham's story and the dream of creating a rocket seems so simple at first, especially when the film was set up in a mining town, where in future coal mines are clearly cut as a pump. But Homer could not follow his father's footsteps. With the help of Miss Relay, (friendly teacher), members of her father's staff and her friends, Homer is trying to make his dream a reality. <br /> <br /> Yet in any truth of living, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston threw us into the coal mine, where we saw the cooler of the excavator digging under the roof of the rock. With illuminated helmets and humble images, they are similar to external insects in humans than in the dark. There was a constant reminder of the dangers of the mining workers that the hacking cache of missiles and black-black faces were facing. <br /> <br /> Homer's picture and his friend's rocket have been introduced in contrast to Iron Shafts iron chain load. Below the blue bowl of the sky, the rockets are placed in a pad and are introduced in the stratosphere ... when the homer sees Sputnik for the first time, the scene does not match. <br /> <br /> Still the relation between the character of respectable characters in the film. Homer's father is a classic harsh man ... but he has a soft side as well. We see that he loves his son despite his many love. Miss Relay's love and support is also clear. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. It does not tie up everything in a nice bow. It lifts you up, tears over you It really keeps the air, which is important in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This picture may be considered as a complete job. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Humor's life. I do not want to end it. Then I realized ... this is a good movie for a person. If it does its job you will not want to finish it. And "Sky Sky" just accomplishes that.
