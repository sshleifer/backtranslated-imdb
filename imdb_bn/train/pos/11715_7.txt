It's a cute little awesome spuf / comedy featuring Casandra Peterson Ur Elvira: The Mestre of the Dark, the most infamous horror hostess of all time. This was meant to be a pilot vehicle for Lvia and it was so successful by the NBC network. They portrayed a pilot film for a television series in black to show busty babe, but unfortunately it did not make it at the pilot stage due to sexual-reference. But this picture is very funny. Elvira Modern Chester Morgan and one-fishing queen This movie was adopted several years later by "Elvena Haunted Hills", which was discontinued by the old Roger Chronon films, but it was flat on the face. See this movie instead of much more entertainment experience!
