Jennifer Aniston, together with Jim Carey and Morgan Freeman, gathered together for one of the hottest movies in this 2003 season (last May) and for the better development of personal forgotten roles in the past and past comedies of the carrier. With a slight tension in Carrie Antrix yet with its flickering and crackle of old soul, this film carries the height of laughter and some dramatic, tears bear very fast at some moments. The elements of Jim's original acting abilities appear in this film. These delightful summer entertainment hit most of the buttons with dramatic elements, along with the musical moments that fit perfectly with this script. In spite of the lack of a well-liked polished animal, Bruce is a great message in Almaty and the flexible spiritual animosity and parody of the buyers, which keep the taste of its beautiful nature, as well as credits for a great date movie. Eight out of ten stars
