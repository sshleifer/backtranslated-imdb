Bill and Ted's Bags Journey Bill and Ted's wonderful adventure. Following their first bogus journey with the first film, and if it is not good to entertain the audience, then it is better to be like a job. <br /> <br /> An evil person from the future is plotting to kill the bill being the plot and Ted using that evil robot that looks like Bill and Ted just. Once robot Bill and Ted kill them, they must compete with deadly crops (death) and return their lives to normal. <br /> <br /> This movie is a top notch, and even a bit weird occasionally, especially Bill and Ted's conversation, it's a great movie. Wannabe rockers sure made another great movie. Select it next time in Blockbuster!
