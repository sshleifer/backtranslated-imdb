Oh man, why? "Six Degrees" is a show about this so-called theory that we are all linked by. Focusing on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions <br /> <br /> When I heard of this show, my attention was not taken. It actually looks very simple. Then, I saw some episode ... and like it! First of all, the characters. They are all well written and different from each other. There is a Madina addict, a woman whose drunk tricks her, a woman who has lost her husband, a driver with a troubled brother and so ... different from what we're used to, most of the letters communicate with each other. Among the casualties, our daily routines are like. Great! My dear mother, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br />, then cast. They are all great. J. Hern√°ndez shows his acting habits in "Hostel" as his Pacton 3 Dg character over the previous work. Others also perform very well, especially Campbell Scott, who starred Steven and Breedgut Mainanahan, who played Whitney. <br /> <br /> When I came to IPW, after watching some episodes, I could not believe it was canceled. Seriously, I do not understand the low rating. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that there was not more than one season. It really will be a good show to follow!
