This is the best version (so far) that you can see and Bronte's work is the most true. Delton is a bit difficult to imagine, who as Rochester declared Jane Arre "not handsome". But in his performance this and Zelah Clark, he is as beautiful, a complete and credible Jane Eyre. This production is a long clock but good value. The book's almost straight quotes are in the script and if you want the first true romance of literature, it is the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and read and read the original. Filming may now seem a little dated but there will not be another like this.
