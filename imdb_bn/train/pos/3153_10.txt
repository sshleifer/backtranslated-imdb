I'm going to make this little sweet and sweet because I do not think you can tell anyone about this show more than anyone who never seen it ridiculous and unique except maybe it's my most fun show. <br /> <br /> To understand your humor you must see this and it really brings some episodes to reach me, but there is no reason to return to you at once. For example, the character of Heides always wants to see his friend in some trouble, it is as interesting as it is. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < An actor I think who always gets tough time Ashton Kutcher, but that means he is very cool in this show. I do not think that Carso's character can be played by someone else, it's smart to play someone. Stupid All the main characters are great and it does not have to be worthless when I do not mention Kunis matching the cold fox in the stone, now a spicy joke is a joke together with all the amazing shows that meet a ball ha ha.
