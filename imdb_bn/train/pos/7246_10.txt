This movie is completely ridiculous. Cruelty not only brutally, but the acting is terrible. Special effects are set in Asinine and the entire movie is a post-apocalyptic desert. Yet, it is sometimes allowed to produce the most fun movie. This is a 101-minute smile, because we all know that there will not be any fuel for fuel or LLC in 3000 years. There are other aspects that I will not loot, because they make movies so surprisingly stupid. I highly recommend this movie, due to this curiosity idiocy. I have no idea that it would expect to be of high quality, but if you are in good humor, then look for 3,000 years of exile!
