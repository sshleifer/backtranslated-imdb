I have seen this event at the age of 14 and I have liked it since then. I love this show because it's just fun! You'll enjoy this show a lot because it shows something new and fun every day and when my favorite part is that Beni always made his latest comments on George after every fifth of his fat monster head. * Laugh * I laugh and I want to see it at home with my friends as it was a fun movie but we like it. Love George Lopez Funny, talented, funny, spectacular This is a great-fun-family comedy series entertaining for everyone and you certainly will enjoy it - I did! And if you have not seen it yet, then I suggest that you started watching because you did not want to see it. Although the brand is not a new episode, I still enjoy the run again. Still funny Never wear off. <br /> <br /> 9/10
