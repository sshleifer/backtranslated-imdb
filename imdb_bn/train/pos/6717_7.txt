This documentary was very thorough and open, and at the same time entertaining, which I thought was rather impressive. I think that this game has done very well since its present day, but still there is a reason why I do not give such high scores in this photo ... <br /> <br /> I think sometimes this story Too much attention to the 'appropriate nouns' of sports, so to say: where too much is on individual surfaces and especially on independent surfers. I think the documentary can do more with the nature of sports, sports, etc., but it would be better (although it was covered, I do not think it will take longer than it takes). <br /> <br /> And many people who are not completely helpless about surfing, they can become annoying about specific positions and specific surfers by listening again and again. Although video clips and depth studies are well respected, it may be presented as such that those who do not have strange surfers will be good for them. Moreover, my biggest disappointment was that they had repeatedly told about how wonderful and miraculous events happened in the history of surfing that they did not have the original footage of these events and you are waiting for the whole time to see this metaphor screen. Talking about the moments of life changing, and ultimately you're talking about all the people about it, and not the actual footage. I was too tense to hear these stories, and then unable to see them. I understand the difficulty of getting everything footage, but please: Do not make an incident so excited and then do not show it. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very new documentary that I enjoyed watching; Not the best documentary for the above reasons, but with very fresh and extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack, this is a documentary that I would recommend to check out everybody.
