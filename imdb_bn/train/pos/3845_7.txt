Offbeat, slow, entertaining thriller has many graphic and "blasphemous views" which will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, it would be even harder for them not to appreciate the imaginative sequences in this movie or to ignore the first-rate performance of Crave. Verozovan maintains an impressive ambivalence across the film, playing with the meaning of the hero-omens. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything is turned into a bluest, and the unhappy ending is certainly not the rest of the movie as well. (***)
