Jessica Allor Max and Valerie Rai Miller's original syndi burn in this operational and atmospheric syllabus. Wonderfully politically incorrect. The quality episode changes widely from the episode, but usually it is high and when it is not high, Jessica is always valuable looking. Valerie's urban lifestyle Afroamerican is incidentally dragging into the dark Angels sitcom regions.
