This movie was quite good. The acting was great, and there were some really great actors there, Buchholz and Roger Moore. This picture is full of surprise. Sometimes confusing ... yes, but the twists and turns of the plot always keep you mysterious. The very thing in this movie was the car bomb exploded.
