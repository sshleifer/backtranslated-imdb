PG-13 rates for violence, short sex humor and drug products. Quebec ratings: 13+ (Canadian Home Video) rating: 14 at <br /> <br /> I saw the Police Story several times now. In my opinion, the police is the best film of Chan 80's Chan. She does not like other cop films because it's protector because it's the keeper. I do not see the keeper so I can not compare. The acting is not very bad and the plot is pretty good. The plot is well remembered because I have seen this picture a while ago, but I remember this film has a lot of good work, stunt and comedy that needs good chan film. If you find the Police Story and you're a Chan fan, buy this image! <br /> <br /> runtime: 106 minutes <br /> <br /> 9/10
