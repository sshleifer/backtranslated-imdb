I think to see this image, the thoughts were so interesting. I really wanted to happen next. I was amazed by how much I could fit in the 8 minute short. We started a school yard. . The two friends are in the debate over skipping classes. Kid B says to the child, "I do not go to class today." And the children claim a fall, they may really miss something important. So Goats B skips and goes to a class of kids. While reaching there, the teacher told him that today they are going to learn the only and most important lesson they will learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. She gives a pumplet to everyone, and when she gets a baby, she leaves and tells the boy to share her. Well, the child will not divide, so the kid will look for a teacher. Finally when he found him, he got a shocking revelation about what it really means in life. I recommend this short watch to everyone at all. It will take 8 minutes of your life, but the message is so important, it can help you for lifetime.
