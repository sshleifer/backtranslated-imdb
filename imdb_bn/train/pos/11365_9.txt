Well, let's say this picture is not true representation of Andrei Chichatello's crime and legal understanding. Although it may be the "official policy" of Polytubura that there was no serial killer of the USSR, in fact the legal system managed another and "Killer X" (actually called him) is already being asked when the case came with Fetisov Burakov. In fact, as soon as it was realized that there were multiple killings, the authorities had appointed dozens of officers to task force and ended the killing of a person so that the normal serial killer was not considered. Parameter. This good director and writer constantly reminds the audience that this story is not only "based on actual facts" but it is not for a document. <br /> <br /> *** Follow the spokes **** <br /> <br /> That said, this is an extraordinary example of a fast-paced Hollywood-style thriller that gets the foundation of what has happened. It is easy to follow and it is quite true behind its versions to see. Yes, lazy raped and killed both children and adults, both men and women. Yes, the lazy lab-work has freed him for murder for years. Yes, innocent men were charged with murder and police "confessed" their crime. Yes, the gay community was harassed while crime took place (though with the support of Burakov's committed support). And yes, Chicatillo was acknowledged by the special prosecutor Gervanov's semen, but by the intellectual understanding of Bukhanovsky (although Garabunov was not really close to the proud Martin who portrayed this film). Combining truth and truth, these events are dramatized which consistently strengthen tensions and fears. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt the director and co-writer Chris Girolamo. . In the case of Steven R.'s assassination, in order to gain increasingly psychological involvement and signal recognition skills, the clearances of the golden party hacks and the clear manipulation of the golden spine became clear when it was needed, as part of Max's criminal investigation, hidden by the horrific fear of Jeffrey Demon. Syeda's children are tired of excitement Sanika to improve dialogue and Christmas editinke which can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> "Citizen X" is almost perfect for it. "Almost" self-congratulations for a moment that is not appropriate). Fantasticly highly recommended as a fiction, is not really presented ... but Hollywood is generally frustrated considering that Junky "serial killer" movies are enough for me.
