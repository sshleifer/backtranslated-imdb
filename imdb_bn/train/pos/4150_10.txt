See the cold case because I portray the real life experience. This one was very close to me and touched deeply, so well-directed, thanks, Merideth. All the characters are well developed 3D coop especially. The material is still difficult to communicate, far behind the developed countries of the United States. Only such experimental experience and treatment affect the population. Of course, not everyone sees the same thing, but I am disappointed that among the 30 people, 3/4 of the people have got the votes in which I was voted as myself. You are working hard - I always have a place for this episode "Best Part". Continue taking the opportunity and accept my sincere gratitude.
