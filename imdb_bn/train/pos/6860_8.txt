Psychotic transsexual Bobby murdered a prominent doctor (Michael Kain)'s patient (Angel Dickinson), followed by high-value prostitution (Nancy Allen) who saw a glimpse of Bobby on the elevator. Lease (Allen) comes to the teams for suspicion of the crime and the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the killers. It can be summarized in some words: it looks very sexy (Dickinson and Allen looks cool), it's very bloody - usually the hole is usually stored for Splater and the boy is well-groomed. Writer / Director de Palmaar script is okay, but it is actually behind people's ability to make movies. It's extremely successful on a glue level and I'm actually interested in / involving these characters. I can see Hitcock's respect to Standard de Palma / Hippoco's Raphaos - from at least one master picture. <br /> <br /> And to stop it all, it's a professional and trustworthy cast. <br /> <br /> This was the second movie of D. Palmer with the former wife Nancy Allen ("Kerry" and "Home Movie"). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best things about it are usually piano donagio music score. <br /> <br /> 8/10
