There is a clear story in this movie, which is quite unusual in the musical genre. The songs "Cats," "Open FanTom", and other Andrew Lloyd Weber's songs can be considered metaphorics, because they use literary work as their framework. The story of "Bikarakan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches the core of human relations, especially the Indonesian people. Although this image is based on the "inferred" novel, it is actually a fantasy of 'adult' children from Indonesia. Dance sequences are not perfect, yet the songs represent how Indonesianians express themselves. I do not think the development of Indonesian dance is more westernized, that the dancer should show the path of Indonesia's dancing industry. Dance sequences seem weird in some ways and are not synchronized with songs and / or music. Still, I still love this movie and consider it a new wave of Indonesian movies which I hope to improve in the future.
