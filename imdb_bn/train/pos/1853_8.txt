Well, this is again a movie that plays with your feelings and you're all soft out by opposing a flexible movie. But I was a hanger for them so I gave it a good score ... the performance was very good and there was a lot of feeling. Violence is a brief which is a change. If not for the salam, I could give it 9! All a good movie with all the good actors <br /> <br />
