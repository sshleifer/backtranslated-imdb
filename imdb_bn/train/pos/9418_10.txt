I have kept this movie for several years and I started seeing this morning again (how awful I was waiting for my laundry!) ​​For most of the reasons, I would like to hear the title song of Benjamin Frankell again. I ended up sitting around the first half hour, instructed, writing, and entranced by assuring how wonderful the performance. The film is like any of the 50-year-old British characters: Sicil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Mallson, Duncan Lamont, and especially Ernest Thassinger, the old monster of Textile Mills. Not to mention Alex Guinness and Joan Greenwood, like the characteristic players but not impressive, charismatic leads. It's its pure form and droll comedy as well as science fiction. An all-time classic, and I hope nobody will try to rebuild it!
