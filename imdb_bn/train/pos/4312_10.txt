You did not see this wonderful movie about life in the 90s (L.A.) but you missed a special treat. This is one of the most wonderful and most powerful movies in the world for 90s in the 90's and it also carries in today's world that we live in. It raises a child, bias (multiple ways), love, fornication, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc. And the list goes away. This story builds up to a final mountain, and then there is nothing else, it always goes back to love with friends, family and life. It helps to dig deep into ourselves and find out what we want out of our lives. It makes us ask our own questions. We've made enough for others, we like this, etc .. ??? Come back and enjoy a superb and emotional movie that I'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> Note the wonderful performance of Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover through this picture. This actor refers to the amazing and true light and really sending a message to all of us. After watching this movie 10 years ago, these three of my three favorite artists of life. I still enjoy it again and again. Also enjoy the great soundtrack with it and do not forget to count how many times you fly the helicopter and try to find its emblem for the movie? Hmmm ... I've forgotten about it most likely it's probably Steve Martin's first serious role in the role of any film he plays. She, this movie does a wonderful job. It might come as the most surprising for you. Enjoy the rest, rest and make a really good film .....
