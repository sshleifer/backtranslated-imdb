I probably did not see this movie in 35 years, so I've recently noticed that it's on television again (it is not available in the video) again, I'm sure I do not miss it. And finally, when they meet again, they look so bright that the visible images from "Marine Pride of Marines" were as animated and effective as I remember. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Based on the real story of Al Shamid and his fellow Marine Machining crew in the Battle of Teneru in Gaudalkanal in November 1942, this book has 95% authentication based on the playlist, "It is al-Shamid, Marine" by Roger Butterfield, fulfilling the limitations of a motion picture Just changed to do This is not an ideal "film of war" where the action is central, and in reality the war scene is 10 minutes or less between the film. But it is a memorable 10 minutes, which is depicted in the light of the night to illustrate a night war, and it is a mockery or fiction that usually strikes the generation. Perhaps before that time, the natural drama of what had happened there was enough to reach the audience with the harsh, ugly, brutal nature, and probably surprised the audience after watching it. This film is not about "glorious" war; I could not imagine anyone watching that fight scene and wanted to enroll in the service. OK, whatever, <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is really a matter of concern, how many more damaged people learn to claim their life again after the war. May An extraordinary hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this issue, and I think the reason why this movie was so good is another reason - it was a very good writing. There is a "dream" sequence in which opposite (negative film) that seems almost experimental and strong, led by John Garfield is strong. Garfield was perfect for this role because his usual mood and shmid were almost identical, and he met Garfield Schmid and even for some time he learned about the man and his role. The actor does not do so, but adds to the equation, why this movie is so successful in saying so difficult, unreasonable stories.
