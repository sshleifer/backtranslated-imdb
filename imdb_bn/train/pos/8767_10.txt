I have seen this movie luckily, because I'm going to a stage where my new congratulations for Bill Palman and to see all the latest movies and thank God! This movie is stuck with me and one of my favorites! This story surrounds two girls who will start a dramatic journey abroad where they can know the true meaning of independence. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlin are just trying to spend time together before going to college. But their trip ended a more complex story. They were arrested and imprisoned in Thailand, the struggle they were having is very dynamic and intense. Acting is extraordinary, extraordinary, beautiful soundtrack and movies and messages are definitely so accurate for sent messages. When I see this movie, I do not think I can find the right words to describe how it looks. I know that some people have not appreciated me according to the movie ratings, but I swear, this one, you have to see !!! I promise it stick with you!
