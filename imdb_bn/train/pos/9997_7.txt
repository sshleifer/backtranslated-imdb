Life Stins (1991) was one step below other Mel Brooks productions. He is as big a crazy wage wage with his "friends" as a wealthy person. Brooks claimed that he could live like a homeless man for a month. Its disappointed and amused friends accept this unusual confiscation. During his "stay" in Bowery, he met a bunch of strange homeless people, one of them caught his fancy (Lesley-Ann Warren). They strike up a friendship as they teach the many techniques he taught him while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive without the luxury of being a miracle rich? Would he win this overwhelming competition? Who is his real friend Find out when you find life stains to find out! <br /> <br /> This image has been disrespected. Sure it is not as classic as its previous movies, but it is still enjoyable Mel Brooks showed respect to Charles Chaplin in this film. Chaplin's silence silently saw the picture, then you also get the humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Mail Brooks.
