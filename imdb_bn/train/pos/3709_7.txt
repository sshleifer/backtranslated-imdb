A screen adaptation of John Grisham's story qualifies as a mainstream Hollywood approach, and Robert Olman wants to go for a mainstream mainstream, about his last director. But this Southern-Fried Pot-Boiler is pretty good. It's not the best of Altonman, it's definitely not one of the movies he's made, which excites your head and wonders what he thinks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the 1973 "The Long Goodbye" movie "The Zingerbrad Man" is not as close to the movie, but it is fairly good on itself. Kenneth Brunge is a coincidental attorney who has himself prepared himself to be killed after being involved with a client (Emabeth Davidsz), who has listed his help to protect him from his dog's father (Robert Duval). This film is set in Wayanad, a tropical storm in Savannah, Georgia, which maintains this movie an abusive environment that I like. Turning towards the opposite end of the movie and clankis, and Altman does not prove herself to everyone to bully herself, but overall this film is not a bad addition to Altman's canon. <br /> <br /> Jansen also starring Robert Doney, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenaer and Fame. <br /> <br /> Grade: B.
