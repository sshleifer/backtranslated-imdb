I was initially forced to join my wife, and she would not go to the movie without me, fascinated by the royal family and their history of Britain. The viewer should not expect to be a power plant, but this film is very well-formed and the visual aspect is no other. In many ways it helps to overcome the mythological story that Victoria is seen in the picture of scary disgusting mustache. She was a bright and happy young girl, according to a bright and intelligent her yearly history. His love for Albert was the essence of true love and even if you count only the number of his children (9), then they certainly had an enthusiastic relationship. All these films are well-born. To this end, well-chosen for both Amy Blunt and Rupert Fray, both for Sound Performance like Cristoire and Albert. <br /> <br /> The historic accuracy is somewhat suspicious, as Prince Albert saved Victoria while getting shot. At least one attempt to kill when they were together, but no one was hit by the shot / s. I think it is weird because little bit was done for Victoria's mother and Sir John Cono's expansion of close ties. Victorian misfortune was the real reason for both his mother and his connoisseur. It was strange that there was a relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne's romantic conversation or the possibility of being at least romantic. He was already at the age of 50 after coming to Victoria, and in that era the marriage between older men and young women was common, the film is pushing Melbourne 30 and being considered as a contender of Prince Albert. Albert was clearly rival, but he could not get a little bit from his station, and Albert was only a boxer, he was acceptable in any case. <br /> <br /> The bad times have been spent in the movie, and brownie points with my wife can not be a bad thing.
