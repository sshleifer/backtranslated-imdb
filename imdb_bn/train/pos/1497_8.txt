This photo is a very entertaining horror math written by Robert Bloc (writer of Psycho) (Crypt to Tales along the lines). It has good fun and awesome cast for awesome fans. The film also needs to be seen for a doctor, who played a fun role as a rude and humiliating horror star of John Parateve (third doctor) fans!
