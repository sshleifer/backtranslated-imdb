Thanks to a smart script and a permanent hand of writer / director Kevin Girl, "Perfect Alibi" is an entertaining and very favorite mystery thriller. The film starts systematically and creates steam, because the sources started to publish that it does not seem like anything. Tiree Gar and Hector El√≠jondo are very dangerous, because they are "mysterious" films from Nick and Dora reminding Charles and teamed up to reveal the mystery. Like the painful wife and character of Alex McArthur, Kathleen Quinnlan has performed well, starring actor Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey, and Estel Harris, and provides light moments in exactly the right time. Rex Lin has a camera. After all, I felt like I was reading a good book by fire.
