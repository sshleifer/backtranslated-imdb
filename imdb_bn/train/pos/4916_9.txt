Replacing the plague femme fatale in this extremely suspicious silent shot by New Orleans by director Elias Kazan. Kazan always gets fine performance from his actors but with a combination of tight compositions and stunning solo shots Chase shows a visual flash for clutteroffic suspension. <br /> <br /> A man who entered the country illegally was killed after playing a card. This is a form of the Bayoranic plague, which is why it is important not only for the arrest of the killers, but also to prevent those who have communicated. City and health officials, instead of warning the community, will implement the secret plans and flee the criminals from the city and spread the disease. Contrary to the clock, a detective and epidemic expert creates a helpless coalition because they use the waterfront by applying their discriminatory investigation styles. <br /> <br /> A massive moral question is raised about the medical media's rudimentary medical outlets, which may be a big risk to the community. Regardless of the results, you can still find yourself in the second to guess the action of the hero of the film. <br /> <br /> Richard Wyommark showed his respect and respect for each other in search of murderers such as Dr. Clint Reid and Paul Douglas Detective Warren. In some domestic scenes of Barbara Bell Jades as Red's wife, there are some good moments with Wimarker, which is well-suited to the excitement of the great search of New Orleans waterfronts (more patient than humor), McDonald Zero motile as a short time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but occasionally sympathetic. Skeletal Blackie (Black Death?) As Walter Jack Palance is simply outstanding. Palance with riveting intensity adequately threatens but not only with the annoying charm but also dominate each scene. In addition he shows a weak athlete that allows for a more suspenseful continuity, especially for the film's powerful ultimate metaphor moments. <br /> <br /> The street panic is probably the best non-brando film. It is filled with tension, suspensefully well-paced and edited. Its enclosures on the locale setting lend a high quality, which gives Kazan the flexibility to display his stage style outside of the movie stage and succeed with Panic successfully.
