We do not have to lose this movie, I have always seen it the greatest. Jean-Pierre Loud is amazing (more than usual) and this movie is Nawawl Pragati's most memorable one. Jean-Esther is no more in this world, we have to keep these black and white images in mind and remember most of the lowest French directors. You just have to love this best composition. I will not forget it. <br /> <br /> Sorry for English ...
