John Garfield played a maroon role, who had been blinded by grenades at the Battle of Guadalcanal and had to learn to live with his disability. He has all stereotypical concepts about blindness, and sure he will be a burden for everyone. The hospital employee and his colleague injured Merrinas could not go through him. Her daughter can not play back by Ellen Parker. He is frustrated and blinded by his own fears, self-esteem, and prejudices. This is a complicated role that Garfield misses out in a great performance, which always keeps an eye on the current syrupy melodrama. There are the best scenes in Gdalakanal, where he is in a machine gun nest, trying to prevent the Japanese soldiers from fighting during the brutal night war, and later in the hospital's dream sequence where he saw himself walking down a white train platform. Rattan, dark glasses, and a tin cup out, all the time her girlfriend walked away behind the camera.
