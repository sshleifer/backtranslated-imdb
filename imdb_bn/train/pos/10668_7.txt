Here many critics have mentioned that the film version is quite different from the stage version of the story. I have never seen the stage version of the story, and so I have a more favorable review of the film than many other critics. Perhaps Richard Attenborough is not the best choice for filmmaker, but the film is still an entertaining account of many dancers who are trying to spend big time on the dancer Michael Douglas' show. The film does not make any famous actors or actors vulnerable to the final try-out group. In this way, our attention is focused on the movement of dancers and personal stories and struggles, which they publish on a Maithon day of try-out. Douglas is probably not the best choice for the part. Perhaps some songs were cut in favor of the new song, and the story behind the romantic contact between a dancer and dancer has been added to the story clich√©-ridden. I would say to justify all this was the weakest part of the film. Frequently made out of try-out, the Casey Reflection often reflects the frustration that often involves artistic occupation in the absence of talent and / or fate. However, this view of the picture has happened in the past, and it has become tired again, this tired old shoe kicked her ankle. The dancers began to commit themselves very well with the numbers "I can do" number, but then the dancers spread a little over different points when telling their stories. Actually, their stories were a bit different from the real lifewalkers who did not get such an opportunity. *** big 4
