The movies are really ruthless, unique and lifting. The story is universal that it is good, evil and in a fight between the world. The most important thing is that its rating is incorrect, confusing, and bogus. Blockbuster rated it as it was an x-rated movie. The truth is that it should be seen by PGRG and children who read clean and easy sub-headlines.
