This movie has a great introduction to them. It's earth, soil and a film that will make you think ... and smile. Paul Reifer and Peter Faul take a ride that you do not forget. Soundtrack is nicely different and suitable; And the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. Eligible for both film and actor! Finally, a part of the art that goes from the explicit love story and often the special effects are seen today. I did not leave any movie with such deep warmth and feeling of thinking in my heart; It felt as if someone had wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket. It is a real treasure and joy to visit this image.
