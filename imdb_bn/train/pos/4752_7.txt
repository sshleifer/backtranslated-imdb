A fey story of a Martin attempt to colonize the Earth. (The goods must return to Mars very badly.) Two state troopers reported a UFO crash scene investigation. Under the ice under the tricy pond ice is burnt under the ice, then the walks around the ice move closer to the diner. <br /> <br /> There was no customer at dinner at 11 am. Now there are some bus passengers sitting in order to allow the bridge to cross the weak bridge. The bus driver insisted that six passengers were on the bus, although he did not notice them. The problem is now waiting for the journey to start from seven. One of them is an alien, but who? All their suspects. The crazy old man (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to practice a sub-rosa wit. A cunning businessman who has to go to Boston (John Hoet). Their honeymoon is a young couple. (Brutal performance by husband, Ron Kipling.) Without a couple, no one else noticed. Even couples are suspicious of each other. Newborn husband bride: "I could have sworn that your coldness was a joke to you." The story is running in a clear but slightly surprising way - for some reason the phone has rings, lights are on and off, the junk box itself is launched - and it is not taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This is a chic worth of a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble game and climatic revelation. It has no discernible "depth". This is not a moral message about people as a general citizen. It's not any kind of warning, just a fairy tale which is diverse and amuses. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy it when I enjoy it.

And here he - with three weapons <br /> <br /> Oops.
