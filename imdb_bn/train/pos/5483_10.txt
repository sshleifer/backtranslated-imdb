I've enjoyed a lot "Revolution Television Will Not Be" It has given me again, a positive feeling about the power of the people, the decision about how to rule ourselves. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that twenty percent of wealthy citizens in Venezuela have made everyone decide for 80 percent of the poor for centuries, not hundreds. However, if their coup fails; After the extinction of Supreme Court, the Constitution, Obama, and the Electoral Board, and the abolition of all civil rights, some of them left behind a barn and shot. They did not even go to jail. Carrying major plotters, living in Florida. And their protection was "Bolivian Constitution" which was adopted by the vast majority of the Venezuelan people. It is not only the history that bites. Democracy can give you a hell of a nick if you make it loose. And loose it in Venezuela.
