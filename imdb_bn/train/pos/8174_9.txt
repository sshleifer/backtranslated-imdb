I like this movie. As a child, it was one of the first films that made me flyinch. Sure, it's light now, but back in the day, it was awesome. One thing in the teeth is fear so people, so why not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's cheesy, it's fun, sometimes it's awesome, but it's awesome. And I always have a love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen playing Dr. Feinstone perfectly, nobody could do it well. And a low budget horror film, effects and such pretty good. And I like the theme music, it is good with the film. Cain Fore (Dawn of the Dead) also played a vague police and did a good job. Fair amount of blood, and some really cool torture / death scenes. Check out this one!
