I love this movie, but what is found in this movie can not be found. Those who do not like this movie must have Richard Roper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe that Mr. Carey behind all the makeup And I'm sure most of the film's actors and actresses have made this movie. And the movie has a new face. Taylor Momsen who played Cindy Lou. As open, Grinch (Jim Carey) comes out secret And whos in Whoville are some fun fun because. Sicone we know that whos love christmas. Greenwich does not like Christmas. Even the little Cindy Lu Hu (Taylor Momsen) makes fun of the postmaster's daughter (Bill Irene) in the city. The movie was directed by Ron Howard. And narrtor's voice is done by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tumbler (Muppets from Space) as the mayor of Bhuvil. Who does not like to talk about Christmas during the Greenwich.
