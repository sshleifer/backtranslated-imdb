Jack Lemon and Walter Matthew started their career together and finished. Remember, always the best of us as Old Man's Grandswest and Kinky Couple, Lemon and Maithu are one of Hollywood's most favorite comedy teams in the past 100 years. Instead, they were the classic comedy team, which was reflected in the more modern Marx Brothers routine, as Priory and "Raiser" as the Wilder. Such a combination of physical comedy and Marx, Chaplin and Keaton's chaos were so famous. In a strange couple, Lemon and Mathu were totally opposed to creating chaos. As unique as physical comedy Chaplin. Curiosity is generally opposed to joking over others. Not your ideal person's film, it's a comedic age of two older men who oppose two young people of their age. Chemistry enough between Lemon and Matawao to entertain Although this movie is not for everyone, it's a great comedy.
