A playful documentary about a pair of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modin) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubenik), who tried to make his debut in the late 1970's. Hollywood North is a trickster story of their struggle to pull everything together in spite of a conflicting thread. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < For example, although it is too narrow in some ways, it is very close to the truth, and there are incidents of "behind the scenes" of truth that are different from the public face of the industry. Creating a movie is not easy, and it was particularly difficult in Canada in the late 1970's. If not hundreds of people, then the film involves ten percent. Many people have inconsistent desires, motivation and personality. Financias and on-screen geniuses are particularly important, as the movie drops or becomes unreliable at any stage during the construction, it can endanger the whole issue, revert to a whole, or to leave the whole movie. <Br/> <br /> So it's no wonder that the Hollywood answer concentrates on that kind of relationship. The result is a nice movie which is both ridiculous and sad at the same time. The script is faulty and the performance is top notch. It is a serious interest in the making of the film making, and must be seen for any emerging filmmaker and anyone. It should be entertaining for any audience, including intelligence and humorous ideas. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 me.
