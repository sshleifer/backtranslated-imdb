Cute idea ... Linda Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) Lampidorra is a tiny little County heir. The country which was not even North America, it was the 49th state ... (Of course, there were only 48 states created in 1952 ...) Linda will go to his country, and we are in this strange country and even its quirkier people Follow along along with trying to determine what to do with it. At one point, he is singing a song that he claims to have Navajo from his people, and it is more cooler than there. Although Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and omni present smile never ruffled or shmeared. Other songs circulating for the citizens to welcome their new princess were spread. In a magnificent British version of Technikola, or something similar, the only big name here is Dirk Bogard in British subject Tony Craig, a cheese dealer. After participating in the war, the bogard created a big splash in the UK film industry, and the second was also the courage of the KHH. Craig and "New Princess" are at risk of each other, and their bravery becomes more seductive, as Lampidora's financial problems get worse ... along with the lines of the Marx Brothers film .... It is also noted that after Danlan, the writer and director of our small project Wall was married to the man and married for 50 years! The guest was well-known for writing and managing his science and fly flicks in the UK and the United States.
