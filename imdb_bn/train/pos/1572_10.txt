While reading a review from another user, saying that this is a terrible game, I can not stand and I can not do anything! Well, this game is great, from news clips (two real people, full humor and credibility!), stories, I find it very good! When I die only enemies, they complain about starting to fade; And in some frustrating situations in LEILA VR missions, while riding bicycles here and there <br /> <br /> This is a great story, good graphics, excellent character, great soundtrack ... I recommend it! Sure! It may be a bit old, but still enjoyable! At least, Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
