My only complaint about this adaptation is that it is sex. Some of the noteworthy hints in the novel have been shown on-screen for strange reasons. Do they think that the audience does not understand that they will be too stupid if they are not shown everything right? That's another, it's very good quality. All actors do wonderful work bringing their character to life. Toby Stephen's is the sexiest thing ever for glamorous observers, at least observers, because of glamor. If I were Helen I would have forgotten that I had married the person I had seen on her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />
