Carmen was there from the show. She was one of the best characters. Why do they get rid of them?! The show is not the same as before. His way is bad <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can not replace anyone from the beginning! Chicks like Kyle or the child's play like the south park this is not right! The lady has replaced her, all right! Awful, terrifying. He is not fit into all the tales. She is one of the main characters, and the beggar can not replace her. She was an awesome actress. Brother is better than brother. Get him back, or you lose a ton of visitors.
