All dogs go to heaven is a movie that I have always loved. When I was a child, I used to see it every day. If you have seen its IMDB ratings and generally the comments of many people, it is implicit. Many say it is not a bad movie, it's a very good movie. It's good and your kids will probably like it. Although it has rated G, some parents may think it's a bit violent. This is actually a beautiful dark story, where dogs are like gambling, extortion, and even cold blooded groups associated with murder. The film follows a dog named Charlie, who escaped from the pound, was killed by an old friend, goes to heaven, but eventually came back to Earth. Many small children can see this movie as they are watching big kids' movies. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that frighten little kids, but I'm sure they'll do fine. Every time I see this movie, it reminds me when it's a little baby. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of their childhood, this movie feels to me in such a way. Burt Reynolds and Dom Delois's performances are fantastic, and the last one is a little girl named Judith Barsi. Unfortunately, he died at an early age, which was as shameful as he had so much potential and 'what has happened is deserved. Now I know his story, I can not see this movie the same way because his voice is so sad. The animation of this movie is great, the voice is awesome, and the story is good, but many other kids are a little different from the movie. It was popular during the Liberation War, but it was covered by Disney's mega popular The Little Marmonade. This is not a film that is not even considered by adults, but if you are a kid, or if you grow up as a child with this film, I'm sure you will enjoy watching it.
