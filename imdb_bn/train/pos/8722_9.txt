Initially, this is a very funny movie that is compelled to laugh with some crazy characters running around (check out two Russian bugs). <br /> <br /> There is a classic Disney story about a Bags Life, but it's a good thing about a movie. Family values ​​were appreciated and eventually the evolution of some of the main characters of the film to stand against the Trinamool. And Dave Folie, Julia-Lewis Dreyfas, Kevin Speacy (of course) have two great voices ... but in reality, the most amazing thing in this movie is animation. It's just wonderful. All the details, great colors, different from each ant, beautiful backgrounds ... and Pixar's boys and girls seem absolutely realistic. All in all, a very nice piece of work. This is the best animation from Alladin to Disney.
