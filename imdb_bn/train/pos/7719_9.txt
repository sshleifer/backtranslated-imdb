If you love Star Wars / Track, then see where all their ideas and movies are available. This is my best favorite of all time movies, other-world-futures and mind-thrillers. The intensity of the main ingredient (Shakespeare's "The Tempest") is not printed by the Hezbang Gemmicri (a La Lucas). And it does not seem to have been made in 1956, do not suppose 'you can see the string' containing the flying saucer. This is the first movie where you can not. The miracle was made on the scale of "at-movie", while economics and flavors were stacked extensively. And the director Wilcox's previous 'hit' was "Lasse Come Home". Until I saw him, I thought that Fred Wilcox was the pseudonym of a director who had already or later been famous, but at that time it did not want to be associated with Science Fie, which was strictly "B" then returned. This is a very visionary product, or very unfortunate 'error', as part of the People's Bank of Bangkok. <br /> <br /> Massive mats with live action are inserted almost microscopically, which is used in Lucas extensively. Intelligent machines that exceed the stereotypical 'user interface'; "Computer", since they were later portrayed in a little less in the future. Star Trek's 'Transporter', apparently, is about 10 years later by Roddenberg. And if the Trek / Wars Technobbet closes you, the scientific reference to the FP is not overdone and all is accurate even today. The "ship" set is comprehensive, pretty realistic, as it is better than what you have seen and more reliable than 'track' for TV or movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It definitely does 'Wagontrain to Star'
