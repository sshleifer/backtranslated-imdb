I do not want to annoy everyone by repeating what I said, but it is one of the best series! It was a big shame when it was canceled, and I hope that anyone who receives it and gets good ideas to start the series again. The good news is it is out of the DVD !!!! I entered the store and raised a copy and was happy to say that it is exactly as it seems. Gary Cole was a wonderful dark and obscure character, and all the actors were very good. It is a shame that the network did not continue it. Sean Cassidy, this is a wonderful composition. Anyone who enjoys this trend and does not see it, will have to do so. You do not have to be frustrated. When my daughter was on television she was very young (20 years old) she is getting very interested and soon will become a fan. He found it "very twisted" and he enjoyed the episode. I can not wait to see that episodes are not being promoted. <br /> <br /> This show is rock !!!!
