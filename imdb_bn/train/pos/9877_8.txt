<br /> <br /> Lily Mangal's presentation is one of the films that has probably disappeared with the studio system. Okay now you know my bias, here's some reason I think this movie is standing. <br /> <br /> 1. The basic plot - though Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star and her director (van Halflin) has a heart-time superb Hollywood story, the author changes her bits. More than usual. Lily gets a big break when she leaves the star, but she does not succeed and goes back to swallowing his pride and playing a minor role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (said enough!) <br /> <br /> 3. Some of the support cast includes really great performance. Spring beington like Lily's mother is truly amazing, such as Faye Bainter (director's mother-John Thorneau (Van Halin)). Standahout Supporting Performance, although the character actress Connie Gilchrist was taken as Frankie, the one-day actress turned the thester's custodian. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch a clock. One movie that is designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
