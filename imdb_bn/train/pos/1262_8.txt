A young and seemingly committed college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to jail for the murder of a innocent young girl and kept in a death row. Shaun Connie played a "happy lucky" attorney, whom the young man's grandmother advised to retire and asked for a case to be expected to free his grandson. Lawrence Fishburn played a police officer who was involved in the case and a doctrine was duped to debunk that Connery may try to free a boy whose son and the entire police department have committed the crime. This extremely intense dramatic thriller, Ed Harris, Kate Cappasso, Ruby D, and Letin Lynn Thegapen co-star.
