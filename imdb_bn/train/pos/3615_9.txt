I'm not expecting the experience of producing powerful movies of "Girlfriends" This is an indie; Low budget, no big name actor, freshman director. I was good at it, but I did not hear this well. <br /> <br /> The establishment of a contemporary, ethnic, labor-class Brooklyn, because the capture of the Kusama urban day-day struggle has done an extraordinary job of Latin. Diana, the hero, is seething with anger and lashes on her high school colleagues, to get trouble with school and her friends. He is being raised by his single father, who sees him and his brother in love, but applies strict, sexual-based double standards to his children. The father's double map is actually revealed that the younger brother is sending boxing boxes to local Jim, but Diana denies the same type of work. A complaint to Jim to meet the ticket, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tickets do not like boxing, so she and Diana are in the business place; He gets the money from the father and then diays to send his place. <br /> <br /> This is actually an emotional movie, such as Diana grew up learning through boxing, seeing a man, and some very serious problems head-on address. There is no giggles, 'that's okay, it's okay' resolution is a la "band brick lake backham". Reality and care personal matters are too big for pat-rays, but in my opinion, "Girlfriend" is a good and more satisfying movie for it.
