Bruce Darn, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine the winner of this modern day light. Among the three, I do not know that the most striking reason for everyone is to offer good performance and curiosity. <br /> <br /> Patrick describes this noir, playing a former boxer and mental patient. Wow, that makes an interesting guy alone! He looks stupid, but he does not. The Ward Bad is a slinky, attractive, cynical, intelligent and sympathetic Co-conspirator that kidnapping plans. Bruce Daren is also in the mix and Darn failed to be impressed with any film. <br /> <br /> This movie can be considered downside to the average viewer, but I find it interesting .... and I do not usually like depressed movies. What I found out is a kind of quirky crime film. Take a look and see if you agree. This is a very unknown movie that should not be the case because it's just a good story and good work.
