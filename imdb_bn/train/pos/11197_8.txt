Another silent love triangle film from Hitakoos, is not a mystery, but very English, very well-illustrated and photographs. Smooth boxer Bob Curbie (Ian Hunter) has appointed Circus Boxer "One Round" Jack Sandler (Carl Bryson) as his sparing partner, partly beautiful but close to Fikel Mabel (Lillian Hall-Davies). Jack and Mebail are the actors and comedians in the wedding ceremony ?? The long, tall and very young man, the fat lady, jumped in the eyes of the couples, of course, the argument about sitting on the side of a bandit, and the wedding banquet is amusing. The rest of the film loses jack to the jackpot and boxing is coming back to his heart, or something like that. In the evening there was another era together with the audience in the dress, and wearing the boxer's clothes outside the rope. Camera angle, speed, use of symbol, cut ?? All are very stylish and efficient. The performance of the camera and the last boxing match is very shocking Brisson's good look is to use this one well; His smile is not so unknowable about what is happening around him like Hitachi's The Matchmaker, and is not so annoying. But do boxers have such dimples?
