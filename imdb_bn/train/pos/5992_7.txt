I did not know what to expect before watching this highly stylized piece. It could be a zombie virus or general cold for all I knew. It's great view, grab your attention with little snippets and starts to drive your imagination to the wild. It's continuing as I learned faster through what's happening over the voice. I'm feeling that there was a nice little Noah silent story a waist of a few minutes of my time. Initially, given the audience through the visual little signal they give a sense of achievement as a piece of plot together. At the end a cool package of its overall along with a nice twist. Score, although not bad, the film has almost given a music video feel. It just felt a little date, the story did not add anything more. The performance fits perfectly with some extra dramatic felt but overall pieces feeling. I walk away from this very satisfied. I was given a lot of information in a short time but did not push or push through working very well and doing voice work. Nice work!
