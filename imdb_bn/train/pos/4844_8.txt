One of my favorite movies, when I first saw it at the age of 10, which probably tells you a lot about the type of humor. Although the date of humor is definitely a charm about it. Normal Askey and Murdoch banter expectations to see so popular, many interesting, quirky co-characters in his days. The lady with the parrot, because of the couple's marriage and her 'Starmaster', 'No one knows where it came from ... No one knows where it's going ..' Interestingly, Arnold Ridley of the Ghost Train Dads Army fame wrote (Private Godfrey Medicine ) See it in the afternoon on the afternoon after your lunch and smile.
