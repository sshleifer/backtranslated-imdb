The film was a great one, such as Ethnie Man and James Stuart Winchester 73 and The Naked Spoah, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bed of the River. This movie starts to run in the west of Mills but it becomes more complicated. It has reached Seattle with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan and is charged with the murder of Stuart. He found innocent but was stolen by cow by a corrupt judge. Stewart then agreed to lead some but I forgot what I did but Stewart only thought about returning to her cattle. The film, like Stuart, continues to worry about itself as a nude spar. They get better half-way points after reaching Alaska. It's one of Stewart's good western areas.
