About the development of this movie. People are growing and fading people, people are wonderful and people frustrating. It has all and more. Hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. This is really a classic drama that plays the whole cast, but especially the Hype Goldberg in its first role. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me very human and proud and I suggest that the film should be compulsory every Saturday in all the jails of the world - it's your condolences touch. Ratings: 10. Within 10 <br /> <br /> PS: I acknowledge: during the final scene I was crying.
