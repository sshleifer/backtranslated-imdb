Although I have the tendency to agree with other comments made by people who have seen this movie, I am rather ashamed to like it. Often 80 pounds of huge pile can not be found! Video, so it's definitely worth a visit (Â£ 0.79 in my local store!). Keep an eye on the gigantic swimsuit and zip on the giant dresses, 'Hero Keith Cheguin' and many classic lines look like the following: Evil Wizard-Type Blocks: "Ultimately we fill the core ..." Core: "Thrilling, is not it? "<br /> <br /> Amazing !! I also like that although the video box is a fort of the sea and a hazardous falcon- like a bird's favorite bird (like the real movie, the 'attractive and engaging' suggestions, none of them will really happen. I'm not kidding ... Really angry or a hazardous bird, it's just trying to make you interested ... in my opinion the classic. The film was 10 of 10 for entertainment value!
