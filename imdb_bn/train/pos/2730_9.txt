I saw it in the theater during the early Liberation War and it was still annoying that I am sure it will still be. It was the first part of '68 and it was still making rounds in cities across America and recently a massacre occurred in my city where I saw it where a man went to throw a bullet. The novelty of close-knit event closely related to this dramatic true story is made for a very annoying theater experience. It really brought Robert Blake and Scott Wilson the wonderful acting life. I was familiar with the novel based on the true facts of Trueman Coppola and explained the interpretation of Richard Brookes' screenplay and direction of contractional cinematical adaptation of the phenomenon and error. Music from Quincy Jones effectively scores it stories. I've only seen this a few times. It was very real. Often being a witness to crime and traveling with murderers. I think this is a 9 of 9.0 possible. Today society has so much sensitivity towards violence and crime that this may seem to be slim and disgusting and can be seen with low impact but more than 50 years nobody will be a hallmark in this criminal trial.
