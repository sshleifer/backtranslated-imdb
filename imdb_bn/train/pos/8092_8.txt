I happened to be in a cold, dark November evening of 8-10 years old in this movie. I used to play outside all day, cold, and when I used to go to about 4 houses, I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised to see a cartoon that was not happy and stupid - and was actually dark, and moral. This is my imagination captive. I'm sure that it misses the text, and all wrong places are summarized for the tokenist paris. But it is still the spirit of the story, likes to carry burdens for others' good, selfish, consequences of execution, etc. Animation values ​​leave the room to complain. But where this image evolves on new movies, there are features of voice character. John Hart is this great. Look at how you feel when you grab the character, and just listen to him. Her voice is remarkable. I have seen it again many times and it always brings me back to that time, like a child, thirsty for some magical courage. For this reason I say 'lucky', this movie is nostalgic for me, so I ignore the flaws. But it still reached me in John Hart and Tokyo's imagination, and still do that.
