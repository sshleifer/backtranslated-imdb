Yes this is a B grade horror. But at least producer, director, and throwing this flashing does not pose the manna to heaven. The plot is pure, it is splashed with a psychological serial killer genetic acid making him a snow man to execute the execution. Snowman ak.a. Jack Frost then goes on to rampage a murder to find the small town Sheriff that is finally arrested. With limited budget the crew had to work with limited special effects, most of the money was spent on snowman costumes. Particullary is conducted by solid shot cartons or managed to shoot away shots (shots where camera details move in disguise). <br /> <br /> This is not a movie of kids and should not be distracted with the Disney movie of the same title. If your parents do not see this movie, your children will not only allow PG-13 movies to be seen. There are two claims of this movie fame. 1. Great Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) played her first major movie role. The scene of Jack Frost's Shannon Elizabeth attack is a few times worth watching. 2. This movie has the worst snowy joke ever. The trick is so bad that the director credits Mick Taylor to the credit list.
