Great entertainment from start to finish. Wonderful performance by Baluchi, Beach, Dalton and Railway back. Some twists and many action scenes The movie was made for me! Screenplay funny line, good music Dalton's tough Sheriff and Railway back as "Redneck-Villain" I would recommend this photo to every action-adventure fan! 10/10
