The old horror movies are interesting, lots of screams, lots of screaming, and there are lots of humor in it. "The Blob" This is a classic of its own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) is a boy who tries to become a hero in his city. Going out on a date with her daughter is rather ideal for all teens. But when the old man discovers the same fallen object as the sky, then he gets caught and Steve helps him do his best. When it's up to the power of teenage, this movie really makes it available. I know that most teenagers suffer during their work, when the danger comes, they must learn to forget the past and do something good to preserve humanity. When the city's final adult "The Blob" learns the hard work of running Amok, they must learn to believe in adolescents and their behavior will not allow them to be better. Many juggernaut days were rather rather clever, and in my opinion I think it was Jail-O! When everyone pitch to stop this danger, then the city is again safe, thanks for the old cooperation. I still eat jelly and see this movie all the time, if you do not like Jello, TOUGH! 5 Star Rating
