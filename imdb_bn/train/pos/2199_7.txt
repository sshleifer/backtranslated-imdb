I first came across this movie while reading a book written about Mitchell's career in the 1970s. I acknowledge that for years I have seen several of his films and his best work is really high quality. Swing Hi, Swing Lo was supposed to be her best one. Although it did not give birth to me, it does not affect me as long as Devon, Death is a holiday, Kitty and even Golden Income. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the score he gave was mostly moderate. It is true that his films had twice the value, but these were really rare happenings: "Cocktails for Two" appeared in Vanitiera and "Mona Lisa" Captain Kerry came out of America, but Mudred forgot the rest of the vanity for this. "Mona Lisa" was the only tune by Captain Kerry. It should not have been that way - Rogers and Heart worked in the studio for the first time in the 1930s. Why could he be employed in a project with them? Swing Hi, the score for swing lo is happy but forgotten. Unfortunately, the film shows a brilliant talent as a trumpet player in the world's entertainment center, Fred McMurray (he also loops his arms around him while playing his trumpet and works in Karol Lomber in his work). How does the song play its boyfriend, it is important for the plot. It works in movies, but it would have been better if the song was more memorable. <br /> <br /> There is a photo type in this picture - it starts from a sea fishing boat, which works as a lambar, as a psychologist. She is constantly being bullied by her boss Franklin Pangborn (the ship's barber). Then the ship is entering the Panama Canal, and we see McMurry as a soldier, who are going to end soon. Their first scene touches the beautiful lacein together: Macmoor is talking to Lomber, on the deck of the boat and on the edge of the lock's wall. It's a nice way to take immediate action if the dialog is pushed suddenly. <br /> <br /> This picture follows the rise and fall of squadron Johnson (McMurray), when he meets Lomber and starts his fame as a trumpet player. , But met "another woman" in the film "Dorothy Lamore". With the fall of the relationship with Lambo, the film's best moments and its collapse like jazz trumpet (its appearance and the need for alcohol are very unclear for the character of Macmoor - even its darkest images such as Walter Knife or Mr Sheldrake or the Navy officer who hit the Keene rebellion depends on alcohol dependence Do not display. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Long love girl His love is wrong, but one of them is one, but one stump is trying to get Wagon again in his magmium, and Pangbourne is fined for the first time. The film is rarely seen in the film, acting actor Karl Zeldes is the perfect fan / friend of McMur. br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, he is a piano keyboard, a room, he has his girlfriend Wife, MacMurray, and Lombard share - its red-faced lies about the presence of the false statement because myakamurera strong. This is a nice, subtle moment. If only his subtlety was acting his diffident humor was more than his moments.
