This is 10/10 a day because this movie is worth a 10/10. The best actor of his time, Walter Matthu and George Barnes collaborated with Hilbert Ross and all other actors in this film, and all of this adaptation at this stage becomes true. One of the best films of Sunshine Age 70. I love the love of humor in this movie, it makes me so laughable. <br /> <br /> I got VHS 3 days in the movie (yes, VHS because it was only cheap $ 3). I saw it before coming back home, but I had to meet again because I lost some parts for the first time. The second time I saw it, it felt a lot better, and I had a lot of laugh. I'm definitely going to get it on DVD because I have to look for special features. <br /> <br /> It's funny how it is. Two people work together as entertainment / actors / performers. They may get well at the stage, but really, they can not live with each other for another minute, after about 15 years, you want to rejoin them on a special TV. You can find that in this movie. Headu and Burns are awesome in this movie. It's a shame shame they have died. Georgie Barnes is eligible for Oscar. She gave a strong comic performance. While filming this film, he was 78 years old. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive Academy Award at an adult age. Jessica Tandy recorded the record as an old actress. Richard Benjamin was fantastic in this. He won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. He deserve that Golden Globe. Although many may disagree with what I am going to say, but this movie has given everyone a strong performance. This comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. Another thing: anyone who hates this film is a "Putz"
