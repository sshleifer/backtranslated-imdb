***** Here spoilers ***** <br /> <br /> What really scares you? The killer shark, or maybe try to bring a message back to Scratch? Perhaps wielding a chainsaw psychopath? Maybe <br /> <br />. But those fears do not compare with fear that people do not even dare to talk or even think - and this is the death of their own child. This base, "Pet Semitic", taps the fear of early adults, and then it moves to places that can not be explored. <br /> <br /> I read the opinion about this film which disagrees with bad acting, stupid characters, etc. I disagree. Acting is actually the first rate for a film like this. Many may find it impossible to imagine depression from such a situation. But film events are not just logical, if they are possible, they can be absolutely inevitable. This is a terrible event of "pet seminary": It is not that pets and people return from the dead as the evil killers hunted by goats and scallops, so anyone who lost the child is so frustrated. Louis Crimes That Crime Despite the alert, even the past history. <br /> <br /> With this film, people who want to reach the heart of the despairing heart. Trying to be able to protect the heart of the protection And the results are scary. In fact, when the film enters the slash region at the end, it almost diminishes, though I believe it is quite logically how it is there. <br /> <br /> I'm really awful fan, and one of the awesome horror films I've ever made. If you do not feel like seeing your child again see it again.
