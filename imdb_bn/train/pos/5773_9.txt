Since I'm so interested in the lake monsters so I really dig this movie. This movie is worth a look. If you like so terrible, then check out the best types of movies. The effect looks really good as well as the "Lost Land". I originally saw this movie more like a 89/90 demonstration demonstration demonstration of "demonic representation" at the beginning of the 90's. I was not afraid of me, but I felt something at the age of eight. After several years I saw the DVD in a local circuit city and bought it immediately so I can give it 9 because I have my personal space in it. Right heart with Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good B movie fun for all ages.
