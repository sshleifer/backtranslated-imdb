My only thing about this movie that vomits me is that DVD is so expensive It's too much for my budget at this moment, or I'll buy it, because the film is a good example of film Nirma ... and I'm happy to see Richard Weidmark, Gene Peters and Thalma Ritter. <br /> <br /> The criteria to produce a great DVD but sometimes the price just a bit to ask. Here's an 80-minute black and white, mono-sound film that is great but not according to cinematography. <br /> <br /> The story is here (stories, visuals, opponents), words, sets, etc.), a peakpack (Weirdk), oddly steals in a purse purse and then carrying it with a microfilm. (Tell that three times!). Everyone except Peter, but the credible character in this film: Winkmus, Police, US agent and communists and especially Ritter, "Md," an informer. He and Wyommark are the stars of this movie. <br /> <br /> Peter was a good act of cheap fluo, but at the first meeting, he lost his credibility with Wimark "falling in love" even though he was ugly. Just in the movie world !! Very bad, because the ridiculous romance part of the story took it away. <br /> <br /> This is an average movie silent which is not good, but bigger and certainly not owned by $ 25- $ 35. For this price, the movie can do much more in silent market.
