Why do I call so many reasons why superpowered is so high, its biggest victory is Cast and Character Building. Each character unfolds more and more each series. Also each series has different 'small time letters' and an array as the main. A good example of a character (who was only in three episodes) for which you might think David played wildly by compulsory gambling robert patrick. Each little detail produces perfect TV series. The event revolves around rounds of public Tony Tony Sopranano (James Gandalfini), who tries to balance his life with his role as the father of two children. The show is not afraid to be brave and strong with his conversations and imagery and this makes what makes this so credible. When Tony shared with Caps Pol√≠s (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Jant), his nephew Christopher (Michael Samuelovi) found a promotion. In each episode Tony has other family members, including his son and wife Carmela Sapranano (Eddie Falco). Despite these problems, his uncle Jr. Sophranano (Dominican Chianes) is trying to get out of Tony's business even after being under house arrest. All are powerful and character complex, but most are those who stand out; James Gandolfini is the 'Tony Soprano'. Also Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher, representing the generation of crime (20-30). Although David Chase did not make the best composition, modern TV plays such as these skills did not exist, such as The Wire and Dexter. So Soprano must be the TV's Godfather, Goodfellas and PL fiction
