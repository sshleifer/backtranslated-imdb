I saw this movie when I was almost a child, and, naturally, a fox family was moved to tears by this story. Hokkaido offers rare scenes with fantastic scenery, and rare rare soundtrack heroes. I'm still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack. It is beneficial for German viewers to report that DEFA-dubbing is only audible. I've tapped both (DFAA and BR) but I'm only looking at the first.
