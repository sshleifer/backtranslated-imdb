As well as opening the film with Bill Calls (Melvyn Douglas), a great story about how to create that client - Jim Blendings (Curie Grant) and his family were packed tightly in small New York apartments without having enough small quotes . The way is very low in the bathroom. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Marina Loy), wants to rebuild the apartment, the advert's job falls in love with Jim (or fall!) For the house. Once he has bought a house, due to the bills and disappointments, everything that goes wrong in making Jim's dream house is all wrong. <br /> <br /> Three collaborations between grants and loops are a charming little comedy - not very taxing with a real great message, but it's a great way to spend an hour or two. The smile is right from the beginning, when the alarm clock stops and Jim tries to stop it, only the missiles fail to escape. The time and delivery of comedic lines and situations can only be given by a few experienced professionals, and grant and fountain gives us: polished performance, general chemistry, and lots of fun. Marina Loy has played a complimentary role (it is clear that Grant's character shares the line of the Jim Line and acting, and Grant, as always, pulls both of them in extraordinary holes), but he gives Mureille a color, life and bite that is just Mirza Loy Can give a character. Melvin Douglas also works as a lady for perfection, never forgets wrong mistakes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Save him" ... only to trap him! Each of the small problems popped up for the Blindings Reform project - including an advertisement campaign for tiny jealousy and 'vam' - can create everything that could be wrong to create a new house, but it builds a credible and enjoyable watch. . 8/10
