I am sure many people outside of Australia have never heard of Kelly legend of the Netherlands. I once saw a documentary about man, but once I saw or heard something about him. And I guess it might be the biggest problem of this movie. Nobody knows anything about it and probably will not care for many people about this issue. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Ned Kelly. Irish immigrants have lived his entire life in north-west Victoria, but the authorities did not welcome him well. Police always accuse them of what they can think of and they harass her family. When Kelly gets annoyed with everything that went away, she formed a gang with her brother and two men. They started robbing banks and even hijacked the whole city for 3 days. These violence lead to the search of a man organized by the police and when they kill three police, they are banned. Finally, they take a pub in Glenron, where they have a group with all the spectators, they are waiting for the police's full train in a part of the track. But the train is able to stop time because someone warns them and what follows will be the fight between life and death of police and four gunmen ... <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to know whether it is true or false. I assume that no one really knows, because everyone will have two camps to tell their own truth: One camp says that he is something like a hero, Robin Hood, others will say that he is a common criminal, a murderer and a thief. . I can not really say which one of them is correct, maybe both, but I can tell you that the documentary was also the same with the film. <br /> <br /> Once I saw the documentary was without a nice and I really enjoyed playing all the actors. White Laser, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, Joefrey Rush, all the actors who are very familiar, but even less well-known actors see in this product that they all know how good acting should be. I really enjoyed this movie and I give it a 7.5 / 10
