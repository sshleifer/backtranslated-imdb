As Jeremy Clarkson from the BBC said (sometimes it's not about our world, yet she feels right). <br /> <br /> It looks like this movie is incredibly stunning beauty which will love your eyes. <br /> <br /> And then the personality of the film is also interesting, interesting, with the narrator, voice and story stories that touch your life, as you see nicely illustrated images. <br /> <br /> This movie will probably not affect your lifestyle, will ruin these beauties, but it will surely keep you in mind that how precious we are to our world <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie has earned 10 great talents because it is one of the few truly stylistic Earth documentaries to enjoy.
