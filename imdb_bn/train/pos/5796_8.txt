Munwalkar is a fantasy music film surrounded by Michael Jackson with various departments. I will rate each section individually. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the image with a music video. The music video "Man in the Mirror" is a concert by Michael Jackson, music video shows Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr, John Lennon and more such as the historical mood of the personality. The first segment is a good choice for opening the film. I like the song and like the montage of historical statistics. I even like the message of the song. I gave the first segment 9/10/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows a montage in his solo career since the start of Jackson Jackson's Jackson. I've created the moodage I've created well, I like the animation I've chosen, and I like their preferences like "I'm sure you're back, bit brick, thriller, you can feel it and how you feel about me you can do." Only I want to do something better in a song of Montage, "we are the world" Why do you see all the reasons rain drops and images of Michael Jackson and celebrities chorus in those drops, but chorus is a little hard to see. Another that segment is still good. I'm a 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is bad for the song. You're probably thinking of Michael Jackson's music video bad, yes yes and no. This segment is replayed by music videos but it's kids. The segment was intelligent but it was not as good as the other sections. I'm a 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a small clamation music film, called the bad version of kids "Speed ​​Demon". The little Michael Jackson is behind his favorite fans and press and he himself has been disguised as a rabbit and the motorcycle is trying to move away from them. The soil was great according to the order of the Chase, but some parts of the film were seen as a little fake during the conversation with the real people of the Clamation Characters. There is nowhere near the clip Michael Jackson comes to the rabbit costume life and he keeps dancing with her. I liked dance but that was somewhere like that. I'm an 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 5 is Michael Jackson's Grammy winning music video "Leave me alone." The music video is about the promotion of nose in Michael Jackson's personal life, and Michael Jackson thinks that he will not let him alone until he is proved innocent. The music video really talks (but remember that before the rumor spread out in this 80's, this child happened before the persecution). But I do not think this video should be on this video because it's a children's movie and I will sing about it as a child. Will not understand I love this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 leads to the whole movie's main story whose name is "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his power as his willful star (including John Lennon's son San Lennon) as an offense committed to save children from Mr. Evil Mbarter (played by Jo Pacey). The segment I really thought was really bringing the film, especially when he sang the song "Gupta Criminal" of dance and song. I thought the special effects were good The strange thing about the segment did not explain why children are having an argument with an old man. Also talk about Joe Pesci's character drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean, why do you talk about drugs in a child's picture. Otherwise it was good. My rating for this segment is 8/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the final part of the whole film. The film sings a cover version of Beatles' song "As Together" with Michael Jackson, and then during the credit, we saw Michael Jackson singing with Ladies Myth Black Mumbazzo. Michael Michael has made a good cover of "Good Together" and I think it is a good idea to include a talented singer like him with a good singer group. My Ratings 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> This film is a good Michael Jackson film, I think it really highlights children's imagination. The film likes Michael Jackson and Beatles animated film is almost as thoughtful as the "Yellow Submarine" and you live in a movie with many creativity, but this is the film. My rating for this movie is 8/10
