I think Charlotte Gainsberg is one of the best actors in the world. I do not understand why some people did not say. Annoying .... ??? Maybe he said he's nervous because he / she is annoying She was a great actress and the movie was excellent. It has lots of wonderful ideas and very well played. The direction was great. I am portrayed in the French environment with all sophistication and perfume, flowers, churches, problems etc. Only when she goes to the sister's shop is just amazing. Everything is great We have a very good actress, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Laughton are perfect. I like her next film La Sciences Dais Rovis more than. And Eric Lartigau did a great job. <br /> <br /> Anna
