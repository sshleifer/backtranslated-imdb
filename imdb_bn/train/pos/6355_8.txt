When I got released "Already How to Grinch Stolen Christmas" and I still love it after 5 years. There are still many people who do not agree with my opinion and have found many love at the time that this movie never came out. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is at the top and in the campi, but why this movie is so charming and interesting reasons to see it is the same. All sets, costumes and characters are completely done in the top of a fun way, becoming absolutely real ridicules. It's a visually spectacular movie to see. This is a very good camping movie! Director Ron Howard is really amazing with this funny little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> Why does the movie work and why it is so fun to see Jim Carey as a greenwich. She really carries the movie with her good and funny role. He must have been helped by making sure-making, which received an Academy Award. Of course, if you are disappointed with Jim Carrie, you do not even think of watching this movie. This movie really makes her film and she makes it all fun and great fun to watch. Other interesting and memorable performances are Jeffrey Tomber, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans acting as young greens. <br /> <br /> This film has good morale but it is very sad to me. Perhaps it's because I'm Dutch and we really do not celebrate Christmas that's here passionate and big, such as in the United States or England. For me the movie was just fun and entertaining and the morale kept me cool enough to be honest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> James Horner's musical score is good and funny, although your average Hararnar staff every day, it still works perfectly for the movie and helps to do some work of the scene. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas Entertainment <br /> <br /> 8/10
