Firing in the car through aircrafts, some are playing their last songs, others do not react, like voice-over. I just wonder how that is made. There were so many scenes in this movie that I was surprised at how the camera was there. If the warhols in BJM post-party are empty, if the scene is true then it was the most impossible absorption, if it was total fabrication or if its purpose was to make me uncomfortable? All the way through this movie I was wondering how the footage came. Take the price of the face, (a tortured) talent is an excellent portrait we believe in ourselves.
