Of course, one of my favorite movies is one. Good story, great acting, all tech (especially cinematography) is sharp and the script is tricky. <br /> <br /> Hot Laser is as great as Edward's 'Ned' Kelly. He is gripping as a legend expulsion, and is well supported by Geoffrey Rush, Namie Watts and Orlando Bloom. All actions are the order points <br /> <br /> The end of the film ends up in your seat staff. One of my favorite films of late legend Heath Ledger, he has highlighted every movie he has played. And there is no mistake here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is a nice movie.
