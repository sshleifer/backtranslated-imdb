Poly was beautiful, cool, enjoyable and quite full. I was hoping to see an ideal "family" movie in this movie, in a moment, I became unconscious and went into the floor. My mobile phone was immediately changed when I was quickly influenced by the movie curiosity. It is very rare that you find a family movie thoroughly and it can be made "healthy". Most are made to attract the cheaply created, written and produced young family members, who will be mind-boggling with over 65 minutes of unnoticed gog and plots. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Polly is a plot. It tells the story of a young girl (Marie) and her best friend Polly, who can talk incredibly and often interact with her. Marie's Darkie Joker found this incredible father and thought that Paul would be harmful to his 4-year-old daughter's mental health, and quickly set him apart. We follow Paul's courage (and unfortunately) since he is trying to consolidate with his favorite owner, along with the way he has combined many memorable characters. Oh yes, Polly could really speak (smart) and had a fast New Jersey accent. Cool. The plot kept me interesting, held thick and entertaining throughout. Poly is the best family movie I've ever found and I have enjoyed it sincerely. Ever. Seriously Pick a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie with the whole family. No sleep I promise.
