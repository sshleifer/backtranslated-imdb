Generally, it is difficult to rate these cut and paste movies. Some parts may be quite good when others bring down overall product ratings. For example, the girls' scene at the doctor's office was quite exciting ... this is the best in viewers (limited) viewing history. Then there's Asia's segment ... Lady is always entertaining. And the story that was tied together in the whole story was an interesting idea. The Swap view that closes the offer is not bad. Technically, the production value is fairly high. Recommended.
