Abe Lincoln's first career was neatly presented by Ford. Anyone who did not see living Lincoln as a real Lincoln, but a fool, wearing a fake nose, with a strange link, voice, delivery, walking, and other methods - just like Lincoln must have imagined. Ford, he was at the top of his form in three of the first films made by Fonda, was fully introduced in America in the early 19th century. The story centers on an accused who is accused of linking Lincoln's court and completing court scenes. Supporting cast includes a lot of Ford's regulars. It was the last film of Alice Brady, died a few months after it was released.
