Zero Day guides you to think, even think again what two boys / young people did - mutually committing suicide by killing their classmates. It should be outside an odd mode that should be for two people who decided to withdraw from general citizenship to define their own / mutual world through joint destruction. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie, but the movie makers and actors were given any money / time - this is a great product. It is better than 'elephant' in terms of explaining the purpose and action of two joint suicides / murderers - it is a lot more than a film that is available around our 'reasonable' skin. <br /> <br /> Faulty but honest with a terrible honesty.
