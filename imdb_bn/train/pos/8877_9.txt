This story is probably the most powerful one I ever took. Father Singleton course went above and beyond when putting this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performance by whole cast, but the app and rapport became the best and most credible form of young stars' career. <br /> <br /> However, as a college student, many things were taken to touch Acton himself. Utmost. A sense that when they face problems at many college campuses, they do not make the movie bigger or externally because the film will believe. In some cases, it seemed almost ridiculous to think that some of this nature could actually happen. However, since it was a little more dramatic, the film was brighter and left me stunned, unable to speak, just remember. There was a quote from Laurence Fishburn's character that I will always remember from this picture, "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you can not see your strength." Bright, just bright.
