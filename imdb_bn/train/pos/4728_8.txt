After watching the 'Break A Leg' in Vancouver during the War of Liberation, I thought it was a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> I had a little beaten smile and there were a few kaymoos (especially Eric Roberts). Scream I did not hear the word about the actual release date even though I stopped it. <br /> <br /> The story is simple but basically a vehicle for letters and situations. The script is smooth and continuous, the plot easily develops and the act is still comfortable. The film has won at least one award from at least 10-15 films or festival festivals. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend 'Break Leg'.
