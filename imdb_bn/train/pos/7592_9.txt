Just finished watching the movie and I wanted to give my own opinion (and justice) to the movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Comedy movie It does not aim to achieve the revolution and critical acclaim of the film industry and it also does not want to be considered as one. If you really want to enjoy this movie completely, then I suggest you to crave for your critical psychology and a good conspiracy because you can not find anyone here. With that established, let us more into the film. <br /> <br /> I had very little expectations for this movie because it did not have a strong plot (yes, moviegoer, I belong to this movie), but I did not expect myself to enjoy this movie myself. I've even enjoyed Stephen Chau Flekes (which I found out for his best effort at Kung Fu Hustle and also rated it 9%). Action tissues and epics, when the comedy stops in the right place. <br /> <br /> - Watching the spirit, I think this action can be outstanding, but why would I want to see serious basketball casts? There are many other sports movies (plays) that have already done well, why not make another? SPOLILERS end <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why you are reading this. Go ahead and see it. Just remember, there is no thought - just watch, enjoy, smile, smile, and <br /> <br /> They make excellent compositions such as Pope Fiction or The Godfather movies and sometimes they are made The movie which is well off the dump shield. I'm not saying that Kung Fu dunk is not worthy of the recognition of the previous example, then, if we talk about Stephen Chau-Ish Comedy, it's a top ten. <br /> <br /> If you love: - An intelligent film with a really good job - Kung Fu-Death Trance - Kung Fu and Comedy - What is this, see this. You have a great time <br /> <br /> 9/10 Cast of Kung Fu Dunk for you. ^: _ ^
