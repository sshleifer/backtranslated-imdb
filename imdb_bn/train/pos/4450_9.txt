An old man living in the mountain woke up one morning and lost his cat. Is he suffering from a forest in an assassination interview, but does he see murdered or loses his mind? Is she just getting old? The film is so big that the audience has to create their own mind about what is happening. There is very little dialogue in this movie but it does not need words, the whole film speaks for itself. You knew what was going on and I like it. <br /> <br /> The part I like is the last leaf and winter shots in the winter. Those who were nice, but what I did not like was just the underwear men's outlook. He could make the dress a little harder, but it was also a pretty deep movie.
