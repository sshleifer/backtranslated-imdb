The unofficial story of the captured US Army Tornacet, who must prove his innocence to avoid Hannan. Paul Ryker was a military court firmly dodge friendly fire into a devastating attempt that he was to spy on a secret mission in the United States. <br /> <br /> The vein of the classic courtroom drama, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well engraved mystery, directed by an outstanding actor, continuous velocity of the director Coolick, and effective plot twists and turns. <br /> <br /> This image was originally made in 1964 as a television movie, and was subsequently beefed up for this amendment with the appearance of many "names" actors and some action sequences. Delmain, rebuilding his role, spot-on as a suspicious defense attorney, whose view is sometimes misguided by Ricker's personal personal woes, but a little remotely wife, inspired by sheep Miles. The frontline is Peter Graves for the prosecution and Norman Hamilton in the original supporting role and Murray Hamilton. <br /> <br /> Marvin's explanation of Paul Ricker's character is challenged by the disappointing circumstances that a typical but dedicated person is usually a balmy behind which he is placed behind. From the resignation of indifference from Mervyn's resignation, completely switched from firm determination, otherwise the small scale drama highlighted, which provides a believer, often intense performance. This performance should be highlighted on a platform where it will place in the courtroom the best list of plays. However, despite apparently ambiguity, "Sergeant Richer" is still a pull-down and compulsory test, you can not put a book that you just put down. Highly recommended.
