I'm from Belgium and so poor rather than writing my english, sorry for that ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies that only play once on TV and disappear in thin air. . I was browsing through my old VHS video collection and came across this title, I saw it and it was an IMDB score of more than 7/10, it's pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I'm convinced that it's a very good movie to put together and that's why I'm confused. This is the only film made by this director ...? How did he make so many films after so good ...? It should be forced to make another movie with such a potentially high, hah ;-) <br /> <br /> However, I really want to see that she will pull her work together and create another such film. .....?
