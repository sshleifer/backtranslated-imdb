One of the better musician films of "The House that Dripped Blood" period. <br /> <br /> ** Spokillars ** <br /> <br /> A missing movie star, Inspector Holle, (John Bennet) saw that the last care was in a large palace in the village. During the search of the house, he was told four different stories of the residents of the house. Good story: The method for dying - The mysterious mind to get some peace is Charles, when his latest masterwork, Harrar novel Charles Hilaryar, (Danemal Eliot) and his wife Alice (Joanna de Dunham) are Dominic Be happy to have a story circulating around a strange curious center. After a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house, Charles believes that my life has come to life and he and his wife are frustrated. Perhaps one of the better entries in the movie, it's also the most popular Christie The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. The myths of the mythical character are really vague, mystery surrounding it is really effective and always has a classic crap-out moment. The classic moment is the murder of the psychotheracer's office, which is the highest ever for glaciers. It builds, with wrinkling words, flashing a mysterious creature, and thunder and light on the back ground work well for this side. <br /> <br /> Sweet sweet is a new house, the widow John Reid, (Christopher Lee) former school teacher Ann Norton, (Niri Don Porter), her little girl Jane (Clo Francs) is out of work. Anne slowly began to uncover a dark secret from Zen's past, which John strictly denied. When she learns the true nature of what happened, she is more frustrating than she could think. With the most straightforward plot and the biggest turn of stories, it's a pretty entry The mysteries of the family are performed wonderfully, there are a few sources of this and here the final revelation is uninterrupted nerve-waxing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In Max Museum, a woman entered a statue, the statue took her life, they discovered a threatening secret of the museum that hunted them both. Here is a clever intent, and it provides an excuse for spending a wax museum, which is always vague. It is no exception, and it looks eerie, which is helped by the florescent lighting on the sculpture display. A dream sequence provides a great moment of mystery, but ultimately what slows down this one slower pace. It takes a long time to publish events and most of the time is exposed to exposition. It's a shock end to build that build up to be seen from a mile away. Those are really a bit less of this. If the turn has changed, it scores high, the rest will be acceptable. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> Cloke soon turned him into a vampire, with fellow star Carlia (Ingrid Peat) and other vampire work at home to become mad in the set. The unrecognized dress is because he can only prove his imagination. It has an excellent decent compound, and there are plenty of scope for some decent scares, but it's a few reasons why the sinks. First, it's too stupid to own it. Ultimately, the trick of plot is a perfect example, which is so much that it really does not have any shock, and comes across as plain plain only. There are some scenes of horror scenes or are trying to be afraid that it can only sit through a bore. It is the weakest of the film. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: a perfectly suitable universal film, there are some minor problems that are broken down by these stories, which are less than the perfect yet still visible film. Highly recommended for those same movies or those who enjoy British films. <br /> <br /> Today's rating-PG-13: Violence
