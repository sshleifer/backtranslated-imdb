Perhaps I saw the first Portuguese movie in my life, and I enjoyed it. How the conspiracy took power in Portugal in 1974 finally defeats the Fascist government of Katano and can make war in colonies, such as Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Verte. Most of the events displayed in the film accurately reflect the behavior of the army officers and the soldiers in the uprising of the oppressed masses, who are very happy with the resistance of this new development and independence, the Kantano men, and also a fine way for most conservative officials, including Spinoza, who served as the new president. The Portuguese Revolution may be remembered for the actions of some young officers, but for me it was the most interesting part of the film when the young captain expressed that Portugal itself would develop democratically, and after this coup the country had achieved some years or revolution. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers did not want to kill anybody; Even the most serious enemies are honored at the end.
