First of all, I want to correct this film in another review, which said that the last song of the Best Picture Academy Award was 'Gigi' in 1958. In 1962 the wrong information was 'West Side Story', winning the following year in 1965, 'My Fair Lady' and 'Sound of Music'. That said, this film is absolutely fantastic! The novel story changed slightly, but it is also more due to a level of limitation, which they did not return to a pictorial version. However, I do not think so. In fact, I think it's a good stream rather than the whole novel novel. I liked Nancy to bring Oliver to the bridge with him and later died there instead of in the apartment. The finer things of this movie make me laugh. I love at the moment, Mr Bumble and Mrs. Bambal begin to come out of the governor's office early in the morning. For that moment the underscore brighter. I had three favorite actors for this movie, Jack Wild, who plays best dosage in a version of Ronald Moody's story, a playful and ridiculous fagin (this character works much better than book) and Shani Wallis, who is Nancy's most powerful, most dangerous version. The only reason I give this image is 9 instead of 10, because there are two big production numbers that 'Concerts your self' and 'Who will buy'. I always hate when musical dancing performs daily activities and acts like humans. It looks terrible and delicious, especially when they dance to London meat cones, they should have had regular dance-making for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that, with us, hopefully, will remain forever.
