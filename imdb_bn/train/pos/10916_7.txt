The comic revolt between William Powell and Gene Arthur is the highlight of the murder mystery, which is one of the most bizarre and impossible plots of today. Powell is perhaps 30 of the most civilized detectives, and Arthur has a unique voice that often seems to be the heir to the little trinkle bells. They are very funny to watch, so take the intensity of the plot with a grain of salt and release it. Eric Blore also has some comic crowns as Powell's Butler. <br /> <br /> Powell's MGM included a deal with the contract that allowed him to refuse to lend to another studio, but he wanted to work with Arthur again and he liked the script, so he was earnestly appointed. They worked together in two 1929 Paramount films, The Canary Meer Case and The Green Murdere Case, both of which are Filo Vans Series.
