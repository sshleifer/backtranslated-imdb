I technically know that this is not the best TV show ever, I mean it is shot in the video and its limitation shows both audio and visual aspects. It can be a bit smaller at the time of acting. But, I love it, I was afraid of hell when I was first promoted in 1988. Of course I was 5 years old. But recently I bought the first 3 episode DVDs, which unfortunately I have now been deleted. And I've also been heard that alert providers will not be released anymore due to bad sales of the first DVD. Even the TV show was not the same as the movies, actually I thought it was even more terrible. Although the color palette is similar to nightmares at the LM Street 4 (both of which were made in the same year in this film and TV show), it has a serious tone and fame has increasingly got more simpler and jockeying. Not a bad thing, I like cats like freddy as a cracker. But I think that this was the strenght of the TV show, you were not freddy fapdy every minute before killing a curse and then killing someone. In fact, its dream is more felt, it is strengthened by the soft focus of the lens. If not sure, the creator or only shows restrictions, the video is being deliberately shot. I love this show, and do not accept it as a part of the film, it can be very enjoyable. Today is better than TV.
