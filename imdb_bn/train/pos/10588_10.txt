Getting started, here's a summary: Sexual Russian Alta Lee (Lin Lori) is murdered by her Russian lover Max (George Shannon) in a game of sexual Russian roulette. Alta's other lover, ice homosexual casting agent Camila Stone (Mary Varnov), offers Aliba for Max. But Camilla has its own agenda, and a plan involving the temptation of innocent actress Julie (again Lynn) on the web of a sexual planning game. When the appearance of the look is fairly vague, the stage is set for revenge as the most heated kernel faces revenge. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is quite vague and never received much attention, I am a sexy, suspenseful gem. Deva Bharvabh has played his best role, and he and sexy-loyal Lori play well with each other. The song "All-American Boy," "You Saw You You Cover Let Me Down", plus "Sally, Go" round rose ", a melodious soundtrack in line with Gerson Kingsley, and a memorable soundtrack. Theodore Garcuni's point is sharp, everything is photographed in neutral world tones, which refers to outstanding business bubbles under the top crust of society. With several atmospheres in New York, Andinen (Warner's friend and fellow Warholite) played a small role, and starred Max Monroe's ex-wife, Comic sub-plot, as the exotic monster Van Bhoren. This sub-plot, though fun, seems to be entirely involved in other movies. However, I am not complaining that the film is smooth but it changes the gear and it is much more interesting that the lovers of the thriller are currently cranked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was originally rated X (soft core) and was released in 1973 by the General Film Corporation. I am the proud owner of a main poster poster - lucky mine! In 1977, the film was spun off for another and was re-released by the Trombay team, which now offers its void in videotape. Mary Bhornov was at that time theodore Gersunni's wife and behind the camera, Lieutenant was uncomfortable acting in lesbian scene sex scene. His previous two productions include Kemke (1970) and Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972).
