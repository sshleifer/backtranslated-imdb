Seeing CUBE, I have been a fan of Vincenzo Natali's work. Natalie seems to have an inauspicious ability to take a storyline, and for all the stories that she can imagine, it's like a wet towel, too much wring. Instead, he let the stories be published naturally in public, so you can actually believe that the cube has tried to escape, or in any case, where there is an empty empty space ... there is nothing! Advertising was immediately hooked to me. It looked so easy! Take two characters that do not like a person, and send them to a world where there is nothing. Natalie is so easy that you forget the argument that there is a place where nothing can exist. Indeed, nothing becomes something of a mockery in the world world. There is nothing there, but there are some '<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The more humorous side leaned towards. Therefore, after watching the film I smiled repeatedly, on the other hand, those who are confused with the advertisement can mislead themselves. <br /> <br /> If I could give some time to give some praise to the film, where the picture is excellent, the idea is over. It is the concept of a global concept that there is nothing in the world, there are two characters, there are two brightly intelligent characters, who will think and act beyond the philosophy of their surroundings, but there is no doubt about the two fools who have them! Another strong point is the cinematography of the movie, although it does not seem to be the first! Where each wall, north, earth, south, west, top and bottom is simply a white plane, a perception of depth becomes faulty. It is difficult to determine what things are set in Miss-in-Cinem. There are many moments in cinematography where it actually happens, but in most cases the camera is placed so that two letters, or an object and a letter are placed in the foreground and background, which can realize the feeling of depth. <Br> <br /> However, this image lacks certain areas. The film is relatively small, but even after a while, the world's newness becomes silent and you want to find some size resolutions in the plot. The argument that we could play again, the suspect. These two letters are unlike a feeling, so we feel no sympathy at any time for these characters. However, on the contrary, chemistry and friendship between two letters seems to be real, but there is some lack. <br /> <br /> I even rank it as a completely enjoyable movie! Do not let the trailer do you think this fool is a science-fiction horror movie. This is a lot more of a comedy! This is really valuable, though completely for the idea!
