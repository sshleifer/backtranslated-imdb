Seeing the life of a bug for the first time in a long time, I could not help but compare the previous year's Happy Feet. As far as the main story goes, the more similar they are, especially when it comes to trying to do a great job that can fit it. It can only show you how good the movie can be without its liberal diary conclusion. When I say that I really like Pixar's sincere effort, many people agree with me. Certainly it does not handle the legendary capture of Toy Story, and is not even beyond the animation of this world. However, spending time with the top notch and character of the story is wonderful. With a lot of laughter and a moral center for booting, I could see it just like other classic studios. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to find in the power to win all odds. In our leadership, Fleck has to surrender to protect his colonialism, open the eyes towards the new living for the future of the colonists and find out the circus bugs that they are more than just freebies from the disrespectful, they all develop into a good bug at the end of the story. Even Veleen Hooper is completely fleshed and appealing for the right reason. He is not doing this to explain it, rather than the fact that the worms will increase it from 100 to 1. He will have to fear him not to worry about finding the truth. It is a circle of life, but it is not one that can not develop with age. <br /> <br /> When it comes to animation, it's really good. Compared to the antza, the time rival film, it is more realistic and less cartoony. Water is provided as well as water. To see how much the amount of production has increased, you will not have to see much more than the ants' eye. Reflection and humidity, despite the smooth exterior, shows the reality. All bugs are very well-matched. How to fix crazy mixtures of flies and animals in the city, it is never skimmed, despite a small role or even more detail. We also see technical in the city. Ant Island is good, though it's just outside. Bag city buildings and clubs have twice as much of the garbage. This is a great demonstration of humor and innovation by what animators use for everything. From the ice cube lined circus study, along with the nutrient guide next to the animal crackers box as the circus wagon ?? And crazy creations of Times Square Build Boxes, Billboards and Facts, everything is fine. <Br> <br /> As much as comedians, you have to credit the fancy talent for excellent delivery and inspiration role choices. No male Ladybug could do better with his aspiric than Dennis Lewery. I dare you to think of someone better than you. As well as Flick and Julia Louis-Dreyfas with Davy Folie, we have our best leadership as well as superbly-fantastic Kevin Spacy Hooper. Spicey does not steal many scenes from the movie, while the time of credit takes the central stage of bloopers. Yes, a Bags is an animated outtake enthusiast from Life Pixar, which continues to be a tradition. With so many tongue-in-cheeks laced across the bug jokes, you will have to give huge support cast promotions. "Those guy actors" are complete, as it is the worm who bring the Himalayan biggest smile to people like Richard Kinder, Brad Garrett, and late Joe Rantoff. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Pixar screen, which is said one year or many other times, but it is sufficient and fresh to provide an enjoyable experience. Suspense action action scenes coming with delightful moments, sad times and even fun birds joining. Complete with some of my favorite Pixar characters, baldness and rolls, I can think of it to say that is not too bad.
