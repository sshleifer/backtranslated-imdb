22 years after the release of "scarf" there is also a major culture. <br /> <br /> It is very loud, unprofitable, the highest and all leakage has been widely criticized! Compare these to those people who compared the Godfather movies to Scarface. It is true that the path behind the technical front (film, screenplay, direction, etc.) squarefaces 'The Godfather'. But it is also true that, what lacking in Scarface and the lack of other gangster movies, the raw crude method of raw, gangsters. Latino gangsters in this film are far more deadly and realistic than Polish or other gangsters of other gangster classics like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of Scarface's main victorious points and I firmly believe that most critics of this critics have been "chipped"! I saw the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that these two films are different from each other and instead of praising the original "Remikke", we should see two different movies! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized for criticizing this film. But how can the filmmakers want Tony Montana's character to be considered properly! He is this angry young man who quickly decides and fits Tantram every minute! He is not here in peace Michael Corleone. He is Tony Montana, a very durable, uneducated person who does not really feel a lot and always gets angry! <br /> <br /> 80 people in this movie think so. The soundtrack is all 80s! I like some songs with 'Gina and Elvira theme', 'Push it to limit' and title track instrument. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable and beautiful shot sequences with famous chains scenes. , Rebenga hit, Sosa and Tony first meeting with her mother's visit. <br /> <br /> About acting: Al Pacino is as bright as the angry Cuban Refugee. He mentions that he enjoyed Tony Montana most of his career. And it seems as if he enjoyed himself in all his views! One wonders what "Scarface" would be like without Pacino. I just could not imagine Tony Montana in any other picture and in all possibilities, the film would not be even more effective! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Logie Tony is as good as a boss, Lopez So F. Murray Ibrahim (as Omar) plays a small role. <br /> <br /> Some eye candy in the form of Elvivar is then played by Michele Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and her role is sufficient. <br /> <br /> The director went on a little overboard during a certain part of climax. Without disclosing anything, I can only say that it is the only part of the harmful handling because of inappropriate handling. <br /> <br /> "Squarefaces" is certainly one of the most entertaining and best-ever gangster movies ever. Outside Enjoy it for: A raw illustration of Drug Lords and their gangland!
