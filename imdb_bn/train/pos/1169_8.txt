Stylish, Moody, innovative revenge-driven bloodbath. Also, sugar, of course, and sporadically too much sugar. It reminds me of the big hit because it has taken revenge on the same contest, and the girl gets alongside the good people because of the same bad behavior of the bad guy. It is unfortunate that there is no gloria there, but it is not Alain Dellon and Glen Ford. Can anyone be able to turn around Alan Kishmia's sweater and Trenchkot? Still he is completely tough and calm the ice. Someone can not touch him nowadays - although someone like Judaism might try to guess. Look good with her is difficult for any girl. The music was awful and perfect and there were quite a few nice car chases (and those are not usually my cup tea) - especially one willy one among the willy. For example, in the public's creative and bloody fashion, they meet with eggs, for example, in the Junkyard Crochet. But beyond the cheese, the overall atmosphere was affected and pulled off efficiently. More creativity, excitement and tangata in more "forgotten" movies than I have seen recently.
