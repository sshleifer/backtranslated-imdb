I've read some terrible things about this movie, so I was ready for the worst. "Confusing. Muddled. Awesome Structure." Although there were some of these allegations, this film was not as close to your average DVD programmer as awesome. In fact, it was actually craving. It usually tried some beyond the giant / slasher nongress. And by God, some interesting things are going on. <br /> <br /> Mrs. A miracle to see Barbeau He carries the film flat on his shoulder. <br /> <br /> This is not a great composition. UNHOLY finally collapses under the weight of its own ambitions. There are many (undetermined) sub-templates to try equally. And plot loopholes built by time travel are never really tackled: For example, if he knows that his mother is evil and ultimately he will kill his brother, why does he not kill his mother just in the first order? It seems like going to hell outside of the future. <br /> <br /> Still, I'm giving a point to try. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
