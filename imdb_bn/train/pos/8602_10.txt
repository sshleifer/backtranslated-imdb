Nobody used to say about Nathaniel Hathrun, that his failure was more interesting than his success. I believe the same comments may be appropriate in Macdonald-Eddie's pictures. And especially this one. <br /> <br /> This apparently has many features in a failed movie: it sounds inappropriate due to tweet, scripts, censorship ?? Still, the film also got some good points: Good Rogers-Heart music ("I've got an angel married", "Thira Tera Terra La"), E.E. Well played with Horton and Reginald Oven. <br /> <br /> However, if you can dislike it, you can not forget it. This strange movie is actually very strong, it's a dream, and you can remember for a few weeks for the day. Why? In the beginning of the decade and at the beginning of the 40's, there was no similar meaning to today's movies: it's like a dream, it is intended to eradicate the public to forget a difficult reality. In all the dreams that were made, it became particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> Let's say in brief, this is a better way to appreciate the film, it should be seen out of frustration whether it is good or bad. To see it, you want to see a dream.
