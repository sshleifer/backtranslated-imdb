This is the best Chinese movie I've ever seen and, in my opinion, the hero or the crawling tiger, much better than hidden dragon. The film is a unique combination of different styles: it's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy, and horror at the same time. And the most surprising thing is that it really has all been successful! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is my best 5 and should be enjoyable by every movie lover. The action sequences have traditional unreal jumping and even flying, but its shot is different from the style of the heroes and the flight always looks great and usually makes sense (ghosts can fly) <br /> <br /> See this movie, you regret it. Will not 10/10
