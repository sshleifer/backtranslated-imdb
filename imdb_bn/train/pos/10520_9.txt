I think this movie is an addiction to Jane Austen and always doubts about transforming the complexity of his novels: Well, this clarity is only perfect, intelligent, subtle, alert, intelligent, respectful, intensely, perfect in one word! <br /> <br /> "Emma" Thanks to one of Osten's most fun and fun novels, due to the overall irony of the situation and the characters. The film respects this subtle satire, ignoring the comic element (above all Miss Butts). What has added to me in the novel and the film has clearly revealed, the deep knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist and women, men and their relationship are being communally displayed, and if we think it is a wonderful 18th century female novelist, who lived almost an isolated life , He could realize the depth and truth of life as he did Len: Most of them and still fascinate me. We can experience this modernity throughout the movie: we can use only the change of clothes, and more current language, but the situation, feelings, ideas will be very modern. I am thinking of the interest of the mind of another person, or the jealousy that controls the relations of women now, and the difficulty of publishing, and expressing our feelings, especially love: Every situation becomes a universal and out of off-of-off, time Price. <br /> <br /> Cast is truly talented and offers very good and very bright performance: A young Gwynth Paltrow specially suited for this role (nowadays she's likely to be very mature), the Tony Colette is just great. And how envied them for wonderful dresses I could wear them! And then, in exciting English countryside, where every situation gets such a magic and dream-like dimensions ... a really enjoyable and worthy movie.
