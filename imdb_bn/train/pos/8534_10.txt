A successful young novelist named Jod Garcia, who succeeded in a special hospital for paralyzed and recently disabled person after breaking his throat in a hacking accident, Eric Staltz provided an extraordinary performance. During his new limited physical condition to combat and adjust gravity, Joel was intimidated, quick talking, charming female builder Raymond (a wonderful Wesley snipes) and a fool, monk, racist witch blossom (horrible William Forces), who felt threatened By ethnic array he is forced to share a room. Joel also received enough support from her loyal and loving, but married girlfriend Anna (played by Hurley Hunt wildly). But he still came on condition of being inactive on his own. <br /> <br /> The unimaginable rejection of the ultimate victory of this extravagant film is that it does not sanitize or sanitize whatever is happening of this man. Director Neil Jimmyne (who has written a thoughtful and insightful script) and Michael Steinberg specially disarms the story with exceptional taste, intelligence and warmth, and especially related to disarmament and how objectionably changes the lifestyle of a person, especially in your sex life (Joel and bring when a In total room fails to love and at The sequence of tries is most strongly made of this point). Without the expected brutality, the film provides an extraordinary surplus supply of another wonderful, raw, ghostly humor which highlights a rage club in Joel and Blas with an incandescent sequence through secret night raid. Uniformly extraordinary performances qualify as another significant plus: Stalts, Snippets, Forces, and Hunt all outstanding, blues datings, mamy and message alicabeth pens and William Allen Young are seen as nurses of sympathetic hospitals. Despite the deadly content, the film finally gives evidence of the wonderful strength and stability of the human soul in a very moving, positive and raised symmetric rule. A drama is a simple little little gem.
