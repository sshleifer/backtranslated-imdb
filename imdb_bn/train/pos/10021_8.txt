This story ("The collapse of the House of Abshers", "Death of Dance" (Poetry), based on Edgar Allen Bo Pokras, is actually surprising since the beginning. It is similar to older black and white films combined with old format house (for example, "The Cat and the Canary", "The Old Dark House", "Night of Terror" etc.). ). Boris Karloff plays an intelligent detector of life-size dolls for the terrorists' guests. He died early in the film (or he?) And the residents of the house suffered a lot of horrific experiences. I do not know too much detail here, but fans of the dark dark room must definitely see it. <br /> <br /> See it with lots of popcorn and soda in a dark room. <Br> <br /> Dan Besinger's 8/10
