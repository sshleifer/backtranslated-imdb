I was interested in this movie, being the origin of the Irish, was not just hot and funny guy. He was sincere and honest. I love the girl very much, she likes it very much. They were such a cute couple. The last was so sad. Love this movie! Although it is a little messy, it reminds the Prime Minister of a British or Irish version. If you like this movie you should see the main The same story line falls for the young man's elderly women, elderly women fall for young people. Crossing many paths, to the end, the best decision is taken or the task is completed. Not saying anything else, without the destruction of the whole movie, though I thought that the French people were ugly, less interesting to me. Um ... If you like Irish movies, I'll recommend "Friends Circle", that movie is so good. Quick quote, you could not get it until you see it "well, spoil my dinner." Hah hah
