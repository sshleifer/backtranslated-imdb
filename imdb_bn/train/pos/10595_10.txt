My former Cambridge contemporary Simon Heffer, today's author and journalist, has advocated the idea that eighty-five British film makers often criticized "Thatcher Britain", the Yelling comedy "Atley Britain", Britain which came after Labor's victory in the general elections of 1945. This theory is probably not intended to be applied to "Kind Hearts and Coronets" (which, if anything, satire on the AdWenian high class) or "The Ladkillers" or "The Lavender Hill Mob", both of which may have some mockery But nature is not political. It can be applied to most other movies in Syria, especially "Passport to Pimicio". <br /> <br /> The Pimlico, or at least fifty, was set on the north bank of Thompson, about a mile from the working class district of London, Victoria Station. It does not seem quite right, as it is often said that this image "declares Britain's independence" about Pimiko. What happened is an old charter that came to light that in the fifteenth century, King Edward established this region from the Duchi of the Fourth Berdundian Dynasty. This means that technically, Pimiko is an independent state, and has lived for almost five hundred years, without the desire of its residents. The government promises to pass a special legislation to amend the inconsistency, but the area is outside the United Kingdom until the Royal Assent is accepted and British law is not enforced. <br /> <br /> Because Pimiko is not a matter, according to British law, the local pub landlord chooses the hour that it is open and the local shopkeepers can sell to anyone who wants to be happy, without non-Russian laws. When other businessmen started leaving the area to sell their products on the street, the British authorities feared it as the legality of black black marketing and stopped the area to try "bargadians", such as Pimcalik's people named themselves for surrender, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> or "Lavender Hill Mob" or a broader community As part of "Whiskey Gallery" or "Titfield Thunderbolt". The central theme of "passport" adopts bureaucracy of public men and women and the officially applicable rules, which are considered increasingly important features in the lives of millions of Britons. The specific goal of the movie is the rationing system. During the war, most people took the necessary sacrifices for fighting against Nazism, but when the government tried to keep it forever, it became politically controversial. This was one of the main reasons for the growing untouchability of the Elleigh administration in 1945, and the campaign for Rashan expulsion was started by British housewives League organizations. I could not agree with critics that the main object of the film's mockery was "Spieves" (black marketing), which is relatively small part of the action or housewife league, who does not appear at all. The rebels target too much to the bureaucratic targets, who have the desire to pass the mentality or seed as "rule of law" and avoid any action. I suspect that if today's image was made, Pimlico would have to be independently independent of a British version of Monaco or San Marino. (In fact, I suspect that this idea might work on a TV sitcom instead of a movie). Four years after the war ended in 1949, filmmakers were extremely forced patriotism and British identity, so the film ended with the reconstruction of Pimiko with Britain. One of the most familiar lines from the film is "We were always in English and we will always be English and it is right that we are in English because we are waiting for our rights to be from the Burgundian". The general sense, tolerance and the good humor of Pimcillo's cats have a tremendous contrast between the neutral attitude of government, which are all presented as extremely British characteristics. <br /> <br /> Most of the steps take place during the summer drought and temperature lifting, but in the last scene, Pimcillo is associated with the United Kingdom, after the temperature gets reduced and the rain starts to fall. Global warming might change somewhat, but it had the ability to believe in British for many years, any statistics could contradict that Britain had unusually wet climate. The ability to joke about that climate was equally important. <br /> <br /> Stanley Hollayy has good performance as Arthur Pemberbert, grammar and short time local politician who becomes Prime Minister of Free Pimiko and a ridiculous show from Margaret Rutherford as a Batty History professor. Basically, however, it is a small community that is suitable for the film dragged together, despite being not played with any real star performance, contributed to an excellent film. It lacks a lot of the latest satirical films, and its lack of style, but its wit and mockery are less effective for them. It has always been the most interesting way of creating bureaucracy and the potential difference of "Kind Hearts and Coronets" is my personal choice among the Yelling comedy. 10/10
