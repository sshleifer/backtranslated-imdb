Action Comedy. Suspense. This movie has everything. <br /> <br /> The plot has gone and four professional thieves will be invited to take part in the hijst in a small town in Montana. Each type of crime movie archetype character is here. Frank, master mind. Carlos, arms specialist. Max, explosive specialist. Nick, safe cracker and ray, car people Unfortunately for Frank, he has been arrested by two bombering detectives (very well-documented by Ed O'Neil and Daniel Rocha), who are following him after sending a letter from New Jersey to others. <br /> <br /> Our 4 characters are seen at the train station and none of them likes or trust each other since the beginning. Added to the mix that Frank has gone and they are not sure why they are invited together. <br /> <br /> Now Frank is being taken by two people to New Jersey but soon he flees in the leg and tries. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyone laughing or just different for a little different A good movie
