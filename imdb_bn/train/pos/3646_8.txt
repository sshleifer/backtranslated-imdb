Walt Disney's "The Rookie" Jim Morris, based on the story of the former minor league picker, is one of the most amazing reverses in sports history, which retires for almost 10 years and ended his major league debut in 1999. 35. <br /> <br /> The film begins with opening with Morris's short story, which includes a series of re-position - his father was a military man. And when his family became good for football's mad Texas, Morris's baseball emotions were strong. <br /> <br /> The childhood segment, which led to 23 years old Morris (acting in Dennis Kaya), who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher (in real life it was Big Lake Reagan County High School in Texas) in Big Lake High School. It has been mentioned that he tried his career as a baseball player, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> Morris's team is struggling and he lectures on giving up his dream. They looked at him at the table and said he should try for the Major League team. Most of the time, when he picks them in the exercises, they are surprised at the speed at which he touches. Morris is unknowable, but he agrees with his players if he can win, but he will try for the Major League team. <br /> <br /> After winning the Big Lake, winning the jail and after finishing the contract, see Maurice trying a Tempa Bay Devil Ray. Eventually, he threw 98 miles per hour - faster than his minor league career and also the extraordinary pace for the Major League pitch. After another attempt by the team, Morris was given an agreement with Devil Race. <br /> <br /> Leave it with a difficult decision - stay in its comfortable life or after following the dream of its Major League, the little league earns a little money and spend a few months away from home. And the decision was even more disturbing than the period of his first minor league, he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris began the symptom with The Devil Race, starting from AA level and moving at a fast pace, AAA level, Major League Baseball down one level. But the season is decreasing, the chances of being called "call" are becoming increasingly thin. <br /> <br /> I mostly love this movie. There are many great performances and favorite characters and it's really easy to drag yourself to Morris. Also, the movie does a great job by portraying both professional and professional league level professional leftovers. And most, it seems impossible to achieve remote and almost even when it teaches time messages to catch up with your dreams. <br /> <br /> Still, there are some errors in the film. Although generally correct, it fabricates hugely and even few things. For some examples, see http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html Also, apart from a scene, he prays with his players, the film completely ignores Morris's Christian faith. But considering Disney's left wing Johhol, it's not surprising. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, many more surprises were made to make the story more dramatic. The 20-minute documentary included in the DVD is yet to be included in the DVD, which makes his story more dramatic but excluded from the film. <br /> <br /> For example, when her family was in good condition for Texas from birth, Maurice once again stayed for 14 times at the age of 12. And his initial minor league career ended after four surgery, through which he lost half his muscles on his left (pitching), thus making it impossible to throw 98 miles away. <br /> <br /> Jim Morris's story, not to see "The Rookie", but to see the DVD's documentary, see the link mentioned above on the film's error and probably read Morris's biography, entitled "The Rookie" . I did not read the book, but I hope for these days. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Rookie" is a very good illustration of a miracle story and powerful proof of dream power and general public win. 8/10
