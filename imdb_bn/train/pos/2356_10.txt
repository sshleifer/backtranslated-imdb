Daisies had an amazing show to push. Like Dead Like Me and Wanderers, you can say that Brian Fuller has been made. I understand that those who do not love theater, cinema, musical instruments and love, how they'll get annoyed. This is not a common television program and is too much for something fantastic. It seems like a little more linear and silent tone to keep these people happy. This program explodes with color, winks old movie scenes, hums with incredible music and gifted performances. There is nothing random about the choice that is made from leitmotif from the dresses. Conversations love, honesty, courage, harm and many stories about the reflections every day because it twists and turns but turns all very accessible. The only unfortunate side was the end of the show and ran because the pishing deeds were canceled. Do not contact this as a normal TV show. Think of an evening in the theater, then sit down and enjoy!
