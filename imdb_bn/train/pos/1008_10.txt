I came in the 4th episode of this season and then I got all the episodes on all episode DVDs and getting better and better with 9th and 10th seasons. It may not be Richard Dean Anderson anymore. The Ben Broder and Claude Black lineup still makes 10 more seasons more powerful and original in the season. Sadly now, in the 11 seasons, no hope relay was released from this amazing show by the Sis-Fi Channel. There are direct and direct expectations of the DVD movie. Atlantis is still getting stronger in the 4th season. There is no work near the death of the Stargate franchisee and in the third place. This TV show must be seen for all fans of science and fans and for generous people because it has a lot of things to apply to all ages and all kinds of people! IT! 10/10
