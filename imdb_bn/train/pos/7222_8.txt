Of course, one of the most wicked and twisted k-worlds I have ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Michael Kane were great and asked me to leave the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Very enthusiastic set pieces and props really lend a lid to the proceeding atmosphere. The lowest feeling works for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not with film, but there is a lack of a suitable widescreen version of the movie on DVD. My fullscreen version (which proves I love to bear full screen presentation) but an extraordinary deluxe or 'special' version must be my cash.
