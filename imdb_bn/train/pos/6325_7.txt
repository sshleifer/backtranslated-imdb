Not very entertaining movie, not with great films but politically attractive. It was created at the end of the Soviet Union, but Soviet mentality made fun. The story has been set in the early days of the Soviet Union and it is questioned both in both cultural and practical positions behind the revolution. Of course, in the late 80's and early 90's, the hard work of the Soviet society has already diminished, but the ideal and mentality is still alive and well and ready for some definite deployment. Happy, this deep philosophical comment is wrapped up in a fun and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Juror
