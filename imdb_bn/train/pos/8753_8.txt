I saw this movie in the theater, and it was completely influenced by it. Then again, when Claire Danes was a good actress, she did not worry about stupid, arrogant, Hollywood-bound. However, this movie really hurt me as one of the more raw, realistic, beautiful friendly movies. How far do you really go for your best friend? I was finally moved to tears, and now when I see it tear up (I own it). When I leave the theater, I remember, I called my best friend and left me to love him. This is a great movie to watch your best friend But be ready for a specific conversation later on where he sends you back and asks if you do something for him ....
