Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (John Voight), thinking of moving from Texas to New York, he would be resurrected through a stud. She goes there and finds it fast that it is not going to be easy - she crosses a frustrating experience after another. At the end of his rope he hooks up with the helpless, sleazy Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they tried to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida. But will they do it? <br /> <br /> Very dark, annoying yet fascinating movie. Director John Schelsinger is a very fatal portrait of NYC and its residents. In this way it is dated - the city may be bad in 1969, but it is now fairly clean. He uses every camera joke in the book - the color becomes black and white; trippy dream sequence; Flash Forward; Flash back (especially involving a rape); Shock cutting; Kinky sound effects ... you name it. It keeps you boring and close-centric - but I could not stop watching. <br /> <br /> There are not many stories here - it mainly focuses on friendship between Rijo and Baku. They have a hint that lovers have (shows that the final shot sort is). It is a portrait of two harmless characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel, urban jungle. <br /> <br /> It was originally rated in 1969 - the only reason why MPA does not remember their children want to see this. Yet, it was a big hit with high schools (after that X was not less than 17 years old). The only X rating movie that won the Academy Award as the best figure. Hoffman and Viet acted for acting (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles who was in the film for a total (5) minute! As it was finally reinvigorated in the 1980s (no further exemptions) <br /> <br /> A wonderful song "Avarvidis Tocin" was launched in this film - and a big hit Has been done <br /> <br /> A great film --- but very dark. I'm giving it a 10. Do not see it on commercial TV - it is cut ribbon and sensory.
