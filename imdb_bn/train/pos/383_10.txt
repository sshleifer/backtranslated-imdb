This movie has caught my heart from the very beginning when listening to Queen Victoria Jones's first note or the wonderful color of the flower purple color. This is a really cry and a film for ...! The whole cast has given me the best performance of a movie I've seen in years and Spielberg really exceeds itself! Hoppy Goldberg, Margaret Everi, Oprah Winfrey (Oh Lord!), Danny Glover and others all give us the best and you can feel it - touch almost! Goldberg Selly, he gave him the feeling of insecurity and inferiority that is needed for character, and we grew up with him, we became stronger with him, throughout the film, and we won with him. Wonderful as Margaret Everi Chave Avery, even when he is at her most arrogant, and shows us that "sinner", indeed, "there is too much of spirit". Always sympathetic, charming Danny Glover hates people and is doing an extraordinary job to make great music (I say to the sir), this amazing movie adds more beauty to Queenie Jones! Photography, music, directors and music make this beautiful, vivid movie a life experience. You do not want to miss it! "Sasta ... remember my name ..."
