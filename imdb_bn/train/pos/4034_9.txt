Pinna is a truly good movie with excellent acting, good narration, good presentation, emotion touch etc. <br /> <br /> It seems that the qualities of Bollywood produced films are improving this day and this image is a proof. <br /> <br /> Any Bollywood movie that I can not influence so much - I literally thought of this movie for hours - a man wondering about the psychological conditions of testing people. <br /> <br /> The film is played by Urmila Matondkar and one of Manoj Bajpayee's actors. Urmila plays a girl in northern India in the background of partition, and all problems seem sweet to her face problems. <br /> <br /> One must definitely see. A technically superior Bollywood product, which I think is comparable to the best films from other countries in the world.
