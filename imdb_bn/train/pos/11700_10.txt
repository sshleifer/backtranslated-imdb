I read most of the comments in this movie. I have seen this movie (and the whole prediction series) with family members of all ages, we all enjoyed it and it was only our surprise and meditation that we knew about reading and reading the Bible about the last time. Nobody is afraid or terrified to read in a post. Movies are based only on biblical events. I have seen many times the last movie "Tribulation", "Armageddon" and so far it is the best one to present Bible truth. It does not have many great effects like today's movies, but I believe it is a good witnessing instrument. This movie and its prediction series highpraise.com can be seen free on this website, and judge for yourself. All the blessings
