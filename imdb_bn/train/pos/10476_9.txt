"Hello Music" My first exposure was the same name as Rheostatic album, which I bought in about 1993. I was reading a fishing note and the band said that the album was in a prominent place in my collection, inspired by Canadian author Paul Coarington's book. <br /> <br /> I picked up the book after a few months and ate it! An amazing read! I repeatedly read the book, every time I found Desmond's new material and his desire to complete the music. <br /> <br /> I found the video in 1996. I did not have much experience with the Canadian film, but it worked for me. Claire's role can be cast differently, but overall I think that Paul Cowrington's vision was shifted from the book beautifully to the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film finds family relationships, love, and anyone who understands. I firmly recommend "Hello Music" to music fans, but anyone has ever lost something or someone, and tried to find their way to the world.
