I was lucky to see it in pre-screening yesterday (October 20) and I was amazed at the surprise of the surprisingly plotted plot and started acting in real life. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is not particularly complex or exceptionally new, the story is released in such a way that it feels fresh, unique, and clearly "indy" in style. It's not something that can easily be compared to past movies, it's a unique step in the classic middle-aged depressed love story. <br /> <br /> I was particularly hit by the film cast. . Below every last addition of the family, it was a beautiful and gifted cast. The three girls have done a wonderful job, the talent has spread equally among them and none of them "sounds" to the other two. <br /> <br /> This is a really fun movie, which is suitable for all ages and laughs. Loud fun while being really touched and warming the heart. It was a wonderful break from the recent jokes and nudity of movies.
