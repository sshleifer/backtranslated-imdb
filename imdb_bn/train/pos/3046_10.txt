All good movies "inspired" some videos copyright flick directly. I was afraid that "Gladiator" was not really good, because I did not see any film, which was remotely reminiscent of the Romans, which has been in the new release for months. Then I saw the last moon offering, Demonicus. I am a fan of Phool Mune's Puttmastar series and Blood Dolls, but they have not seen any non-kissing doll movies. However <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Describes what is happening to a group of Demonix Hills campus camps. One of the campers, James, found a cave with old gladiator artifacts, and was inspired to remove the helmet from the body and tried it. He appeared, and, as the giant Gladiator Teranas, was inspired to kill his friends to revive the dead, who is the real taranas? <br /> <br /> Imagine, like a full moon movie, it's less or no budget. Occasionally, editing and direction was so amateur that I swore I saw the Blair Witch project. Attempts to cut limbs and head off remind me of Monty Python Scheit. Arms, though apparently practical, really look plastic-Y. It looks like a partly a weekend was impressed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder. Imagine, there is no mistake in making such a film, it does not just hire and hopes for a technical skill. Looks like there was an attempt to search for the script, because the Teranas did not really work as a gladiator, at least he spoke in Latin. <br /> <br /> Combine all, I Actually enjoyed this film. Probably as a killer doll film, perhaps, but the full moon is still distributed! The only thing I was disappointed was that there was no full moon video zones!
