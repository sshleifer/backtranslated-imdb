I saw Enchanted April first five years ago. I love it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy of the following Christmas. Nearly two women have decided to hire a fort in Italy for the month of April, their stakes are behind them. They are very sad women at the beginning of the film, and you can not help them, because they are blocking this plan with two other women to invite them to share. This is probably the best movie I've ever seen. It's' pure and easy, no car, with no animosities and no death. It was made with care and very good taste. You can not help but smile all through it - without you crying when you are happy!
