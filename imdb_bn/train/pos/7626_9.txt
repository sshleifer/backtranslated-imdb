In 1979, I saw this movie that I love. I'm still wondering how accurately Curt Russell shows Elvis how well he goes and how the expression is correct in his face. Sometimes its looks terrible, works, and discussions like real Elvis. Thankfully, it was released from the DVD, so all of us waiting could get a great quality version of the full-length movie. I heard the opponents, who say there are some errors, or some things left, but I think that John Carpenter was supposed to work for 21 hours and it was shown on television (Elvis's death just two years later!) He Did a good job with this. Actually I did not see the other Elvis movie that even near it. Highly recommended.
