... 16 years after Tim Burton finally disappointed me !!!! What happened to the old Burton of Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" to prepare for the return of Batman in 1988-89? It seems that Burton did not study the book, and because of the movie he made everything wrong! This movie sucks! It's not as good as the original and it does not deal with the same thing as the original. If you want to see a good Ape movie original. <br /> <br /> ** ****
