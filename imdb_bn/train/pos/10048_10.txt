Each time the conversation will start "favorite movie". I'll talk about the Titanic, and at least one couple people will be snicker. I can not give them any idea because I knew five years ago that this same movie was crying to this same person. And they are very embarrassed to accept it now. <br /> <br /> I returned the Titanic for the first time. I was surprised to see that the film did not lose any power over this five years, hoping to enjoy the story again. I'm back in the same place .... in the same place. It was brought back to me in 1997 when I think a movie that could break a movie has become the most popular movie of all time. As a movie, I can remember the film of public sentiment (yes, more than Star Wars). And today, many people do not even accept it they enjoy it. People, let's do something straightforward - you do not look cool if you make this movie worse. You look like a look out of touch cynic. <br /> <br /> No movie is perfect and this has some errors. The dialogue becomes slightly flat, and some plots around the two lovers come very nicely together. However, it is so confusing that it destroys the film. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is the perfect actor of his generation. Wait, you'll see him in the New York Ganga, before that you will not say anything except a beautiful boy. Kate Winslet was so powerful in this film. The movie really was her, and she kept it nicely together. <br /> <br /> James Cameron believed it was impossible by restoring a trusted Titanic. The drowning scenes were horrible, just as they were that night. How can someone say bad influences out of me? I was completely transfixed. <br /> <br /> This picture is a memorable scene after another. Port of Southampton left the Titanic. In turn rose and jack, "flying" "Iceberg, just ahead!" Incredibly hanging screws of the sea. He screams down the wreckage. And that ultimately brought tears to the most barbaric people in the theater. <br /> <br /> This movie was also successful, it was a key element. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the theme of love was beautiful and tragic. The very bad Selen Diane pop song version was so destructive for so many people. <br /> <br /> I admit, I'm a Titanic Buff. For example, I enjoyed the opportunity to see the ship because we did not see it - in all its beauty. Perhaps I felt a little more affected by this because my life was so much interested in the ship. However, I saw many of them as Titanic Buff. I congratulated Cameron for bringing this story to the public, which has never taken the tragedy. The image was created with such humanity. Another critic said, "Better than I can ever do: Open your heart to the Titanic, and you will not be disappointed."
