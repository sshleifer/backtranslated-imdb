I can not believe they stopped this wind. Especially, when they were only a few days left. My daughter, sister and some of my friends love watching this show. Due to so-called ratings, we were very annoyed when they stopped showing it. This is not suitable for people who are watching this show from the beginning. We were right to see the end. I hope they take the total vote from all the people with the system of voting three times a year. They can send papers to mails and viewers can vote in the overall program on which we have seen or heard. It can help to promote a new show. People will see it and wonder what it is. You can not just view what viewers are watching, you can use it as a tool for free advertising for TV and cable channels only. We would like to see other episodes. Get it back !!
