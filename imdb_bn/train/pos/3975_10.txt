If you have been through 60, then this film is sometimes painful and may be quite enjoyable at other times. It's all but there counter-printed print at the small time of tabloid culture. This is the roots of a social revolution that is still going on: "Do not talk too fast at the speed of the wheel, because it changes once". The film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD, and at that time it plays a great role in the evolution of intellectuals, only on the evolution of intellectuals, by engineers, scientists, and in the development of computer-related operations. Salute for filmmakers from one there - you've seen that era better.
