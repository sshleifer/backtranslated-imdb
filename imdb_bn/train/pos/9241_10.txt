Hey man, what's going on It's me, the one and only Mike "Sony Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ........ You can not write a review in the real script, because we do not have any of us there. As far as I know, the story was okay when we went along. The best time of my life was to create that film, and it became so cold that I ended up with jesem ............ fun time So happy that you all enjoyed the music. I could not do the fights I actually saw. Every time I took some action, the director of war kept changing them. Yet, I had an explosion and really met some great people. Especially the purple female ninja, who seems to have read the filmmaking scene.
