We really enjoyed the Gray Oil: A typical story in classic Attenborough fashion has been well-said: some romanticization, decorations, humor and dignity and values ​​stress. <br /> <br /> I spoke nicely, the true story of this archa, an Englishman who became a local Indian, and went to live and fall into Canada. <br /> <br /> Creates this image with a message for everyone to see solid performance easily. <br /> <br /> The movie star has never seen anything without any doubt - and the message is a good one for its ecoleanings. It was definitely great to see or read Gray Oil in the 1930s, it is a unique character and it is a suitable film festival.
