Yes right Samo Hong played a key role in the 1983 "Magic Mountain from Magic Warrios". Now, 2001, he did it again with "Zoo Warrior". But this time, he finally gets it right. You rarely see him in Uxia, more often than the classic Eastern or crime slopstick. But this role only fits him! Ancient Chinese legends are often not present in the film about the zoo (as far as I know about the western film translated). However, legend has an interesting story and possibilities. Straight said: You have not yet seen the story in a modern movie! And that makes so great! And Wow: All the colors plus a very deep, heartwarming story you read instantly at this moment. For the first time I saw it, I had to show it again, and I did. Okay, I did not understand this for the first time. But that makes it only good! You know, you do not understand it all because it has a lot of spice in it! It is a pleasure to visit it spontaneously. And yes, it gets deeper in your heart, as soon as you see it. <br /> <br /> Overview: The story of love, the crying characters you have, and the real: a movie that you do not forget! - Editor's note: Well, I think I should see it again: D.
