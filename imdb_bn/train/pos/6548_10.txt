This is a great movie! I played all the nancy druo games and read the books, and I do not expect the movie to be so exciting and fun! If you have never heard about Nancy Drew, read the first book (secret of the old watch) so that you can use it in Nancy, you can see the film because they do not actually recognize the characters in the movie 'Name Fast ;) My whole family enjoyed it and the plot was very interesting. It has been a final form of previous Nancy Drew films, which does not seem to match the Nancy Drew actor. This movie is very much like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so beautiful! Lovers of Nancy Drew, you will see this!
