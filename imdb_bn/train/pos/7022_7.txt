Finally !!!!!!!!!!! I have been waiting for this film to come out for almost a year, and finally it was seen in the premiere of SB. I met a few of the actors, who were really nice and who were great movies. I've seen so many trailers that I did not know what I could expect, but I started sucking it completely. The film was really nice to see and the music was very good. I recommend it to anyone in the Rayan Donoho fan, and the SWIST SWIKE it was very good. The other actor was also great at the best. I hope it will come out soon from the DVD !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first became Ryan to OC observer and then saw him look like a tremendous indigenous group like the legendary heroes. He's great in this film, and he's all that indie does it. I like Dominic but I can not see it as much. Hope to see them both soon !!!
