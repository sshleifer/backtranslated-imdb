If you face face-to-face, but it is logical in a given illogical condition, you will enjoy this radioactive 8-minute Spanish movie. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene seems to be simple, but the counterman, the customer, and the two musicians are somewhat weirdly frustrated. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians played and a man started singing the title song, gesture began to dance on the table with a musical-comedy. At the first set of times, customers are laughing intensely (badly but nicely) with the phrase phrases, fall from their paper slips. On and off they like backing up singers, jumps and dances (kinky but earnestly) in the dance form. <br /> <br /> But why ??? Wonderful women. The answer is that the single jacket opens and sees what he saw on his chest - just before the explosive mountaineering ... <br /> <br /> Even if you do not play the song (probably ferrous) songs, the situation-perfect performance You have to give a chic and a chocolate ... I want to see it again!
