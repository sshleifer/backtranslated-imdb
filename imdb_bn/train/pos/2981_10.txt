Why is this movie rated so low? I have seen this movie 25 times, I know every line in this movie. It is clear that I love this movie. Tray Parker and Matt Stone (South Park Builder and New Doll Masterpiece Team America) starring Joe Cooper, or Cop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Rimmer, or "Sir Swiss" Mainly they are referred to as Coop and Remer just across the movie. As soon as the film begins, it reminds us of the hunger crude world of extra-paid sports startups, even if they are known as "Townsell". I must quote this movie because it is true of some game startups: "And one year for New England, San Diego, Houston, St. Louis, Toronto Argonaut, and one more game for Dessert in a season, I finally played in Miami City Happy to play here. "His agent leans over:" Minnesota. " Let's not forget the important part of this movie. So it starts that Kuop and Rima are in a high school reunion party and they still do not know anything by talking to their old classmates. Outside basketball basketball heroes are likely to make up the sport BASEketball after being challenged. After shaming them the sport goes in about a year. This time they manage to hire their third teammate, SQ, which is actually one day after the game was discovered. Following the film, we found that Kup, Rima and Sikk are the only quality sports hero left. The story follows with Janny Blackmail, Milwaukee's beer cheerleader, and humor is so weird that it will leave you crying more. See it dude, it's ridiculous
