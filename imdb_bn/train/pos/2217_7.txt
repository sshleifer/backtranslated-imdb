I am usually skeptical of watching movies or mini-series based on novels because the script is always different from the novel. Thankfully, I was wrong! The screenplay was very close to the novel (I guess the writer is an executive producer and writer, huh?) <br /> <br /> Cast is outstanding. I can not enjoy how excited the actors look like (see I'm from OC Davis and Ruby de to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> Location setting ... I was hoping to see the house and the cottage, I thought to myself: What I saw on the screen is a little different. However, the small series was not enough to dislike me. <br /> <br /> I recommend someone to read the novel: If you have it, do not be frustrated. 8 out of 10! <br /> <br />
