Why did you enjoy the last episode? White, comedy, light heart, and deep thoughts can actually show co-operation because of the true genius Melissa Joan Heart and her supporters' cast. I used to enjoy the most that I could come back home from hard work and started laughing ... Why I was inspired? While helping others, this magical person was so happy to see it was an inspiration to see it. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, there was a hero ... though he was so weak that we were not different from us ... was very different; His fingerprints, greetings and commands which can be used for good or bad can exist in many of our imaginations. Most of what we see, have, know, can be used for ourselves or even wishes ... for good or bad, and how we like to define it, we define a person. <br /> <br /> He traveled the world and other areas with these constant and unpredictable ideas ... learning, living, laughing and loving. He was always learning how to improve his skills for the convenience around him; He lived, he made mistakes through the growth of different living, as he, his cousin, and Selim (underlying, yet incomplete hero) proved through false proof that you are still wrong, gifted, and wonderful. <br /> <br /> He displayed many selfless, education and loving work alongside his path. If there is not enough reason for this 10 anti-war heroes in the world, where people are so hostile to each other, they do not understand how to differentiate the torches of life rather than the causes of killing ... then I do not know what. This event certainly was a gift of inspiration to make us better and also a smile on our chops as well as traveling to a better world ... I have mentioned above everything that I heard from a doctor leads to a healthy "heart" ... and What do we need all? :)
