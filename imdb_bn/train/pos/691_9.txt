I will be clean. I found out about this DVD because Dominink Monaghan is a favorite actor of mine. When I heard the title of this movie, I thought it was going to be ... Probably not a good way. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading out some reviews about this brief, I was actually excited about seeing it. I sent off for my copy as soon as possible and took it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not frustrated. <br /> <br /> This picture follows Jack, who is uncertain, often under circumstances that makes him doubt the reality and what he has on his head. I will not give up what happens, but I will tell you that this film can sometimes be scared of its reality. <br /> <br /> The instruction can lose a great amount of entertainment or contemplative moments. <br /> <br /> I give 9 of 10 out of 10 of this great film to all, which I think is less than that which I think can achieve a lesser amount.
