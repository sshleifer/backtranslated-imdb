"Slaughter High" is a completely ridiculous slashher flashing about a high school unarmed Marty, which always gets the choice by some pranksters. Excellent mistake and he ended up being burned silently. After a few years, he was involved in a reunion of his pain - only ten of them, and less and Marty killed each other. British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") acted as a heroine (died anyhow!). Acting is utterly horrific, there is also a large number of death scenes seen in the mysterious death scene: a person's abdominal blast, another female gets a acid bath in the literal sense of prey, a couple is related to sexual relations in the bed, a person is crushed by the tractor, a girl Is either drowning, and a doctor has a high blood pressure needle in the eye à¦¼. The killer wear a decent and rather weird Jason Mask and the setting (a beautiful old English castle) is really nice. Although the end of the dream is completely cruel. All is well that "slaughter high" is a piece of garbage, but I enjoyed it. For really bad slasher flicks fans.
