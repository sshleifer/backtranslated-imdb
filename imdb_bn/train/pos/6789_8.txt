Dragoon's Legend is one of the little known games that people love or hate. Some people claim that it is much more like other games, such as the Final Fantasy series - which is understandable, because it is essentially equivalent to Sony's Final Fantasy. Actually, I'm not very familiar with FA Games, I can not comment on the differences. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of the game is the war method. You do not have the ability to change only the more powerful dragon form, but each time you attack, you will need to pay attention to the buttons at the right time. Not only that, sometimes the enemies will attack you directly in the middle of a sequence, which means you can press different buttons to avoid harm. Even some of the attack items need buttons-mashing to be used. If you do not want to attack, you can always keep an eye on it, without raising more than half the damage, instead of using Healing, you raise your point of injury. <br /> <br /> FMVs are quite good - about the same quality as the last fantasy 8. However, while playing games the graphics are not quite as good as that standard. They might be good, but they might be - and honestly, have been - well. Some pages to be selected as well as translations. It does not only raise interesting character-related relationships, but there are some grammatical mistakes that should not be allowed to pass only. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I found to be interesting is that you lose the main party character - one dies, and the other becomes meaningless from the party and the page. Although there is often no point in the death of one character, it makes you realize early in the letters, while the heroes are still mortal as the next person. Those who replace lost letters only attain all their stats, so transit games play is fairly smooth. Perhaps one of my allegations about the character is the love interest of the main character, Shana. He is helpless female's epitome, requiring rescuing, finally a point to driving a player to scream with despair. When you can use him in his party, he is very weak - I do not know how his dragon's power is, I loved him so much, so no. Characters Rose, in contrast, is probably the favorite of my favorite female character. He is no wimp, and some of his dragon magic is extremely useful. The poles are quite powerful, as well as sometimes boring folly are barbaric. <br /> <br /> Character designers mostly do not care much about female characters or whatever, in many cases. Outfits actual utility Seriously, having no armor and most of your exposed skin is not helpful when fighting monsters. But I will support them, because women in various countries in their country work as nights. <br /> <br /> I can not comment on the plot, as I did not really pay much attention to it where I needed to go next. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br It has its errors, but think of it for me and just press the button and hit the right balance of right to kill monsters.
