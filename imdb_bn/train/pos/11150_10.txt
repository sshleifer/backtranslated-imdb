I was sitting to see "Midnight Cowboy" and it would be another movie of '60s / 70' 70. Some of my favorite films came from the '70s, "Midnight Cowboy" (the same vein like "Taxi Driver," "Middle Road," "Panic of Sweden Park" etc.), but many have achieved strong reputations among critics for many as well. Unfortunately, a huge majority of them do not keep up to date. I feel like "Easy Rider" in this way. (Even though this is one of my favorite ones.) <br /> <br /> So, I did not expect much from "Midnight Cowboy" but it was a lot lagged behind. It's a touchy story, systematic and consistent with the best performance of all time. As Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman, giving her best one - it is occasionally a little funny (when she speaks as a cartoon character - probably due to Lone / "Simpson" connection), Hoffman is completely convinced. Half of the movie budget went behind him because he was becoming a big star of Hollywood. Joe Buck as the second billed John Voet, "Cowboy" who travels from Apple to Apple in the hope of being prostitution of the male. Soon his stupid ways put him in trouble and he is associated with an unreasonable scam artist named "Ratso" - who becomes Joe's "director" for a certain percentage of profit. <br /> <br /> The film is quite long two hours but does not seem really long too. Some of the movies can be dragged, especially in the '70s, some of the reasons for the film's production (such as "Ezzy Riders, Raging Bauls") were directed by the directors of the 1970s and sometimes they got bit too infatuated with their material, too Long test characters / views / etc going on. That's not important. I think the only scene was a bit taller and there was unnecessary drug party - this film seems to be outdated (like "Easy Rider") and damages its flow because it is not needed. <Br> <br /> Also, "Midnight Cowboy" is almost a shameless motion picture. I was pleasantly surprised. It has flaws (flashbacks are a little sticky and can sometimes be used as they may) and some scenes are a little uncomfortable (such as a gay movie theater order) but if you can manage its contents "Midnight Cowboy" is a real great motion picture, 60's A critical test of life on the road late last in the late 70's / 70's. This is a sad movie, yes, and today's values ​​may seem a bit longer and heavy on the liberal view of "life horror, etc." ... but I still love it and especially the very sensitive end will be with me. A long, long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend. One of the best films of '70. (It was technically released at the end of 1969 but I'll still classify it as a 1970s film, it won the Oscars as its first film and the best-rating rating of the movie - it was rated again later, appeal appeal. <Br / > <br /> 4.5 / 5
