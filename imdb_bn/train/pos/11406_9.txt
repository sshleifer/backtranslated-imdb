These very clear settings of Wagner's last opera definitely increased on me. When I first saw it, I was somewhat annoyed by the miraculous images of most movies, and I felt that much attention was paid to the story. However, if you can change the "amphitheater" to a fair amount, I think that you will find that this movie is operating on the other strange, other global environments of the operators, and especially the moments are fined. <br /> <br /> Personally, I never realized the role of smoking until I saw how Edith Chickcar illustrated her. Her performance (a lip-synchronized meme of Yvonne Mintan's song vocal), amazing, is nothing short to end, and only fixes the hours it takes to absorb the film alone. Another reason for this movie is that it is a spectacular interpretation of Robert Lloyd in Garnman's important role, which Lloyd plays in a glasses in the opera room all over the world. Many times, he got the privilege of enjoying the role of Guernman in the role of Gurnaman on the Metropolitan Opera stage, and the warmth of his voice, and the warmth of his interpretation of the warm character, must be genuinely preserved, such as reviewing the predominance of the two major solidarity, characterization of law and law 1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a video tapes made for the US, and so there were subtitles, but could not be removed with. This is especially unfortunate because the translation is very wrong and it gives a very Christian explanation in a movie that already strengthens the layers of opera related explanations. Both Wagner's clear remorse of Christianity, and his deliberate attempt to "generalize" the Christian element of the story, were both very contrary to me. (See footnote with Spliler at the end of this review.) I think it's almost impossible to stop watching a movie with subtitles, to prevent them from being exploited and strongly recommend, if you have the ability to turn off your subtitles in DVD versions, you do so, and Instead, if Opera is not unfamiliar to you, then you can read Libreto carefully. <br /> <br /> There are so many things in the film below which I dislike and I have seen it as soon as seen differently ... but it was first seen in years that I grew up hurriedly, and I myself Grabbed <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> A good example would be the famous line of smoker, "I saw him ... and smile." It is translated, for subtitles, that are avoiding me, "I've seen Savior's face." This is particularly annoying for me, because throughout Libretta, Wagner is very deliberately and carefully used to describe this invisible character, who does not need German as the "Hillerland", meaning "Hiller" - a reference to Amfortas wounds, and all wounds and maladies and Need cure
