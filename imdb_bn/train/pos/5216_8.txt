Errol works for the Department of Public Safety and checks his sex offenders in his work. Sometimes he pushes his work line and beats over sex offenders I do not blame him but he is ready to retire his boss with Alison. Like Errol now shadowing him for training him and working on it. Although Alison is not a little na√Øve about her job at the beginning, she does not understand how much she is actually in danger and it is a fault of all errors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her "practice opportunities." Errol is a good job but for Alison's safety. It is very good mystery and I was right when I figured it out, there was more.
