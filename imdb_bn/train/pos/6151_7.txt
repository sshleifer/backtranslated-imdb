I'll always keep a soft spot for this Disney Flick, their part is one of the Live Live Action / Part Animation Entries which wants to revive the success of "Mary Poppins" and never made it. When I was in grade school, every time we had a movie day, where the whole school would cafeteria, and a movie, old fashion, multiple relays and everyone would be projected. At that time, whenever this day was reached, it seemed like an important occasion, and I can remember one of these movies in "Bednobs and Bromstics". <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, it's quite charming. Angela Lansbury did not put her name on anything that was not least capable, and she won a magic wand here as a magician (the boy, who can understand the mistake, is not it?) Who can take him and some young people away from the magic adventures away from the kids. Place Let the child do not want such a bed? <br /> <br /> Grade: A
