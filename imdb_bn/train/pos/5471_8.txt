The film took a lot of interest in 1933, because it was very much for the content of the story, and Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwick) could do something to gain a lot of wealth and power. Lily's father forced her daughter to prostrate at the age of 14, and she grew up in a steel mill with a very poor man in a city and her father was running a power of spell that brought all male characters in her house randomly. . With the story progressing, Lily meets people with people and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is the President of a Playboy Bank. It's great to see a young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy junior), who was only 25 years old at the time. And Jimmy does not even get the first base with lily, even for lunch. A very young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) starred alongside Barbara Stanwyck and gave both outstanding performances. Since 1933, this is an extraordinary movie produced by Darrylif Junk and it has been blamed for many years and has recently been screened on silver screen. This image is rather light compared to what we see in the Hollywood screens, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this kind of movie. Enjoy
