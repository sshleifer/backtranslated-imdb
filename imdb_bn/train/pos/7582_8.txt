Santoros Katsu is best known for Jatouchi films, and in this third and final film, Kenzi missumi (mostly known as "Lone Wolf and Cub"), runs the song 'The Razer' Itamy of Hanoj, the rape 'Bhoot', and the galaxy in the Shogunate Treasures Reveals enthusiasm. The 'plot' of Hanzor was somewhat distraught and repetitive. What was the novel in the first film? Thankfully, it was better than the second, thanks to more humor. I am glad they like to stop in a trilogy (I see you Lucas) <br /> <br /> My grade: B <br /> <br /> DVD: Trailer for just 3 Hanzor royar movies <br /> <br /> Mother's Candy: Aoi Nakma unleashes both tits, Maco Midori is just one of her left
