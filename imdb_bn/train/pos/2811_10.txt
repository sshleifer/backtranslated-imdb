Silverlake Life, the scene from here comes together about stunning movies about AIDS as well as gay love relationships. Some pictures are really hard to accept, especially when one is homosexual or is afraid of AIDS and perhaps for any sensitive person to see it. Creating a movie about such terrible illness and its consequences is not easy, but the lives of two people. This movie teaches you to take care of each other in such a difficult time, but it does not shock, it still shows life at any time, whether you live in a theater or outside your home, which may be a fate. Characters are incredibly respectable, we see their intimacy with the shots, which do not exceed very strict limits, sometimes do not reveal personal or objectionable. Children certainly do not want to see this film, but they should be encouraged, as they can not cope with the situation, and they will not apologize for the tears they are driving.
