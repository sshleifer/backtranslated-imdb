My friend and I have selected "Paperhouse" outside of a random pillar of our weekly travel films in the Hurr section - none of us have heard of it, but the blog's blogger was really committed. And the movie was not frustrating, though I probably would not call it a horror movie specially. <br /> <br /> 11-year-old Anna Ad Madne draws a house, and meets her in her dreams. He is sitting in the house while he is clearly asleep, but it is real in a real sense that it is almost completely separate reality. Which does not seem to cry much from the point of view of the next incident. However, he can easily add pictures, find out the house, its contents, and its surroundings. <br /> <br /> When this is going on, fever is becoming more and more sick with fever, and along with it the house and its drawings are being drawn. Above him, he and his mother are dealing with his missing father; She has a job that takes her away for a long stretch, although there is much more to the story than someone gets her impression. <br /> <br /> Well, the drawing thing is good enough - but to be honest, there really is something boring about it. Dreamworld is eerily surreal - for example, the house is only a gray block in the middle of a lonely field. The people who made this film have made us very uncomfortable with this dream world / running dream ... <br /> <br /> One of the things Anna's house is, is that the boy, Mark, seems to be the same patient as a doctor ( I do not give it up, from that moment you know it's the same child). In fact, Mark can not walk because of illness; In Anna's drawing-world, she could not walk because she could not draw her any leg. He blames himself for his own life-threatening illness, and tries to correct the situation, but ... everything really starts to be strange. He even draws his missing father, even bringing disastrous results. Bits with dad are really awesome. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give anything, so I will stop there ... It looks like a lot is going on in this movie. I am convinced that after analyzing your ball to analyze this ball you will die with your friends - is this a simple story that seems to be the level of money? I do not know, but in any way it is quite interesting. An "Nightmare on Elm Street" - quality about it, it intersects reality and dreams at a particular point. I love something like that <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it seems to have ended so many times, but it did not. I was satisfied with the end (some kind of sensitive kind of kennex can easily be!) Though it may actually have different conclusions. However, it does not look right after it's actually gone, but when you're watching it and it's faded, it's a small nervous vaccine. <br /> <br /> Still, "Paperhouse" is a really good picture. It worked well, and played - especially as Charlotte Bark brought - the top notch. Bark, who has never appeared before or after a film, is a real gem. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Doubt / any other type of movie, with some definite harmful moments - but you You can still see it with your family and do not be worried about your younger brother or grandmother's blood splashing or something. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance, you do not regret it! And perhaps you read books Should, ...
