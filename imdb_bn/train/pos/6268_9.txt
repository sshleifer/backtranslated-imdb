Carter Wang is a reputed hero drama for a book healing, which is looking for him the ultimate vengeance! Pansing is good in this film and there are many battles in the fight to continue the film. Flying guillotines have no problem using the evil look and the main villain them. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and takes you to the very end (which I could feel that it was a seagull). <br /> <br /> Campo and the dark, it is the cool oil school Kung Fu !!
