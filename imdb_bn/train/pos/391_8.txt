"Ju: Warriors from the magic mountain" and was an impressive classic! You will not be guessed it was made in 1983. Special effects were very creative and inventive of Tue ui Harak. (He continues in the Chinese Ghost Story Trilogy and subsequent productions.) So far, it can measure up to other movies of this type. "Junk's legend" is associated with "JU" fighters from Magic Mountain, "It's not necessary for this film to understand this plot, it is difficult to follow this plot." But to be honest, this is all about a job and adventure! Always thinking about what I want to do to CJ Harak, if he gets his hand in CGI, now we know he has made this movie, perhaps it's too much But the overall outcome is so beautiful that I'm not going to be critical about that, so much of the screen is happening, you just will not believe it! I think it's a big shame that the movie was not shown in the theater here in Hollywood, the movie is screaming for the screen time in the movie! The only thing that can easily defeat Hollywood productions of big budgets like "Superman Returns" or James 3. I have to mention that the lack of humor, he has integrated the drama in most of the movies of Tui Hawkers, fantasy, martial arts and humor, however, it is absent in this movie, and again I'm not going to be like this as a small issue. "Ju's Legend" You will receive the most beautiful delivery on the action with special effects. A true classic!
