This is my kind of film. I am fascinated by the strange psychological nightmare and this movie is just that right. But it's a dark comedy. Although I can see it as the most scary / thriller, others may also see it as a black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, it's a compelling descendant to become crazy. Ultimately guards me, but what's the end! It lets the audience remember a lot. <br /> <br /> Strong performance, a complex and detailed plot, a great scripts, a scary scary of dread and a dash of fills, and a stupid atmosphere makes it a movie-worthy watch. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think I can choose all these times and understand all the data inside. But this is a film that will be a pleasure and it is not so that it can be done.
