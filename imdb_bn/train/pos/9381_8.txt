A drift for finding a job is a mistake in a small Wyoming town for people, leading to all types of complexity. The cage is fully cast, hoping to complete the hazardous schmuck as fast as possible and to get out of town, but he can not escape from the title town. Hooper did his best job, plays a psycho known as "Dylas Lyle", the actual Hit Man. Walsh is a cruel Sheriff and Boyle round out of fine molding as a femme fatale. Brother John and Rick Dahl's script are delicious twists and turns, and John's side creates a terrific "NoA quiet silent" atmosphere. Wicked and very entertaining, it sucks the visitors from the start and does not give up.
