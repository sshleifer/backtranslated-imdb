This is my favorite of these three care beer movies. Again I like all the songs. The big problem is that although most people have mentioned that the story is the opposite For those who first saw the movie, the Rear met their "cousins" who did not know clearly. Finally, the virus got the symbol of their pump after proof of how much they care. Although cats grow up with care and stomach marks are always in this story. As you say it is not a bad movie until you keep it separate from the first. I think the DarkHart character is worse, then the first Nicholas. But at the same time I felt it added a balance of the sweetness of care bears. I eventually like the care part, although I know that there were mixed feelings of other people about that scene. And of course I love the song. My favorite being growing up and young forever forever. Care-carrying movies always have such good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
