I saw this special advance screening today. I want to inform you that I am not a fan of Dan Cook or Steve Carroll, so I do not really have any expectations. I finally enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Life is a widow whose three daughters go to spend their holidays with her family. During the bookstore, she meets her dream woman, only to know that she may be his brother's girlfriend <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is well-made - soundtrack, cinematography, and acting Top genuine, especially Steve Carroll. My problem seems to be the lack of character development in most cases, mostly with the character of Dan Cook. We do not see the relationship between Dan and Steve's characters closely, and I think it could help to show Dan's internal contradiction in relating to the love of Dan's girlfriend. On the other hand, Dan in the real line is certainly a tough, sweet film - of course we're getting this year a wonderful break from all the horror and action movies.
