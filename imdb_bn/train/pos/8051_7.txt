"One of the better initial efforts of humor. Humor-trying to imitate Hang Lee's actions and expressions of death, and in some cases where the jack enjoys the fun of Jackie Chan's drunk master, the action is also good. Art experts take three cycles, it is not the greatest movie, but the '70 for Kung Fu Well, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or Leo. Be careful, though: Most video movie versions have very good quality, Blackface has a character that some people may find objectionable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is often billed as a parody of Bruce Lee's "Enter the Dragon", but this is not right ... Sammo is a rural swan hunter - With Bruce Lee Overwhelmed - who helps its relatives run a small open-air restaurant in Hong Kong, is forced to protect voters from local gangsters for the protection of new jobs. When Samo switches to combat mode, she switches her Bruce Lee into disguise, which can be believed! The film is quite desirable, in most of the battle scenes, Samo wars against people who are obviously more than martial artists, and there is a character that is supposed to be black, who played an Asian man in heavy (and unrestrained) makeup. But the lack of budget and accuracy of this film, it is more than being created for the atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood. "
