Even saying a word, Billy Connely is as wonderful as a zombie ... "Mother" as Carey Ann Moss?, Even better. Zombie Girlfriends? <br /> <br /> "... my dad gave me food ... I have never tried to eat timmy." <br /> <br /> I thought the donors were good. What kind of airless (Mets?) Living dead, sponsored by the zombies. <br /> <br /> And do not forget the coffin of my head <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> And yes, the social comment is too much to comment. Say <br /> <br />, it really works!
