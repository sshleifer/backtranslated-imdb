I do not understand the hatred of Roni Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was quiet, and he gave one of the most clever action films in the world, 'Cliffhanger'. Okay, little pans, 'cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it. <br /> <br /> Slie Gerv played the Walker, a former rescue campaigner, a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rucker), who helped to rescue a mountain peak. Walker apparently returned at a convenient time, because the aggressors were actually a sophisticated group of thieves led by Eric Quinn (John Lithgo). Qualen & Co They have lost the amount of money they had stolen from the United States in the Rocky Mountains and they really want to get it back ... <br /> <br /> Basically, 'cliffhanger' is another 'die hard' clone. In the Rocky Mountains of the open mountain ranges, the Nakmami plaza constraints create only scenes to identify the weaknesses of our heroes and push him towards death. Naturally, the set is completely torn off very quickly, because Stallone's character can easily avoid bullets, and many rocks can face without any adverse side effects. After all, what action movies are not all about? <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting action movies around 'Cliffhanger'. A showcase of great views and stunts. One of the first stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in the movie, and when the rest of the movie did not get anything better than it did it, it keeps its performance remarkable. John Lathgo's chief villain is entertaining, and a bad dude. Perhaps one of the coldest lead villains is one of the best Clifford Stallone efforts, apparently by Ronnie Harlin. Best Effort and Very Exciting Action Movie - 9/10
