Sequels sometimes live up to the original. This is definitely proof of truth in this case. However, if you're basically a big fan of original than giving a watch. Although there is a lack of camera work, the character of Brian Cruz is annoying and the plot is wheeled, it is much more fun than the first and I am entertaining about it. <br /> <br /> This picture does not expect the same performance as the first movie. Quite clearly it is a bit different. Rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplaces, Stanley is trying to direct his dream project, Kevin Lake. This movie has a different feeling, but Stanley again looks at the action. <br /> <br /> I gave 6 out of 10.
