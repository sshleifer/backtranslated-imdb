Yes, it's flawed - especially if you're in Hollywood movies that have many effects, claiming a completely entertaining or imaginative story or plot, and you can not really think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Disease films are a perfect example for intelligent film-gear, and insinifience. <br /> <br /> Characteristics are brilliant, the story is excellent, but, like all the episodes of nick disease - about the aspect of it you are thinking on every level of reality before that you will not be dawned on. His movies always remind you, and personally, I like it in a movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect to see this movie and feel happy and happy, because you might be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's nice.
