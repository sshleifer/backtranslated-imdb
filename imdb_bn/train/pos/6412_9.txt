I'm certainly glad that a film about Karl Brasier's wonderful life story was created. As it happened during the civil rights era, all the minority communities in Brasier had become an inspiration for people who did not agree to sit for the expected conditions. <br /> <br /> Brassier played by Cuba Gooding, Junior. For example, he chose life behavior. Very similar to Jackie Robinson, who integrated baseball and sticks it with his character and behavior. Like Brasier, Gooding knows that he does not want his father Karl Lumbly's shareholder life, and makes it truly clear to live longer than his life. <br /> <br /> But when Harry Truman armed the armed services after World War II, the Navy still has its restrictions. A black man can only be a chick or an officer's valet, the real war part is denied to him. It is not enough for Gooding, which is applicable to naval deep sea diver. <br /> <br /> Once Upon a Diving School in Beyoncé, New York, Gooding dumps everyone to him, most of them are Chief Chief Executive Officer Charge, Robert DeNiro. Denroe may have some left-wing projects, but then he is a hero and one who can inspire to pass the race. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Man of Honor is chemistry between Dino and Gooding. They come from different places, but they know each other, both can be respectful men. <br /> <br /> Another good performance is, the wife of Charles Thérône Déronou and Head Holbrook's head diving school, a guy navy just willing to retire for the reasons you'll see. <br /> <br /> An inspirational story about men with the ability to dare and change the honor of the men.
