I think children's looks are very good to show. I especially enjoyed the performance of Emma. Savass! Stunts were quite good for low budget shows. I could follow the movie and enjoy it for every 5 minutes to watch my watch. I enjoyed the tooth fairy and the scenery of his fiery scenes. Ex-apparitions of the release of souls of children were also good. The movie is another good point that kept moving along. Slow scenes were not many. Adult Lead was also credible and therefore helped keep the show entertaining. All the movies are a enjoyable night watching at all.
