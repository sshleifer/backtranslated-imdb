It is very difficult to rate this film. As entertainment value for 21st century viewers, it unfortunately fails. However, for elementary film film and history students, it is a jewelry. "Show Off Sous" was a resurgence portrayed by MGM's successful "Hollywood Review of 1929" competition which still lives completely with its technicolor scenes. <br /> <br /> The purpose of all the star resurgence was to show a specific studio silent star, and it shows that they can move. However, Warner Bros. Forget this and many jobs and stars that they did not employ long-term contracts such as Ben Turpin, Lloyd Hamilton, Beatrice Lillie, even a marching band. Meanwhile, their biggest talent - Al Jolson - notable missing. He was not even forced to join even at a higher salary. Almost every action is too long and the film is played in a dozen or so dramatically. The final is very long, but it's really enjoyable with all its dancing numbers. <br /> <br /> Movie Highlights Winnie Lightener - Two numbers from "Pingo Pango" and "Bathtub's Singing". , A few numbers with Nick Lucas, performing Shakespeare in John Barrym, and the Chinese fiction "Lee Po Lee" with Nick Lucas and Marina Loy. This last number is only part of the survival movie in Technicolor and it's really quite interesting. A good creator, these good-looking players were the star of Warner Bros. for a long time, so perhaps the directors knew how to play them in their power to know. <br /> <br /> This picture acts as a snapshot of an odd point in film history - 1929, which was the bridge year between two eras - silence and sound age, and higher 20 and great sadness. Just two years later, the same film was completely different, as Warner Bros his silent co-star and the stars he had hired kept only for the sake of the musical instrument for the star, which would give Warner Bros his distinct urban appearance. And thinks - James Cagney, Joan Blondel, Edward G. Robinson, and others.
