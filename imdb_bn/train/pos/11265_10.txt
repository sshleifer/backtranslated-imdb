I did not really know who saw this Robert Owl. But after seeing this, I realized that he was a funny person. This HBO specially taught him "American History" of New York University Film Students and the people were just phenomenal. He enjoys any important historical event that has happened in other parts of the world, not the United States. This documentary / comedy was a great mockery, which really took me as true true history and it really is true. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed how Mr. Uhhul could mix useful information with great comedy and tried to learn. Much more exciting. I would recommend this to anyone interested in history and wish to question what he believed.
