I must admit that the first Anantoni film was difficult to start since the first attempt and even for this, I saw it in three parts of the recurring shows. In the end, I felt that it was probably good, because it forced me to stop thinking about the usual condition of the plot and the scenes enjoyed one after the other. <br /> <br /> The first part seems to be more broken, which is not a bad thing, it requires more effort to follow. When it gets to the desert scene, all efforts are paid full. Stunning cinematography is simply a part of it, which really makes each other unforgettable, like how the landscape is a huge presence, like silence and its splendor, sadness and feeling of freedom, how it lungs and contrasting with the young characters. The desert is dead, but at the same time it seems less remote and isolated than the urban scene in the first place. The flying aircraft on the aircraft and the girls makes for a series of great shots in the dance in the car. Love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful, it is difficult to imagine such a system from a movie of our time. Of course, it is somewhat stylish and researched about them, but at the same time they express the natural, spontaneous innocence that is very rare nowadays. It all sounds loose and unapproved (thanks to unclear acting), but it is the result of the detail and the attention of the form that ultimately comes to its measurement in the continuation of the explosion, it is really shocking spectacle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With the twists of action, but then if all the movies were like that, that would be really dull and sad; Ugly - Maybe, but when that ambition is combined with the true skills, depth, and style, pretentious is a compliment. "Political" criticism makes me feel at least, I can not see the coming point of a film like this with ideological blinders or bad, patriotic requirements. It's just to lose purpose. Perhaps it is true that, like the comments of the previous commenter, Antonioi fascinated the youth with 'hippies' and politics of protest and a foreigner with rioting politics, but I think something has been added instead of being separated from the film. It is not true that Hippies did not exist in Italy (think of the '68 protests like France), although they must have been more militant than American opponents and in some ways. But his interest in this film was not a little political. Events seem more prominent for a film whose application is a universal, timeless quality. <br /> <br /> Specifications for excellent soundtracks. Among other things, this film, along with Easy Rider, is perhaps the earliest precursor to the contemporary 'Arts' music video, as well as the concept of a movie soundtrack that will stand on its own, but it is one of the few. Using music in a much more subtle way, instead of action, it mixes it with the landscape. <br /> <br /> If you want a traditional story in a photo, do not get bored. If you want to hang, be patient and you do not regret it.
