I'm going back to C and C's fan, their record, and liked this movie, but in the mid-1980s, in San Jose California, it was broadcast on television with an alternative plot line that destroyed the whole point. All references to marijuana are replaced with "diamond". Chung's "Red" drop is in diamond instead of Marianne, but the conversation remains the same ("... it's equivalent to $ 3000 / lb"). There is a sub-plot that observes the alien clips of a ship, C and C, and talks with each other about getting the diamond. At the end, instead of "Space Coke", it's something else. I'm not sure who created this version, but it is terrible and clear that they are trying to make family / child friendly. It would be better if the network does not broadcast it.
