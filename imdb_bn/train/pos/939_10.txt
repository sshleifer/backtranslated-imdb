Okay, here are some reviews, what can I possibly add? <br /> <br /> I will try <br /> <br /> This is why my favorite screw is the reason for everything. Set, outdoor location, costume is so beautiful and authentic. Music sweet Support throwing is done very well. One of my favorite performers and nephews is played by Roger Reese. His absolute sincerity is touching and his voice is about Christmas words to me. David Warner is also a complete credible Bob Crutchit. He has a difficult life, but he is positive and respected. <br /> <br /> The best part of course - George C Scott is like Ebenezer Scrooge. Some people said that his screenplay is very bad. I can not disagree more. His exchange in the beginning when the cold or harsh, the character was not out. He is a terrible man-made person who has become hard-hearted by his desire for life and riches. <br /> <br /> During Flashback, it is clear that he is not all lazy. This is where we see that there is hope for him. If he goes completely, his companion Marl has not come for him for the first time. And after all, we hope nobody is in the past. I think Dickens is trying to say what a big part of it. When Scrooge looks at his employer's belly and his dancing look, you feel mad at him, he told Flossby that he would go through life "whirling over my face". Clive Donner was smart enough to allow this moment in the film. Sometimes they are left on the edit room floor. <br /> <br /> Finally, its transformation is so full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time I see it. His apology to his nephew Fred, so sincere, so moving, it is not just Christmas but the spirit of humanity. He was so clear to his wife that he brought Fred with joy. And that line gets me every time, "God forgive me for the time I waseteted." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />!
