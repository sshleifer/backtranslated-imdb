Well, who torn it out ... Tony really bites and his life will change forever. Unfortunately, after his father died in an accident in a strange situation (!)

My favorite sequences are in the sex-add classroom where Tony has published his role in the Verubil conversion and Dr. Brand (Alan Orkin, who steals the movie without having a screen on Kenneth Mars), probably in 80's class, perhaps the world's worst psychologist . His work of talking to Jumper came down from a balcony. Jumper and fireman (first time trying to talk to him), both are brand crazy! The brand tries to sign Tony Dafer to donate his body to science so that he can get a quilt for his wife!
