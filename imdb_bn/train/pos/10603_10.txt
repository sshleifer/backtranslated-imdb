I became tired of seeing my 4 and 5 year old girls nicelydodon, Disney, and the like. It seems like all the same old tired cartoons rehashed over again. This afternoon my daughters could not go to the fair because one of them was sick, I wanted them to take some rest and take a rest. I flopped the television and for a little different search, I flopped the channels. The surfing of my finger channel stopped when I heard the voice of Harvey's voice. I worship every single solo thing that this man has done and when I saw that he is doing a voice-over work for a little duck ... well, I could not change the channel! My daughters were immediately shocked by the cartoon and as much as we watched the show, the more I loved the message that was portrayed with it. This is not a proponent for "gay rights", but for anyone who has ever been irrelevant to children. I had friends who picked for one thing or another .... very fat, very skinny, very feminine, a weird, not intelligent enough, there was only one parent .... you name it! Children can be very cruel to each other as a rule, so I was happy to see a colorful cartoon which actually released a life message to the audience. My girls already take others like they do and take others to be different. My eldest daughter is actually standing for her friends if they are picked (only with a mother and that little girl is often picked - when Casey stands for it, it forces my heart!). <Br /> <br /> So, among those who are condemning this show, you feel compelled to "accept gay rights" or "take certain views", you have clearly missed the point of this mad little cartoon <br / > <br /> <br /> If you need you will be explained ... well, you need more help than any television program can ever give.
