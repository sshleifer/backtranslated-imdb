I think this movie is really fun because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock), who died and sent back to Earth in the middle of the 50's. He should change his behavior and did not understand that he continued to work as he had before. He is singing, singing, and listening to the stereotypical part of an urban black man. The real humor in this film saw the problem of carrying this behavior with the black community.
