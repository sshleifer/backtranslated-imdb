Insane man scenes in a sanctuary, quickly intercutting, and photo montage / superimposition, and unclear, interwoven details, a very difficult movie to follow. Apparently a person (Masu Inui) takes a job as a porter or a janitor so that he can stay with his prison wife, and may possibly rescue him. But he is definitely crazy, most of the time with an empty expression and huddled over the floor with writing on his face during the rest of the fear, woe, and confusion. The filmmaker sometimes switches from his point of view, and we see him vaguely on the side of the pond under the children's infestation or throwing the drowning baby. He is tormented by some. When her perspective is transferred to her or other crazy people, the filmmaker uses distorted lenses and such things, which shows us how crazy people react and then how they react. And crazy folks, laughs, hidden, and in one case are frenetically swarming with night and day dance. At one point the man tried to take his wife out, but the door was afraid of him at night and he returned to his cell. Gradually the man burst into a nightmare, where he hindered another attempt to steal him, and he killed doctors and many attendants, and crazy people smile and worship. When he wakes up, he gets relieved and jumps on the floor. 1920s life, street, some interesting shots of the house in the 1920s
