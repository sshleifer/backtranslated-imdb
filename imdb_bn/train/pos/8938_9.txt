One of the best-selling books and Slash Broadwei was an extraordinary film version, two African-American sisters, who lived in the age of two and played stories for a century in American history, played with the life of Sedi and Besi Dalyan. Ruby D. and Dianan Carroll have performed very well as Basi and Saadi respectively. Amy Madinon is also good as New York Times reporter Emmie Hill Harth, whose sisters started the book. Etc. Flashback scenes and many of today's days are very powerful, if not inspirational, as a book. This is the only real error, some aspects of the story are not clearly presented, such as the mother's inter-ethnic background and why their father was so strict. But more than that, a very good job, best acting, a strong movie.
