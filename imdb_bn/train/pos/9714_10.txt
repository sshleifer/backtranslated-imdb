What do you get if you cross the matrix with the truman show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've seen all the matrices now. Matrix creator says that it is inspired by 'anime'. Just seeing this classic trailer, you can see where they took the plot from. <br /> <br /> This picture is arranged in Japan in Japan, and it really shows up. Costume, music and sounds (in the latest English language edition of Eddie Vision) they all raised in this era. I believe that this was also created during that time, but due to some plot point it is not the date of the movie! <br /> <br /> Perhaps you have guessed by referring to my matrix, the world is not real. It's not really 1980's. In fact, it's more like some of the 2480's. After the nuclear war, the ecosystem of Earth (or "Prime of Biosphor") is destroyed. The residue continues to conflict where we are forced to flee in space. Once the planets (or "biofiers") were abandoned, people began to live in Meganj - the city inside the spaceship, where they believed that we came back to the world, the most peaceful time in recent memory through the delusional and truman show-esquiz ... in the 1980's. When the young shoe acquires a mysterious looking looking motorcycle, it is more than to tell him more than ... the garland from a weapon of 2400 (a bike that becomes a mech), the military has escaped to Shogo for his escape. When the war came closer to megajon, the war came closer to the house and due to clashes between the military and the computer, war also came to megajana ... if I want forgiveness, they will be forgiven, but the plot is basically designed in that way. <br /> <br /> Morso drives higher feelings in this movie than this matrix. You really believe that the war is going on, and Shogo has become quite bad by discovering what it really is. An uber-happy cooler started as 80's flashbacks and dissonance became a sad story. These characters are real people, or we almost look at the matrix's bullet-time, the cardboard is not cutout. Such conspiracies, and after the war was captured, the people of suffering really understand. It can only push you towards the end ... I know it's me. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite impressive for it, and the quality of the image in Avivision DVD is unbelievable for her age. Artwork style is beautiful and traditional anime memorable, very cultural. Be prepared for many violence and blood, there is also a sex sexual scene. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would say that this is one of the best animations I have seen, in fact, I have seen one of the best movies, and many are considered as one of the greatest anam of all time. <br /> <br /> It is unbelievable to take my English language as I can certainly suggest avivation DVDs and movies will cast the same vocal, which can be bought with justice, and an artifact holding two sequels when they release. <br /> <br /> All, Megazon 23 is an incredible movie, and the demands to be highly-held, and any Anime fan's collection should be an essential. Hack, even my mother enjoy it.
