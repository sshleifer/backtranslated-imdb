"My Left Feet" is a fantastic fascinating film that tells the story of Christie Brown, who has learned to paint an obscene artist with cerebral palsy and with his left foot, the only part of his body was under his control. Daniel Day-Lewis won the best Oscar for the first Oscars, which I was not completely specific, but still notable. Day-Lewis give a realistic and sometimes almost ridiculous touch. Brenda Fructor, like Brown's foster mother, won Oscar to play a credible and sensitive role. My problem with this movie is that it is sometimes very real. When Brown falls in frustration and needs to save him and do everything with his left foot, the film can be hard to see. This often gives a frustrating feeling that can close some viewers for some time. However, if you look outside of it, you can see a feeling of hope and inspiration for those who can overcome frustration and other problems. Those of us who are useless and still do not think of their problems, are inspired by this film, because if we can overcome their problems with a much worse situation, we can certainly do the same thing. Well made, sometimes enjoyable, but the clock is difficult. May not be for everyone, but nothing bad. <br /> <br /> *** *** ***
