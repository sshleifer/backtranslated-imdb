In August 1980, there was a lot of anger against the disappearance of child Azizia Chamberlain and the murder of the child on the charge of following her guardian Lindsey and Michael. The media and the crowd had already convicted the accused couple and were responsible for the blood. Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that Dingo was taking their ten-year-old daughter from their tent while camping at Ayers Rock in Central Australia. Eat barbecue area Someone believes them. Lindie was charged with the murder of her baby and Michael Maxwell was charged as an accuser. The whole country was surprised by the whip of a religious assassination. Chamberlain's trial ended before it began. <br /> <br /> Lindsey did not prove his innocence, so he was convicted. There was not enough evidence to convince him, yet the jury was driven by the public and the pressures of the press. How can we judge as a nation? From where we are, how could we possibly guess? As long as there was complete evidence and there was no reasonable doubt, Chamberlain should be innocent. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " That's actually a dingo-eyers rock that took the baby Azaria to the lucky night. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a man who was totally annoyed by Chamberlain's payment, he showed Australia a rather overwhelming light! Co-written by Robert Caswell, his scenes shook aloud with a loud whispering shouting loudly. <br /> <br /> Wonderful Merrill Strip gives extraordinary performance to the most horrible act accused women. He was firmly convinced of his life that the little Australian who was ready to stand against these accusations and set the world straight. Even its pronunciation is almost, but quite, spot. That is a very good effort by trade master. Sam is just as good as Neil Strip, but the first faithful but then discouraged Michael is not able to understand who is separating his world, and he begins to question his Christianity. He's like a strip, a great mental power that will move you deeper. Caste is the best supporting actress and actress in some parts of Australia, and it is also excellent. <br /> <br /> Technically the film is also bright, Photography director Ian Becker has captured this great terrain (especially Rock). Editor Jill Bilkak holds the whole movie and is very emotionally charged, when Bruce Samanton is not saying one. <br /> <br /> It must be seen for all the Asians, if you want a miraculous look at Mirror, we were like a family that just wanted justice in the context of justice and knew the truth. Michael Chamberlain said: "I do not think anyone understands innocent ... to innocent people ..... <br /> <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - video <br /> <br / Even in the 1980s, Frances Schiziery has been brought back to Fred Schiesisier's account of the failure of the Chamberlain's defeat in the murder of Children Azoria. Brian's novel transferred to the screen and says with simplicity that the horror story Bicycle and Lyndy Chamberlain have been badly mistaken, within a few minutes of submerging a newborn daughter Aasiya with a dingo in a family tent. <br /> <br /> Lindi was charged with the murder of her baby in the media speculation and miscreant public, and Michael was charged as an accused after the charge, which was followed It was a bit more than the trial of the media, and according to the Australian people's decision he was released, Lindy was convicted and sent to prison with hard work, although the prosecution could not present anything other than a purpose and circumstantial evidence. <br /> <br /> Meryl Strip topped the accused women who fought Australia to prove her innocence. He's really awesome, and the only thing that's his failure is the true blue Australian accent, though he's making the sound of his throats better. You might be surprised why the leading Australian actress did not play the role, but star power is probably the answer. Along with Merrill, equally impressive Sam Neill, who is outstanding in separating his world from the eyes of a husband, is outstanding as a husband, though he feels powerless about doing something about it. Editing from Jill Bilkak very quickly, Ian Baker's rock and other nasty position artists are apparently brilliant and perfect for Bruce Samantan's music section. Certainly for all honest Australians, certainly. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
