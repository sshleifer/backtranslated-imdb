Melvin Douglas once again gave a smooth performance that, at this time, he plays a detective who can not establish love before duty and courage, and warm-hearted young man Joan Blundell (who is, as far away as being illiterate, recommended as a critic), his early life Wrote a novel about it) is enjoyable just like its forever suffering. It's almost sculble comedy, almost a thin man-type movie, almost a series, I guess, it did not make it in most cases. A series. It can not reach most classic status, but it's a delicate, fast-moving script for 85 minutes, subtle character actor and direction that keeps it fast all the time, so that you do not often see Williams. While identifying it (Douglas) is not exactly Columbo. I wanted more films like this.
