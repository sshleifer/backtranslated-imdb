I just saw "human bonding" for a few days and "WOW" people! What a mysterious and almost wonderful film. I liked how Philip went to the music with the speed of each step of the feet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is not good at it because it was so harmful, ironic and ornamented in 1934 as a common actress. He went on ... Bate wanted to be always risky, and when he began to realize that he could be terrible and brave, he thought it right and people loved him. If you are the real lover of the film, then it is amazing to see ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like "a mass of music and fire. It's a old kazoo and some sparklers" or "but you blanche, that chair There! " Or "with all my heart, I love the person I killed!" ... who came from some of his movies, but you can get my drift. She was just so brave, sassy, ​​and exotic with those beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can not believe that it was repeated twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was fantastic ... so calm and lasting, the need for love. I thought he was adorable and everyone did not understand how it all fell for him, but then again, everyone ... without Milldale. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing that I did not like was something common with writing in elementary film. They make such a character so disgusting that it is really incredible that someone really falls in front of them. Performance was fantastic, but Phil was never interested in Milldale in real life. It's just simple ... see it !!
