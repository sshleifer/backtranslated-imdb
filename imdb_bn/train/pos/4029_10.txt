I do not have the word to describe how good this movie is. Just like Amrita Pritam, a talent can write a real picture of party days. The film has been hunting me for a long time. <br /> <br /> Urmila plays the role of her life in this movie. He played the role of Purus and Manoj Vajpayee's role was not less like Rashid. It is difficult to imagine someone else playing the role of thick and rays. Punjabi dress looked so natural in Urmila and Manoj looked like natural Punjabi Musalman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Priyaan Chatterjee worked well as Triloki <br /> <br /> Some scenes can not come out of your mind. When thick first meets Lazio, it tears in your eyes. Climax is just killer. I had a sad last hope but thankful, the last was surprising. <br /> <br /> This image is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-Az-Azam, Banar etc. Will not be missed.
