18 was the same as the director: tell the story of Paris's love story. Naturally, some of them have become better than others, but the whole mosaic is quite charming - as well, if the same perspective of love for them all is not annoying? Here's how I rank them (which may change in second view): <br /> <br /> 1. "Quartier Latin" by Gerard Depardie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Diverse and delightful. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel", by Sylvain Citt | <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Tuliors" by Ethan and Joel Coenier, <br /> <br /> Coin Brothers + Steve Bessemy = ridiculous <br /> <br /> 4. "Park Monsau", achievement by Alfonso Cuoran ("You Tu Mama Tambin", "Men's Children"). Nick Nolt and Ludwig Sagniaria (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. By Oliver Schmitz, "Place des FÃªtes", achievement. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touch); <br /> <br /> 6. "14th Arrangement", Alexander Penney ("Selection", "About Schmidt") A wonderful look here on the sad side of life, achievement. Undertaken actress Margo Martindale (mother of Hillary Swink "Million Dollar Baby") as a lonely, middle-aged American woman on holiday; <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubber Saint-Denis", Tom Tikawar ("Run Lola Run") works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and the blind guy (Melchior Baselon), who falls in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Pair-Lautage", Wes Craven, credits. Emily Montimer and Rufus Selel (Plus Alexander Pine as an Amazing Came ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9 Walter Salis and Daniela Thomas's "Lone Do 16cm" (easy but portrayed Brazilian director, actress Catalina Sannino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), "Quartier desEfinance Rughes", a tragic story achievement. Always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. The achievement of Gass Van Sant, "Le Marais" Gaspar Ulli, Ilyas McConnell and Marianne Faththul (easy, but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine", by Vincenzo Natali, credits. Eliass Wood and Olga Curilenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quis de sign", by the gurunder moon; <br /> <br /> 14. Nobahiro Shua, credits "Place des Victors" Juliet Binoch and Will Duffo; <br /> <br /> 15. Isabelle Coexate (underlying "Imagine my life without my life") "Bastille", achievement. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castelito, Xavier Camar and Leonore Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigle", Richard Lagragens, credits. Bob Hoskkin and Fanny Arthur; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre", with Bruno Padlades, and <br /> 18. "Port de culprit" by Christopher Doyle, known as the creator of Berbet Schroeder (mostly known as "Berfley", "Fortune of Reversal" and "Single White Mummy"). <br /> <br /> I can classify some categories as bright and mean as others (or even slightly annoying), but their single plain is bad. Overall, I pay an 8.5 / 10 "Paris, J.T.I.M." and recommend this for: a beautiful mosaic between love and other things.
