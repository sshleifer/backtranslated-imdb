This movie is awesome on so many levels ... and there is no level between them that they wanted to be great. <br /> <br /> Just remember: when you see the dead Sean and others in the latest zombie movie ... they are good or bad ... they use this formula. This makes the zombie movie so great. It makes it even better than the story behind <br /> <br /> and movie. A simple web search will give you what you need to know. <br /> <br /> Everything is, it is not lasting. There is no point where you think yourself "Come on, stay with it" ... it runs fast and the corners nicely. This sporty, little Italian number of Zumby Fleiscus. <br /> <br /> So terrible, it's wonderful! If your tongue spends a lot of time on your neck ... rent it, buy it, love it. <br /> <br /> As a great quarterly note: If you look at it in DVD, you notice that the sound effects on the music screen below the music screen are ... well ... because that's the song that was taken directly from the trailer ... which is probably the only print print of the music that still exists in the long loop.
