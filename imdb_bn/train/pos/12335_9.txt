Warning: There is a spoiler. Corny intrigue and terrible acting in many cases. Fantanan is a great, but Ivy's husband, especially Richard, and some other woods. Lying on the bed, the toxic sadness of the surgery, in every hairstyle. Still the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful. The book is more believable than most of its era. Throwing Joan Fontaine toxic (and an adulterous woman, which was very frustrating - I'm not kidding kids) was a great stroke. He just switched his usual Joan Fontainey. The assassins were supposed to have died by the fall of "the highest feet through the floor of an empty space".
