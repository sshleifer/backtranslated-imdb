McConaughey in a horror / thriller? I had to see this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not say much more than the whole movie, without forgiveness. Just know that if you decide to see it, then be very surprised. <br /> <br /> All the main players are very good. Bill Paxton has done a great job to guide these kids, and his performance is amazing. McConnie's performance is completely firm and perfectly fits the bill. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges you to think. Dad is crazy? Have a God? Does Demons exist? You must go to a wrong way far And what is the "right"? I still wonder. <br /> <br /> And thus I recommend "Freelity". 7/10 and this is a movie that demands and second, even third, to be eligible.
