I did not believe in the IMDB 5.6 rating at the time of writing this review, and I think I want to do something to promote the memorable part of the comedy as much as possible. Importantly, to get a rating so low, mentioning those who have voted very rarely, there must be very limited sense of humor. You do not like ridiculous flicks, do not see them! Awesome humor, telling a very good story and the extraordinary speed given by multiple moving gags, this movie has chosen the way to collect my DVD. And this is based on our favorite organized crime movies and here and of course, without mentioning the visible distance using "Clean Deals" and "Clich√©s". <br /> <br /> I have shown this film to many people and it is being launched without any specific expectation (without showing any comedy) - the state of your mind is in my opinion to see a movie - they all liked it. It's good, it's not long to see, and there is absolutely no slow motion in the evolution of the story, which I think is really simple. Sure it's not perfect, some gags become a bit smaller, but no film is perfect, especially when you consider your opinion. That's why I gave this movie 9 rating out of 10. This picture is my opinion strange but in the fantasy comedy, the pioneer like "Top Secret" and "Spacesballs" Nowadays more and more unreasonable, when thinking and cutting down the wise side. Sometimes gags require more culture, many people imagine correctly understanding, if it is. As a final word, I want to say: Look for yourself, do not follow the average Joe's words, and if you do not like it, you know the truth that it was not good for your taste, but it is unlikely in my opinion.
