The most sound of the polymorphine sounds like lechemose and sensitive womb, which you can never find, but it is really much better than your expectations. The arrogance of the plot can easily set the voice for the whole film, but in reality it is a charming movie in other categories. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking then a parrot of the poles. Buying for a small girl with lecture problems, Poly becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He also sat on his shoulder during lecture therapy, and finally he became an intelligent speaker. However, Poly sent to a little mother and she spent the rest of the effort to move from NYC to LA to rejoin her. <br /> <br /> Why is this awful word? Is the film relatively successful? Firstly, it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. The second (and more importantly) has the courage to embrace his playful determination, and without actually thinking too much about the obvious flaws in the story, he actually tells a running, often funny story. Thirdly, it has a number of surprisingly strong performance, including an impressive joke of J. Moher, a kind of old lady to Gane Rowlands, and Chechen Marin (yes, dop-smoking Chechen Marine!) As a musical immigrant. This can not be a classic, but it is a good entertainment for all the kids of the family.
