Very exciting thriller set in urban city urban chaos, Brazilian urbania biggest and rogue third world nightmare. To make it easier for those interested in filming this curiosity and genuine film, it features the character of "Amoros Perez" in Mexico, which is not far away from Max Caddy from Cape Fears, although it does not, by no means, a psychopath A film The construction partners of two construction partners (Alexander Borges and Marco Ricca) give Hitman Anisio (Miklos) to kick off their third partner (and most share holders). The city is blamed for the murder, but the things start to look very scary when the nightmare of the wicked and stylish walks decides that she always wants to be close to the nervous partners in crime, not only the criminal, but also the more rigid social codes that Brazilian society is up to. Aynsho transforms poverty into an attitude and she wants. Often completely full-fledged, vintage performers, especially the first time actors (and members of the classic Brazilian pop band 'Titas'), Paolo Mickels, Dagels, and Bultos, with his beautiful funny social terrorism. <br /> <br /> I saw the image in Brasilia Film Festival in November 2001. It has been very good since then in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendon√ßa Filho
