No hidden agenda. Pure Scifi All fun <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and were very scared. I was a child :) <br /> <br /> I saw that the original could be appreciated and forgotten than the new one. Movie movie Steve Mac Quinn (Bullett) is the original movie, any good and only version can be seen. <br /> <br /> The production date of the movie has been done, but the FX time test-up used to create the phone. I was sure that the thing itself was running spontaneously. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Jafaad
