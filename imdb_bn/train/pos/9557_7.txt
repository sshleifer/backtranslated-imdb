I love this anime! I was laughing my head with disappointment and jealousy (mostly from Akon Rama's reluctant but short-term "fianc√©"), but it is so disappointing, but Rama is able to do her best to correct her. The main character, Ranma Chin, is cursed only to know that Jusenkkyi is studying in spring to become a cold-watered girl. Since then one of the pure chaos after each other. Kunda and Kodakir's fragile brothers and sisters are both in the outdoors, shampoo, perverted hapsoosi cause problems for our hero / heroine. But it is Rammah's selfish father, Zenma who is most often accused of fraud. If anyone would like an animation fun, this one. It's cuter and well with the Japanese dab.
