One of these critics and fans of Kurosawa tend to get obnoxious, but I was wondering about it. This is a great epic of Tokyo's poorest character, who literally lives in a city made of rubbish. Although it is similar to an atom bomb, the film has a kind of cool beauty for technicolor's glorious use. The title comes from the word made by the crazy young man, who runs a fictional trolley through slums. All the letters were wonderful and engrossing all the stories, but perhaps the most tragic worries of a lost car resident people and his youngest son. While not looking for food, they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house. A mentally moving and beautiful film.
