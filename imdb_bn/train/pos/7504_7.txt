Hey, I'm really in this movie! I saw even a few years ago and I did not know it was on this site until I was so surprised! I played Pete, the main character's son. It was a great experience and I liked it every minute. During the filming, they would have to stay in two places, so they used to treat my two sisters as double! When I press the radio button in the car, the finger is not mine. I still work and do some TV, but not as much. Oh, and if you want to prove you're my first name at the top of the scroll. Review: I thought the movie is okay but if I'm not in it, it will not be my favorite. I thought the acting was really good, but the story line was only so.
