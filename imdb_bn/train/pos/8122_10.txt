I have never seen this movie until I bought the tapes last year. I was enthralled and entertaining. It's a book or screen, I have all the elements of love to see a Sci-Fi story. There are social comments, speculations, and a good story. <br /> <br /> In the 'Remote Future of the 60s and 70s', there is something weird and funny to see in the 1936 scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> I would see it a must, and think only for sci-fiers.
