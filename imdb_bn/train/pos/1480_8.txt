I'm now looking at the cosmo in front of the TV. It is changing, it is evolving or good ... devolving. Two heroes started with a courier wedding where it is reported on their love story. After that everything changes, a child is born and the rest usually happen in the couple. This is not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple and generally the center of the film. It does not want us to show something special, nothing new, it's just a natural love story, a couple's story, and being different, it gets separated from the rest. It's a flashing movie, everything is small, every scene is just a few seconds long. This is a reported story, much is known because friends and parents talk about them and their opinion creates central, opinional stories and destroys it. This is a common story of a couple that I said, but it is not boring, it should be shown only a couple, everything should be known, but I am sure every one of you wants to know what's going on, so do not forget to look at the end!
