It is refreshing to see a movie that you think will be almost as happy as almost every American movie, and then be surprised when it does not happen. I like the next guy as happy until the end, but sometimes it is better to portray things more realistic, and I thought the Brocadown palace was very good. <br /> <br /> In the end, basically sacrificing himself to a friend with a friend, then frees her previous poor behavior which took them to the first position, was very dynamic. I used to work without the last line, which proved that he did not really acknowledge that he had done the work he did, because the film made a movie about friendship between two girls and less about crime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very realistic, very impressive <br /> <br /> <br / > 10.
