I am a sucker for films like this. Let that film back you and revitalize your childhood. I grew up now and have great responsibilities like mortgages, kids, dogs, wives and others. I enjoy my life but it is not innocent and unreasonable as I was at the age of twelve. Mike Binder's Indian Samar knows this and searches it for twelve years. This will bring you back to a time when life is simple and even more fun. It brings you important things as you become worried about your first kiss and you are surprised that you can finish the Camp Marathon. Indian summer is a fantastic movie and it should be seen at least once a year so that you can sit back and laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> The movie star Kevin Pollock, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (named after some) came back to their camp as a childhood friend, their former head camp councilor Aik Law. Uncle Lou played perfectly by Allan Arkin. He is the leader of the group who is the leader of the group. He knows all and involves anyone who understands the true spirit and simple things in life of a father figure. She has spent a lot of time with today's kids, who are walking on the walks of a huge beauty like tobacco. It is a camp that moves through the camp, changing the color of the colors God has given and the eyes as far as the eyes are visible. Uncle Lou turns to the old age and his former campers camp and ask them to take one of them to the camp. When they are all together again, we see their test and adolescents and perhaps a new love for them. <br /> <br /> Since adults return to the camp, they do not have to do the work before as they usually play again as the camps replay the kids again. They are toilet paper to stalls, toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on. All this is done ridiculously and with actors like Pollack and Paxton, it's all very fun things to do. <br /> <br /> But beyond Hilarity, we can explore some very real adult emotions that can make things real. Among my favorite scenes Kevin Pollock and Elizabeth Parkinson are watching a bay where they went to canoeing like kids. Pollock can not see how small it is and Parkinson finally tells him that the bay is not small, they grow up. It's not point point hammer, but it's subtly. We're all grown up, we're all going forward, and unfortunately we can not live just like we could live 20 years ago. Some changes, the more they are the same. Indian summer is a character driven film and it is well-written by Mike Binder, who was actually present at Camp Chimpanzee Tobacco (such as Sam Raimi, who played Stick in the film), and it was his feelings and his experience by burning the film Bright memories. There are many touches in the scene and there are many more fun. Both perfect. <br /> <br /> I love this picture. I love everything about it and it's a true hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
