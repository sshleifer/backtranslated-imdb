This is an amazingly interesting meditation on the nature of repentance as a way to paranoia. There are a lot of things going on in the 74 minute run time, but it works. Scares do not jump-cut scares that seem to fade away in the very subtle, recent Asian horror films. The "scare" set-up is similar to the annoying moments in the "Uninvited" (archived by Inyong Shiktak, Su-Lyon Lee), but it is not nearly the same amount. The film works a great part in enriching a classic ghost story with something more unusual and something psychic. It's not perfect, but it's what it's supposed to do. If you get a chance I will recommend checking it out.
