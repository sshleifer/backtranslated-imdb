Eight simple rules start as a very entertaining series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessy and his relationship with his children was the best part. <br /> <br /> I always like Kerry on Bridges, Brigitte has already done, Keri is quite unique and I can relate to him in many ways, although I'm not sure his character went to the series later. <br /> <br /> There were simple teenage plots for the early stages of Paul and Cat discipline. Children, though I think, Spark has lost the show as John Ritter dies. I congratulate Cast and Croo to congratulate the successive series of successes, but when he died, I felt what the program did. The entire show for me was based on the guideline of the 'Generic 8 rules of my teenage daughter', it was written by the real man with teenage girls, and the angle of relevance and show was changed without Hennessy's father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When he sees the Great Exemption), however, CJ thinks the show is unnecessary. He felt funny in part but during his arrival I felt the story line was similar to other American comedy series. Bad at all the newcomers, not only the absence of tension and the burning of someone else that works in Kate's school and there is always CJ and Grand Daddy there? I always recommend this shot to friends because it was very strong at the beginning and was very valuable for Paul and Kane, but the best ones were the best.
