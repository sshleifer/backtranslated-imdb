Jackie Chan is considered by many fans of film and martial arts film, as one of the best action stars to satisfy the silver screen and the police story earned his fame as a possible heir to late Bruce Lee. If the so-called bench mark of Lee's greatness is entered in the 70's, it can be said about Police Story and Jackie Chan in 80 seconds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " With the introduction of his status as Fu Talisman, he does not mention his status as a movie career, police stories - a series of the first successful cop films, currently based in Hong Kong, Hong Kong is the current day. <br /> <br /> I have seen many of his efforts - similarly in US-based Rush Hours, Bronze Rumble, The Medianian and The Tocedo - and many of them are overwhelming compared to police stories. In this movie, we saw a low 'submerged' version of Jackie, among whom there was no scope for maximum use of his fighting power, not to mention the sequence of war that a good drunk master, police story name, like this kind of effort. <br /> <br /> The stunts of this movie are awesome and the best in action movies The view of shopping malls is literally a kind and it can be believed: glass flying branches, Chan just jumped with a stick walking like a madman, driving on street roads on the road like crazy, and Chan successfully used all kinds of irregular objects and evil devices Using weapons as a weapon to fight with. <br /> <br /> Known for hurting and breaking every bone of his body and pushing himself on the path of loss, Jackie's firmness is his firmness to show himself as a Stanman man himself, and his reputation as a reliable Kung Fu expert. Especially he is adorned for her. So, he has proven that he is not a tactic and that it comes with coming up with different and clever actions. <br /> <br /> According to the story, there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in the narrative, it makes up with its last-end action and war sequence. For conversations, this is not really a big part of the film - that's why jackie and martial arts films are more interested in action than most fans. <br /> <br /> There is no matte matrix, no cables or CGI, or any form of computer trick involved. What you see is what you get- and what you get with the story of the police is a great Jackie Chan full of epic, action and pulting stunts. This is better than Bronx, Rush Hour and all its other American efforts, more than a mile than the Rumble. <Br> <br /> Police Story is an extraordinary movie and one must definitely recommend to a young Jackie Chan fan, but it is not sure who should see it first.
