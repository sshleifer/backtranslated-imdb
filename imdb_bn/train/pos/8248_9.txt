When you look at the cover of the DVD, you are sure that it is a classical chessy class, a movie created for $ 1000 in a film. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> it's quality material and really good. It's a comedy and a cute at. It is very touching spot, with an excellent spot of kindness. Production quality is very good (it looks great), known to actors, film direction and sets are great. It's amazing. Who thought? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Playing against Kaki-Anne Moss, wife of Jail Cleaver, "Helen Robinson". Billy Connolly grunting is great as a heartfelt zombie "Fido;" Team Blake Nelson ("Mr Theoplis") is a sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy" and nice as a father (check) as Henry Carney and Dylan Baker, "Tommy Robinson," as well as K'sun Ray Young, should not be ignored. In fact, there are probably more lines in the movie than that. <br /> <br /> If I explain the story, then it will be so foolish that some of you will see it. You have to take the word here for people who liked it and it looks very, very beautiful. Although you need a dark sense of humor; A perception is stupid.
