****** Warnings: Sparrows may have *************************************************************** So who is this "mystery man Simply put, a group of mysterious men sub-heroes desperately tries to find the life of their teenager imagination while botching both of their real identity and their super identity. Sobelela (Bill Messi) works during the day to work and lets his wife and children leave the house, when he wanders on the street, looking for the crime to deal with his amazing and unique solo-fighting style. Blue King (Han Azeri) sells silver coins to bridegroom during the day and sell flag tableware at Rangamati villians at night, if her mother is not busy with the latest snipping. Mr. Jersey works in a junkyard to pay his wages, then raises his frustration over his friends at night, friends and friends threatening to catch enemies, and get really angry with everyone (everyone is surprised, so what?). Ben Stirler plays such a life in this character, you can not help him but love him. <br /> <br /> These three people are trying to capture their night's 'glory moment' which they dream of ... being super heroes Of course, it can happen. After the champion city Captain Amazing ... a flying flight or a two-string flying logo with enough corporate logo to stop him, the war criminals, the Super Police Greg Kinnar is trying to bring his fans back to his carrier evening in a wonderful performance like a middle-aged salesman. <br /> <br /> To bring the extra witch back, which again can win the adornment. Casavia Frankenstein, the top Topa at the WAAAAAA, played for reducing the fullness of the Gecefrey Rush. This crazy genius has created 'Psychologist' to reflect champion City's own fury ... and C Within a few hours of release from prison. To stop Frankenstein's bad plan, it only leaves the mysterious man, but with the help of these disco-like disco-boys to protect Brendenstein, three need a little help. <br /> <br /> After admission, and a painful recruitment party, the team was permanently established with the bowler (Zenna Garpholo), who initially got the team's sole talent, his mysterious bowling ball was animated by his retrograde attitude to his late father. Was done; The Invisible Boy (Kyle Mitchell), who claims that someone will disappear when he looks at him; Spline (Paul Reubus), given a strong mysteriously flatulence by a Gypsy; And many underlying spinx (Wes Stoody), who was able to spend half the gun with his mind, after that the rest of the film spat on the Andaman Kingdoms and played extremely well. <br /> <br /> This picture is really a cross-generational romp. Anyone asking for pigeon-hole films in a dry small section is fighting a losing war. It's a superhero genre / parody-comedy set of revelry (and occasionally even more spoiled material), the comic book style gets a good curriculum. But at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. Both once. Although there is no indispensable concept in itself (for example, this film reflects five acts of DC Comic's short-term infirmary), it is completely innovative for big screens. It offers a comic-book world that requires suspension of the mistrust anyway, then requires inevitable wanna-bes-throws - and we all know that if superheroes were real, then these people would be real. If Big Gear flies across New York City, you will see half a dozen news reports about Idiots to kick the underwear regularly. Of course, Soveller fought well, and the Blue King was shaking with great accuracy - super heroes all parts of the world. But do they create genuine super heroes? Just in their mind. <br /> <br /> This movie is a comedy, though a dark. Inevitable, the patents of Super Heronic are trying to indicate the ridiculous nature. One-fishing boats are fired by throwing lots of bits to stop comic giris in the stage. Particularly surprisingly dialogue by Zenen Garfalo with his bowling ball / father. Nevertheless, it is not a comedy in the sense of side-split laugh or forever memorable joke. It mixes a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but it does not really take any initiative in it. <br /> <br /> In fact, the mystery man can make a good film, that's a compelling. The guys who are weak / lame are finally justified and for a brighter moment, they become really heroes; Justice is served; And the film ends with a scene that resurrects reality (as much as possible the reality is that the bowling balls fly as much as possible and the glasses have perfect impersonation). If the audience tries to label the film, then the film can be a great rap. <br /> <br /> Of course, no movie is perfect. Despite having an important role as his conscience, Claire Forlani came to be as bored and directionless as the love interest of Mr. Furias'. Tom Wets crazy inventor Like Helera, she feels distraught by her own line, although in retired women in nursing homes, her open scenes alone are worth seeing. And villians are never more than those who throw guns (a point that is made in the film). Cinematography is sticky and confusing (as it happens in comic books, so it is ridiculous), music sometimes strengthens visualism and special effects do not get completely rested on the rest. However, overall, this picture is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of Comics and Superhero genres to appreciate this film, but it's a fun way to kill a few hours and rest your brain. <br /> <br /> 8/10 in my opinion
