Once, there were different types of movies. These different movies were quite different even though they were different to each of them .... <br /> <br /> It seems obvious at first, but I think I'll point it out during this review because it seems that some people might have forgotten . This is just a fun movie for the haunting fans. That's all. It is not demanding something else or something glorious. Those promises are not as short as anything that it der der as to see the whole picture - literally. Finally, Hollywood produces movies that are shameless vehicles (bodyguard's wife / Whitney Houston 2 example, which reminds spring). <br /> <br /> I first movie as a car for Pavarotti. There are bad things in this world - and bad movies. The singer is gorgeous and fun to choose Arias. The film begins with the death of Ave Martia of Schuurbert and then Leonhavallo. Pav has been singing songs from La Giacomo, Mann Lecott and Turinotot but "left my heart in San Francisco" and the song was nominated for the Oscars and the Golden Globe, "If We Were Love" w / John William's Music and Allan and Marilyn Bergman's Songs - all 3 previous Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad. It was certainly going to be something deep or universally applicable to movie viewers so it was created for Pavarotti. This is a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized in a bad night before the opera years ago. Asked to sing at the same place, New York's "MET", she lost her voice from fear. Doctor Pamela (or Italian, Pa-Maa-lah :), operated by Catherine Harold - gives him a shot to heal his psychological response. He gives him a chance to quarrel with him and he voluntarily accepts it. <br /> <br /> They started a matter, she knew that she married and promised not to fall in love with her and she thinks she should be just another woman. In spite of all, they will fall in love (thus singing, "If we were in love") and with his help, he crossed his fears and returned to MEET where he won. I would not say how it ended, but it is fairly predictable. Which is not always a bad thing. Performance in <br /> <br /> is not bad. Pavarotti (who plays with Jiyogi Finney) is not an actor, so if you look forward to the performance of Spencer Tracy or Tom Hans, you are not Paoroti. He knows that he is not asleep. She is beautiful, charming and charismatic. She is making fun of herself, and if you can make fun of yourself then it is not too bad. A funny line is when he tells Pamela (Harold) that he "thirsty plants, Finney can give you water!" And of course, he says, "I do not want to drink the water of Finney!" Catherine Harold is very sweet and acts as an extraordinary woman who learns to learn a little from this extraordinary person. One of my favorite lines in the movie is: "Life will never have to be a life size." And Eddie Albert who has done his usual good job as a finer manager. There are several "themselves" kaymoos by the original conductor, singer, etc. and it is located in Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like Opera, if you like Paoroti, or if you let yourself go and enjoy a "small fling" to offer in the movie - you can enjoy it for this movie Is. I know I - every time. :) <br /> <br />
