Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of the ACC except the British version, more than that, more than the explanation of the superior and greater life of Ebenezer Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Specially effective when he opposed Bob Berry in his office at the end of the movie. As Scott stood in front of a large window, the sunlight carries a flashing mantle on it; All you can see her silhouette. Scott's voice, promoted by a ponderous boom, is galvanizing the effect ... Many MacLean Brando's APOCALYPSE is now like the first scene. "Hello," actually! <br /> <br /> However, they say that one thing that works for you can work against you. Scott shows such delightful ferocity across the whole, because it is contagious. To bring another way, "before" screws almost "caricature" as "after" as though it should not really be. You can call the "Doctor Smith" effect, since Jonathan Harris used the same procedure as well as the introduction of the role and other heavy weight (simultaneously screen and screen). <br /> <br /> I actually consider myself a liability for Scott's glitch anger. But other "Christmas carols" could be purists. See the film and judge for yourself.
