Just watched the Piedo World Prison at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed it perfectly. Here we present a revival of George Romero's reusable novel, which is broadly pioneered (of course 'broadly and successfully out'), George Romero. But it's a Canadian director and it's a comedy a Canadian film! And, yes, I actually think it's better than 'Shot Dead'. Perfectly credible and perhaps more important, the delightful performance of Dylan Becker, Kerry-Ann Moss and young actor Kay'soon Ray, which I suspect is that we will see much more in the future. However, I must admit that I'm Tim Blake Nelson Neighbors. I enjoyed the delicious counter like Theopoulis, which is primarily an animated version of Victor Van Dort of Corps Bride (or who saw this movie, which would be better just like Corpse Pride?) And, of course, Scott Actor Billy Connolly is his lowest animated, yet the title Plays a slightly deep role as a character. It just seems that he could not achieve this role even if Peter Stormer did not get the promise of Prison Break (as quoted after questioning on Thursday night). I can not help but think that the inspiration from the days of Jubbar 'Bub' of screenwriter's death should be very encouraging. I am not always interested in publishing plot details during any comments, and I will not start now. Returning to a striped, graphical poor Jamaican movie that you can rely on Romero is enough to say. Rather it is a movie that you will constantly get annoyed and though (and I must be careful about carefully) bloodshed and violence, interesting fascinating humor, created by millions of media directors Curry and its co-authors, this is a feature that it's PG-13 It goes a long way toward thinking like it should be rated. I request you to go see this little canuck wax. In the next summer I hope it will buy the DVD.
