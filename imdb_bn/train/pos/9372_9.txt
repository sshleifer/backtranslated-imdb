Red Rock West is one of those rare films, which guides you what will happen next time. Nicolas Cage is wrong for a contract killer because she enters a small town trying to find work. Dennis Hooper is a bad guy and someone plays them well. Look for the short version of country's singer star Diet Yakam. It is mostly a serious drama but there are some light moments. What matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort!
