New York, I Love is a joint work of 11 small films, each segment is running around 10 minutes long. Shorts do not have relations right away but they all have some common, love love. Regarding finding each little love, if it is a couple or only two strangers, there is a rope among them. Among them, Shiite La Bauouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christian, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irfan Khan, Robin Wright Pane, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson, and Anton Yellchin. With such a stellar cast and such an attractive premises, I was expecting an extraordinary film; The problem is that I did not add you to New York. It remains the sum of its parts. Some sections are fun, original and interesting but others are so meaningless (Orlando Bloom / Christina Richie and Ethan Hawk / Magy Q Segment) It's unusual. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. Story-based, it seems that students of some pictures may be together. It says that the film has some great moments, this is part of an old couple, which has been a century by Eli Walach and Claris Lichmann, which walks toward Brooklyn on the occasion of the 67th anniversary. And this is a moment like this which made me as an audience, the film was more consistent, because there is a lot of potential here. However, due to the dissatisfaction with the overall story being over, for me, cinematography and soundtrack preserved everything. The edit was perfect, the way to shoot the film is very impressive and the miraculous soundtrack can not be more suitable. In the end, New York Eye Love sounds like a test movie, and most of the experiences are high and low. It shows in such a way that the film will decide whether to enjoy it or not. It may be appropriate for others time and time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
