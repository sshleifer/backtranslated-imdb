I could not agree less with the rating given in this movie, and I believe it is a sample of how small viewers around the world think. Really ... Have you forgotten that there was an art of cinema before some tycoon tried to entertain it only? This movie is not entertainment, at least it is not easy that you can find movies like Titanic or Gladiators. It's a style, it's different, it's frustrating ... so many of you have hated it: because it does not try to make you happy. It's just a story, I acknowledge a very strange one, but after all, only a weird story. This is not a great story, not even a great film work, but I believe it is not enough to please audiences for the courage of both the author and the director, for the boldness of the 7-star rating value, it is thus worth millions of copies and making big studio even richer . This movie is for me, a European-artistic film made in the United States, and everyone involved in creating it is respectable. Be it for courage, or be it for the unique knowledge of humor.
