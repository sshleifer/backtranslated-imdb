I do not know how IMDB types the review, but I know that it will happen most often on Amazon.com, there is an interesting number of negative reviews for this movie which are similar repeats, some vague talks, almost words like A campaign? Only the IMDB knows. <br /> <br /> For this movie: It's OK. This is a fun, cute and very straightforward movie. <br /> <br /> After working in Brooklyn for more than a decade I lived in Quinn and met relatives in the south bronze. But I found nothing inhuman or exploitation about these kids. Grandma is a strange character? Haha Conversation and plot accept this? Yes, thanks, what they did Are other movies set to LES and Dominican / Puerto Rix kids kids? You betcha Is that not a crime in this movie ?? Will some suggestions (my eyes, astroturf) suggest? Hardly Give flowers to thousands of plastic flowers. <br /> <br /> This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi high. While comparing Scof, we never got it and I originally touched the purpose of this movie and the humility of modesty. <br /> <br /> She said, I want to know backstory behind all this backbiting! :-D
