Definitely a decade of French film, a sharp, atmospheric thriller that rarely uses full-length characters to use words in search of movies. Emannuelle Devos is a truly stunning, multi faceted performance, at times open and at times weak, really confusing and manipulative. Another reason, those who appreciate quality movies should keep their eyes open for the proposition of France.
