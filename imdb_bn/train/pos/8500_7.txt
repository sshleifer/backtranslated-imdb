I was surprised to see rather low scores for this movie. I've seen this picture for just 10 years, and reminded me why I liked it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, kids, when Michael Keaton was a straight comedy guy, and you could get some pleasure in this movie. It's in love like a gentle comedy - Ron Howard - but if it's your thing then you have to test it. <br /> <br /> "Gang Ho" is somewhat dated, because it takes place in the last phase of the pre-global economy, when it still turns to the standard. The country was a business-oriented. It said, it gives a lesson about smile and how people can learn from each other as well. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy without having to remember one. Especially you have really liked the scene, but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but gradual constant flow. It's like an Ivy. Drops And I mean that is a good way.
