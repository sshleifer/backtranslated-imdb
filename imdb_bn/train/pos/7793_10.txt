My brother brought this movie from the merchant's store and I think that it could be such a sister. I think the headline is especially close to me. I can never start a movie with low expectations and feel so perfectly won. I saw the movie twice before returning to my brother's shop. This is impossible how the movie talks to me like this. I was completely caught by Ruby because he tried to choose his way of life. The bad thing about this movie seems to have ended so fast. I could have kept watching for hours. Another negative thing is that I was dissatisfied with everything in Ashley Jude. He is so perfect in this movie. This film is easily all of my top ten favorites at all times.
