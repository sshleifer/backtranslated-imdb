Prior critics note: This film is "Illiterate of science-fiction" adaptation of Eliad's science-fiction. "So whether the references are painful or not, there is no forgiveness, they believe that they have stolen ... even though the PC is done. <br /> <br /> <br /> Great glimpse but very small. Perhaps the writer, director, or studio wanted to come out, but fantastic fantastic fun. The only one that arises is to help in adding her inheritance. <br /> <br /> The remix of a big budget will not be fun, and probably will not screen the screenplay anymore, but it's fun to dream about. DVD release is apparently available, but I do not think it will play in NTSC players. I'm trying to figure out any expert and this way. For now, I live with VHS avatars.
