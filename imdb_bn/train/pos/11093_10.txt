This is a great "small" film. I call "small" because it does not have a hundred guns or dozens of explosions in John Woo. Great performance by Roy Scheider and three "Bad Guys". John Frankenheimer seems to be more fortunate with small productions this day. The film is very easy to see, the story is much more than the washing machine - instead of what is happening around and around, it seems that things like plots density become worse. Wonderful ending, very positive. I've never read Elmore Leonard's book, but it can not be so different from the film because I think I'm watching Elmore Leonard.
