It was seen at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who created it) later took a question and one. <br /> <br /> I believe this was the first time director and Harvie Kettel had all the kundo again taking a risk and going to a body for a written script. <br /> <br /> Of course, the paradiso of the film is memorable, it tells stories to the young director to curb the Cuban revolution. However, do not expect to be a movie about this revolution, it is astonishingly confused with political attitude. Much mention of directors (a great "bicycle thief" respect) and some scary scenes that work with obscenity in the obvious love of film history. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
