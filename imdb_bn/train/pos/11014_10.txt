I saw Clifenker, at first, when the woman (Sarah) was a terrorist at the time of the slip, I thought that it was a terrific scene, because I think that when you see that your body's nerves come to you it fills you with fear and your heart Fast beats I like to see Clifanger, I think Sylvester Stallone is a great actor and I think he would be known to play Rambo and Rocky.
