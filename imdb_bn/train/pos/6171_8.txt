To read the highly respected novel of Rohingya Mrs, who will definitely influence you for this reason, this adaptation of this film is for you. Apart from a minor mistress, Sturla Gunners' feature film debut is the last stage of the book (the last phase). <br /> <br /> For those who did not read your novel, this movie might be a little tricky. This is certainly not a big movie drama story. Instead it has a strong element of reality, but I did not find it any other way. The best way to describe such a long journey for film fans is to say that it is a small size, Hindu version 'Fidler on the Roof'. Instead of Jewish / Russian milk, the playwright Gostad Nobel was a banker in Bombay during the Muslim / Hindi War in 1970. His sick daughter, the eldest son of her personality, a distant friend who is involved in some dirty money, and is forced to face some unexpected problems of her life in an unhealthy neighborhood. The end is not happy, it is not unfortunate, but actually the fact is involved. <br /> <br /> <br /> Such a long Journey is a fine small movie, but if you want to see it, good luck. Unlike the novel, it has received very little releases.
