Although the film has not been seen for almost 20 years, I still feel strongly about its impact and starring. Of course, one Mr. Rooney is indeed impossible in his role as ring-leading "killer". (In reference to another review here - someone other than Oerson Wells had named the name of Mikey Rooney as the greatest movie actor.) I recall Jazz Brassey score and bare black and white photography. Before leaving Lead Toxicity I love Mick's last line. (I think Stringler picked it up for a line of one of their songs - get yourself a firmness.) This is a great movie and a fairly buried movie. Let's get it out! Side note - A recent movie review paper has written a great deal on Don Segel's "Babiffs Nelson", which was played by Mikey Rooney some years ago and "Last Mile". Another wave of Mick's intense and sympathetic performance. Perhaps it is the role of gratitude for the performance of some real final films.
