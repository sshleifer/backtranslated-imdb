I was watching this movie at one of my normal times, which is the real reality at night. Usually the movie does not interest me, I started sleeping and had to run freeze attacks to stay awake. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that since this movie started pacing, what would I have to do, along with the tendency to prolong its character with long-term character. But after a while, I started to get more into the movie, as more about the main character was revealed through his story. In the end, you think that you know her full life. The movie keeps my interest so much that I could not even wake the sun. <br /> <br /> Lincoln is not just the style of conquest, but it has enough play characters to make the movie fun.
