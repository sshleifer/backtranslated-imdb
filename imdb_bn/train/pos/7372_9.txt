"Is not it love song" is a brilliant example of the style of Chase, which many people have an inherent sense of mind. Love between two main characters can be more than brotherhood. I believe that Hiton is in love with Spike, but Spike is very na√Øve to see it. <br /> <br /> I really think these scenes, such as hit back and letter writing, are illustrated. Hitons speak deep close to the spike. How to write Spike on top of her face, how she faces face face and how to take care of her. <br /> <br /> I noticed during the review that when the film was reduced, the reviewer felt the film was not fully understood, because they did not mention the possibility of Hiten being a sexually transmitted spike. I also feel the feeling that some critics did not accept it, when they used the phrase: "Who is Hiton? What is he doing with the spike like a bit?" This person may, however, hit the nail on the head with their comments. Spike shows remarkable signs for ADD, although I do not think this person has understood it, because he is using the word "rotor" as an insulting word in his mind. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. Although it is not for the indifferent There is a lot of character based on the film, after the shooting there is no dialogue between two anti-hero heroes. Stay good as long as you are watching such deep, great movies.
