This movie is one of the ages. First of all, once I have met, I have to say, it has become one of my favorite movies. Why? Easy; Ben Coo Cio (author, director) has put together a true piece of art. Right now 99.9% of movies are fully entertained, director Ben Koksi gives us the truth, gives us the reality, gives us a learning tool to know why it happened. Mainstream media spins and spins, but Ben Koccio is firing in front of face in school, where no other form of any kind has ever been done before, two young men plan to kill his classmate. Although it is definitely graphic and awesome, how can it be? The gloves are closed, the lacquers and the covering of sugar in our media masterminds are gathered and we are taken to a place where we can find the truth about what happened. Sometimes it's not just a screw pill that everyone wants to think about, but sometimes hatred and isolation deeper, more people, we have shown that these guys are us and we also have them. The society has left behind them and its consequences are terrible and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your colleagues. We all have to learn what to learn, thank you for creating this image. Mr. Kochi, I hope you will continue your career in film making.
