Apart from the longest rule (63 years) in British history, Queen Victoria also has two different differences. He was our present queen, who was the greatest British princess of all times, living at the age of 81. At the age of 18, when he came to power as a daughter, British (English or Scottish opposed) was the greatest British ever. And whenever television or movie produces any event or movie about them, they show more interest than older young women in Victoria; Victorian version that is likely to be familiar with modern audiences "Mrs. Brown" Judy Dynch. "The Young Victoria" tries to solve the balance by showing our events about the early years of his reign and the early years of his reign. The former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice shows an extra form, it has a rare difference. <br /> <br /> There are three major levels of this plot. The first one expresses concern about Victoria's mother, Duchess of Kent's plot, due to the influence of her mistress Sir John Cono, who was also very popular with her own daughter who rumored to be her boyfriend. (According to an overwhelming rumor, he and Kent were late or Victorian natural fathers). The second strand reveals Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert and the growing romance in Belgium for influencing the romance of King Leopold of Belgium. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of Sax-Kober's house, where he and Albert were both). The third is among the peculiar episodes of British political history, Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because it was thought that the young queen Hague party and their leader supported the lord. Melbourne, although Higgs historically supported a minor-state government, the princess suddenly turned into a figure. <br /> <br /> Script writer Julian Fellow is known for her conservative outlook and sometimes I may paint her treatment of this political theme, because she stood by the predecessor of the modern conservative party Tories. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as royal and honorable, when Melbourne is shown as terrible and unwelcome to all his dashes and charm, in social reform. Some of these traits may be true, but Fell keeps an eye on the fact that Tory opposed the Reformation Act a few years ago, which ended the corrupt election system of road bars and they were benefited from the unconstitutional dismissal of William IV, a hog administration. <br /> <br /> The text of the genealogical and constitutional history does not always move well on the screen, and is part of its ineligibility. For example, Prince Albert Victorian's life was not as intense as Edward Oxford's efforts and he was not as sharp as he illustrated here by Paul Bettany in Melbourne (during the Fifteenth Century of Victoria's Assembly). King William II, of course, does not like the Dantes of Kent (who was his father-in-law), but there is doubt about whether he could go so far because of Buddhist abuse at the state dinner, as he is looking here. I failed to understand the significance of the scene where Duchess and Kenio tried to force Victoria to sign the "Regency Order"; Desese's constitutional position was clarified by the Regency Act 1830, which is the condition that the age of his daughter would still be a regent, even when he was eighteen years old. Any part of the paper signed by Victoria could not change the provisions of the law. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there is helplessness. In an early scenario, we saw Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to being around Shusbird, a metaphor has become so hackneyed that the whole scenario is "Danger! Caution Yet despite this scene, I have come to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially as the overwhelming connoisseur of Dresse and Mark Strong, designed from Miranda Richardson. It's apparently being shot in a very attractive, rich style, we've come to be associated with British historical drama. Jim Broadbet gives a fun change as King William, though he is sometimes tempted to be at the top. (Although he was not upset at the top of the "Moulin Rouge"). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Blunt is perhaps more interesting than actually realizing Victoria's life, but in her delightful illustrations, the queen and the old lady of popular imagination, the widow of Windsor's black cloth, who was not completely surprised, but firm, convincing and loving young girl. His love for Albert and his happy family life together were the only main reason why the monarchy was able to establish itself in the love of British people. (Apart from George III, the Hanoverian ancestors of Victoria were notorious for married qualities). Blunt and Friend "The Young Victoria" is a sensitive romance and a human drama with an important period of British history. 8/10
