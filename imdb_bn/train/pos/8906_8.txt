Some of the people who watch movies and complain about them for the living are forgetting something: the DVD menu system. When I tell you guys, I saw this recurrence around the main screen 35 times. It was awesome. A cinematic tapestry of cascading brightness that was from me, which was at the very beginning. Multiple times and left! I was hooked. Again, again, again. And over. <br /> <br /> "Dove de Doot, De Do De DeDido." And that's just soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I put one side on the bed, tied with my voice. The rain is flat on the flat roof and tonight is soft and soft. The cat is comfortable and my ankle which crosses between me, is already resting. I pop up the DVD. I was mesmerized. By night. "Dut de Dut, de do de dodado." <br /> <br /> Blob. See it. Steve Quinn, two policemen, and one girl in a dress. Two thumbs up the way!
