Thankfully, I did not know anything about this movie I was interested in tapping on the TV. And then the end of the tape just finished five minutes! <br /> <br /> But I'm happy that I could achieve most of it because it's really a great spy movie. There are normal toy submarines and a bit fog plot, but there are very cool and even brave moments. Considering the production year of 1969, some little lesbian stylus will be raised in the eyebrows. Of course it's no surprise to anyone and those scenes seem to be nicely done. And it's not just two Georgian actresses. <br /> <br /> The gas attack seems to hit the audience very firmly, it does not surprise, and certainly hurt me. Very effective The views of both sides of the opponent also give more depth to the whole story with the usual mystery and action. It's not just a story of a heroic war on a winning party, but it's what's behind the conquest of good and bad. Well, there is an incident of war, mostly bad. <br /> <br /> For fans of musician Enino Michron, it is certainly a must. His work is always nice, but never above top. And I think try to catch more movies with Suzie Kendall. Speak the Frailin! I hope they will soon find it on DVD, so I can get the full movie in my collection and this person will become familiar with this very familiar jewel.
