My roommate bought this documentary and invited me to see with him. He came from China and heard too much about 9/11 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and he wanted to tell me later on the documentary. I feel terrible seeing this documentary, it was like reviving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> But on September 11th I am very grateful to see this documentary that I was sure that we were all where we were and when we were going to do what we were doing, we all could have thought of a few questions: " Why? "," How? "," What's going on? "," Oh, my God! ". Almost all Americans were grateful for brave fireman and police officers, who risked their life to protect others. But I do not think they thought about how they were going. It was not actually considered as a documentary about 9/11, cameramen was only filming a normal day for jobs and they were only two blocks away from the world trade center and everything was found outside and outside. Tape. <br /> <br /> On 11th September, I thought to myself, "OK, police and fire-fighting people will survive". To be honest, I thought it was an accident, I was in my junior year of high school and being changed from gym and being ready to go to my science class. Someone came to the locker room, "Some buildings have bombed New York!", We all dressed up fast and went to our classroom when we saw the first tower burning on TV. Only 15 seconds later, there was a second plane crash at another World Trade Center living on TV and we knew it was not an accident. A few minutes later, we listened to the Pentagon and had a plane to go to Chicago but were shot. So much thought ran through our head and I started thinking "What are the firefighters and the police going to do?" But I thought of their approach, they would know what to do. <br /> <br /> The first tower collapsed, we knew that now many lives have gone, the second tower has crashed, things will never be the same. Those firemen in this documentary showed courage, confusion, and energy, real raw human emotions. They did not know what they could do, they were just as hopeless as the others in the towers. They jumped out of the window and jumped the bodies. And here I was just crying at what I was going on TV. I was surprised with this picture and just wanted to go to New York and tell them how grateful Americans are for helping them all. I know they think they're just doing their job, but they did something else, they were heroes. On 11 September every week after September 11, they knew that there was no survivor, but they continued to pray and hope. God bless their kind and courageous hearts. <br /> <br /> She cried for my roommate and admitted that she was crying for the first time in this attack. He saw the truth about what happened to that sad day. He asked, why? I did not know what I would say, it broke my heart that people might be evil. "It sounds like a ring, but it was a normal day for everyone". Someone expected this to happen. Not only that, the people of the World Trade Center or the Pentagon or the aircrafts that were hijacked were only doing their work, there was an incident happening, or even there for a second pass. They were not killed, they were killed, and those hijackers gave a song in their hearts. Then to celebrate all the people in the Middle East, why do people do this? They celebrate death and lose: Mother, Father, sister, brother, friend, grandfather, cousin, cousin, cousin, etc. Why? <br /> <br /> Thank you for creating this documentary. You really think about the firefightings in Iraq, the police and the soldiers and it is your hope that there are good people in this world. Thanks to all, you are our hero. <br /> <br /> 10/10
