The real fans of the movie will love this real movie. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolls that I call this movie as a star and it's called unreal. Although I do not have backgrounds or come from the playwright's environment, I worked for few years in low income and laboring areas and the acting is very practical and how teenagers behave. I do not know what is the basis of the comments of the film "unrealistically" The dialog is cool <br /> <br /> The low budget production price has not bothered me a bit. I felt the natural light film character improved. The focus was on the storyline and character development completely and Hollywood does not propping or melodrama glitzy. <br /> <br /> I completely bought into the character's motivation and reaction. Acting was trustworthy and impressive for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If you think your good movie is transformer or quick and furious, then leave it. If you enjoy good character-driven plays, see it. <br /> <br /> (negative comments are "trolls"): Click on their name and you will see that most reviews are not just negative reviews.)
