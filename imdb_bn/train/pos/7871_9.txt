The honey stores give all the banned items to touch and the most realistic picture of modern society. Like his previous movie, Ekta and Chandni Bar, one of his directors has been more than impressed. In the next picture, only the hints are searched here and published as a whole. Welding is amazing and someone can see the justice of each scene from many angles. Often, the movie makes you amazed by many incidents. If you begin to guess things, you're most closely finished but the number of views in the many views is missing. It eventually gives a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Actors Kanakya Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni are among others. Dialogue is well written and you think you have lived around some of these people. Still some scenes that remind you of more depth. During the time of saving the background of the songs and the song "Kitan Azib", a very meaningful song by Lata, you feel that you have gone alone in modern society!
