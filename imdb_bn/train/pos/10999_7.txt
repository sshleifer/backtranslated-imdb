This movie is about this scary guy, who has decided to spy on Digicorp, an attractive high-tech company. This scary man, Morgan (Jeremy Northam), displeases her life of the sad city and disagrees with her claim, so she decided to become a spy. He goes to conventions from other hi-tech companies and thinks to find out the plans of all the companies. Instead, Morgan attracted herself as a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and mostly exceeded these two companies, which forced her to be a double agent. How would Morgan get out of this myself? Can he believe the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more important, can Morgan make it alive? How nice! What a nifty movie! I was completely sucked after 15 minutes watching this movie. It's very suspicious and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion as you're doing his best to stay alive. The scene of this terrible shrinkage on the head of Morgan had to stop him in the brain, the scene is scary and frightened. Morgan gradually moves through the transformation of the personality, so long as you do not think about it after the film is over, it is not easily apparently apparently visible. From a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses, he actively turns a man to fight for his life. <br /> <br /> Last, Wow, the last is incredible! Twist is so fun! It left me gasping and cheering like crazy! The best performance, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this picture!
