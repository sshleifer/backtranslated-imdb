When an actor plays an actor, fictional or factual role, it becomes more difficult than playing a role. In a double life, Ronald Coleman himself surrendered herself to an oppressed double personality Anthony John. She kept her character and sincerity in that character. While playing at Othello stage, the expression, behavior, movement and positions of masks clearly showed how Anthony was going. Among the short scenes, Kalmmann played a very good role as a Shakespeare actor, who was part of the film's genre, Othello. Due to the closure of Colman like Ollalo, he is tortured due to suspicions of Desemedomon's loyalty. His character was discontinued with him, and only one can achieve the depth of the realization of the performance of Coleman. It is Jillil and Mr. Spencer Tracy was looking like Hayde, this dual role was even more deep and dirty. Shelly Winters looked very sweet, weak and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie. It is believed that Ronald Coleman preferred his role in this movie and won the Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I will not see this bother again and bored.
