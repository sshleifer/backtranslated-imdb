I think JD will now be considered the "last" entry in the legendary Saga, and it was a very good one, as was most of the time. I liked taking off this signal right after following the Empire Strips, and I appreciate the characterization of Luke Skywalker (as Mark Hamill, as an actor and an actor). After hearing many negative things about Evoze, they were not so bad. I enjoyed exciting cheeses in the woods, and I felt there was a lot of oldest emotions with this chapter. The last (with some new additions, I think?) Successfully turns all the six fantasies into an amazingly wonderful title. I hated the true true story of George W. Lucas, the true star of Warsaw, but I was missing out on learning about this late in life and not going to live in life, I think he made these six films. Completely as a complete entity. Oh, and, wrongly - Carey Fisher looked quite tasty in his skimpy outfit.
