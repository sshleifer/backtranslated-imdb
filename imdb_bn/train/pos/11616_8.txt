I read the only available comment before mine in this film and I want to say first that I have understood the user's view of the person who commented on this film is very good: I can see from an Israeli perspective, think very well that this film touches on very sensitive issues and The slightest description can be important for the audience They are less or less related to the events shown in this movie. What I want to say is that the 'distortion' was shown in a movie festival in Geneva (Festival 'Cinema Taut Acron') in November 2005, where the audience won the awards ('prix de public' in French). What can I do, I like the music of Moor Boujlor's 'Nervous Camera', who, in my opinion, has kept the film's excitement and uncomfortable atmosphere and I think most of the Swiss viewers have praised this movie. This view, though Israeli viewers may seem completely 'malicious' to the audience, but it is not surprising that it comes to the audience, because Switzerland is a country that has never been attacked by a terrorist attack. Viewers in Geneva judge this film with a much more 'isolated' viewpoint. In this interview in Geneva, Mr. Buzgalo said how I am translating into French: "After 50 years of living through these violence here, we can ask ourselves whether it is possible to remain normal, we can sometimes think that rather than living a life Suicide will be easier, we are like the character of my movie, "at the edge of the border." That is why personal detective, In any way, "Voicure" is the happiest character of the film, because he gets lively thanks for this system, he takes advantage of this situation "It is, in fact, the main subject of me and the Swiss public, in my comments, this movie has been mentioned and we are told in the film Do not pay attention to some inconsistencies with the characters, which the previous critics mention with great accuracy and humor Chen. So, different different perspectives, but I think it's great, because it assures me to influence my future movie, which says that it's never a 'unique' form of thinking 'thinking'
