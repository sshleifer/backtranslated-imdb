I really enjoyed the pilot, it was extraordinary I hope that it will be, well not. Patrick Warburton was a riot, although at first I thought I could not stand up to his character. There was little chemistry between him and Meguni, but it is expected that they will make each other more comfortable when the season goes away. Meganie seemed as a star as a co-star for her last show ["Ground for Forward"]. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hodson feel completely new to the whole sitcom scene, but I think they will be better with time. The character of David Spade, my surprise, was not the full focus of this pilot. The way he supplied his line is different from what I have ever seen on any other TV, but I think it's just his style. It works for it. <br /> <br /> I think that couples or even single, all doubts and war are related and can be uncertain about your decisions, about this event. Characters look just like real life, not sugar coating like most shawls. <br /> <br /> I hope all actors give CBS their chance. If given the opportunity and time, this show is likely to be one of the best series of shows.
