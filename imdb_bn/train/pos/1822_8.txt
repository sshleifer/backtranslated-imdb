An unforgettable composition from the creator of Neem and the Secret of the Land of Secrets, it was a very sensitive bit cartoon. I think very well from my childhood, it was fun and sad and very nice. Well it starts a little dark, a dog, who escapes from the pound, and dies by an old friend, ends in heaven and comes back. But when he can make an orphan girl friendship, he becomes sweet. Some scenes were frightened against other cartoons, as was the case with Charlie's dream sequence, but something else was right, and the songs were fair. A memorable role in Bart Reynolds and Dom Deluge, I just love that guy, Ahh And Judas Jr. Barsei revenge of Jaws, God can give rest to his soul, poor girl, he is not worthy of death, but now he is in heaven, all good people go to heaven. Overall it is a very good animated movie, a Don Bloss classic which is enough to keep anime and Disney for shame. Recommended for the whole family. And if this is the original video you have, then you'll find it after the movie, Dom Deluge has a very important and special message that the person will love, Ah!
