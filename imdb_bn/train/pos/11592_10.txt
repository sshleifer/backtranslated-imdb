When this boy saw this 7-year-old film, he is now on a Russian fishing ship and said that he was most admired in this movie, and in this 39 years he has all these films which are The Legend of the Legend, and Eagle. He asked, was it possible for me? I'm sure many things go through his head because he has only 3 hours of daylight and he is in the ship for 3 months and 3 months before the expiry of his contract. Since we have Indian blood, it is related to this film. He will be 47 on January 27 and I would like to get this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for 17 years and we all know that this is one of the most dangerous acts. Can you help me get this movie? Thanks in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Derfiild Beach, FL
