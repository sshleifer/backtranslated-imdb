Richard Attenborough is a director, whose name is '83 'equivalent to the Academy Award winners' Gandhi'. I recently came across 'Cree Freedom', I did not know about any other work, was released in 1987. Although it was not as popular as his Gandhi, but it is not anything more if it is not more and South Africa is still not released from the shackles of apartheid when released. Most of the social issues come out when the incident happens, but I think this time has been released. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the real-life character and events. The book based on the film wrote Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who worked in South Africa until the end of the seventeenth century. It identifies Woods's friendship with Curzmetic black leader Steve Beacon, who is amazingly portrayed by Denzel Washington. I can not imagine a better choice for the role. Washington reveals the presence of a natural charm and screen, which is characterized by the character of Baiko. <br /> <br /> At first, with the spread of black racism in Boko, Woods felt that he could not help him get drawn after seeing him. In his struggle and ideas. The relationship between them became stronger, and Woods and his family realized and became sensitive towards the plight of the people. Represented in the afternoon. <br /> <br /> Finally, tragedy strikes, and Woods will now have to be careful to flee from the south. Africa, with his book, so that he can express it and tell what is happening in the outside world. The second half of the movie will be the story of his South African escape and his house with Terre Haaks. <br /> <br /> There are some delicious laughable dialogues too. An example in court barks and lawyers is an example. <br /> <br /> Do you support violence? Biko: I support a conflict Lawyer: Well, that violence, Mr. Sell ​​it Biko: Not necessarily You and I'm a clash now, but I can not see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments that can bring you back to a terrible country more love. The scene shot by the army forces in protest of children in school is intimate and heartwarming. <br /> <br /> This must be kept in mind. I will advise those who are not familiar with Attenborough's work, take time for this. There are movies that make lots of money. And there are movies that make life. I would like the next day to do.
