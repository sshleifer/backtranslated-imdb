My brother and I have DVD Pokemon 4. We saw it like a couple of times and it was the best. It's not a bad thing to talk about this at a new Pokemon. I have to use it. <br /> <br /> Iron Mascara Murders was very meaningful when Captain Selby with his dark ball. Better Things Ash and Sam managed to take him out of control. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the last achievement, by Kelly-Brat, by Russell Veljukuz. <br /> <br /> <br /> Three previous films and people have always been successful to love that movie.
