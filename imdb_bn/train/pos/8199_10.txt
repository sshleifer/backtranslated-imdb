As the final chapter of the series, The Enforcer (1976) was considered to be the official junior Harry Trilogy. Great Harry is back, old, more shocked than the 1971 classic and great. <br /> <br /> In the past, Wendy Harry killed a psychopath killer, the Vigilant police and experienced terrorists in Vietnam. But now after a new assassin, a murderer who wants to retreat behind him, shoots his attackers down. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the effect gives the Wendy Harry a new meaning and a more bold voice. Kaahan is returning a woman (played by Sandra Lock) in a new murder case, who was brutally raped along with her sister, who has been attacked. Ten years later, he turned out for revenge by gunning down his attackers. Similarly, Kalhan has been under severe pressure due to his high position, since he suddenly encourages a public for a heart attack, among which the people are hunting him. So to allow heat to die in the city, Harry is going to take a vacation in a coastal town, but at the same time, victims of the victim are also attacked in cities as well as cities. Harry's investigation is underway, and murderers have found very similar, since they are sitting in the streets of the murderers. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the sudden impact, with my top ten revenge films, as well as the second best film in the movie Harry, is still much better than both Enforcer and Dead Pool. What was the real power of the sudden Impact of Harry, a bold voice with the entertainment value. <br /> <br /> So you feel lucky, punky?
