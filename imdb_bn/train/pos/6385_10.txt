This movie was great! It was a wonderful imitation of an ancient legend. The animation was a bit weird, but there was nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie with a song. <br /> <br /> Background animation was a witch. It was a different level work for the people of Disney. There were a few small boxes of characters, but it was more than just creating visible beauty and tranquility. The music was largely helpful, but it was suitable for film. It was not necessarily a film that needed to sing for the sake of character. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10
