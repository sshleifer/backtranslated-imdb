This is a great movie, it shows that if our government does not like our government, what other countries would do. The number of Reagan and Bush was not as bad as in South America, but like the United States, there is still no business hateful with other countries. These films prove that American media campaigns. This is exactly what they do in Haiti Aristide. This coup against Chavez did not succeed because Chavez was elected with 90% of the vote. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a political documentary, but if it was a drama, it is a great movie, it is amazing that it is real. <br /> <br /> Another critic is lying when he says "Chavez seizes the airwaves", personal media is always running the Chavez campaign.
