This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really go though movie distance though. Without the plots, I should stand to test that time it would describe as a new Princess Bride Savage favorite. You'll see Robert Denaroo completely different side in this movie! (Only the price of the entry price!) All the elements boldly have romance and good comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents have even done!) Good special effects, can be scary for young people. Happy Birthday Cinema. Some great for escapism <br /> <br /> deserves at a. (Hope this is good at the box office)
