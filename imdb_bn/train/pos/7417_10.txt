This beautiful story of a big boy is coming and learning to love and becoming part of everything left there, it is tragic and moving. It shows a society that is weird to the western world, which we lost with the lost feeling of the family. The story is beautiful, sad, and sometimes fun and funny. It's a feeling of reality that we can not see in western movies anymore. Acting is amazing, as the movie is playing, it often impresses that it is not acting, but a documentary of ordinary people. These brilliant instructions and films made. <br /> <br /> This director wants to see more movies.
