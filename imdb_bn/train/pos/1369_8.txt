I like this movie, and I'm one of the old people, who can not enjoy it, or think so. No, this movie is not deep - who care? This type of movie is not there. But weird, there is a message in it. We may all be possible whatever we have. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great in this movie. I always have to bear some resemblance that he faces Katharine Hepburn. So, it's great to see that both Happburn and Pozzy have made films about the library (The Hoppern's desk set). All the librarians, especially those who have a sense of humor, can see the party girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8. This is not a great movie by any film quality, although it has some nice shots. But it is incredibly charming and entertaining.
