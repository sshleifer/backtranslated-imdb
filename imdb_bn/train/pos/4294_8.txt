Viewers did not have dry eyes in the afternoon after showing this gem of a movie in the house by selling this year as a part of the Hamburger Film Festival. And tears smile. There was no other way to say that this picture was light. It was not a boring bit in it, I laughs with her and the other three lovers of French cinema with me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If a call for the situation requires a great shoes and serious. Performance was of course completely above, but what this story needs and what it was so well done. I was great at the same time as Charlotte Gainsberg, I love seeing a lot of things, and Mao was very strong performance. The sister can characterally have more details in the character, but there is nothing else to do except that. I was very good at seeing this picture when Hamburg was sinking out of the rain and I hope this kind of movie from France will be released regularly in Germany. But distributors do not understand the country that the French make good films. I can not wait to find at least one DVD that provides subtitles (hello australia? Please?) Because this movie needs more time in my house!
