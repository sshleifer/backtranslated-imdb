At one stage, this film can bring out the baby in us which just wants to create sandwiches and make stuff in the air, and to read it down again. Although at a deeper level, it searches for deep desire to reconnect the land. When I said, "When I am alone here, I fully express my feelings." <br /> <br /> I think big and contemporary artist Andy Goldwarthi is one. I mainly known her works by installing her coffee table book and a couple art gallery. But to see his work at speed, he was completely captured by Riedelheimer's lens, it was a revelation. Time was lost, Goldsworthy's creative living, rolling, flying, dissolving, growing, crashed. <br /> <br /> And he's right about that: Time. Creation and destruction process Rise and disappear. Coming out of the void and becoming the universe, and returning back. There's a shamanic quality about her, verging on the rails. You get the feeling, seeing him at work, his industry is the reason for his life, if he does not do it, he will go wherever he dies and die. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, share his vision with Goldsworthy's capable photography media. Otherwise, except for a few clerks and walls, they exist only for one person.
