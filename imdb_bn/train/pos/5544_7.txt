PRC This Moody is the lowest minimum golden goal with a little thriller. One year ago, they did the same thing with "Detroit", which is probably one of the few best-budget movies. <br /> <br /> "Strangler" is a set film that is filled with fog and shade, most of the poverty rows are a technique used to hide or set up studio sets. But here, it works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (known as Ming the Merilis) killed the people involved in his death sentence for the murder of the church around the mare and caused some sympathy from the audience. His final victim is the daughter of Feriman ... He hates his fate not only with those who are related to his fate, but his relatives also with his relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary La Planck has done a normal emulation by someone who is a coma that passes for her acting style. He stops himself to stop the killings, but as glossy to the audience, the miracle sees the greatness of his curse as a symbol of his mission completion and he returns to the next, is somewhat disciplined. If Ulmer (directed by "Detro"), "Strengler", he hangs from the nearest tree and the strange thing will be done. But who is complaining? It is not the attraction which is the main attraction but the horny set, the light and the common mood of the piece. It stands right behind the "detour", as the best hours of the PRC
