A wonderful, unusual movie from Audi Read, My Leopards is a drunk, lonely - heart thriller. This is perfect for Vincent Castle's handsome glowing charisma and it has an amazing performance by Emanuel Deos. A repetitive feature of Deos Audio, which cared for Care Wierd Jean-Pierre Zunate in the same way: Uncommonly beautiful (he referred to as irrelevant to this movie), versatile and subordinate profiles. <br /> <br /> It is often expounded by the definition of his role as Carlia, his officer dog, his colleagues using deafness. Still, if he likes former Casale Castle, he finds an amy exploitation. Everyone struggles through each other's extraordinary talents (theft and lip reading) in their respective circumstances and constitutes an unusual romantic appreciation. Devos / Audiard Carla's deafness and its care, warped with the cute, stylish flyer, manages the internal world. <br /> <br /> In Audiard (2001) Audiard invested his tactics, actions and frames, a real obscure experience that would be a great hit - nine years after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 7/10
