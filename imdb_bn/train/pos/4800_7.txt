I went straight to the studio, with a nice side, sad / happy type drama and some good acting. This I got. What I was hoping was not a fairy tale to judge human existence. For a general story about a 300-mile journey on the law enforcement force, leave it a lint, and make it a tiny bit of human condition. <br /> <br /> If you do not notice it again, see the age of Alvin's people, the reaction of the region he is going through, his reactions to people, the different types of discussions with him (the first is about pregnancy and children, the last one Outside the cemetery). The way the last road is run is curious hunting in this context, because it is narrow and its fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure can be seen as the death, and the miracle of his engine is related to the later life, in which he achieved the desired reconciliation. <br /> <br /> I just hope a few people who branded it a slow sappy melodrama to take time to watch with a more overall attention.
