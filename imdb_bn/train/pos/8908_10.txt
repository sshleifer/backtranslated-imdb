First, I saw "The Blob" at the age of 7 or 8 and seeing it as an adult was incredible experience. Pages can still be written on its effects on horror films. And even with 50's "Thirteenth Fear", more on his social theorem can be written. But this simple little story about interplanetary horror is still a great fine movie if you put it. <br /> <br /> Sure, it seems like sugar in our modern world. But "Blob" sticks the unstable creatures as a band of kids in some really scary moments when adults do not believe in them. In fact, there are even some amazing moments in the world of its candy color. And Steve McQueen has given much more than the stories on paper that the viewers are caught and believed in. <br /> <br /> If you can stop the clutter of your postmodern filter, there is more to fill the eye.
