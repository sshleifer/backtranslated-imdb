"House of Games" is a shameless film, and I see one of the few movies that blurred on the screen by surprise and unexpectedly ending. A few years before I read the review of Roger Ebert, I first saw it in the video, it was announced by the best film of 1987. I was skeptical because it was not known as other films of that year. Boy, I was surprised. It was one of the most intelligent, best-written films. I do not think that the script is mostly working, only on the terms of the plot (which twists and turns and rug out from you when you think you figured it out all Have), but in terms of character development During my second visit, I realized that the drama of Mama was not only successful as a clever film, but contributed to our understanding of the development character of each plot and their motivation. The measurement of the film is especially effective because it is absolutely inevitable. It generates naturally from what we know about the letter, and so it is far more than an arbitrary package. The performance of Lindsay Cruse and Joe Montgennen is also widely added to this film. Apart from Montague, I can not portray any other actor, play Michael's role, and cross his role in the right amount of self-restraint to convey a oppressed criminal mentality. Their work, the extraordinary play of the plush mamas, combined to create the greatest films of the 1980s. It's really a must see.
