Sandler is amazing again ... I've already become a fan of Sandler. This is the story of the most saddest Sandler in the movie. His expression is pretty fantastic. I also click to cry over watching but there are some similar points. The value of evaluating the value before losing the family and being able to say 'I love you' is the most impressive truth of life ... it is difficult, it is real ... and actually a real owner of this success, Binder I think other directors might not give such emotions. <br /> <br /> Chadle and Borogulio are amazing ... Cradle to Chadle is my favorite. Do not expect smiles or a lot of positive environments ... If you are ready to face the reality of life, do not miss this movie.
