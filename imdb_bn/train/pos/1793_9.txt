I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I absolutely love this movie Mother Gammer (Lilah) is due to her father's poor decision to marry a man and not because of real love, where I like about it from the sad moments of mother and daughter. I love this moment because they were so real. At first I was deeply scared because I hope that it will not end Bobby, which was a great cast, but it was not a bad film with a bad meat. But in the middle of the film I felt completely different. You will laugh and you will cry but eventually you will want to see once more in the evening. Believe me when I say it!
