This was the best Muppate movie I've ever seen! I wanted to know that the fantasy top to meet Miss Piggy kids was the cause of pet kids. The song will be on my head forever. Just saying that because the stupid Nicholedon Show Hey Dude song still remains in my head. Sorry, the subject is a little close. But whatever I want is that after the achievement of animals, the animal "goes away! Goodbye! Bye! Bye! Goodbye! Haya Lugo!" That smile me so hard. Play my ending ending in my favorite past. I am surprised that Sesame Street characters popped in the wedding. I'm just glad this movie was very entertaining. I borrowed it from the library, and now I bought it because I can not keep a copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I have announced that I have never seen this great movie! For me, it's even better than Goldman Ember's Austin Powers, which is my favorite movie!
