The film revolves around a person who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The concept behind his art project is to confront a humorous culture. We are naturally in Los Angeles / Orange County. He rides on comics (ko, a, some), rock band, model, blockbuster Hollywood movie, and touches on many other mediums. Finally, he found himself in the arms philosophy set in motion. The film is five years old and rings more truth every day. The best description of post-punk anger I've ever seen. This is one of my top 10 favorite movies.
