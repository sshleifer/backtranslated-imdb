Another fantastic movie from one country, due to the oppression of fundamentalist rule decades, there is no problem creating enthusiastic issues. In this time, Panahi took a different approach with almost a humorous comedy and a respected, non-professional cast mix. Although he got his message being viewed internally as wrong, he did so without needing a heavy story. This is a positive step on a country, especially its people, that the Iranian population is strictly needed. Most sadly it will not be accepted. The Iranian government, disrespectfully, the Iranian government has firmly said that these fine filmmakers are successful only abroad because they are part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After growing through revolution and after being educator's observer, in the last 25 years, the artist and educated became 'invisible', he saw great courage to continue the work there. The actual reality achieved by shooting at the World Cup qualifiers actually moves you to an event. It's really great to shoot it at 35 mm, since most of these will try this project using only the digital format. It looks fantastic. This movie is also used only in his world using non-professional actors. Fine circular all round. After showing many films to show Iran's problems, and pressing these information through the media, we can scatter the people and the government. Reverse this picture. It shows us that they still love the same thing and laughing themselves and the irrational rules of Sharia law may not be very good. Some think Panhei is a feminist filmmaker but I think he is fighting for the most oppressed population in Iran. Young, independent women.
