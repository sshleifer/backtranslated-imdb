"Dar Toading" -The second full-length feature film of the world budget (the first is notorious "Nicomantine") is not a central character or character, but instead of the suicidal act, the theme of the series is the continuation of the theme. Weekdays, it includes a series of pieces of set, each featuring a completely unknown self-reliant. Yes, production quality is low and it is annoying, but in many ways "Dr. Todesking" is highly effective. It sometimes makes you feel more important than pure entertainment. It is not very serious compared to other budget activities, there are some unpleasant images on Tuesday's episode of a dead body and various activities of suicide. The last (Sunday) episode is so sad and painful! - It's amazing if you want my opinion. 10 out of 10 - See this post-modernity shock! The purest annoying industry!
