The latest classic of French New Wave. For the directive, Sinst's Gene Ester was pictured from the simplicity of the first century movie; For the story, Esterch came to the pain of his complicated love life. A lot can be said about this movie - observationally bright; Self indulgently overlong; Sometimes ridiculous; Mentally draining ... etc. Etc. In my opinion, any allegation against this movie can be easily overtaken by its numerous strengths. Not every film student, writer, or just 3 hours of filmmaking is willing to do any film, without any sudden cut, overwhelming music videos, plots twists like a soap opera, and a silent dialogue will make it a point to see this movie. Make everything commendable: Make a memorable film (short, cute, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone, quite simply, perfect on their respective land), and the simple direction (thinkers are a casual observer in the film). This is undoubtedly a film that you have with you.
