For a Danish movie, I want to say, this is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It is in a class of its own, but it is an international possibility. <br /> <br /> There is a big budget, and some actors playing famous dancers and very good players It can be seen by someone who likes bravery and some 'Bhoot' films. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, get excited!
