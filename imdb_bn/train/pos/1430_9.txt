It was playing in our theater in Amsterdam and the movie we wanted to watch was sold, so we went about this issue, it did not know anything other than a documentary about the planet. We were very happy with our misfortune because it was a very powerful film about life and we all share with the rest of the world. In this movie, I have taken the most exciting photography ever seen in a movie and have brought me from the desert to forest land and showed a movie that I have not seen in a movie, TV or book! "Earth" is a movie that every student will see before being witch. I would encourage my nanny to see this picture because we will leave the planet. Photography is so strong and exotic as it is a movie to watch on a theater screen or on a very big television.
