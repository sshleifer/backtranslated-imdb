After reading I went to this movie that it was a drama with a supernatural gift, which was created in a giant by society. I was expecting something completely different from me saying. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I both thought that the film was very romantic (really the leadership of the male was definitely not bad), and enough plot development, action and even humor (it took them up to the third part of the movie, now the movie's full name was full of joy). And to invest in the story. So short: I do not expect, but really a very good surprise. I will definitely buy this movie after the DVD is out.
