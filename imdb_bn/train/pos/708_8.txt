A good movie about Downs Syndrome. A mother has a pair of very sick and the other is good. Mother does not think that she can raise him so she gives him some children, whose 15 children have 11! Mother does not like it, and she thinks she should stay with her family (I agree too), so they take it to court and the family breaks down and they can lose grandfather, never say the makeup of the mother or the girl? I think this movie is good but the plot is known, it is still good and there are some strange smiles!
