I think this film was probably even stronger after its first opening in 1943, although it seems to be very promising and stable nowadays to glorify it. The film was established in 1940 - just before the war in America. Paul Lucas plays very honest and decent heads of his family. He is a German who has fought with the Nazis for seven years and avoids capture. Bate Davis is his very intelligent and long-lasting wife who regularly educates and takes time without childhood. After the movie began, they are crossing the US border from Mexico and for the first time they have become calm for the first time and are going on. <br /> <br /> There was a problem for me that the family was also perfect and very decent - they seem to have a clear positive campaign instead of actual families suffering from their real problems. At this time it was a very great goal, it seems just terrible today. In particular, incredibly weird and highly written conversations used by children are not true. It sounded more like speech of anti-fascism than the voices of real children. They were as very annoying consequences - especially as a little, sometimes, who came to the most littlest one. Regarding true words, only with the exception of Bat Davis and its extended American families, Roman Romanians lived with them (though they had no clear words). <br /> <br /> It is very hard to believe that the super-famous Dashichael Hammett wrote this conversation because it does not seem to be true in life. The story was based on the play by her boyfriend, Lillian Hellman. And, fundamental story ideas and plot are good, but the dialog is sometimes bad. Overall, a movie with an interesting query and a few nice moments ... ... but it's really everything.
