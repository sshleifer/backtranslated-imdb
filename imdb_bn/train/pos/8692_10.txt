I loved watching this I had no idea that I was part of a big series. I was 6 or so on the TV. I thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep interest in it that it was clear that President Bath Bathroom was a piece of toys. It was originally taped on this TV channel when my parents were originally promoted in NBC. Old scum coffee with tape even a few others was commercial. I am planning to return home for some time soon and will try to record the tape on my computer so that those who want a copy can do it. If you want to contact me, I think you can do this by releasing the IMDb site. I will keep you updated and let me know when I have a show in my digital format.
