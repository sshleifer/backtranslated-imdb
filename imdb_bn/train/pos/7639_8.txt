This is not a big film. Acting is not uncommon (some sub-charts are even played evenly), the film is not beautiful in any sense. Really inventive or nothing new If you like big movies, this is not for you. Yet it's a big plus - really big plus on the story. Larry's story works because we know this story from our own life. The girl we did not ask at a date, the test we failed in, the friend of a friend, in all of our history. This movie works, because it touches, it's a great story because it's a small. All of us have life, we all have pardon, and still the message hits: Every life we ​​could have had a negative impact on our lives. For the first time I saw it, I was 15 years old. It was shown in a party at my school. After 16 years, I totally reflect once every time, and whenever I see it, it laughs at me. See it It will be better for you You will be happy with what you have.
