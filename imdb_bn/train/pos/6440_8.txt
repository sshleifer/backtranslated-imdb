I do not see any reviews on IMDB until I am surprised by how good the movie is, or how bad it is. This picture falls into the first division. Every year, I try to see everyone nominated for Best Foreign Film at Oscars, even I know I do not like. The bill "seems like fit" in the bill. The plot is sugar-coated and sensitive and slowly ... for my taste, which runs more towards original, dark and / or brave foreign movies (Michael Hanek, Françoise Ozone, many modern Japanese / Korean movies). Heaven "is not particularly attractive ... it was not released in the United States, so I was sitting to see a VCD found in Singapore," I crossed the list. "After the slow start," It's Is In Heaven "is the rare movie Become where you are inspired by what's happening on the screen. Weak Point: The characters in the film are the pure "stock" characters - the Wild Dreamer, The TA Nay Bulle, The Beatrated Wife, Loose Women Year for Love, Repress Minister ... Thanks, they are basically a favorite group, as well as good writing and good acting. Like the Minister's wife Ingar, Iglesa Olson was nominated for the Oscars, her acting was in English. Powerful points: Music is beautiful, and original songs of music by Gabriela, really dramatic and memorable. Playing Olga is 87 years old.  িনেত্রীর জন্য নজর রাখুন, যিনি নাচের ধাপে পাশাপাশি ছোট মেয়েদের পাশে বসে আছেন! আমি শেষ কথা আলোচনা করব না, কিন্তু আমি বলব যে এটা জ্ঞান করে। তারা চলচ্চিত্রের শেষ ঘন্টার মধ্যে অনেকগুলি আবেগের ঘটনা ঘটছে এবং আপনি নিশ্চিত নন যে তারা কেন ঘটছে। Although some words are not interpreted, it all means when movies come in a fitting day. ***** out of ***** Perhaps the strong Swedish movie I've ever seen.
