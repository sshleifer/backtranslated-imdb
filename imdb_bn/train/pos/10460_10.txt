It was a good movie with a strong message of love and freedom. I like the transition of brother and the family's response to terrible diseases. Well played and well managed If there was an error, I would like to say that this story is usually seen in the family of the sub-continent and their problems again. What about all the cultural backgrounds of all humans? I love watching a movie where all these cultures are shown - in real life. Despite this, the film is more in terms of its values ​​and its understanding that one of its diseases can be closer to its Creator. Love the picture and it brings tears to my eyes
