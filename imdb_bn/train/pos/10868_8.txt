I always like to talk this long and annoying-the head stick static interior full flick, dude, I was wrong. "Election" is a very impressive and thoroughly impressive thriller-drama, taking a deep and realistic view of the source of triad-culture. The characters are constantly running and you will always be an outsider as a spectator, but it is still possible to feel the secret from certain decisions and the ambition of character. In addition, the public has been successful in creating some truly ample images due to Meditation's protected lighting and atmospheric lighting-shadow contrasts. Although there is no such step, yet at the end, it portrays brutally cruel cruelty. Cool movies that deserve more attention, and I've come to the selection of quite a few gloss guitar scores.
