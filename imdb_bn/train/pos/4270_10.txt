Tamo peva Ko Ko the best comedy of all time. Believe me I have seen many movies and comedy but tell me which one you can smile when you see it. But the truth is this humorous humor is special. It is a caratherisic for Serbia. And all the Eastern republics of Yugoslavia know it very well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) can not enjoy it. Destroy things because of subtitle holes. But should try at least !!!! Yes it's weird This is the best flick in Serbian history and the world can not understand it! :-) If you've got a chance to see this one, do not blew okay!
