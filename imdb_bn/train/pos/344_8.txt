Another entry in the "horror of the holiday" section that fills the roof of your local video store. * Spoiler * "The unexpected nerdy teen who took revenge for 'cold' revenge against the kids" The plot will certainly be known who saw it before. And those who've seen it before, will probably see it again; Those who are expecting Engmer Bergman and later will get angry about their lost time, they will avoid it. On the soundtrack, Marilyn Manson and David Boryanz, Dennis Richards and Kathryn Hagel go on as eye catching - go with the flow and enjoy. Oh, and I like the unclear mask.
