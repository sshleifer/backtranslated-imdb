Because of bad reviews and friends have been told that they can not believe how bad it was, I did not see and see this movie in the movie. After watching the DVD, I want to say that I am sorry. I'm not saying it's brilliant, but I'd say it's a good movie. I've enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> If they want to go to a movie and want to be a documentary, then horses are more dense than Ned's helmet. If you read the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures, there is usually a huge difference between these phenomena and myths. I do not think the story of the Ganges has sometimes been distantly depicted with historical truth. Actually what kind of people Ned Kelly was a subject of controversy, and it seems quite sensual. Despite the efforts of the government and some historians, Ned Kelly has become a legend. Myths, stories and stories will talk about what they say and listen to them, they are just like the real personality. Ned Kelly has become such a popular identity because she represents the attitude of Australian culture that does not believe or accepts the authorities. In any society there is no dissatisfaction or challenge, more dangerous than a Busharagar and more dangerous. <br /> <br /> So this historical Kelly gang can not be expected as the right entertainment, I have actually found it an amazingly unencumbered and refreshing movie. It was sentimental and romantic, but with gratitude it was not like sugar anywhere; For my fellow Australians, see 'The LightSurstsman' and you will see what you understand (this is a tragedy that the story was so bad). Perhaps the love relationship business could be abandoned in other areas such as soldiers for more details like shooting. Wickedly, I actually enjoyed the movie because of this, because it will be the story that the story of Need will be given attention. Detailed explanation of the best discoveries by reading different views given by various historians. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Perhaps Nirdi's soul is a little less in this film, because I think it rebelled against the expectations of people and unfortunately missed both targets. Luckily it is a film made for an enjoyable quirk. This was an unexpected kind of movie for me, which I liked Ned. Orlando Bloom's performance has done a lot for the movie - he really added something. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Man from Croc Dundee or Snow River at any time send me to the DVD for Christmas.
