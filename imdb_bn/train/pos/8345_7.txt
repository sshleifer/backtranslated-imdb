I recently saw IQ. And although I'm not a romantic comedy type girl, I think it's just a nice and sweet movie to watch. In my opinion, many movies lack fidelity. When you are watching a movie, you know the feeling and you just feel confused because it is taking something from the story and putting it together like a trash, just like the director did? The story in scientist is a sweet and fun one. They stuck together and they helped to make the team Robin's character smart. I like the story of Love between Teams and Megues because it was easy and while showing love, it shows a good point, "nothing seems to be". I would recommend this for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
