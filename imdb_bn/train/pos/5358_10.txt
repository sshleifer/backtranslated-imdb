This is one of the 80 seconds of my collection, which I always remember. <br /> <br /> Until this day one of Arnold's best and most different movies, and when I saw the first running man, I was so excited to see a movie like this. I just worship all fights and this is really a special movie. Among them are Jesse Ventura, legendary professor Toro Tanaka, Saven-Ol Thorsen, beautiful Maria Kanchita Alonso, Yapat Koto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Junior. In these films, Universal Solar, The Lost World, Rob Cop 2, Pradyator 2 and others were killed. All Arnold fans will love this movie from the beginning to the end, because its action is full, star fills, and it's an Arnold's serum date!
