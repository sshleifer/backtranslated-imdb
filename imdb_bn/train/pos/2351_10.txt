First of all, I want to make it clear that the inability to realize the imagination of the average user is helpless. This show makes it so unique that the Reality creates it. You do not need to know why Nedi can bring people back from the dead, or why it may be only for a minute. Where is the wonder of the horrifying story of childhood, like a skeleton in time. <br /> <br /> I'm saying this is the main reason for refreshing because it is a pole opposite to public television public. Do not leave room for imagination or surprise. <br /> <br /> A little surprised at the television experience. <br /> <br /> My favorite aspect of the Hyper-Reality shows. The 1950's-decade-setting setting, innocent and rare characters, and scenes and physical settings are not accepted as pure reality. <br /> <br /> This show unveils the mask of terrible nature of death, others accept it. While entertaining, other television shows have been made a backwards shelf for this series. It really recovered curiosity, imagination and astonishment on television. <br /> <br /> By pushing the daisies it quickly turns the top of my list.
