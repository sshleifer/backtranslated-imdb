Your hard-core Freddie fan then you might not like it. This nightmare seems to be a mockery of the series. There are not many to see here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But this death scene was very painful. The visual effects were great and were just fine but the back story was excellent. Originally Freddy's story comes in full story. <br /> <br /> I've read the bad reviews for this but actually I have enjoyed it despite the many benefits: <br /> <br /> 1. Elm is a nightmare on the road. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddie's Dead: The Final Nightmare (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Dream Master. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: Children of Dreams (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend if you enjoy the series. This is completely explained to Freddie, but all that is there. Later on, my list was Wesley Cravannes's new nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
