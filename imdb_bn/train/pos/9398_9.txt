This is a wonderful modern-day film. Nairi ... "Excellent" This is interesting, from the beginning to the end. There are some holes here and some confusing parts that poured you into disbelief ... but I did not find anyone who was not caught in this story. The right amount of movie has actions, mysteries, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, it has some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar based soundtrack sports. <br /> <br /> I labeled this crime movie "Silent Film" because it is great and not all characters are good. Even Nicholas Cage is the only supposedly good guy to be played by himself and may have a quick relationship with him. He does end up doing something that is not right, but I'm not looting it by saying Saying, however, the rest of the letters are so bad that they look like Cage! <br /> <br /> "Bad guys", what's better than Dennis Hopper? not so more. At least in the "fragile" section, he is hard to beat. Lara Flein roams for several reasons in Bole. J.T. Walsh gave another wonderful supporting role. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films which has never been publicized, but it should be. You'll enjoy watching this. However, try to say the name of this movie three times faster!
