This image was almost a great fantasy film. Mix of Shakespeare, Pop, Jazz and Ferry stories. The Cinderella theme of this movie was a fantastic twist. Containing a strong cast under the full firm Catalin Turner, everything that was going for this movie was all about it. Everything but production standards I often do not think a movie has a special effect or big budget, but with its top product like it, it stops with the same sensitive standards as everyone else made for the TV movie. Without good cinematography, this image was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
