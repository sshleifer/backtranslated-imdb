I really enjoyed this episode, which got a great surprise, bad reputation seems to have gotten it. From the point of view of a pure, '16 mm temple' is an absolute behavior, excellent dialogue and analysis of character, Sterling is usually. In particular, I've enjoyed the philosophical inconsistency of this novel, dealing with themes of existence and reality, although maintaining its balance with denial, pride, and more psychic things as desired. Based on the reluctance to accept the 'Sixth Millimeter Curve' change, these ideas are a part of how these ideas can separate a person from the remnant of the changing world. This is an excellent example of the cerebral twilight zone; One that explores the mind beyond the world. All of this material is very nicely combined to create an anxious and incredibly interesting idea, like all 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " May Of course how well Sterling considered his character must be absolutely embarrassing. Moreover, Leijen does not seem to have to do with most of his characters, sometimes they are standing around to set aside something, which probably explains why Loopino has taken poor performance from half time. Thanks, Bolsam works well to cover many weak spots, helping to retrieve the show from at least acting perspective. <br /> <br /> As I said before, if you're a fan of classic movies and cerebral science fiction, it should never be as bad as it is sometimes made. As I mentioned above, along with some of the best photography presentations of this episode (it is still surprised to see that the show looks good after fifty years!) And the appropriate set-design is appropriate. Overall, the "Temple of the Sixth Millimeter" is a great episode and, of course, one to remember you.
