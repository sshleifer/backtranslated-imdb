Sunny, D.C. A cocktail waitress in the area, kept lightly, a little slow. He drives an old clunker and rents a small house from a gay male couple. However, he saved the life of a prominent Arab, behind which the officer was under the burden of a bullet. He congratulated the national press on his national comment and his sweet looks. Shrink an opportunity, the presidential partner installed him in the protocol section in the United States. Yet, he hates things repeatedly, but he tries hard and teaches a lot. She even grabs romantic attention to a State Department officer. But, is another terrible plot to involve another Arab man interested in marrying another? A blonde one? Mockery Goldi is beautiful as a picture and the fist is said to be "a fox". Sunny is learning about the United States jungle, very good. She has important issues with honesty and her lack of around her protocol. Probably, the Arab community will be less than thrive with this work, but for those who like to laugh it's a rental today.
