The title of the first film of Joshua Cephele - the mockery of the memorable proportion - is as follows: The impact of the corporation's war <br /> <br /> This image is a traveler (John Cusack) traveling to Turkey (not real country, FYI) the American government 'involved in getting their message' helped the leaders of the Turks He met a reporter (Marisa Tomi) and we all know what will happen to a single person + a hot reporter. Somewhere in this mixture, a pop star named Jonikka Babiah was cast. Yenika is married to one of the most important people of the Turkmen (son of the President), a mistress is made where the tenant has to keep an eye on this star. The image starts with a lull casket at a bar; After more than fifteen seconds, the image hooks you up. It is funny and intriguing in terrorism and politics that you are attacked during the film's running time. The movie has a lot of action in the film with occasional scenes, good dance fights, and excessive scenes of the assassination. Although the story is not deep, its simplicity makes the movie perfect for both ordinary people and film critics. <br /> <br /> The simplicity of the film's final act is very hostile and jumbled. I think it has been very well executed, but the other might disagree, and I understand why. The end of the twist after the twist is over, and like most movies, it's a real hit / miss situation. However, three film writers (Mark Lenner, Jeremy Picasso and John Cusack) have created a realistic and entertaining satire on today's situation abroad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />; Integrity; The film's most vulnerable material does not diminish (which I was scared). Shefelel could produce the film completely: created a brilliant atmosphere, both of which tested the rigorous reality and cartoonism lies. - The opposite of them - as well as the film seems like you see it all. Seftel really lets you get involved in all of the actions and lets you close it completely. No missteps here I hope he has got more directory jobs because he is a director.
