** WARNING - Contains SPOILERS! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to say that I really liked this game. After getting two weeks' notice to my parents, I got it for Christmas. I am that I am happy that <br /> <br /> First off, I want to say that the single player was very good. At the time of a team in London, the first-level game is probably the best, and some bad people have destroyed the daughter of the prime minister for kidnapping. Of course you have to rescue him, and this is a big level, but you probably have to take at least five minutes. The best part, and I think, is the fun part, when you're jet-packed, and people are rapping big Ben. Just decorate the jet-pack's most reliable rocket launcher and push the clock face and the enemy. Pure fun! <br /> <br /> The rest of the level is very good, but quite small. There are four mini-levels that you can unlock and this is one of the reasons for the frustration, only the first two are really fun, and the last two to unlock, kill only 'targets of 25 enemies', I mean,' Mon! We got lots of points to unlock this mission and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> Multi-player, I and some of my friends agree, very good and challenging, if not bot. Halo had no bots but still some fine multi-player games! You can load bad loads, and you can go against each other, and you can set the trap, which is the best way to kill people without seeing their character. Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (odd ones have a bad graphic, but it's not too often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (no comments, just awesome, you can drive in jet-packs and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10 (I'm going back to London level and Istanbul Part 1). <br /> <br /> I give this game: <br /> <br /> <br> There may be some improvement, but it's still good.
