This movie is awesome, but you have to see its cause. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, only the greatest Chase scene of all time. When Eddie fed the team, he left behind the hallway. Eddie hibernates with shocking consequences (like a jerk of a trumpet player, buy a DVD and see it slowly). The best obstacle is to tear the egg balloon into a jac, but one door earns money to slide on the ground. But when he slides, he quickly denies physics (mainly friction); What is the supreme lie behind the door yet? The most straight stairs case in a school, which becomes clear in this air. In fact he would probably die a broken neck. He simply does not deny all the concepts of reality, he created the greatest word of all time in that situation. Go and buy this one. Believe in this scene your price of 6.
