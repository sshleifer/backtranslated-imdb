Nobody looted this piece of work well! Great movie! Era Levin's choice of expert and Christopher Riv's career performance, and best screenplay of Kennen best illustrated, it's just awesome I hope I can catch a staged version somewhere ... maybe someday I will. I hope it will not be very difficult to identify this perfectly included, neglected film because it's 'necessary' for HitKoachian, Agatha-Fail or the great movie lovers. I can not solve or predict immediately in very few films, and the value of second or even third philosophy is valuable, "DeathTrap" gets 9/10 and earns each of its IT returns. We need and deserve more movies like this!
