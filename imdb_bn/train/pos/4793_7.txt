After watching this picture, I think I'm a little more aware about America. David Lynch shock quality is weird for synonymous and curiosity, and in reality these elements are not absent from straight story. But it is in such a light that I am never a witness before Lynch. We start with a normal family living in a quiet life but with the depth of their lives, weirdly, with the array of interesting characters that can not be clear from their role. Especially about fifty years ago, with two WWII senior people who were affected by bar scenes and how it influenced their current life and emotion. If you are looking at heart or Dual Wild, do not see it here. But you are looking for real people with real stories, this is the movie for you.
