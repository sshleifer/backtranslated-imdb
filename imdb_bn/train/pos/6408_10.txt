The best sense of a classic Hollywood biopic section Both Gooding and Diorro give spectacularly impressive performance in two leadership roles, and cast supporting with stand-out performance of Karl Lumbly and Michael Rapport together is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I can choose that the role of Theron was unnecessary and confusing (his performance was not good, that was the film adding two unreasonable scenes for his role.) <<br /> In addition, the characterization, dynamics of the real life story, and the functioning and the unforgettable. The evolution of the main characters and how they experience their animals are characterized by unique performers. Despite the extreme length of the movie, the pansing remains intact. The score is horrible too. <br /> <br /> Is it an expected Hollywood movie? You bet Therefore, Mike leg's addiction should reduce a star, but others can enjoy it at all.
