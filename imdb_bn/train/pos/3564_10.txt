{Probable spoilers are coming ... you have been forewarned.} <br /> <br /> This is one of my most favorite music and movie musical instruments ever! (The other is Dan Yankees Gennon Verden, Tab Hunter and Ray Walton) As we all know, sometimes the lighting of a ceremony (songs are not mentioned) gradually transforms from screen to screen. This is, of course, not sure here. <br /> <br /> Sets are divine, bright and colorful, characters are bigger than life and you can not help them but love them, and Michael Kidd's dancing skills are absolutely stunning. (They're delighted to know using the original Broadway Korean Graf) <br /> <br /> All actors in this photo "bounce the ball" (that is, extraordinary chemistry) for completeness. Frank and Marlon are the most credible and most notorious gambling players in New York's oldest permanent standing floating bad game, who batting in the lowest minutes - such as their fever, if they do not go to 104, penicillin Sweet Simmons sir's role is perfect, though Sarah's role (though it's true, her lyrics pipe is not as exotic as Izabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - Mission dolls with gold hearts and drives are all cure. And at least at least (at least in my list) Miss Vivian Blane revived Miss Broad's role as Miss Adelaide - the lead boxer of the hot box and the dancer who ultimately wants to get involved with Nathan in 14 years of marriage, and wants to get rid of it has made him psychologically cool. <br /> <br /> First off, Stubby Kye and BS K Pulley they reprise their Broadway role as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Beni Southstreet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To make sure that he can do everything in the role of Sky Masters. "LB AA Lady" shows me when I perform her number. Especially enjoyable to hear him "Dad ... I got a sidder in my ear." <br /> <br /> <br /> Simmons is beautiful and pleasant by keeping her face, voice and the role she plays in the way she conducts. Sky (or, at the end, believe him) you are very much loved for him not to win, but to help people overcome gambling, drinking and other sins and live with God. "If I was a Bell," his strategy is nice, at least to say <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is so perfect for Nathan Detroit's role - and here he is Sung some songs that could never have been Sam Leven to Broadway Cast (horror actor, but the chapati tone was deaf ... go to the picture). I really enjoyed adding songs "Adelaide" ... Some people want to sing like I want. Frankie's cool, flashy lack has crossed the film's limit. But most importantly, you want him to marry Adeleide. <br /> <br /> And speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blain's just perfect perfection in this role From his belting accent from "Adelaide's Lawant", he's just awesome. And he is my favorite part of the whole movie. He really makes you think for Adelaide ... especially when he cries again "before me" time. I'm still not convinced whether I still like "Pot M. Pappa" better than "Kitchen and a Pack" ... maybe I like them equally. By any means, they do as well as the ones that "take away your pin." (I'm sad that he has left "Hollandaraj" from the film ...) She does not mention my favorite part of a completely appealing, delightful and complete film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things to do about this movie is their Lingo. It is a mixture of high class and street slang. They never use it "it", "I'll" or "it's." It is always "it is", "I'll" and "that is." Overall, Guy and Dlos are my favorites, one of the movies and songs all the time, and it's time that it may take time to visit it every time. My only complaint? No "marry people today." Now that's a good song.
