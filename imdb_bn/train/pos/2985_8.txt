This film is the complete point of production, one of the first in the movie opera and one of the greatest international color releases, it was more accessible to the public. And doing it so pretty successful. For the story of the love of two young foreign lovers in ancient Egypt, the general public will still sit for more than 40 seconds, 300 pounds, and the word Sopra will not sing the glorious music properly with the voice. Therefore, a visible view of beautiful principals (a small Lauren, Hogan Della Murray and Slinky Miss Maxwell) makes the story more believable, to get a better chance of those who are not familiar with the plot or music. Lovely arias who can not be otherwise. Together, one of the great works of Verdi's wonderful role is one. When I was in junior high school, it seemed to me in mind and it certainly woke up my interest, a form I was not familiar with. I still consider this movie sincerely and it would highly recommend those who appreciate good music than great music. Luciano Dela was a standout like Mera Radem and unfortunately the audience did not appear in any other movie.
