Time has not been the kind of this movie. Once the controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Convitt's best seller, this film now seems to be a mainstream version of your general Spookfest. Touching the horrible touch aside (especially the crazy, at the top end), it's basically a shiny horror film that does not apply to those people who do not care much for the style. In small roles, it is an extraordinary cast (Jos√© Ferar, Ava Gardner, Eli Wahach, Berge's Meridith, Christopher Walken and many more), but some tell me that the producers wanted this expensive cast that the audience should convey that it's your average downward movie (70's) The producers of the disaster film did not have the same idea). I like to see familiar faces, but the story is very stupid, and the film does not seem to be a high-class image, it is directed at the level of exploitation of your average '70 (though not completely bad thing). Still, it's an enjoyable movie, especially for those visitors who enjoy stargazing. As usual, Albert Whitlock's Matt's work is outstanding. Overall, quite entertaining.
