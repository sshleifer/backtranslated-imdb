I do not understand that fans of this movie do not like this movie. It was really a lot of fun. Special effects were surprising. I usually review and agree with IMDB voters, but this is not the time. I waited until I came to the home video which I felt another reason I would not enjoy this film. I believe special effects film needs to be seen on the big screen, but this was not the case again. To me, this film compares the two films released at the same time. Blair Witch and Mummy I think both movies were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. Mummy made money gobs and it was empty empty. People like it for its special effects. Films like Mummy and The Hunting are not rich in character development, they are more like fun rooms. Mimi Hunting's e-ticket had a B-ticket with the exact same analogy.
