Here is a love story that I enjoy watching. And mostly, it is for two reasons. First, it focuses young people, very young people Those who are still in their teens and face love for the first time, or at least they think. We are all in our lives and "people in the moon" have a wonderful reflection on our memories, maybe adding more details and improving us than any of our experiences. The second reason is a love triangle. And I believe that as thirteen, it's the most dramatic. And the story has been developed so well that you believe that the letters can really be in love, or so new to love that they firmly believe that they have come after and after a tragedy, believe it for the rest of their life. <br /> <br /> Cast of "The Man in the Moon" is full of great gifted names. It plays the truly versatile actor Sam Waterstein, capable of playing strict, yet careful and intelligent parents along with the strict district attorneys in this film. There are also Tus Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. At the age of fourteen, you see a young, talented actress and you think the road is about 10 years ago, she won Academy Awards. All cast members excel in performing amazing performances and look like real people with realistic screenplay dialogue in real situations. If it really all happened then. This type of movie that I want to see comes more often. Love story or not I like to watch movies that show everything in reality and in no way terrible or unbelievable.
