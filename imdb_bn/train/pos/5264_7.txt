A musical concert film based on Clay Porter's Broadway memoir, a musical abbreviation. Bob Hope's first credit film is a pleasure! He played in America's Playboy Millionaire on a holiday in Paris. The picture is open with him on the table in the caf√©, telling his friend about this beauty that he can breathe. Suddenly he was few yards away from his spot. He has come so much that his friends burn him and suggest "just show your bank book." But Hope claims he can win by "no" money in less than 30 days! They defeated Polo Poni on this issue and received all his cash and ID. I hope he will be followed, and when they are alone they will not leave any proposal because he does not think he is sincere, unless he will sing, "You do something to me" Cole Porter But he must go away and he is trying to earn money as a tour guide so that he can follow him. But when she shows her another girl around the city, she desperately wants to let her go. He pursued her and kept her and her family in a race track, where she hoped to win enough to reflect her, suppressed her small income from the last nation. He won the winning ticket through a series of events and a large synchronized dance number, and he decided to marry rich or poor. So she won the girl, nation and Bijoya and singing two more songs!
