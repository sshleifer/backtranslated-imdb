An impossible schedule and no budget is said to be made, the film is much better than your expectations, more true for Peter O'Donnell's books and comic strip than the previous two films. You can now read a copy from Titan Books or a monthly Comic Revue. This is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time. The film is not great, but unlike most of the budget movie, it makes the most of what it gets and it keeps your interest in it. In DVD Extras, interview with Quintin Tarantino, which has definitely thrown stones, a gas. Some people blamed Tarinuno for linking his name to the film, but then it would not have been made. He is a Modesty Blaise fan, and a good writer and director is picked. Considering all things, 8 stars are worth it.
