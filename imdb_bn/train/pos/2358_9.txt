Pushing Daisies is just a beautiful elf story, with the aesthetic and romance shades of "Amelie". It's got a nice palette, its shot well thought and detailed, its name and dialogue are scary and very cutesy to be real, great in its imagination, and its romance deep. <br /> <br /> You can not find other sets or shots (with a few exceptions) to the blue, outside the blue in the sky pop. See a wonderful natural and completely satisfied song break from a scene. <BR> <br /> The score is superb, its cast is the most preferred, great music, and two leading romantic stars can not touch each other. Do you need more sexual excitement? (Actually, I wanted to find a way around this, but C'est la vie). <br /> <br /> It's simply a show that is a joy to spend an hour with, and I highly recommend it. Most of the television was not different and I'd like to see more. It got through a crappy week of a flu, as it makes for the company well. <br /> <br /> Get it back!
