This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic feat. From the very beginning, Late Victor Burakov (Stephen Rey) started crying while the child was working in automobil at the body of the corpse, I was hiding in a true real story. It was then an impressive story by Andrei Chicatello, which starring Jeffrey Demman (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and sympathetically that spectators almost start to grieve him, until we think what he is. Psychiatry Dr. Alexander Bukanovski, who starred by Max von Sedore, was absolutely credible in every detail, and the thing that he made while speaking about the war in Soviet Union became very clear by the behavior of local Communist Commander Bondarkoque. Jobs Ackland Although for me, the extraordinary performance Donald came from Sutherland, again proves that he is an outstanding character actor. I was often in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI followed him closely and praised his work. From this film's atmospheric and silent Soviet landscape, from the superlative performances by everyone involved, Lambs in the shade puts silence. <br /> <br /> I rate this image 10
