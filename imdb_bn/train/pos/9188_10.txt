His very bad people did not understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But do not worry! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now people do not realize that Tony's dream is only a dream. This episode is about his preparation for his death. He lost his identity and eventually forgot himself, thus he distinguished all his bonds with this world. You will see what you are saying to the doctor's view, where Tony said she lost her briefcase, which included "her life." They did a great job for the manufacturers to explain their own thoughts about what would happen after they died. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot then you will get a unique thing in this and the next episode, which has great spiritual meaning. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> <br /> <br /> I just did not understand what the beggar's role was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
