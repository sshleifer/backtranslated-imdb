I saw this photo at least 4 times after 84 and I'm still pretty cool to see it. It's a very compelling version of Opera Carmen, a fantastic Flamenco dance, Bare Horn set and, of course, wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This story of Carmen is a story in a story, every parallel to another, twice the sad end. Clearly low Spanish Spanish production, this movie is danced by some of the Spanish Flamenco dancers. At the level of the stage, the brilliant opera music and dancing bout, the story is said to be more powerful. <br /> <br /> This is the best of independent films and probably my most popular foreign film.
