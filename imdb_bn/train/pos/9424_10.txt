For me, this is Eling Studios' most perfect film - as it is the latest and the relevant half century to be released. <br /> <br /> Built-in obsolescence as the 'rise' tactic of economic concepts and sarcasm for commercial needs, it can hardly be up to minutes. And in any other film can the hero that literally wear the plot? <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there is parallel with the Jurassic Park, which is quarreled with the environment, literally rounds up and bites you. But the bright central feeling of Spielberg's book moved away from being fooled about 'children'. Hello <br /> <br /> <br /> Hello in the White suit in man, Alec Guinness is an idealist scientist who comes with a cloth that is never dirty and never wakes up. Suddenly the workers of the North English mill and the capital where he is working, have never been united before protecting his livelihood. <br /> <br /> Ealing, it's a comedy, but it did not need to be done. A vendor complicated interplay (it should be appropriate?) Played well for the sake of it, because one side of one side understands that 'progress' is a threat, and it is disposable and waste which binds the looms. But, yes, it's a comedy - though a particular subject - and the delicious performance among political iron and some good old designer-smile-smile. <br /> <br /> Yet it's satirical taunting that the constant - fantastic and white.
