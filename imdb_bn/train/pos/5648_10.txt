I recently bought the entire American Gothic series in the DVD and it survived in my memory. I was very grateful to be able to see the first time episode that was not the first television. I like the "Ring of Fire" among the stories I have not seen for the first time. <br /> <br /> <br /> As a Caleb, Black Lucas is a fantastic player. I thought Brenda Buck as Selena combs was fantastic in her film. In fact, the whole cast was excellent and talented chemistry with each other. <br /> <br /> It was embarrassing that the series was confused by the network (it combined with the growing group of sensors) because it was really designed to see adult. A mixture of comedy, tragedy, furus, satirical, gothic romance and awful generators, it features the characteristics of bright characters supported by talent level performances. <br /> <br /> The most awesome desire for Satan in me was life. Long Live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most delightful "fallen angel" ever
