I have seen a few sticks from the mystery man in the press and with the general public (for example, I am taking the IMDB vote), but my overall feeling is that mysterious men are more fun than most movies, mostly so-called comedy movies and very close 'cute'. <br /> <br /> Cast Fantastic; Greg Kinneara is excellent, such as Geoffrey Rush and Tom Wets. Kenyar's Limo scene with Ricky Joye is a perfect 'distorted movie star' and she inspires her character to awaken her work with the exact balance of comic book quality and reality. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that the pansing is in little close places, and the scenes must be very flash lips, probably for more damage to the character, but at the end of the day it is a high concept film - what is "little tiger lily"? - And this is to see many great repetitions of this movie.
