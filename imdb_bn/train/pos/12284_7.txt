Why did Jeremy Iran not understand the most annoying utterances, spoken by closed teeth, and the need to express it from behind the back of her throat. Actually it spoiled the film for me, and perhaps it was confused by good performance (very annoying). No other actor or actress seems to be so pronounced, and I've always rated Jeremy Iran as the performer, I can not classify this movie as her best. But the film has hunger for me, as has some other comments, I made the film very interesting and now I want to read the book.
