A nice little picture about the loneliness of this single man. Philip Herrell, like the Heroes of the note, is a collective of Taxi Driver (his stoismism) and Chuncy Gardin (Peter Sellers there), Robert De Niro. He is not the only source to attract single but still opposite sex - in fact, he does not really make any effort! <br /> <br /> She has a stewism and seriousness that never denies the hope of achieving success - her friend Jos√© Garcia is in similar illness as Tisarand, but she bravely attempted to overcome her extended virginity (at the age of 28 she admitted that She has never been sexually). <br /> <br /> Very nice outdoor shots of Paris and rouen, where two software man runs the business. They try to benefit from different nightclubs and places but not all. My theory is that they are trying in the wrong place - they go to a lesser or less 'youth' nightclub; They should try to get older people, more than their own age. <br /> <br /> Hercel is gradually separated and tried to take some effort as a taxi driver, requested his friend / colleague to go and put some. The nightclub pulled a beautiful girl. <br /> <br /> precious to see.
