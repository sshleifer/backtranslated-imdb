This film should not be compared to "The Sting" or other Copper / Hest / Con game. Such a great movie experience is what can be said about relationships, deception and belief. It is a matter of miscellaneous cutting-edge criticism of psychology, since the female playwright is such a narrowness that is easily deceived and works in such a primitive manner at the end. Is Mr Mommat Therapy an Unfortunate Experience? Very, very recommend!
