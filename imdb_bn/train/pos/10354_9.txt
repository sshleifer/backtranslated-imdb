A CRY at the Dark <br /> <br /> Dark A CRY was a film that I expected an unforgettable film, if Merrill would strip and offer a tremendous performance a tremendous performance. Apart from nominating the best actress of the strip, this movie attracts some attention from the big prize pools. It came from the idea that <br /> <br /> I hope a creaking of Dark is such an exciting drama, it is better to be built on each level. If you ask me, it is a acclaimed classic under. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Fred Schepisi (Director) gives a romantic idea of ​​upcoming tragedy that selects a random moment of capturing a family, also Lindy (Strip) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain show attention to their children who care about their happiness. <br /> <br /> Famous Line "A Dingo Take My Baby Baby!" On this day a punchline has become somewhat, the movie does not even come near ridiculous. The real death of Azaiar is terribly imprisoned. It's subtle and realistic, scares the audience and asks questions. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie was held in court streets and focused on ensuring their prescription and courtroom harmoniously in the continuous fight of Chamberlain. Suspect Lindi Murder <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a member of the audience, I invested fully in the plight of Chamberlain ... and when it was actually made to show such a horror by the media, they were really angry and sorrow and sorrow. But simultaneously, media / public opinion is understood. I did not like the media to be sympathetic in any way, but they always had valid reasons to keep their views. <br /> <br /> The final line of the film captures the central element very deep and fully <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, the film is truly the only strip and blue ... and they distribute it in every way. For me, it's one of Marvel Strip's best performance (if not # 1). For those who pronounce different languages ​​(which are very impressive on their own rights), the strip never loses its central heart and soul. I find one of the more subtle performances of this strip, and he hits it from the park. And Neil, an actor who has never influenced me after appealing in the Charitatic and Jurassic Park, is a perfect reflection of the strip's performance. From what I've seen, it's undoubtedly the best work date. He was not recognized by the academy for nominating an academy to meet Strip. Shamefully he plays with each other. <br /> <br /> Most passionate than most movies, and incredibly suspenseful ... Dark A CRY has exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend that the film is known only as Flickr, where Merrill shouted "Dingo took my baby!" Watch the movie and see how much of a cricketer is in Dreck, one line. <br /> <br /> ... a ...
