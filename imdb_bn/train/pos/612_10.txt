This extraordinary film can be made very briefly. After all, comparisons of "Princess Bride" are inevitable, but it is almost unfinished. Although both films combine adult intelligence and humor with a backdrop of a fairy tale, "Stardust" is far different from any imagination / science-fi film. It is a hybrid shrinking of those styles, but its plot and script is so unique that performance, special effects, movies, and scores - finished products are not comparable to what is seen in comparison to anything that is ever seen. Silver screen Secondly, the score is very effective with us pulling stories and fiction into the world, which gets it and shocks the story, when it creates real fear and excitement where magic is believed to be credible. Thirdly, I could not find even the remote difficult film to follow or confuse in any way. In fact, interesting interplay among the three main sub-templates has actually made it more compelling to look at it. Wonderfully casted, and nicely played across the board. This fantasy adventure (with the elements of science) was the best I saw from the "King of Return" (I'm not comparing two). OK, so it's not easy to get rich, but a crude and / or silly and absolute review and a rude PR of the movie does not prevent you from participating in your best times (or even perhaps for a long time) in this summer movie!
