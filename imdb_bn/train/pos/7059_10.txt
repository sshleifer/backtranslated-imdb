I was surprised and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the Web, I thought Cinderell 2 (plus 3) is very intelligent and fun signals for everyone - kids and adults ... like me 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I found this and very informative movie, it shows you the truth and lessons to follow in your heart. I think it's great animation, and the voice was very good at casting; The song performed by Brooke Allison too. Since this picture has been divided into three flashbacks / stories, among my three favorite, when Jack's man has become a man for a day, thanks to Fairy Godmother and his magic.
