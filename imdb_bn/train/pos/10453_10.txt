While traveling on a train through Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Huq) and French Selain (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide to stay together in Austria at night. The next morning, the United States of America and Selin returned to Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite romances, "before sunrise", is actually one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. This is a very simple and real story less budget movie, but chemistry between Ethan Huq and Julie Delli is perfect, and the dialogues are stunning. The aspect is amazing, send feelings of Selin and Jesse to the audience. I completed my review number 1,000 on IMDB, and I chose "Prior sunset" for this significant number because it is a special film for me. I do not understand why this movie was not nominated for the Oscars, such as a great screenplay, direction and performance. Yesterday I saw this movie for the third time or the fourth time, and I still like it. My vote ten <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ants Amarnisher" ("Before sunrise")
