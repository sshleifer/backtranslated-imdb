A great film. Acting - Head prostitute, from doctor to Pavel artist, with very little exception, was wonderful; I think the Sony Rajjan (Mrs. Noble) and Prajak Hirji (Sourav) are the best of the lesser known artists. Even Kushush Debuo (Tehmul), who may be accused of being accused, presented quite credible and known character. <br /> <br /> Another great thing is the camera work - and the bombs hold the power of the road, <br/> <br /> I am quiet of the importance of his prayer and life in small apartments. <br /> <br /> I like the story of the wall which becomes a temple and then breaks - and the artists accept it. <br /> <br /> Looks like good movies in Indian themes.
