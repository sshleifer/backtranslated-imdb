I'm not sure that this comment has a real spoiler, but I'm playing it safe, so if you do not see the movie, do not read it. <br /> <br /> I enjoy this movie and so I work with everyone - and that point. Without acting, I spent a great part of my work life in the film. The people of this type of film are - Gaffar, Puller, On-Air Director, Lighter and Writer, Costume People, etc. And the whole thing has been said from their point of view, at least one great extent. Most of the actors are self-absorbed in the inefficiency and illogicality, which makes this movie so well, but to act with the actors, you must act as the real-life drama of this movie! Possible spoiler alert: In a terrific scene, both actors, both actors, _discussing_ how _discuss_ some of the 'out of off-scripts' completely with some other actresses, and they line up, rehearse them, and criticize each other's performance. <br /> <br /> Since this picture appeared, '91, it has become fashionable especially on TV. But very rarely did it so well.
