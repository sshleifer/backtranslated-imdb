Stargate is the best show ever. Absolutely perfect for the role of all actors. I love connecting between characters. If you do not see this show then I highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star Trek, it can not be completely completed because it is actually completely different. I am a star fan fan but I will definitely rate this star rated any star treks. Unfortunately, I live in New Zealand and we do not get the stargate on TV so if I want to see it, I will have to buy a DVD and season 10 is not there, so I can not see it for quite a while (which is extremely boring). However this program is very very good and one must definitely see, but be warned it is highly addictive. So summery I love Stargate (and Topping Amanda).
