At the middle of the 40s, I was not close to the original population of "Nancy Drew", but I was surprised to see this image this afternoon; So, I used to say that there were 60 silver-haired women below my rows. The elderly man left the theater near me, especially the 20-year-old woman woman (who said she saw and liked the previous movie) praised this picture. <br /> <br /> More points, however: just in front of me, nine were - their count, nine-ten year old girls standing next to each other, popcorn and hot dogs and candy went forward and went outside < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> Start the roll. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie; It does not fully pay her high school subpotts, it is not confident enough at the spontaneous level, and her lips are not too much hair for the critics for a long time. But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respected, the plot holds fairly well and it is extremist in the sin of excessive glasses and excessive modernization. Ultimately, but not least, Emma Roberts is carrying out this film on outward blessings - despite the amazing time of Josh Fleetter, it's Roberts's movie, and closes it nicely. His direct ancestor of Nancy Drew Christian Bale's Veronica Mars, and this film is the linear descendant of Jodie Foster's primary and underrated "Kamelsoo" <br /> <br /> In today's market it is a boring: a family movie that honors the intellectuals of its audience. For example, it will not taste everyone - but for this it's the best movie in the decade.
