The movie that I'm about to review is a small television movie made in 1996 and it's played by Melissa Joan Heart and Daniel Beldwin. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist / opponent Jennifer Stanton (heart) is feeling the pressure of being a regular American teenager controlling father (Beldwin). However, when he met a former voice called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never Kissed"), they became 'fallen' for each other, but there is a different concept of where to take Jennifer's relationship. He used to kill his parents to kill his parents, but he used to get rid of his parents, so he could be with Brad (the future of David Leshar's 'Sabrina' catcher for the heart). Melissa Yoan Heart actually made me wonder about her role as a bad manipulator, and she used to be with her friends and Nick, that the film is well carried out so that she can literally kill and go away. The rest supporting cast works well and the screen time when they each have their own. In the same year, I started making this movie and was released, Heart, Sabrina, Tianz Witch, and these shows can work on the continuation of my film and television. <br /> <br /> Although the film is still somewhat of some of the best works involved in the drama or the thriller and I look forward to seeing the 'Naked Dead' released in November because it shows that she can look like other people "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this picture to anyone as a fan of Melissa Joan Heart or Sabrina. No, so let me test it.
