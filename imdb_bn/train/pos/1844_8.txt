I was not sure that this could be just one of the stupid night soap operas that seem to be frustrating at the initial time but it is seen that it is not a beautiful show (no small thanks for gifted casting). Four female friends with different backgrounds get together and share their love on weekly love life. Hours long programs find love to follow them each by separating them often through screwed up quests and making it without annoying or trite. One of the "trudy" hememaker of Sharon Smal (the widow widow after 11 September) who has been a little publicity and annoying with her friends (who are a little frustrating and more creative in their efforts). He is great among "Inspector Linley Mystery" as t.v. Great to see the small back on. The chick can work. Orla Brady's character (a lawyer, Sivan) is perhaps the most affected, but is still very sympathetic towards women, because she was in love with her, but self-absorbed husband Hari (with Jupiter, previously "Spooks") without her needs, with her child. Cast is the finalist of two finalists (Shelley Con), an event planer who is a wild child who is sleeping with everyone, sex is not specific, and KT, (Sarah Parish) is an inferior doctor and her son related to the patient, her career and control Life outside spiraling has been sent to love. That's saying, I hooked up now and hope the BBC continue to cranking this series because it's good, it's different and it's got a great throw.
