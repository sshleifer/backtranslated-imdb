It's a delightful movie that's so top that my wife, daughter, and I found it irrelevant. The plot is just crazy but "real rings" in the absence of impossible and impossible omissions around sub-all over the world. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed Kevin Kline and Sally Field performance. I'm not someone better than playing the Thickheaded Kline. Real frustration is needed for the character and determination of the character of the field - and reducing its almost hesitant mindset - has played nicely against Field's famous (infamous) background "You Like Me!" Oscar Wonders Those who can accept themselves with such a big salt are very rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only movie where I did not displease myself with the character of Hypie Goldberg; I thought he was "spot" in every note he hit. Robert Donny Jr., Terry Hatcher, Kathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also the first rates. Just a great movie if you are in the mind for the journey and go along!
