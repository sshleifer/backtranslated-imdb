I saw an improved screening for this movie tonight. I absolutely love it. The film keeps me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphy Villain is extremely vague as well. For those of you who watched Batman, his character was much more awesome in this movie. She played her character very well. The horrible "bad guy," I've seen in a while. Rachel McAdam was fantastic. The audience laughs at all, gassed and excited at the same time, as if we were in the cottage. Mysterious events happen through this movie. This amazing part was not the last climate. I was not disappointed at the end. I felt satisfied. Do not judge trailer movies. The movie is much better than directed trailers. Do not wait for this movie to come to the video. Go see it. However, I do not have to pay to see this movie, I would love to see it 1075 please. Enjoy!
