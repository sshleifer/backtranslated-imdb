Wonderful film, one of the greatest horror films of the 70s. She is realistic settings and atmosphere. Normal negative comments as usual were inevitable. I have noticed that one of the most horrible films of the period fails to attain even sufficiency. Obviously since most of the horror movies are old and have to be digitized, it is a psychological process that brings music to the critics' mindset. <br /> <br /> Before you can see what the final verdict was before you read the review 10 is really good because the movie is a good gift. The rain falls very well and the way the film was created reminds me of many kubrick films. She really impressed. Really nice movie I consider years'70 a film texts.
