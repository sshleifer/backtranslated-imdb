This is a holiday I've seen in this fun film. And I really liked it. All the kids are beautiful, who reminds me of my own childhood with those stupid thoughts. This weekend night is a real entertainment movie for a group of families, which can create many memories and smiles. Children's humor is always working. Better acting as well. Simple story but cool shooting. Excellent job for the instructor to find the kids' way. When it comes to baby cinema, I think "12 and holding". This year is another but the world's variations in the world, which are real and cruel. Excellent job. H2EFW focuses on the happy aspects of childhood, which requires each child and family. Note Twitch, I think, from Nimo's voice "Nemo Search"
