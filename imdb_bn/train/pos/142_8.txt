The second part of the hit Danish TV series (actually episode 4-8) is a little less than the first, but there are lots of smiles and fears. During this time, Uddo Curry plays in two parts, such as a demon child and his monster-like father. Other standout parts of this period are the gold palmark doctor Dr. Crogosh, who said. Helmor faced terrible revenge and again, slowly and slowly, he tried to solve the mystery-style mystery gradually. After the death of a cliffman and lead actor Ernst Hugo Zeragard (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Ralphus (Mrs. Drauss), you will be surprised that they will be able to do the third part, but I hope it is a shot from Van Triair. Sadly, Marton rot lepers, Down's Syndrome Dashwasher # 2, died as well. Look for Stellan Skarsg√•rd in a camio. ***
