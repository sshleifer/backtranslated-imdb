I'm a fairly big fan of most movies based on the book of Stephen King - this rate is one of the most awesome and most memorable. <br /> <br /> I've finished reconsidering it in the tenth decade and I still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary. <br /> <br /> Guaranteed collision course with giant trucks where scenes where Gage are. And in the end, the word "no fair" by Miko Hughes is not a touch of brightness. <br /> <br />
