This is a nicely accomplished film that searches for a theme and gives each viewer something different from it. The premises are simple: An unnamed celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) visits a shop and decides to research people for upcoming roles. He took special interest in "10 items or less" Lane (Puja Veg), in which he found an appealing, powerful, and weird presence. <br /> <br /> Both characters play the role of each other cheerfully and bring a solid character in the character of what the characters are researching. Not a conventional character; They represent each whole world. Cashier's life is harsh and frustrating in the "real world", when the actor is so worried about his imaginary existence that he can not do simple things to remember the phone number. He easily acknowledges that he encounters while talking to the people and shows the whole point of research to the real man that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But the actor is not inspired by his work only. ; We see the reverse process as well. Many characters mention her as "her" and how she inspires her role in the movie. <br /> <br /> Cashier's favorite song "Al Pasar La Barca", how does a girl refuse to hide behind beauty? Instead of paying for boat passage (ie: do the good work), the choice could not be well selected. It is parallel to Wig's character, the only store employee with any brain or ambition, who is willing to work hard for success. (It's mostly craving, everyone looks like Paz Waze.) It's a diverse little film, probably a shoe to be made. If you do not think of slowly pacing and "talkie" methods, this movie will be entertained. Characters are completely reversed, and effective acting makes them respectable. A nice watch
