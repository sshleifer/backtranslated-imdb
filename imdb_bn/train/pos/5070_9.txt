Recently I was looking for the newly released Wide Screen DVD of Fly Away Home and brought interesting titles I never heard of: GREW OLL. Richard Attenborough's film attracted my attention (he was responsible for fine films such as Gandhi, Chaplin and Shadowland). I noticed that the script was by William Nicholson (author of Shadowland). This "special edition" interesting words material was full and the price was less than $ 10.00 - so I grabbed it and bought it. How nice! What a beautiful picture In the 1930s Paris was known as a brilliant life, known as Brosnan Arki Gray Ol, who came to love and respect Canada's wild land and worked to protect them. Brosnan (who played James Bond in the film) gives a galaxy, warm, strong performance, as Anne Gallipao also feels like a young woman who loves and influences her feelings for the country's animals - especially Beaver. A fine score by George Fenton (The Crusible) and the beautiful photography of Roger Pratt extensively linked the effectiveness of the film. And this DVD is something extra! The original Gray Oil with two short films and Aspenbero and producer Jack Ebert's audio commentary tracks made in the 1930s 2 features; And many other fine additions to plus options for accessing a PC with DVD-ROM features Grey OWL is released straight from the DVD in the United States - a fact that Richard Attenborough has highlighted the lack of interest in Hollywood's distribution that is not loaded with much violence and sex. It is a movie that not only informs and entertains, but lets you leave it to think about it. I had a very warm feeling in the conclusion of the film - and a whole new love and understanding for the Beaver! GRAY OWL is a very fine film - worth checking out! This is one I'm looking forward to sharing with others.
