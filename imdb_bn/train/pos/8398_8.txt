Realistic romance of young love for college set but appealing to older viewers like me. It has ups and downs and twists and winding and has run me a tear or two. We rarely see movies with black-colored characters that appeal to older, non-black black viewers and young black adults can display more real life pictures. <br /> <br /> This movie is a college campus and a town where two people see and love to read. The influence of different friends in the background and the circumstances affect them for good or bad. Some might say some common stories, but this was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I have transformed myself to live a couple's relationship, saw my own past in their story. Peeping out acting out of deep thoughts and unlocking moments. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant film that I love in my heart and love forever or ever. Awesome movies. I would be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection.
