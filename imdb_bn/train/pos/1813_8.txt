In my case I liked this movie because I saw it when I got more than expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated movies that I think about their themes even after finishing them. It speaks of death for revenge, vengeance and hell in such a way that it gets a punch in your face, and even in the middle of the movie, the dream sequence can also be enjoyed. This movie makes so well: Dawn is capable of blubbering (director), playing with human feelings and hating or hating any of his characters. That is, and it has many good letters like Charlie and Anne-Marie, in the sad but happy end, you have been told that "I have something in my eyes" hide the others you are calling. What I said is just some good aspects of this movie. For the rest, you will see them for them in a film very impressive. Don Bluth, thank you.
