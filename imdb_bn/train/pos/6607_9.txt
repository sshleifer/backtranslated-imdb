I'll give it 10 out of 10. However, some confusing parts, as well as those sections, are also mis-Leading which hit film flow / continuity. The story lines are great and well composed; You definitely want to see this quietly to understand it completely. Characters are complex and so the like line is expected to provide enough information to stop scratching your head, this is a film that has all been explained in the end. Animation is great and femme deadly and film silent combinations are a great film than I have seen in animation. It's a black and white film and its silent darkness in some scenes so it's a good TV, or it's valuable to see in the Plasma. Character voices preserves this film in its English version, but it was more convincing that while French had some French accent to emphasize it, I enjoyed French subtitles more in French. If you buy it on DVD or Bluerai, it's all good! And if you enjoy this picture personally, you may also like; Shell 2 Innocence Walking Life and Ghost, it's just a personal advice.
