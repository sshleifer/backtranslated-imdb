War, Inc. We currently find out the logical extensions of all outsourcing activities related to war fighting between Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are familiar with HalliBurton, Kellogg, Brown and Root and Blackwater foreign antics you are already half home for the full praise of Cusack's latest piece of Humor. Cusack has played a corporate hit-man called the House House, who, while waiting for his latest goal, has found himself in Tunisia by organizing a trade show in the new independent country for his release. There he has been intrigued by anti-establishment reporter operated by Marcia Tomi and followed by a sexually transmitted sex star by Hillary Duff. We've got to know the past of the house, in which there is such a tragedy that has scared him since then and Marshall Dillon, a corporate assistant who is actually doing full work for him (and played laughingly by Joan Cusack). The time you have played properly over a few moments is not the expected moment for you, and the little touches often surprise you. All the principals turned on solid performance Duff's pronunciation comes and goes but otherwise he does a very nice job and goes a long way in spreading his Disney image. Tomie is funny but lowers when Cusack is in almost every scene of his own. To be fair, their good material is given. The author concludes enough to turn the rear on all the way to keep you riggling enough twists and turning a good script with winding and visual gags. Indeed, the last prediction is the only thing that keeps me above its ratings, the story changes and it becomes the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you want your comedy to be broad and physical, perhaps you are not here enough to be interested in the whole movie. On the other hand, if you prefer slam comedy and wide mockery, it's for you.
