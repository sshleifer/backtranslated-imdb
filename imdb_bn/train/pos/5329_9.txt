Good guys were not very good. Black actors playing normal letters than black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Adding a baby incorporates a good touch. Sympathy might have been otherwise a little difficult. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree about acting. It was perfect, very good. I really wanted Judge Reinhold Punch <br /> <br /> And after all, a really good movie's mark, Judge Reinhold does not want to punch?
