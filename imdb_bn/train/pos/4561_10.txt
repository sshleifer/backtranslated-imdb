I saw this picture three times, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and more emotional. <br /> <br /> The acting is extraordinary, it is not difficult to believe because it's Daniel Day Lewis, an amazing actor. Brenda Fricker surprised it, though. He has taken your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy, who can not walk or talk until he is late. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about the movie, but I will stop here. I enjoy that movie based on the actual event or generally enjoy the good drama anyone recommend it.
