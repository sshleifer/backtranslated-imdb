The most seamless so-called "The Great Grand's of the Grand Goginle" of the cinematic sub-generals: Camp Herra movies, which combines Gothic thrills with extreme melodrama and have always played in the Golden Age of Hollywood and almost forgotten actresses. The role unfattering either screeching long suffering victims or bad harpies. This style gave them an extraordinary performance show which removes their staff on the screen again, and has spent their faded pictures from yesterday and won the new generation of fans. <br /> <br /> "What matters to Helen" is the last drop of this sub-series with both stunning performances by Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters, a talent for feeding anxious mothers to two criminal criminals fleeing to Sunny California in California in the 1930s. Forced to open schools Those who want their girls to be the next Shirley Temple. In California, Debie Happiness, Client, Tango, Tap Dance and a new love interest (Dennis Waiver) Shelli has got awesome flashbacks, Mensing anonymous calls, strangers, Smiling Agnes Murhed as a radio campaigner, with a cute little rabbit (!) An unfortunate face with an electric fan (ouch!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wrote, a man who started with "Jane Hoffand to Baby Jane", with Master Director Robert, Aldarik, Joan Crowford and Bate Davis) plot hole, red waterfalls, and fill the incomplete facilities that can make this movie superb: the underlying themes of frivolous maternity (Debbie and Shelley's characters are "failed mothers" and mummy children in the morgue) Goth woman ties (Debbie and Shelley relationship and a few male characters in this film, even frightened or lazy, even Dennis Weaver dream boat Texan) is broken. Instead we are approaching Debbie Reynolds musical instruments and dancers, although the funny thing will take a lot longer to get emotionally involved. But still this movie is very entertaining. Two stars and Curtis Harrington's stylish direction easily crosses his error. The 1930s movie entertainment was a very sophisticated budgeted colorful and elegant (look at the Debian cloth!). The enormous atmosphere of madness and violent abruptity suddenly happens suddenly, which will frustrate you for the day. And you will not easily forget that the movie that you manage the song "Goodie, Goodie" easily. And seeing the growing madness, Shelley Winters, Deby Reynolds, is happy to see the chance of happiness! <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8.
