This is a very nice movie. I like it where Ning meets her ink, and the skeleton lags behind her, but fortunately she knocks them, opens the windows, and even does not target them. Xiao Qian is very nice. And when he torn the needle, he was violent. And when he says love is the greatest thing in the world when standing in two armies very great. Yet the part where he killed many people and killed many people. Then you shouted him in the grave that he fled fleeing the wolf. Love scene romantic, Xiao Qian and ning together look cute. Add comic timing, monster tongue, and you have horror, romance, comedy, all together. Not to mention the super special effects of 90's.
