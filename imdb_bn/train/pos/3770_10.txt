When will people know that some movies have been made to be fun and do not need to change the world? If you realize this, then hope to have fun while watching "Billy's Journey of Bill and Tede". It's a movie that is fun to watch, made a great movie on the Kenyue and the Alex Screen Team, which revives their characters through more 'style' than "Bill and Ted's extraordinary adventure", then they were in 1st movie. It's not rocket science, but it's great for laughing, the characters are very capable and the storyline is so fundamental that you have to laugh. Hope 'deep and meaningful' not just fun!
