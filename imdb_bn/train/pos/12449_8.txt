Eventually there was a good Modesi Blaise movie that was released, which does not say only a story, but actually tells the story of "real". If I hope to have an action thriller, it's a bad movie, but if you stop your track and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that this is a story originally made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story to tell about what Momerti has become a wonderful person. It's not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell a real story. Something might be good, but when you can not forget the terrible movie from '66, it's a great movie. So if you are a fan then relax and enjoy your story only with the cover story to tell her story gently.
