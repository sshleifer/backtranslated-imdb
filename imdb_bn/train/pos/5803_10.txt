Wow, when I was fascinated in the search of the garage, I forgot how wonderful this movie was. It's a story about Michael Jackson's collection of an organic, musical vintet and a super hero fighting to save a small hero. Vignettes are good (especially the speed daemon), but the best part of this movie is the Super Hero Segment, which is turned into a Michael Jackson car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and it sounds just as weird). Joe Pesci is delightful, and has enough cool images and entertaining across great music! <br /> <br /> Original gem owner of the movie for the incredible "smooth criminal" video, that's part alone!
