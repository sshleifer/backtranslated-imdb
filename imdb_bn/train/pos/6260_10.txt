This soul was provocative! I am an Iranian, and living in the 21st century, I do not know that such a large tribe is living in this time of my grandfather! <br /> <br /> You see today or even 1925, one woman or child on one side of the world could supply everything to clean or demand for it, but 80 years ago, people wanted to go anywhere with grass. It is really interesting that these Persians endure these problems to find pastures for their sheep, but they lose many sheep in their path. <br /> <br /> Those people who praise America with this tribe were as difficult as the people of Bakhtiyar.
