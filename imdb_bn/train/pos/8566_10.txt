When I came to 101 Dalmalan in 1996, I really like 101 Dementions, now 5 years later I went to see 102 Dammalans in 2001, I thought it was fantastic but I think 101 is good because I think it is even more I am thinking that there are 103 draft plans planned based on the same story, funny, more humorous and similar to that movie cartoon version (One hundred and one Dalmatians (1961) . Hopefully, yes, probably not, we are all dyamamesana fans will find out in the future is going to be damalesana 103.
