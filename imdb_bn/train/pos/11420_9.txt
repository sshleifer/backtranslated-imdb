This movie is catastrophic and the problem of crossing limiting limitations of morbidity, race relations and desires. Guessed, this is not a movie for everyone. There is no car movement, no building explosion, no murder. Drama Glennes, short gestures, spatial boundaries, lamps and tails tossed suggested by the rest - sometimes very visible - insecure. It's identity, memory, community, related. The various parts of the film work together to strengthen the leitmotifs of self and others, identity, desires, limits and damages. It will pay attention to the attention and sensitive visitors. Those palates whose explosive, massive, spicy action will offend them. This is a beautifully illustrated human story. All that
