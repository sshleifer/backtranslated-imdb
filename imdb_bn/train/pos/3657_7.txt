This image is similar to the 1950s edition of Eitor Schola's Bruce Sparke e Cotivi. A lesson with less sex and less reality, but great humanity and warmth. I would not call this a neo-realistic picture. It should be very emotional and more like a fairy tale, and probably should be classified as a comedy, although it is related to serious matters (little like Chaplin or 1930-comedy). Although common in Italian, very emotional, and difficult to resist without a stone cold person. Sensitivity is a separatism, although this picture is not meant to be a realistic drama. It's not a great composition like Umberto D. or Bicycle Chief. But it's a loving and funny comedy, with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
