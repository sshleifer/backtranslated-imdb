The darling story ........ gave me 10 votes compared to the average age for my age and sex ... which is not comedy (I am about myself almost wet film) though interesting enough. Probably not a little more musical fan for me, but they give you time to grab a drink or soda without any significant absence. When Harry met Sally, what was the fifty years? Ahab is not really, but it's like your top ten if I like this movie. It really just leaves you with a warm vague feeling, what romance can do and think, something to shoot for you. My short story is very low ..... It's quite a charming description
