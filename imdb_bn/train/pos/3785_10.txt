This movie is very underrated It is extremely fantastic, creative and clever. It's just fun and in my opinion this picture is the first top. But for the first time forgot the movie, forgot the movie, and more surveillance has been there for years. "Bill and Teddy's Bagus Journey" also hit the box office, where the first was a very good hit and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem may have been delayed a few years later. In 1991, Bill and Ted thinks "so 80" already. Although only a few years before the 80's, music and style landscape for songs changed so much with Gangster Rap, Hip Hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Grunge and Seattle. Bill and Ted were with Oz Osborn, with Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses Music, they had a lot of space with the 80's style and were old in '91, and I think this is a big reason bombing box boxes. Someone but the Surfer is still "Excellent!" Like stuff is saying. And "bogas!" "Gremlins 2" in the early 1991's, which suffered the same kind of fame as a good movie that bombed the box office because it was very much connected with the 80s. The transition from '80s to 90' has changed quickly with 90 and 200 '. Nothing like 1998 or 1989, but now 2002, and last year 2001 still looks like / looks like 1995/1996. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> May have been badly damaged first.
