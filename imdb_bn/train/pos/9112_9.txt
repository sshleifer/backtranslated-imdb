The half-Portuguese does not give me half-blind (or half-favor) when discussing Portuguese movies. Whatever that is that very often get that. But this picture was similar to Adrenaline! Yes, that's right - it was the most accurate / correct in history - but it did not break a fifty pieces to go outside of the normal Portuguese-film area: using real-time locations between traffic-intermediate Lisbon and things like a real crowd recruiting around 30 years Before stand for the original crowd. And Allah has found them right! Well, for the number: If you live through it, it's very emotional, but you'll identify lesser improvements that the platform requirements can be made side by side. If you only see it randomly, then you are looking for a better historical romp, just like recent history and a little more than usual. Even by the European standard, yes.
