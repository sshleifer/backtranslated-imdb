Edward Burtynsky is the Canadian photographer who makes the imaginary least artificial "artful" out of the industry. Daily items such as cray, box, metal container etc. are used as the most beneficial and completely eliminated without aesthetic talent - instead Burithnsky's camera is transformed into a glorious object. He has achieved this result by focusing on repeat colors and geometrical designs which is probably present in the artist world - which is understandable enough to spot them. If seen through Burtensky's lens, the hops of compact trash can become beauty objects (but do we not already know it from "Wall-E"?). He is particularly interested in photography photography like a mines and ship branches, where Man has already attacked Nature - which can explain that sometimes even in his films people (that is, those workers), their uniform clothing and robotic movement, why are they part of the art landscape? <br /> <br /> "A document about the work of Banttsky", "Produced Landscape", is most likely about "Quanissacci" because it is our image and design-rich diverse calidoscope. Indeed, director Jennifer Bechwal and cinemographer Peter Metalla have originally highlighted the main pictures of the original films, such as recording their own cameras, a factory in China, Bukituski and its assistive running photo shoots, a dockyard in Bangladesh and the construction site of China's three major river gorge dam projects . With their fluid camera-work, filmmakers match point-points for the beauty of Bootinsky's pictures. Actually, the film is opened with a Chinese factory's eight-minute long tracking shots, of which hundreds of similarly dressed workers work perfectly in a uniform and color-coordinate rows. <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> When Burtynsky gets almost pretty articulating his work "theme", which, roughly, comes out sounding well, baffled, contradictory, and perfect half-baked. But it highlights a purely aesthetic experience, images and forms, that resonates most of the "created landscapes". In Burtynsky case, perhaps, a picture really thousands of words.
