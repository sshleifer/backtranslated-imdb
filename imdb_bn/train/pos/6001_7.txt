In no way is there any excellent work, and far from the best of Ariel Flynn, Istanbul still has a lot to do for it. Location and beautiful technicolor cinematography, brought us back from the past long time. Errol Flein shows his past glory moment, and Jim is just as Brennan, a pilot comes back to the past of the past. The picture is actually a remake of "Singapore" of 1947, and the story seems horrified and cliche by today's standard. Many of the supporting casts also seem to be "moving through the motion" in this picture. Many people compared it to the best of all time, CASABLANCA. While watching the film, I can see many matches, but O, Casablanca has inspired a number of imitators, so accept what it is worth. If you're close, you can see the old fan of Flin, or the old fashion love story, but you can see this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or Malts Falcon as a good role in the Hollywood classics ....
