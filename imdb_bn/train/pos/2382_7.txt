For a long time, 'The Manjeri' was my favorite 'Star Trek' episode though in recent years it has been adopted by 'City City Forever'. What I liked about 'MENZERI' is that it was a very impressive Star Trek with this impressive back-story in the current-current track story. I still think Gin Rodenberry is fairly impressive in ways involving the original pilot in a two-part episode. Although the "new part" of this story is primarily an excuse to visit Kirk and some (and our) pilots, it is a truest idea to speak the court martial. If you want you can poke the hole in the plot. For example, according to the condition of the control of the mind of Talosian mind and Captain Pike, why should physique be returned to their planet? And there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore's mendaes ... do not seem too hard to get the details and just enjoy two levels of ST.
