I saw it first when it premiered ten years ago. I saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me. She Fought Alone, a girl, Kaitlyn (played by Tifani Thesene), with whom raped by Jess (played by David Lipher), who enjoys the suffering of classmate girls. Catalina is in a popular high school cycle, but when she revealed that the gang was raped, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This movie describes the struggles of the catlines in the city as a whole. , Including a high school, which certainly determines the social environment of athletes, which allows them to move according to their wishes. <br /> <br /> There is genuine Chemistry between Thesene and the Green Top Actor and the two of them throughout the film. All the actors in this movie, inspired by genuine events, do a great job. He is worried alone, really wanted to be in high school (at least in 1995) and despite his own self-esteem and fame, he kept his original concept. Recommended. 10/10
