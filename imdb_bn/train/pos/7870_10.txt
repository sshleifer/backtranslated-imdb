A real demonstration of how the film has become ambitious and selfish in society. It contains lots of characters and each and every character represents a separate section of the person. No character is 100% good and moral, which is contrary to the heroes of all the ordinary Indian films and no character is 100% bad, but all are different. The movie is a very perfect mix of passion, drama and entertainment. For the first time I liked a movie that raised some social questions. I would recommend all to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who has added Bollywood hip-shaking teams on the newspaper page, but this story is what he has been a reporter for the newspaper. But not all of it, it shows that she could not survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent child, how cruel her voice was suppressed. Even he was fired from the job. Then he did not find the job of a criminal reporter and he had to work again. Not only that, but a lot of characters are involved in the movie and everyone is different when viewing the movie. I really congratulate the director for making great movies. Please do not afford to miss it.
