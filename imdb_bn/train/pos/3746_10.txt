I love this movie / small things Jason Style is amazing! My favorite parts are the French song and the title of the opening when the Sputula soldier "Spons!" Cried out. I crack every time. I would recommend this movie to Knox Climation fans and those who enjoy Jason Steel's other films. Animation is very original in its style. To take a closer look at the background, it takes a few views. Her humor is also delightful, and there is definitely something you would like to hear before. Intelligent Sputular like Mac, who has a sound and light arrangement in his head when he talks about his tragic life, while colorful lighting and happy music are insignificant. This is a wonderful animation to see anytime at any time.
