First of all, I want to say that when I know about my share of Star Wars, I'm not brave. I do not know how much chromosomes are on a wap night or an extended family of TK427. What I know is: Star Wars, all movies (though less with episode 2), some witch has been caught. It's hard to say, Luca has found the button and brave it, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. This is an idea. <br /> <br /> How can you ask? I'll explain. Star Wars reaches the worst versus stereotype, good versus. It is so clearly, so deeply, that literally any person can understand from any environment. Six of the episodes work very well, ending the epic struggle between a son and his used and impressive father, nevertheless, with the connection of estimation, reveals more in the hinted background. Suddenly, the audience stood in front, and the spectators realized that this is Akkin's story, not just the look. But even before 1-3, it had all the amazing depth. It felt realistic, as the capsule entered the house of Lucas from the sky, a galaxy's historical account details away at a distance. <br /> <br /> Star Wars are certainly much more than ideal, and I must admit, whenever I see them, especially this one, I feel very small. I think I enter a world where good and evil is clearly defined. When I see them, I get a breathtaking feeling, a feeling that something, anyway, has touched me physically.
