"Lion King" is always no doubt my favorite Disney movie, so I guess I give the sequel a chance and I did. The lion king 1 1/2 was pretty good and it was good smile and fun with Timano and Pumba. The only problem is, I sometimes feel like no explanation because they can create feelings of plot holes and just want to explain your own. Well, I would recommend this movie for lion king fans or with this family for just one night. It's a fun with a hilarious and similar humorous character. So, I hope I'll be the same with the third schedule of the Lion King series. Sit in the back and think of the hakuna mata! It means no worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
