This movie is not for everyone. You're both bright enough to get "it" or you do not. Supporters of the Sci-Fi film who are not seriously concerned about themselves will enjoy this movie. I suggest this movie to anyone who can appreciate spoofs and parodies. I recommend this picture everyone has enjoyed it. You enjoy movies like Monty Python or Mel Brooks, but you probably will enjoy it. Voices are performed in a tongue-thong system and one liners fly faster and furious.
