This movie is a very simple but clever motivation - an unemployed person trying to steal from a convenience shop and the shop's clerk holds this job ... The thief then goes to the shop's shop with Clark. All the time, the store's clerk is facing problems with low rank Yaquja Chinpira (gangster). Behind the thief, they were caught by Yakuzar's eyes, who found Clerk in the shop for convenience. The story comes in high gear in the form of Tom and Jerry (cat and mouse), but behind the cat it is added to the dog. The whole 2nd law of DANAGANA Runner (translated as "Pinball runners" can be translated into English) is behind disappointment, and Chase goes to the point that at the end of the second law, the left forgets why he is running, and Yakuza Don does not remember that he is behind two He or she even thinks why he is moving away from him. <br /> <br /> The next picture of SBB, like Postman Blues, is mostly all of the injection involving viewers with Chase and action, lots of physical comedy and dark humor. The end which ends in the end, when three men go out of steam and which is one of the most chaotic Mexican stand-offs, you will see the movie, which looks like that Sabu Tony is paying tribute to Scott. True romance (wrote Quantin Tarantino).
