A very modern room seems to be the reason for the bizarre (and deadly) behavior of its residents. Or at least it is the Lara Flynn Boolean character Colonel Kennedy's argument. Next door, after a series of serious home fatalities, know to give something to the Corn. Mark-Paul Gasler is also big as mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: House Next Door works because of Lara Flin Boil and places (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, absolutely not to mention the stunning. He brought credence to his character and made the film an inspiration. Without it, it will fail. A possible buyer in the reference of the "It's so alive" house. Yes, it's alive. But the story is not too much. <br /> <br /> Except for Boyle's presence, there are not many things happening here, because the movie is watching huge amounts or waiting for the current owners to influence the house. The results are expected. But I like it anyway The cinematography film lends to a polished face. 8/10 Because of Boyle, an evil overdue modern house, location and film, and decor and dress set.
