But it's a great martial art film. Liu Chia Liang is one of the Korea's warriors, only Samo Hong than his best. At the time of the war - it is immediately obvious from its strategic proud exhibition of the flashy camera angle. The direction is firmly regulated to speed the viewer through motion and movement, but is afraid of his performance with the right skill. This picture also benefits from the participation of Liu in front of the camera. Liu's performance with the opening ceremony of the film is one of the high points in the history of Kung Fu. Liu is supported in support of the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hong (My Young Anti Fame) and 'Hishiya Ha', whose crafts are exciting, and more favorite than any of Tarek's, this picture follows this fantastic theme of retaliation, but the characters along the way and Moral development, and a most appropriate resolution. This humor is good. If you only see a Kung Fu film once, it will be a good choice - it has all.
