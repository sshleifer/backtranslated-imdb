It looks like Von Trott is much easier with personal story balance in contrast to the history of the film compared to its earlier film, Vert√®che, Das (1995). Was there. The direction was carefully controlled, and apparently I felt it was very interesting - especially where the visual description was concerned (a new candle light in modern times in memory of the memory of different letters and the memory of different characters in the past). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Although it was indicated, it was not intended. Von Trotta told me! (And she is a beautiful woman!) Second, the time of the ceremony was historically correct (the actual dates are shown on the closing of the monument) and the release of the prisoners was released as a sudden film. Gobbels has proven irritating with this work and has proved that he finally liberated it. <br /> <br /> Overall, what influenced me most is that it is a main story. The 'elapsed' era. This photo seems to be shameful for a long time (for various reasons) to hit us on screen. <br /> <br /> Please more please Margaret!
