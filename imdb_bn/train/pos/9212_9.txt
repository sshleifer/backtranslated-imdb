Yesterday, I went to the movies alone, because in Mexico, most of the other countries are filmed in part of the so-called "camera alternate" (alternative camera). But after seeing this movie I realized that foreign movies are not an option. Thankfully, this is a good example. But I said that I have enjoyed this movie so much. I was finally happy .. This movie is a little hope this day. And the main text for me .. At the end of that day ... love is the main strength behind us. This is a good option to see a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention the best music. Especially the main song in the movie .. Kosas Koen Hessen Co la La Vida Valga la Pena ... Excellent music! !!
