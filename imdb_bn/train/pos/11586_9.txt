Some people are going to write an essay by Paul Nati's "Wawlman's Fox" compared to the great Spanish psychic films, "L 'age D'or" and "Yu Chien Andlou". Naschy film is a best composition of the delirium from the beginning to the end. Dali and Bunuel probably liked it, and found their heart so comfortable that they had to pull their brain. <br /> <br /> There is a plot in this film, but there is a lack of narrow structure. From A to B to C. "Professor Walterman" - his first name, mind - during the operation of Tibet, the pilgrim was pierced by the tithi and after that it was not the same. Understandable One of her sincere colleagues, the well-known doctor, Voldestine's insane daughter, knows about her condition and tells her that she is cheating on her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In a fort filled with circus freaks, wired with different instruments, japed with strong electronic effects, associated with injection with the help Is made, is turned into a warefuff, in an evening gown, high-nasty fetish boots whip him, he escapes, beautiful lady doctor Helping to get out of the castle, Circus fixes the battlefield with the battlefield, finally returns to Vareval and has to fight against the death of his cheating wife, female incarnation of Varuval Avatar. With the Nazi boot, the lady was shot with a silver bullet from her liger pistol, they died together, and the beautiful doctors went to the street with a story-time reporter, who did nothing. "Look how beautiful it is!" <br /> <br /> Early Paul Nashee wrote "La Faria del Ambo Lobo". The original director Enrique Eguilez was fired and replaced by José María Zabalza, who was a drunk who was ugly drunk throughout the production. He often could not work (although he found 14-year-old nephews at the time to order a change in the script) and Rachi directed most of the director of the film Achaena. Javalja Nashey's earlier films, "Mark of the Wolman", gathered some of the scenes of scenes. Although the scenes were different, fortunately it was good enough to use twice, even if Jabalza refuses to leave the bed to finish the movie, it helps to run the runtime pad. Post production was a nightmare. Nobody knew who was performing, the money was gone, the master prints disappeared for a while, and then a film distributor got the urine in the hole in front of the executive executive officer during the screening of the pre-release. He was very drunk to find the rest but at least he made it curb. <br /> <br /> Anyway whatever film works, if you give it. It's our curious palace, vaulted catacombs, chains, whips, key about atavistic memories about depressed moors. Supporters of these things can see it in heart though the whole story does not give much knowledge due to the vandalism of the death penalty. At one stage his wave rained and the wolfman trembled with electricity; Later his bones dried up and he quarreled in full moon. Then it was raining again. And yet you do not look at it as a gaff. It's like an open dream where the contests are possible, the opposite is the same, and the reasons for the effects come forward; At first the wolfman takes power cable and screams up, and then starts flashing with electricity. People say that their low budget overall performance hampered - I say they spend more time to spend, then the film becomes ineligible. It's a wonderful event to do something from nothing, and it can not be successful because of what it does, but because of what it does it It's easy to laugh at stuff like this and it's easier to dismiss. This technique is able to see through the greatness, or as a part of the impact, to reflect the chaos. <br /> <br /> Paul Rascal died last week at the age of 75. He was ill due to the firefight cancer. One year or more, he was working directly on film projects until his last day, but during the treatment of chemotherapy, Spain died on the Madrid side of Spain. His rich, diverse, and surprisingly long career is a heir to the subject of universal mainstream concern following his artistic outlook. And yet we are all the children aged one and a year old, who will scare their movies "Raul of the Wolfman". Even those who do not like the Euro, they can even discover something in this couple, if only for a minute in a few minutes. You can buy it at Archive.Org or it's a DVD for a nickel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem that was encountered while producing it Perhaps it was frustrating to forgive a very private individual atheist. I will never see the courage to forgive him, but I would say: I want to see the Flees of Volumean, discovering this or any other holiday in Swine Flu Cineplex, despite its fastest, most cut and dropped fullscreen universal domain prints. <br /> <br /> This month the world has lost a great artist. Watch her movie, and remember. <br /> <br /> 9/10
