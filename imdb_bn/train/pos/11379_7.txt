Blood Castle (Demo Lover Ukka Scrum, Blatter Alter, Ivana - The Best, But A Minute Suspicious Movie-Title, etc.) is a very traditional Gothic romance film. That means it's a big, strange palace, a heady young girl, a mysterious old man, awesome and supernatural, and traditional romance elements of traditional times. This means that it is very deliberately read, and the film will work best for Horn Magnas who are the smallest fans. If you like movies like Robert Weiss's The Hunting (1963), but you also have the taste for Spanish and Italian horoscopes in the late 1960s / early 1970s, you can also love Blood Castle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Carlos Quiney) Locals feared him because legend says that whenever he dies on a woman's bed, he dies at the end - it is equally agreed that he set a violent dog on them. This is a problem because Baron has a very healthy appetite for women. At the beginning of the photo, another woman died and was exploded. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dr. Ivana Rakowski (Arna Skur) appealed to take Baron to the center of the village. Dalmatian Castle He is from the outskirts of the city who appointed Baron for his skill in chemistry. Of course, someone wants to go near the castle. Finally, Evvana finds a film person (even if she becomes shadier) to take him. Once, a strange woman, who lives in the palace, Olga (Cristia Galloni) rejects Evan and says she can not stay there after she becomes a woman. Admission to what the Baron Barber may have. She ended up staying, but somewhat reluctant. Baron has hired him to upset the effects of his severe fever, which is suffering from Baron's brother Igor. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Baron Bhai's mind is to tear a stick into a wicked, black liquid vat. And more, Eva has a wicked, hallucinatory dream. Just what's going on in the castle? Baron is responsible for the crime? Is he mad <br /> <br /> I wanted blood clots more than me. As I mentioned, the film is very deliberate in its pensing, and most of them are very few. I can go any way of stuff like that. I'm not worried about hunting (yes, I'm a very small minority there), but I was a fearful European fanatic of the 1960s and 1970s. Mario Bava is one of my favorite directors. I love Dario Argentine's work from that period. But occasionally, Blood Castle sometimes came very slowly for me. There are a lot of big parts that are not very exciting, slowly walking down the canyons in the scene of Ivana. Director Jose Lewis Marino operates more than passable sets and positions and they shoot fairly well by Immanuel de Coaler. However, the Blood Kassel feels relatively low budget and it is Roger Krooman-produced film, which, after all, (which usually seems to mean low budget, though often high quality "fast"). So there is an indication of the complexity of the bava and the complex set of decorations, all the more. Of course, it's like the 30-year-old photograph of retromedia print that I saw looks like the sun is very long left. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, Marino and De Cola occasionally create spectacular scenes. For example, a scene of Ivana is walking on a dark hallway, which shoots from an exaggerated angle and reveals an important plot material only through the shadows of a wall. There are also couples in Angmerman Bergman's shots, where the actors are uncommonly blocked to relate complex relationships, are only attractive, and deeply draw your eyes on the frame. <br /> <br /> The performances are fairly good, and women especially Schürer - very interesting. Merino exploits this fact by including a modest amount of nudity. Schürer acted like a number of films that were soft mud pornography like other styles, such as English life in a man's crease (1974), Necked and Lustful (1974), Strip Nude for the Killer (English) 1975) and a Sexy Seduce Storm Exploits (1977). Blood Castle is a lot of tomers, but apart from nudity, there are light scenes of rape and slavery propositions, and of course, scenes mix sex and death. <br /> <br /> The initial attraction is probably the story, which is something like slow flaming romance. Intense material, mystery elements, and a little unexpected packing bonus are at the end but in the end, the blood castle is a love story, various disasters and antigominations (often with physical threats or losses).
