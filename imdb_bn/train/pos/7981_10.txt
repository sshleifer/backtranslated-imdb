In Mexico City, former CIA killer and currently a alcoholic John Krise (Denzel Washington) industrialist Samuel Ramos (Mark Anthony) recommends his old friend Riebern (Christopher Walken) as the bodyguard, his younger daughter Pitta (Dakota Fanning) and his Wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) Pita changed the behavior of cold chris, living it lively again, and she felt affection for him. The girl was abducted and the court said that she was murdered by the criminals, she swore to kill everyone responsible for the abduction. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a wonderful composition, and certainly a classic in the future. The story is excellent, never corny and although running in 146 minutes, visitors do not feel passing time. Cast is protected by excellent actors and actresses, highlighting their performance outstanding, Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. Cinematography has wonderful moments, and the plaque has stunning lines. According to the character of Christopher Walken's Manjano (Jiacierl Giannini) I personally liked the death of the specialty of Christmas, and he is preparing his best work. I agree with this user that commenting on "Man on Fire" is not the best movie of the year in this film. My vote ten <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas de VInganka" ("Fire of Revenge")
