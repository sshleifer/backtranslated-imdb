At the beginning of his debut, Danzell Washington has taken a real story that seems to be a very difficult story, and since Washington's acting efforts, we hope that it brings the truth to the screen, but now we see this touch as the director. <br /> <br /> Recently, we saw some devastating results of children falling through public safety cracks. This story speaks of the existence of a nightmare that leaves horrible scars, but ultimately indicates the victory of the soul of man. <br /> <br /> We can not choose any first-effort problems with many close ups, and not the best way to edit these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that power the project can not be isolated. <br /> <br /> It would be frustrating if the Academy ignores this movie. This film does not break into fifty pieces and goes on the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that usually does not cross the novel from the screen. This, of course, is a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a sandstone so go see it and tell your friends to see it!
