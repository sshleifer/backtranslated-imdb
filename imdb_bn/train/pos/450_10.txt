I am biased towards any movie that draws an exquisite picture of Italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately the film was rather small, for a period of abnormally, and a little spar on the cinematography aspect. However, the excellent story makes for it. Four women start an exhaustive relaxing holiday with the problem of their minds. On film, they begin to understand their problems and fix them. They believe in San Salvatore that the fort that they live in has a dominant influence on humans. "It's a tube of love," says Lottie Wilkins. As Italian beaches work their magic, you can see them gradually change from gradually dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> All their problems and their solutions are valid. The actress was great. Background music seems very suitable for a romantic Italian local. Above all, a 10/10 movie for me.
