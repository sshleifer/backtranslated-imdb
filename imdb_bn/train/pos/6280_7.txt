If you like, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> Some outstanding actors in the film, especially Vinnie Jones, with her ideal no messy attitude and hardface look. Others are not bad ... <br /> <br /> There are only two small flaws in this picture. First, poor plot, but people do not see this movie for this plot. Second, the glory of Grand Theft Auto (car crime). But if people really believe that they can steal the fugitive and move away with them, they feel good, hopefully there is a good time in your prison! <br /> <br /> When I first read that the main role of Nicholas Cage was the role, I first thought "... sweeet.", but then I thought "... naaaa suck you!" But after finally watching this film I realized "... he is walking!" Just play the role of jokingly. <br /> <br /> I will end this extraordinary review. "If premature death dies, a criminal is generally illuminated by the filmmakers as a serious finish under the increasingly delicate wreck of criminal life and motivates them to change their way, with this death It carries an inherent benevolence, everyone has to be lucky, you can say "poor criminal." I I say: "We are weak." <br /> <br /> - PS Angelina Jolie looks beautiful!
