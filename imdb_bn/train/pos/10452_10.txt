If I want Selen and Jesse want to enhance their relationship, I want to tell them that they were made for each other, in that film we want to die for each other in a very long time. Our story was what we wanted and probably never reached us. It's not about love but kind of stupid things like "Notting Hills" or movie. This life and I had faith in them, I was convinced that they were falling ... this was so tricky and touching. I just finished it one minute ago and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I mean, I am now becoming liars and feel that love is just a fake, an idea, but with this movie I realized that maybe somewhere <br /> <br /> I'm not French And despite Kleiscowski, I did not know Julie Dellie very well "three colors: white" ... now she needs to see others because she's looking like an angel and got a perfect performance. I have seen "before sunset" (a series in Paris) before sunset "I've seen before sunrise" and they do not care. They are both masterpieces. Proof that you do not need to print the eyes with the technology to get pure feeling. I'm sorry for my english which I'm trying the best. <br /> <br /> Franc of France
