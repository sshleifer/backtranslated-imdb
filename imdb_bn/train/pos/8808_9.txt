First of all, I have given this thing to the people I got together. 9/11 is a sensitive issue that creates a movie that dares to be controversial, which takes great frustration. It's a shame, though not surprising that the film was banned in the United States. <br /> <br /> I said that the movie is pretty cool with some weak moments. The film begins with the Iranian segment, which somewhat reminds Majid Majidi's work (absolutely beautiful "children of Heaven" and "Colors of Heaven"). It shows the clips of the two films of what happened to the innocent eyes of a group of Afghan refugees in Iran. Absolutely beautiful clip. Shaw Penn's clips are pretty sparkling as well. But some of the clips are exceptionally cruel to others. Like the Alejandro Gonzáles Iñarritu Mexican clip and his intestine, "Amoros Pereos" he can do it brutally. Most of the clips are a black screen with different sounds playing in the background. Those words were journalists and their shocks like the second plane crash, who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families, who were angry ... and gathered it with the flash of people jumping from the tower. . Seeing is very difficult and you will not forget that some clips can be very difficult to see because some clips can be very difficult to see "one that you are not only suffering". Especially the Egyptian and British clips not only say this, but they also launch tables and say how much sorrow in the United States is due to other people. <br /> <br /> I will make special mention in the clips of Bosnia. Harzgovina, France, India, and Japan (although this last may actually look worse than the place). <br /> <br /> However, not all clips are great and I specifically mention the clip from Israel, in my opinion, very weak. The idea was good (a reporter of the oil invasion of Tel Aviv, but the story of what happened in New York happened because of the fact that many of us living in the countries in war are understandable). The clip ends when some entertainment reporter is always trying to get some airtime, a person says he is a witness and hopes he will go to TV and soldiers and paramedics shout just "cause". This clip fails to capture any image of any such play. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see it, then you should know that if you are not a conservative, you may get better as d good stay. But if you are not, you can know how many of us live in the United States outside 9/11.
