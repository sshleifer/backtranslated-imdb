Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talent, dark and monster. I've read other 'comments' in this board as well as in message board staff and people just did not get it. T.V. Any incident that appears in an accident is an accident. A lot of money, time and work is wrong to produce a TV show. Sarah wanted to be stupid because this show stupid. Sarah wanted to be a boy because this show is a teenager. I thought the jokes were fantastic and the theme shows as well as the number of other musical instruments surprisingly diverse. It's very bad like a p-way playhouse, like Slacker's prominent glue sniffing, from Valley to America's future pornography. Cast is excellent. The situation and actions are well-intelligent. I hope this show is successful because the comedy Central David does not let the spade hold his show. Who is playing Sarah's sister? She does not have a cast list on the show's home page. I want to see her stand up. Does anyone know about his up-coming show dates or DVD which can be floating around out?
