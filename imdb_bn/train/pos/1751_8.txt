The 40-year-old Virgin, about 40 years old Andy Stitzer, who works in electronic stores and does not live mostly in social life, and is very unhappy with women. Some of her colleagues at the shop invited her one night and they discovered that Andy is still a virgin, so they plan to help her to lose her virginity. One day at the shop, Andy meets a woman named 30, who gave him a phone number and finally gave him an end, with enough courage to go to a date and they start to like each other but Andy is still very painful. It comes to sex and she has to say it to Tash, because if she is really unknown because of her embarrassment, she has enough courage to tell her. 40-year-old Virgin's good looks, a good script, good comedic performance by full custom, good film and good film editing. Film star and Steve Carroll co-authors, who achieved very good comedic success and his writing for film is very good. I was very pleasantly surprised with this picture. It's sweet, fun, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, cute, good nature and a good time. This movie is just as good as this year's wedding crashes, and both of the movies I've seen are two of the best comedies seen in a few minutes. The 40-year-old Virgin really displays a lot of talent and it is well-used and it works as a comedy and romance and it's sweet and a lot of fun. The biggest surprise and one of the year's best comedies.
