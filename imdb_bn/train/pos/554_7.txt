(There are little spoilers) <br /> <br /> This is interesting as how it uses James Stewart here. Of course, Stuart certainly remembers many as Frank Caper "It's a Wonderful Life", George Bailey, so it's easy to get parallelism between the two movies. "It's a wonderful life," Bailey sees this world as she never was born. Stewart Jeff Webster sees the same thing in "The Far Country", until anyone else (without himself) is involved in the aid: a world where he (for all real things) does not exist. <Br> <br /> Not involved (and not trying to care about anyone), Webster is forced to see those for whom he can not help, but it is hard to take care of, push around and even die And nothing else. It reminds George Bailey's viewers that they see a world that has turned upside down because they have decided to get involved without ever being born. <br /> <br /> Both movies end with the same image - a ring bell closure. By turning around his philosophy of Stuart, non-related, it would seem, its "wings" acquired.
