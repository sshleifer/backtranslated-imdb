Maybe I was fox, fox, and favorable to everything but I thought it was done very well. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it that was shown when Lily was not comfortable, such as fire and house (not trying to loot too much here). I think it's important for kids to try and understand. <br /> <br /> I got a little confused after reading a few comments, one by one, that finally, the splendor-mother and her son appeared, since she was telling her son about her story. The movie that I saw was not with the mother or the boy till then, just a picture of a girl with a fox. Can anyone illuminate me? However, I really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes may be slightly slower, which can sit through high energy kids. They can still sit but still worth it.
