I have read another review and found something like movie void real life (for example in the music school), Britney Bashing, etc. Let us now focus on the film and the message. <Br /> <br /> I marked this movie for ages 8 to 14, 10-year-old 7 and a family movie. For the average adult man ................................................... 2. <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock music, I'm 45. I know Brittany Spirits but I did not realize that he actually sang Stangong until I read the credit and this review. I could not recognize his poster on the wall, so I'm not worried about any 'self-promotion'. <br /> <br /> I see movies for entertainment. I am not concerned about casting, lighting, producer, director etc. What is the film and it makes me entertained. <br /> <br /> I've seen the message for this movie. The world's greatest epidemic is less self-esteem (which is another complete story), so the message is seen in mind, because it is an area of ​​interest. The movie is light, bright and dazzling, great for kids. I saw Texan Twink started to fade throughout the film and there are many ways to escape / not leave the message, so it was somewhat predictable. Though great message ... they should be more. <br /> <br /> This movie is a big family movie, but a blurry to see by yourself, get Honeyball.
