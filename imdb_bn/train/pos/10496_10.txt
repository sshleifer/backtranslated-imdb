Great actors, an Oscar nominated actress, stunning scenery, a good fortune story line and more smiles than you can fit into my new handbag (and that big). This photo was bright. It was a neatly more serious scene and the fun moment was played. .well, side splitting. I have never heard so much of the movie audience, and 'crying women' in tea stalls, I was crying. The British film industry and Craig Ferguson have done well with the magic elements, which confirmed that this is one of my favorite year's movies, if not always.
