The really sensitive story of America's admission camp, where young people prepare for the war in Vietnam. People's research has always appealed to me in the film of war, because it translates personal, subjective opinion of the war, analyzes the action of filmmakers where action and technical data analyzes human ancestral ancestry. <br /> <br /> This film is already directed to set up a new spin on an ancient content and drives itself away from normal war movies, especially from the point of view of traditional values, to a hero anti-hero. The film focuses on Buzz's tragic character, who refrains from suckling the smartphone from the war machine, and refuses to give up control over its destiny and wages for those who do not believe, spend it on their own in search of ways to avoid and Both comrades are being sent abroad, and eventually the end of the war is going to end its own cars To find the final. Perfect hatred <br /> <br /> Actually really exceptional, and the documentary-style shooting makes you feel almost moved into the movie. The film will also provide food for those who are happy by the action of the general war film or fight-game enthusiast workers, hoping to raise some minds of a generation that has fortunately saved drafts from terrorism.
