I liked this film a lot. It's a wonderful chemistry between actors and a story that is very public, pronounced son's story. Despite the aspect that I liked the best, the bathing room was more than just a background for the story. The father told his son about the story of his wife's family in the northern desert of China, the water and the bath element became almost a holy ceremony. There was a deep bath depth and meaning that the water was very low. <br /> <br /> Overall the film was very effective. There were moments, when it became very "sweet" sweet ... closing borders during the scene of movement in the park. But overall, I highly recommend this film.
