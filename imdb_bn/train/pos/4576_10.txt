I think it's a fascinating movie about the life of Mary-Kate and Ashley's character Sam and Emma Stanton! They are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy; Unfortunately, it's not easy for them! I thought it was a completely entertaining and sweet movie and if you're a real fond of these incredible young men, I'm sure you agree with me! If you have not seen this movie yet, I really miss you; Big time, and you will certainly take time out to see it now! This movie is a real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
