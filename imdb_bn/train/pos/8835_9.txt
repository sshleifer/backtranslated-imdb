A sharp political comment to come as a story of age is what this movie is about The annoying thing is that it works effectively both levels. It is not supposed but. This story of four sons of Communist Belgrade in 1953 and a girl growing up warm heart. The gentleman who read it as a classic movie. Clearly, the 1953 Belgrade communist society is not as rigid as dictatorial and fascist environment. Anyone can listen to rock and roll songs, a song from the song "Hey Babu Riba" is the title of the original movie. But jeans can not be bought and ownership of specific medicines is not illegal. Like a heavy intervention of the communist society, this movie shows how it affects us as four as it affects the lives of five heroes. The woman who is in exile in Italy and is waiting for a passport for her mother and she is going to join her, the piano has taken away from the hands of the boys, suddenly it is necessary for your new comrades in your house and in the fourth quarter. The boys spend a lot of time listening to music, and it has become clear that fascism that created communalism quarrels with fascist charlatan, who tattooed Stalin in his hands. All of these led to the subsequent actions and memories of a time because the film was released in the evening of the Soviet empire in 1986. The price seen again and again is a great movie. "Repentance is not your enemy but it is not a friend."
