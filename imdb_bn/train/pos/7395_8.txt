The whole film is made in a public bathing place in China. There are no fancy sets, explosions or fascinating people - only fine writing, acting and direction (Hollywood, take notes!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is good to see the parents that naturally the family is doing business. In fact, he noticed that his father and his disabled brother had developed a truly intimate and caring relationship, and soon it became clear that he was out of the loop! Dad is very traditional and this visiting boy comes from the big city and does not really value the old bath house. How their relationships change and where the plot goes, there is exceptional and trustworthy. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see that not every Chinese movie is a verb photo (such as Jett Lee or Crouching Tiger, hidden hidden in the Dragon), I do not particularly care about these frenetic films. Springtime in a small town hall along with shawwars are two excellent examples of people's good Chinese film!
