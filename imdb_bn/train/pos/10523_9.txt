Emma is a true romance. If you love soppy stuff, charged with intelligence and folly, you will love this movie! This is the truth of the novel, which is very important, has been added for some twists with pleasure. Gain is not my actress, but she does justice to a role that requires all the speed she gives. She shines in a role that she could have done proper justice to any other actress. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, as a hero. How are you I did not want to look at him! What can be the right role for you! He is so understandable that the ruler looks so good as Mr K that I literally look at him in a new light. She makes and has excellent romantic lead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> A good throw. A good movie If you are a fan of Jane Austen, then watch this movie with Pride and Prizudis - and most importantly, buy books. It's awesome that heightens the movie up to the height
