Jane Austen's Emma is one of the most enjoyable stories and stories I've ever seen. Emma of Cake Bekensel is unreasonable. Gwyneth Paltrow, (with the help of a good playplay and excellent cinematography) is able to effectively effect the comedy, he fails to make Emma preferred. Palatro does not support this section that 'wrong' (and I believe in this era) for his hairstyle section and he sees positive sickness in empire line clothing. On the other hand, Kate Beacinsel manages to manage the comedy easily and is still able to show Mr Knightley (the most romantic of Jane Austen's heroes). Mark Strong is an excellent Mr. Knightley handsome look, with the right mix of appropriate age, tolerance, compassion and sincere behavior. Actor and Mr. Knightley are well supported by a cast of the cast and are quite pleasurable to produce completely.
