Even after the negative reviews I received in this movie, I suspected that I would give it up, but my walpel and id was Â£ 3.99 for buying a movie like gambling movie and saw it and gave it before. I'm glad, I enjoyed it. Chain Reaction, The Ring, Bourne Identity, (Brian Cox) is a film star and it was gambling with me despite being a junk, but it was not, I found a lot of humor, especially Alfred Molina star Spider-Man 2 Character Dock Oak. She was the most enjoyable part of the photo. Of course, like many people who bought this movie, I saw Matthew's name, and it brought me! And no part of it is big, at the very end of the movie it's too small, it's not a big part of what I believe is why people hate this movie. I recommend you give it a go. Some parts are a poor poor who require polishing, acting, and more steps. But it is watchable.
