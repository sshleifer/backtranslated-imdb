I was pretty impressed with this flick. Although there was obviously lacking in their bush, you took this movie for seven years and still got better. The acting was quite impressive and the story really captivated me. My only complaint is that the end was really a little accidental for my taste. But if your audience is more absent then this movie has been successful. <br /> <br /> I would really suggest watching an Italian athlete to see the Spanish talent Antonella Rios. Bad novel on acting). Antonella Rios really a star growing up.
