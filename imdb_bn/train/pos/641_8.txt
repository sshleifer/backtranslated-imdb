This show is a few clich√©s and some of the top, like Dawson's Crick-like moment (when a 16-year-old is in a sense when he is sensual?), But overall it seems to be a decent show. Most characters seem to be very real, and the story goes along with the pilot as well - ending with a good lesson in the end. I hope the first episode will not be life-changing, which will be very dramatic for this car. Jeremy works as a teenager with passion for the baseball baseball, I believe he can be related to the fear of many of us and sometimes he can give a tunnel to the team that he always wants.
