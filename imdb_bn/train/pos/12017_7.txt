"The Last Hard Man" is a common western for the 70s. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Pacinpah. Also this one, but director Andrew McLaughlin John Ford Pupil and it may appear in many scenes apparently. IMO is very good at starting. In a certain way, McLaughlan wanted to show the audience a tour of civilization in the desert. The third part has some unreasonable flaws and I have complained about Charlton Hesson. He will have to play an old former law enforcer named Sambargad, but he is an extraordinary physical figure. I have never felt that there is a problem to climb up to the horse or the rock. For me, he has not seen much inspiration in most of his epic films. Playing the daughter of the sheriff is very nice to be defeated repeatedly. Probably had troubles with both directors or were unhappy with their role. Harashi and Cobbler do not look their best but they are still good. What is the meaning of scriptwriter John Wayne, like Sambargad? Also Michael Sherwood as a modern Sheriff is underused a bit of his role. James Coburn, on the other hand, is out as Jack Provo. Coburn is one of these really great villains. She is portrayed as a bad guy in terrible hate and cleverness. His role and the best of his acting movie. <br /> <br /> Landscape and Shooting Out Great. The shooting scenes look bloody and violence realistic. Jake Provo and his gang had some serious and violent scenes. I miss the western step in the middle of the movie. I would appreciate something like a bank robbery or similar. Overall it is a recreational western spark. Not a great movie but rather a great Coburn, a very good start and above average due to some serious and violent scenes.
