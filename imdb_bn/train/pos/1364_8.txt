Before being the queen of independent film, Parker Pcci remembers the "side World Towers". In this film, Possi shows her potential as a top actress. In this movie, Umar Townsend with casting was Mustafa, a Lebanese immigrant, who worked as a Falafel salesman on the street, who wanted to become a teacher. Supporting cast plays a wonderful actress, who plays only family relative as her godmother and jodi, librarian who is an old fashioned, dedicated and menopause. Posey as Mary learns to grow up and become mature. Liberating his librarian Clark's loss, he understands how much he misses a place in his life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side village of New York City, before it gets a reputation with Upey. This film is very good for an independence and I have come to enjoy Parker Pussie as Mary and other characters from other films.
