My rating refers to the first 4 seasons of the Stargate SG-1 which is amazingly fresh, creative and addicting. When stepped through the ramp gate, did not know what else on the other side! At the beginning of session 5, the show had a different focus - still good, but different. <br /> <br /> This series follows the advent of people (and an alien) group, who regularly take part in a planetary transport device. "Stargate" The backstory of this series is based on the characters and incidents of "Sturgate" movie, which was discovered at the time of the archaeological excavation of Egypt. <br /> <br /> The episodes are light (innocent and easy to see) and very creative. Many of the innovative stories can easily be made in their own glorious movies. What happened next was always uncertain. <br /> <br /> The characters that show the show are also defined and defined. Their tone is severe, but the dialogue is flowered with incredible intelligence and humor. They just make fun to see <br /> <br /> Starting somewhere near Session 5, the series became a series based on a single enemy (Goyud, then Ory) war. Plots have become more complex (much more political / strategic-based) and contradictory The characters were as big as before, but the show was different in nature. <br /> <br /> One thing that must be mentioned is to see the episodes of the 100th and the 200th episodes. They just can not miss the display. They show creative and wildly ridiculous talents that carry the series through 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you're a scientific fan, watch some episode of the first 4 seasons and you'll probably be hooked. If you want to develop story lines between two opposing parties, you have 10 show events.
