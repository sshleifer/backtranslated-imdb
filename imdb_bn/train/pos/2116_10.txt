Ever a movie has been more charming than this? One reason why everything works well is that actors' teams really can communicate with each other and influence each other's lives. Its center is "romance" by James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan, who work together and can not face it, but who connect with each other completely as a pen pals. But romantic comedians (including the "You've got Mail", with the latest update to "shop") support characters, and then still do not whip up two leads and support their needs. Everyone can be a complex part of Arnest LÃ¼bitz's impressive rich dress. One of the most heartening scenes in the history of film occurs when the near-tragedy Frank Morgan undoubtedly searches for a Christmas dinner with someone and humbly. A must see! **** out of ****
