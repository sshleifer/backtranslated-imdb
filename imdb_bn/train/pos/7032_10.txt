My school's play club will set up this show in the spring of 2002, and I can hope that we are just like this! I recently saw this role as "research" of my role (Rossi Alvarez), and I want to say, VENSIEVILLE WILLIAMS is the best! <br /> <br /> Wow! The welding for this movie was on the right (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh, my gaud, is there something that he can not do? He was the greatest Albert Peterson of all time - I especially love the expression and dance of all his funny faces "Keep a happy face"! He is so great! VENESA WILLIAMS, I said before, the best. He was a beautiful Rosie, and his conversion from the secretary to seductress was completely credible. Ten Daly was ridiculous as Albert's objectionable mother and George Wendt was annoying. McAfee was fantastic as well (but I love Paul Lynd's performance in the 1963 edition!). Brigita Dao pushed me like Ursul Marchel; He really hammed it up! And Mark Koodish was an extraordinary Conrad Bardi ... "Trouble!" <br /> <br /> There was only casting which I did not understand, and you will see from the previous opinion, many other people 't understand Kimpha Phillips like Kim McAfee - What was? I'm really nice and very talented, but ... for the role he looks a bit too old. Eh, maybe I'm confusing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I highly recommend this movie. It will let you laugh! <br /> <br />
