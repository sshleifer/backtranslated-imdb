I just saw this movie a sneak preview and what I can say is ... "What I saw ????" And I mean that in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The plot is really simple. Stiller and black friends / neighbors play. Styl focused, hard working when Black is a visionary. Black creates a spray that invented the idea that P. The idea became very popular, and black became very rich. The Black Profits that are trying to be their best friend with Styler's amazing lifestyles and still become crazy by the jealousy of Stiller. <br /> <br /> I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is weird. With the sequence spelled up somewhere out of the strange, weird spin-off opening shots. Dialogues and acting are very weird; The way is strange in a rambling sort. And the soundtrack is the strange thing in the film, from the strange "jealousy" song which is seen in the scene where you think you are going to listen to the classic 80's song but it is suddenly in Japan. <br /> <br /> So, the real question is ... strange fun? The person who is completely dependent. I was looking at the strange oddity in the movie's charger. After screening I heard that people are terribly irrational and are happy to have it free. Curiously, I could understand their point of view. There is no joke, so if you are not employed by its uniqueity, then you will hate this movie. I hate it completely. <br /> <br /> This movie will lose lot of money in the box office and become a classic of DVD culture. If you can only laugh without any curiosity in a movie, just like singing or punched drunk love, then I suggest you see it. Do not you run away from this movie. It will just make you crazy.
