This is a brilliant political satire. There is no wonder that it has been largely ignored in the US: It really reveals our murderous foreign policy. <br /> <br /> Another good movie of this era, the radiance has been completely aborted because it has been shown correctly, the United States is a war machine for the oppression, assassination and murder of citizens for the whole world domination. <br /> <br /> A cute plot, well played, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsle, none of Marisa Tomie?) and some scenes of Hillary were supposed to hit this movie one. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are involved in genocide.
