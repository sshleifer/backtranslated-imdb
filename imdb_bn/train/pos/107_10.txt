Lars von Tears Europa is a very good movie. How was it There is a very stylish way to tell the story of Von Trier, at least he was with Europe. The whole picture was like an experience to me, even if I could see it on a small television screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete, the real and moving part of the film and most of the top 250 list movies. I think this is probably the most horrific, the highest Gothic and full movie. OK there are other good ones, but this one is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most annoying scenes ever.
