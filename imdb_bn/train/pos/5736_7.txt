Dumland One (American?) Focuses on the family's life ... Dad; A fierce and indecent person who fart and loves to love and loves those who have no redeeming qualities. Mother; Those who seem to be a madness psychology, really do not do much. The boy; A vague annoying repetition little colleague. Animation is easy and crude, but the story and character suits. Episodes are available mainly from DavidLin.com.com, but are now released from the DVD. The DVD has 8 episodes and follows a brief summary: <br /> <br /> 1 - Neighborhood: We meet the neighboring neighbor and find three things about him ... He has a beautiful shadow, he is just one Have hands and he likes to do naughty things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2 - Treadmill: We find that the wife has an affair for exercise, but the husband does not really think it is a good idea. In the end, the exercise is the winner of Treadmill. <br /> <br /> 3- Doctor: An unfortunate accident with an open live cable of the father ... The doctor's examination is quite thorough (if not incomplete) but determining "you are quite normal" (but we knew it). <br /> <br /> 4 - Visit a friend: As soon as the new clothes comes up to visit a friend (believe it or not, he is there! But after we meet him, why do you understand?), he There is no wonder about what hobbies are. Take the stick: We meet another neighbor, one of his stick is stuck on his face (although we do not find out how to find it there). Unfortunately, removing the stick from his neighbor's face is becoming more difficult (and more violent) than the expectation ... but ultimately he has won ... Jesus can be some ungrateful !!! My teeth were bleeding: this was my favorite episode ... and it was the most heart-repetitive and repetitive (yes, what does it say about me?). Not sure why the boy's blood started bleeding, but believe me it was short for the plot of the story. The story was not an intriguing, which is an oxymoron. But there is a fun ending (a fly involved) !! Uncle Bobby: After meeting Uncle Bob and Uncle Bock's wife, we get a unique feeling that the Dumbled Gin Pool is very shallow. Uncle Bob is a sick fellow (I will not elaborate, I will not waste it for you). Uncle Bob's wife definitely wear his family's pants ... and the father ends up in the wrong direction on his empty fist (and the rest of the rest left to cowering their trip into a tree behind the yard). <br /> </ br> 8: The kid goes around the ants, and the unexpected attempt of bug-spray becomes very bad ... He spreads himself in the mouth with a bug-spray and starts hallucinting. Charming songs and dance showcases the show ... He tries to kill the barbarians, the wind blows in the plaster of the whole body ... and just say, the ants finally retaliate. <br /> <br> Bad to these stories, there are some things that force me to watch. They give another insight to the mind of my favorite managers. David Lynch Maybe they had an outlet for him to get rid of some violent thoughts? I really smile laughing a lot in the episode. Many aspects are strange fun !!
