I'm not surprised, someone first thought of doing a movie like this. Horse is often the most effective when it uses real life dissonance as a theme. And someone (in addition to Steve Martin, The Little Shop of Horses) likes to go to the dentist. Tooth was done before the torture (see Marston Mann for example), but it brings terrorism to the suburbs. <br /> <br /> This plot revolves around the dentist, Dr. Alan Fynstein (Corbin Barnsen), who is crazy. Now our beloved doctor is not playing with the full deck to start, but he started attacking people around him, driven by jealousy and emotional-compulsive disorder. Doctors are leaning towards the mental state, we are near the character of Michael Douglas in the ficky down, but with the horrible end. <br /> <br /> Strawart Gordon and Brian Yunci, writing and managing Harrah Stewart, is a wonderful stream of his wonderful. Also featured in a police playing, Never welcome Ken Foree <br /> <br /> Now I believe that this movie will not work without absolutely fantastic performance from Corbin Bernsen. The LA had seen him before the law, I was overwhelmed by his acting. <br /> <br /> The Sickle Dentist 2 is also valuable, but slightly less than the original. <br /> <br /> Titkek's Bottom Line - A fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe, by the great performance of Bensen
