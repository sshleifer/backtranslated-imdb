Simon Peg has played a strange strangely and often came to work for a great American magazine from the control celebrity journalist who has been in England. Of course his winning ways made all kinds of complications. Comedy based comedy featuring Christine Donest (looking forward to being grown), co-starring Danny Houston and Jeff Bridges It works primarily because we love Simon Pegah despite her bad behavior. We fully understand why Crisson Dawn is talking to her despite her frequent screwups. I like the film It's not all at all and all but it was an excellent way to stop an evening sitting on the sofa for watching movies. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 7
