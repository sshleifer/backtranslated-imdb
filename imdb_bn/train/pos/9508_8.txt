In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Luz√°n) lives in an old house with his unstable wife Lola (Merida Perezes). Lola still expressed regret over the death of her son Augustine. The Colonel has been waiting for the war pension pension in the war against the Catholic Church for 27 years. However, for political reasons, the present government wants to forget this old war. In addition to any occupation or money, a valuable game, they are struggling to get recognition letters from government, money for delayed pension, and survival with the prospect of payment. This slow and sensitive film reflects the social and financial status of most retired people in the Third World. Most retired people in Brazil have to survive around $ 80,000 per month. In the story, the colonel's debt was made to provide a cemetery for his son, otherwise he would be buried as a non-resident. Reality in poor countries, which is very sad story, Cast's extraordinary performance My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): ('No he is escrowed too coronal') (Do not write to the colonel) <br /> <br />
