Eddie Ezard is not short of a comic genius, and Eddie is in a very good time. Its material is extremely malicious and sunny, and its delivery is the best thing ever to witness at the best level. Instead of insulting the audience's intelligence, he relied on him to wear his clothes, Hitler, the moon landing, and the humor from the British. With so many memorable smiles, no one can help but repeat some lines of it. Always more, "Do you have a flag?" Should never be considered one of the most fun lines distributed in a standup routine. The top groove standup comedy is required to see every fan "Dress-to-kill". The best British standup comedy I've ever seen, Eddie Izzard has struggled for success at the live stage. However, the lack of commercial success of the movie does not indicate his true talent. "Dress to Kill" found its way into a treasure, fortunately home video, and it should be enjoyed repeatedly and should be enjoyed.
