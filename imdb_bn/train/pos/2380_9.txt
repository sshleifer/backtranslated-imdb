I did not have all the walking mind. People do not really walk back then. It is a winding loan from this time piece and some perspectives of the Martians technology. I was very frustrated by the effects too, especially in the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider as one of the book's most exciting ones. But I can not commend the film for the faithful of the story of Wales! It's about time. Actor favorites and performances are charming. Also, this film is very valuable to hear only the true songs of the Jamie Hall. The same actor saw both the author and his brother in London.
