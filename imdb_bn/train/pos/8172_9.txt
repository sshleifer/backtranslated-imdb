When I was young, I was afraid of the blood of the film and gradually became less magical, until I became sure that many other viewers have become, so the dams of poor films made in the last few years humbled me but my fear or squirm me. "Dentist" has turned around. <br /> <br /> Setup seems easy: Mental physically dentists can penetrate the dentist and possibly destroy the body. The shiny mobile phone is a dentist, the film's protagonist, instead of being a decent bad guy without any obvious motivation, his development is the widest of a character and he is very human and credible. In this way the viewer sympathizes with him and expresses sympathy for his victims and instead of getting the hope of justice, I am optimistic that he will find ways to cover his tracks and return to normal life. <br /> <br /> "What makes a horror movie" is really violent. And "The Dentist" is better than any other movie. First of all, this film has a lot of tension, something that is lacking in modern cottage films. At one stage (), the dentist is emotionally disturbed and he has to first see a young child's patient. To reach the child's face, you expect that the dentist and the child do not face the face for request. I would not have looted what would happen. Secondly, when the Gorish comes, it is the worst, the skeletal nervous injuries. Again, I will not be able to give anything <br /> <br /> Of course, a movie you have never heard of, there is a problem. Most importantly, it's only for awesome fans. Also, another critic noted that, by taking space in just a few days, we do not really have any background in the characters. And a little point in the very last time to pull. But in reality, the characters we want to know about the background are also proven to be very good and proven that the majority of the film is strong enough that small losses of tones can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> After a few years of being used in the movie Gore, suddenly my eyes were covered with blood. "Dentist" scares me and makes me completely uncomfortable, and for this, it gets my complete approval.
