The story of "Women from somewhere" is simpler and nicely adapted than Eastwood Spaghetti Western: A mysterious stranger comes to a lawless city run by a highway and starts shooting the place. Even opening credits and music, Spaghetti thinks: Sergio Leon and Ennio Mikeron will be proud. The stranger that is really interesting is a beautiful (!) Female, a Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on Harley, and a place somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of gunfight, some good, some guessable, and the other spot is somewhat hockey, but this is a complete fun. Ryoko manages his gun with credibility and aplomb and gives them thugs due. It was not a physical challenge as it was a challenging challenge for her, but she managed to do very well things. He shows more acting skills in his acting skills, NHK drama, "Musashi". <br /> <br /> If I hold the fan of Ryoko Yenkurah (which I oddly) and / or the "girls with gun" movies and repeats it repeats the view. To me, some "brighter girls" of films like "Nikita" in La Fame "and" The Long Kiss Suvartri "are somewhat brilliant and unreasonably objectionable. And a fantastic glass acting Rico also played it, as well as the gobble on the cake.
