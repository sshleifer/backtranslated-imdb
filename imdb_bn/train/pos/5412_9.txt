As a Pokémon fan, I've enjoyed this movie a lot. It introduces new legendary Pokémon (as a movie) and adds depth to the relationship between its characters. But I do not even expect those Pokemon fans who do not want to enjoy it (this is included in most adults). Some of the lines were authentic, but it might be a bit inadequate when filming the movie in English. The animation was beautiful, although there were great parts that did not look good. And although Villain is a kind of fanatic, I think movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains and I guarantee you that not all of them are like this. I say to everyone who does not like it, but fans of Pokémon will like it.
