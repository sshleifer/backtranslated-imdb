I saw this movie in the morning hours when I should have slept. This, itself, was the testimony that Deliverance was a spell-binding movie. I think Boorman has done an excellent job to direct this film. How to show skill primarily with mountainous people and uninterrupted Banjos. It is so good and primarily how people in the area are naturally saved and easily shown. At the end of the case - at the end of "Dual", Banjo-playing boy smiled (liked his banjo), but when the "dual" was trying to push the boy out of the draw, the child was very preserved for responding. The river trip is sure to not bother you. The rape scene was cruel, but it was necessary to show what this group was against in this retreat area in Georgia. I think the terrifying Shock of the Potter was well done after. Some people said that he was terrified. I disagree - if you really pay attention, he was immediately reactionary during the whole process, in which Reynolds kept the arrows through the attacker and he followed the toothless man. When it was confusing, Ed killed another person in the upper part of the straw. It is often shown that when the arrow was crawled and the arrow was expected to be killed, the arrow was shot, but then you realized that the arrow you shot before it was realized that it was finally implemented. However, a great movie, and I was in my voting between 8 and 9, but after reading an unsolicited voter message it gave "1", I gave it a "10". This person's argument was based on personal bias rather than a motivated approach, and it was an irrelevant attempt to reduce its vote.
