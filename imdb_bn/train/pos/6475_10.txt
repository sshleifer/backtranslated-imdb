This 5 part play has only 2 episodes, but I can already say that it is one of the best things to do. It's TV, silver screen or even real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it is so good that it's almost morality! As a spectator, it's a boring anniversary of the mountain ranges from Monday to Friday instead of Friday. I am very annoying. It is clear that all these negatives are really positive. <br /> <br /> I am a modern man, who has previously gone from TV drama. Compared to movies, TV plays always seem to be dated, pretty tam, and good, generally annoying! "Five Days" has really brought TV drama into the 21st century, so at least, it changed mind. See it.
