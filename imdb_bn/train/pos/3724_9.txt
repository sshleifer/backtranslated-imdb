Tigreland follows the life of a group of recent draft men in the army urged to fight in Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> At this time, America knows that they are fighting a harmless war, and the director takes a documentary shot film of 16 mm hand list of various recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a genuine plot of character, but it is a character named Roland Bose, who is a helpless but intelligent man, who wants to escape from the camp. The story is waiting for the publication of the unit, we are taken with different letters. <br /> <br /> I want to say that it is a great story about Vietnam and generally more important about the army .. Great acting, and very memorable. The film's director and style also works very well, because it always looks like Vietnam's old movie footage. How does the film show that it was great to see all sabotage and problems were so important in the battles of this war? Special scene where Bose goes away from a training mission where a coach sees how using radio as a torture machine is just bringing everything to a brief war ... and it is in vain. <br /> <br /> Fantastic film. Individuals have to decide to determine what rights are morally by staying in the army rather than not just about the name. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 9 ratings.
