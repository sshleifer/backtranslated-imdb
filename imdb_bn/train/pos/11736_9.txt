If there is no familiarity with Kendrand Peterson's arrogant Elvier, it's a good place to start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, the brain of the dark" begins with our heroine. Message. It seems that his elder aunt is dead and he must be present to meet his wishes. He is excited to collect money for the show that he wants to open in Las Vegas, he hopes to get lots of money and lots of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place to go to him is Fallwell City, Massachusetts. Being spellbound because of his car break, he saw that his big aunt left behind three things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. The residents of the city have mixed reactions: teenagers like him, women hate him, and men wish him later (though they try to remain moral pillars of the community). His worst problem is going to be his big uncle Vincent (Dr. Morgan Shepard), because he wants his cookbook. It seems that the book of dogs is a book that will make him more powerful. <br /> <br /> This picture is really interesting, Pietersen Ur Elvira is a joke using her curiosity and sex ("And do not forget, tomorrow we see two things with ... I mean the thing with two heads") . Edie McCullus is particularly interesting as a fascinating pariah, working hard to keep the city in a tall town, but ultimately seems ridiculous (Picnic view is a perfect example). A peek deserves (film, of course, her boobs, not).
