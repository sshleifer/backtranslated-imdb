Sometimes I see a movie and are really impressed by it ?? And yet it's not easy to explain why I liked it a lot. Mostly true for this extraordinary movie ?? One can hardly compare it with rest. Good night Mr. Tom is one of these special movies. Is there a lot of passion in this movie ?? And while acting was so good that watching movies, I started crying and the story started moving. Young Nick Robinson ?? A small boy (William) was recovered from London due to the reduction of the aircraft during World War II. An elderly man, played by Mr. John John Thaau, was sent out to children who came out of the village. <br /> <br /> Tom first refused to take responsibility - to take care of such an irritated young boy? But he took the left without a choice. Mr. Tom discovered that life is so terrible for William? In addition to his luggage, his mother sent a belt and instructions written in the host to his son ?? Do not hesitate to use it. Is this belt berried on the field ?? Will not be used in such a brutal manner. Mr. Tom provides a real residence for William and the boy is happy with his new life, he goes to school, creates new friends, invents hidden talents. Suddenly a letter called William to London and said that he does not feel good? And it starts again ?? Just this time it gets worse ?? How much experience can you feel in this movie? Love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? And much more Good night Mr. Tom is another composer of British movie, comparable to Daily Frankie and Billy Eliot? If compared. I've really enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it. Before finishing this review, do I want to mention Thomas' amazing performance in Jack's role? A friend of mine from my own childhood reminded me (:
