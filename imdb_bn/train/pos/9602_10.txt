Darius Gius is a film depicting West American beliefs that makes everything possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful fun filled and sometimes hearty movie shows a young man who never expected, but wanted to see what was out of his beautiful city of Gaza in Athens. Darius wanted to see the sea. His longtime friend Logan, Ben and several good friends decided to make Darius's wish to be true. They started small - Ben and Logan began an email campaign to create awareness about the condition of Mother Darius's condition: Desenie Mascular sees DistroFy and Darius, not just the ocean, but the great United States. The friends of the young college will be successful in achieving confidence and awareness in the hope of this horrible disease. They dreamed of Darius and then realized something. When Darius sees love, care and funny tension, he keeps his life alive, while helping Darius to see how he can show similar characteristics to DMM's victims. Darius became a volunteer for the Red Cross - collected money on his chair outside his local chairman (with his friends). His wonderful smile makes the world dream that the dream is real - all you need is a group of hope and college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the boys an Oscar - and no one is worthy of it. Martha Swine
