This movie is exciting, brave and music is very good. Cinema Mowvala's album Bad (1987) was paired with. I feel bad This is excellent (*****). The film starts with Michael Jackson. "Man in the Mirror" on stage Next, it shows Michael's history directly from the first day of Jackson 5 in a bad era. Oh, and Badder better. (Badder is a music video parody of the music video for Bed the One). Then the speed demo shows the video. The song and the video are very good, very good. Leave me alone for the same, which is displayed later. Then it shows Munawalker a few minutes later, in simple criminal play in a club named Club 30. It is only when it is greasy. Then, you are beautiful to look at.
