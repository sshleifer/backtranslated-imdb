Basically I rented this movie for my daughter because she was interested in football - and I was not as frustrated (as opposed to football scenes without plots). As a father, I think I was surprised by the introduction of homosexuality - but I must admit that these issues as a parent are now fully available to children (i am uncomfortable with the subject). In this case, this emotion was a right to the main premises of the film - at any age you must have your children to believe in yourself. Jasmine (Jes) - a young woman from the British couple - this disaster is a former Indian tradition who dreams of playing professional football. Marriage of her elder sister in a traditional Hindu wedding provides a great opportunity for her future (in a great way) to discover her expectations and fears for her future. <br /> <br /> The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting strategy to explore Jesse's frustration with her parents' expectations - again there was no substance in substance compared to child-parent relationships. <br /> <br /> In Samaria, football scenes are great (learn a lot at slow pace) and when I did not need the story - there was a need to continue the film.
