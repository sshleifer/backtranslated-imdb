A few years ago, the vessel had maintained distance far from the creation of "Man of Honor", which was based on the experience of the first black master of a film to overcome the provocative racism of Major Diver's struggle. The best side of our navy is interested in supporting movies shown on the USS. Nim Itz and two helicopter attacking carriers, which were with the help of the coastal installation, were provided with a free rage to complement this great story of a young sailor's war. Some images shot on the USS. Bellaw Wood <br /> <br /> Anthon Fisher Denzel wrote the script for the director of Washington's debut, in which he worked as a navy expert, who acted effectively and deeply by Darye Lucch. <br /> <br /> <br /> A clearly brilliant enlisted man USS allocated Bellaw Wood (LHA-3), a front line helicopter attack platform. Fisher does not seem to avoid starting his own attack in less tense than his fellow listed men. As part of the possible pre-separation process, MD has been sent, Fisher is slowly exposed to black psychologist, reveals terrible childhood in great ignorance and expresses cruelty of cruelty. <br /> <br /> The story evolves carefully as Fisher, but increasingly dares to believe in his doctor and gets ready for love's interest, starring Cheryl, a listed sailor, played by an unusually beautiful Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> and agreeable hypocrisy among pastoral family settings. Most versatile actress Viola Davis, seen in most recent films, is an image of Sullen immoral, but nothing more than Mother Tate (Novella Nelson) who will earn less but visible scenes - if it exists - then <br /> <br /> photo patient Following a specific prediction about the therapist's conversation (all the transfer and replacement materials), but Fisher Bang's doctor / consultant's sincerity is actually molded. This is a good story, well said. Duration <br /> <br /> "Anthon Fisher" is not a service story as a "man of honor" in a real sense, it is an extraordinary film that deals with racial discrimination against a real person. No it's really a film about black. This is about living out of terrible childhood experiences and Fischer said that the victim declared in adults is still "standing tall". As a brave and strong young man, the oppressors, with the help of an oppressive doctor, claim to have the right to live a dignified life as a righteous young man, shrink the size and significance. <br /> <br /> My only deception is that a lieutenant commander in Washington but as a commander. In order to assist all the navy listed in the last achievement, the director of Washington must be told that his character, like all the following naval officers in the commander's post, is referred to as "Mr.". Not a big criticism, is not it? <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie is playing so much in theaters. It deserves comprehensive distribution. Derek Luc can get good Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
