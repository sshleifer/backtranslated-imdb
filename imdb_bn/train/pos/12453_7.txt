Unfortunately many consumers who wrote reviews for IMDb are not good at budget. There may be no need for this movie, more budget is not really part of it. Lots of big sets and special effects will make it into another Lara Croft movie. One step or two is better than what we are going to do here. <br /> <br /> Almost unknown Alexandra Staden is impressive as intelligent modesi, and this film is very important for working. Her cute little sunny and cute look is awesome, and you will not leak her face to the camera that senses herself. It turns out that the bad guy Nikolai, who is less known (at least in the US), Nicolas Costaar-Waldau can take extraordinary brains in him, some may use humility. She can only rape her with mockery and "stop wasting my time"! Then suddenly stopped the storm in its heavily armed but suddenly separated henchmen. <br /> <br /> Probably my biggest problem is playing a stellar staden Momesty, not very believable to take his hand. Beat him with athletic and muscle-like people like Coster-Waldaur. He can just throw a traitor punch who does not have the actress of PETA Wilson or a pump up-up Hilary Swink. Costaar-Waldo seems to be imposing himself on Staden, just as he wanders with his little sister. <br /> <br /> This is not an action film, it's not a big mistake. I hope they will make them better if they make them signals.
