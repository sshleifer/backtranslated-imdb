'The Mother' is an extraordinary part of filmmaking - it thinks you do not stop it - and eventually it lets you think. Very open ended as the lead character of the lead. Annie Reid (which I knew briefly from his appearance in Victoria's wood-led projects and thought of a fine comedian) is really fantastic here. Stereotypical widow housewife that was not perfect in marriages and mother tongues. And first of all that is not free spirit and adventure. He plays his character with just the right note which is the real ring (well, it did with me). Strong cast Great script. Actually European movie revival;)
