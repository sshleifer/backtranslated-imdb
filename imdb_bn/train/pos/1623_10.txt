This is a cartoon which will be won instead of country casino. Apparently good work and much more entertaining and memorable. Just worth watching for solo music! Although there are some elements that will undoubtedly damage some of the sensitivities, the cartoon must give a bit of perspective. It's 60 years old and after all, just a cartoon. I was inactive and as I was hyper sensitive as people who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage, I would curled up in a fetal position and be faded away. Sometimes you need to put your head back and float up, light up! The celebrities in the cartoons were common between 1930 and 1940, and they were often not terribly flattering. Bing Crosby hates it when he is used on multiple occasions. * Sighs *
