I absolutely love this soap. It has been my favorite one. Will be highly recommended :) ... I just love brazilian soap, they deal with real-life events. I'm really sorry that the soap is gone but I'm sure I'll be able to find it anywhere. For those who have not seen it, see it. I like how the last thing for letters, intrigue and villains turned out to be. The only thing I'll be changed is the end of love for Xica and her long life. I can see it again and highly recommend it. Xica has gone away, the best soap I have ever seen. Forget all else :) Go to XICA .. Hope you all do it well.
