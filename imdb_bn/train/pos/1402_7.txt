<br /> <br /> "Hole Man" is perhaps the most vulnerable movie that stars director Paul Verroven, "Total Recall", "Starships Truppers" and "Robcop". <br /> <br /> This is probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven stuck with a completely medieval script, and he made it the best. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is very good, with lots of curiosity jokes, great special effects, and even Soundtrack's Scan Annesi. Unfortunately, the film has flown in the second part, it turned into a standard slasher film or perhaps a very bad "alliance" clone. The finale is particularly ridiculous, as Kevin Bacon returns to life after most events. </ Spoiler>. And the whole thing is quite shallow, in fact: the disappearance is not fully investigated. <br /> <br /> Finally, with this movie, well-behaved well that makes Halloween grow. <br /> <br /> ** ** **** of 1/2
