I did not expect to make this choice; I thought it was very worthwhile and sincere, and rather plodding and lazy. <br /> <br /> This is actually better than that, and I really enjoyed myself. I do not know much about Queen Victoria, most of which are known - married to Albert, who dies a young person, and she later mourns him. He was interesting to see the situations he grew up; Actually I have seen myself as I saw more stories, and I imagine that we can see a signal at any time. <br /> <br /> The scene apparently is superb. The set and costume is very gaudy and incredibly lazy without top. Top grooves from everyone involved in acting. <br /> <br /> A word, it was great!
