I saw this series when it first came in the 70's. I was 14 years old and my father did not want to see this, so I saw it at my best friends' house. It became a weekly event every Sunday, and for anyone aged about 14, you would have to say a documentary about the often revered silence to say it was something special. <br /> <br /> The widespread expansion of World War II has made the document a difficult issue. The creators put it in the most important of all events and with each episode of each episode 'Volfac Pack', which covers long over the last six years of Atlantic War. Stalinager had an episode of its own. <br /> <br /> Today's documentary could not be made easily because most interviews have ended. The list of important players available at that time gives amazing insight to thinking at that time. Anthony Aden's Foreign Secretary, Carl Donets, H. Eubot's Ed, Albert Spahr, Pet Architect Confident and Hitler's Next Surgery Minister Hitler. In the subsequent episodes, we were Trudele Jans, Hitler's secretary, who was with him in Bunker and this was his last will and testament - he left Bonker after Hitler's suicide and fled through the Russian line. This incident and many others play a major role in the reality of illustrated incidents. <br /> <br /> If I have any criticism, the series is that the Code-breakers of the Blatchy Park were not included, but the release of their parts appeared in the series only after the series was created, so I can not blame the programmaker. <br /> <br /> The first title and music are fantastic, and Lawrence Olivier's description script lends a natural gravity. <br /> <br /> Best Documentary Series ever made? Without doubt
