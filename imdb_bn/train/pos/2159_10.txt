First, there is no way to use Remy as good, because Japanese society is different from us and it has played such a large part in this film, as explained in the earlier description. It adds humor to this movie as well as warmth. There are various supporting letters / personality killings. Each of these movies has a wonderful make-up. This movie is full of comedy which is not as lazy as most of today's "gross-out comedy". Yet it still has you laugh loudly In reality, in real life, you have no choice with which you work or go to school ... etc. This film really inspires and shows that human nature can overcome small differences. Not to mention, it makes for a great sub plot and lot of humor. This is a story that actually has a story and it's a good one. There are some stories that are not out of place, but actually support the original story. Really a good writing film. Dance is very great I can be a movie fan with any kind of dance, for that direction. However, this movie goes out of the way with other dances, it's actually a story and writing about the dance in Japan society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 10.
