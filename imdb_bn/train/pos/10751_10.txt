It is impossible to add this documentary to several words next. Each fiber in your body tells you that it is not okay with the openness of the fast-fire images through a clean-up finish shot in Grid Zero, but each frame is real. Two French brothers living in New York thought this story. Beginning "newbie" from Judas (28) and Gideon (31) Nudet (pronounced "Nou-day") Academy, New York City wants to create a documentary on firefighters and follow them fully through the 9-month-old premiere period. Fire extinguisher. Station 1, an engineer 7 engineer and fire-fighting actor, James Hanlan (36), played through the Academy's "Probes" and found one, Tony Bennetakos focused on a large part of his documentary. <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are either "White Clouds" or "Black Clouds" i.e. all kinds of fires follow "probi". The former meaning is followed by very little fire activity, but one day, the mother of all the fire will be there. Tony is a "White Cloud." After some initial growing distress, Tony settled in the Foundation House to make a season vet. Then untimely event happens .... <br /> <br /> September 11, 2001, a clean blue sky and a morning leak to Wall Street are supposed to start with a call to see. Because Zeus has little camera experience, Gideon raises a camera to his younger brother and tells him to go with the main T. T. Caffffer. At about 8:42 am, the firefighters started using their gas detectors in the hole. Then suddenly the flight of flying flying aircraft became visible and Jules seems to be upward, we see the first strike day. American Airlines flight 111 is facing the North Tower of World Trade. Pfeiffer ordered his men in the fire engine and they head for the World Trade Center. Once there, Zeus tells the tower to join the chief. Pfeiffer said to stay with Nouait. Once inside, the full impact of the growing disaster began to confront the men whose only purpose is to save lives. <br /> <br /> Gideon left the Neodet Firehouse and moved to the influential area. Once upon a time, he influenced Flight 175 of the second aircraft plane plane plane with World War II. He is with Chief Pfeffer inside the Zeus Tower. Gideon started to catch the increasing fear of Lower Manhattan, keeping an eye on public reaction and stopping attention. Within Tower One, Zeus recorded the last scene in the world, or loved ones will have their children, parents, cousins, grandfather, husband, son friend, friends one after the other, each fire-fighting equipment carrying 60 pounds of equipment will start long unexpected climbs wounded and trapped 80 stories read out! Zeus also highlighted his last notation with Chief Pfeiffer's brother Kevin, since he is going to perform his selfless job. It has also been found in the video that the term of the victim's dead body is faster than death by the smoke and smoke of the fire, by selecting the jump from the upper surface above the affected areas. But Zeus is respectful, sometimes he does not capture a sensationalistic moment ... money shot. His work is professional through his baptism of fire. After the second strike on the second plane, the second was destroyed by the destruction of the ruins and firefighters from the tower were expelled from civilian buildings. Then Zeus was caught in the fall of the Southern Tower and the first official victim was taken: Fire Department Chaplin Father Michael Jude Then Zeus and the Chief Pipherpiece made their way from the collapse of the Tower, and the tower started its structural collapse. <br /> <br /> <br /> Interesting views from the inside of the jaws of Zoos, which results in Zeus and Gideon working separately for recording on that day. Although alive, but not alive, everyone is horrific, everyone is horrific. Each firefighter reached the firehouse at the firehouse, they come back to it with a hug with each other. And a moment's emotions, Jules and Gideon are reunited. Because Zeus was crying on his brother's shoulders, Gideon arrested his younger brother, because Hannel created the issue of filmmakers. Tony Bennetakos, who seems to have left the station with the former head, has a terrible moment, looks like he's lost ... but coming back to the trap, this "probe" proves himself. <br /> <br /> With only three obstacles, 9/11 is a remarkable achievement in documentary film production. It comes up with the footprint of Hitenberg's footsteps in history. The matter of Naudets is appreciated for handling their theft. In the lower hand, the trend will be on the breathtaking side, but Naudets blaze their eyes towards dignity and compassion. As told by Hannel, we remember him as he took the audience through September 11 events. Robert De Niro directs this event to a cruel, modest way. She does not look for cameras for her own glory, but she mentioned the scenes she is going to see. I appreciate CBS for their courage at this special airing. Punished for their efforts to lose ratings, they upset their editors' emotions toward those who died. For anyone who needs to remind them of the true heroism, it must be seen. It is not a basketball drilling, nor selling an album of hate songs ... 9/11 about humanity at its best. Heroism at the cost of its superiority and independence <br /> <br />
