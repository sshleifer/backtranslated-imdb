I like this picture, initially shiny graphics appeared to be strange with Danny Footage but I got it fast. Thousands of footage shots have been made and I really appreciate the work done to finish it. If you are easily frustrated by drug and violence, then this may not be a movie for you, but here are some cool characters (and some real blur). Technically, I liked it, they must have used a new de-interlacing algorithm, or maybe the footage that looked so dark but I would not be bothered to see the normal paintings seen in the video for the transfer. (Open water made me nuts, mostly because cheap, progressive cameras are now available and I do not see any excuse for not doing any shelling if I want to screen in the movie). Sorry that my own little rant If you are sometimes involved in the music scene, I must definitely recommend this movie, it has some tragic moments but it is mostly ridiculous, but it may be laughing at my other misfortunes but it's a classic piece.
