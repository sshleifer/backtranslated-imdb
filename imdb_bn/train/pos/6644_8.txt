After waiting for many years, Ana Reverse Seidons' 1979 book, "The House Next Door", is finally illustrated. The result goes a bit far away from the novel, especially if the first story of the triangle is dissatisfied as a TV movie, it can be understood, which is completely absorbed and really good, not as big as a book, Stephen's one <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br />, especially the climatic revelation, at the very end. <br /> <br /> However, the entire custom stupid dislike works well in this thoughtful story of disrespect. There are some unnecessary cheap shocks but horrible growing environments well developed. Indeed, one of the most annoying scenes involves an abstract painting of an apartment trying to visualize his corruption on the canvas by a amateur-artist neighbor at his doorstep. <br /> <br /> Do not forget to read the great novel.
