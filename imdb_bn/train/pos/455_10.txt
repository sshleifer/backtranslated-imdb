The "magical" film is not a very powerful word for spelling. You find yourself resting and seeing others in more bright light ... a movie that can affect viewers is a serious consideration. Sometime we are soaked in beauty like this. That was not enough, it's fun. Performance is exceptional, without exception, but special mention should be made by Miranda Richardson and superb Jose Walker - both are open as roses. <br /> <br /> Why is not this movie DVD? It is worth living forever.
