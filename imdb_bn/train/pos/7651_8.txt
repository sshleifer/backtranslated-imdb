An interesting TV movie based on a truly real, deceived by a prisoner that describes the leading character. Giovanni Ribisi has a fine mission to determine whether her brother's brother will appeal to the court for his death sentence. But when he entered Elias Cotas to see him, the problem started.

Magazine is very sophisticated for a language that has spent most of his life behind bars. This feeling came again to me, who met an old friend, whom I had not seen for nearly 15 years, which he spent in several paleontological fishermen. The young man I wanted to know was not totally, but because of the exposure of the punishment system for a long time. There are prisons and prisons, one must say, but the "shot in the heart" is definitely outside the world.
