I was lucky to see this fate of a lucky movie festival and saw that I saw that I came back again for the second of the three screenings the following night. A fun, brutal and sharp tooth attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment, undoubtedly, the lowest-common-collector took the target audience naturally, which frustrantly took the member slowly for his guerrilla war. Everything about the movie, and the expected and refreshing way to expect it that you are released after the credits are renewed, and the original movies can still be made. Someone will be frustrated with their incomplete expectations to enlighten their fantasy, but it will work very well to find the item (and find out the meaning of hunting). Fight Club and any of the Charlie Kaufman movie fans, and those who need to see someone who can avoid avoiding multiplexes like a sudden.
