Despite the feeling of most "Star Wars" fans, in my opinion "Winning Returns" is the greatest cinematic film ever produced. As I have seen it for the first time, it has embarrassed me about depth, intensity, special effects and moving stories. The film is so well kept that it has been able to stand in the exam of the last 20 years. As the ultimate form of the powerful trilogy, George Lucas gives us an enthusiastic finish in the "Star Wars" sea in our "ZD". [6] <br /> <br /> I saw the movie essence (which does not have spawels for them) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Empire Strikes Back" We finally ended the story of the "win-win" story. Darth Baidar, in a mental unrest, surprises a new incomplete death star under the supervision of its construction. The emperor first met in this film because there is a final plan to destroy the rebel coalition and the young Louis Skywalker was brought to the dark side. Luke, Lando, Lia, Chevy, and Drood, Lord of the Tattoo Tours to rescue all criminals Han Solo; My graduation After the rescue of Han and after Jabba was defeated, Luke came back to Dagoba to come back and hide, where he learned the terrible truth; Actually his father Darta gentleman! Re-group with rebel hero rebel flit Now with the exception of Man Kalamari, other species and nations have been joined, Rebecca must certainly plan to attack the top to destroy the Death Star before it can be done. Although Landro encounters a space attack on Millennium Falcon, rebel heroes must disable the Death Star Slope Generator on the End Moon. The ribs rash here, but it happened on the powerful eovksk. During the intense war, two parts would be leuked in the third war, because Luke sent him intentionally to Bhadar for deliberately leaving the dark side. In the embarrassed sequence of events, Luke must face his father, because the emperor removes his dark emotions. Young Skywalker is facing his death in Palpatine's hand, and the gentleman surrounds his wicked master to save his son's life. <br /> <br /> The good versus Temple is full of a deep continuous story, "Return of the Jaddy" is a spectacular, emotionally charged movie that best describes us all.
