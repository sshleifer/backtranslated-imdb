The people who claimed this were another "bad language" fiercely beaten in the Mexican movie. They are right, but this movie is called for awareness about what has happened to us. The awkward truth is frustrating, or when you have already accepted recognition of acceptance as the only possible goal of Third World War. One of the most important things of "Siro von Quatro" is the open invitation of a deep reflection about our current identity. What are we all that? We want to be all that? I am abroad and I have realized that how the Mexican society was destroyed when the Malaysian society tallahac happened. I still can not understand the mass murdered murderer. I puked around when I saw some pictures. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, there was a small village near Mexico City when dissatisfied with the media and the government. The situation of this picture deeply disappointed me. Other stories illustrate corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and other situations of violence, but I think "Tamil De Chiba" is the best. <br /> <br /> This film is deeper than some "Cabaron" and "Pendjo". screams. Those people are meaningless than the action. With a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human waste. Just like real life, honesty is going to be an exception than the rule of our country. Moreover, honesty is only miraculously rewarded.
