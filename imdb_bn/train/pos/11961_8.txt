I thought it was time to spend time on a very nice summer holiday, sitting in the air-conditioned theater and watching the light-hearted comedy. The plot is easy, but the dialogue is witty and the character is desired (even the best bread suspected serial killer). It may be a bit frustrating when they realize that it is not match point 2: eliminating the risk, I think it was proof that Woody Allen is completely in control of our style and many of us are in love. <br /> <br /> I used to laugh at the interest of Udyyi at the age of the year (boldly, a decade?). Although I have never been influenced by Scarlett Johansson, so she was able to drag her "sexy" image and was able to look at the average, but the cheerful young girl <br /> <br /> It may not be the jewel of the crown. His career, but it was more intelligent than "Devil Wears Pataa" and wanted to meet with a great comedy friends more interesting than "Superman".
