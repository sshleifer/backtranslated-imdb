This is a good show, and I find it interesting. Finally the bad Latin Stereo is on the type! Â¡Gracias, Sunrise Lopez! I love this show, and I just started to see it three months ago. The whole idea about a Latin family TV show really surprised me. I'm surprised that finally there's a good shot on Latino's TV. This show is probably the best I've seen, it's fun, heartfelt, sensitive, and beautiful.
