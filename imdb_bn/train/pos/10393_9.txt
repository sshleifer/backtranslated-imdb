Let's cut short a long story. I like it every minute. The real Arab-Knights style is a fantastic imagination. There is an evil magician, a beautiful princess, a djinn and everyone lives happily afterwards. Modern Hollywoond has one or two things to learn from this classic. Quibble only: Special date beautiful date (although Sabu likes djinn's legs, though!)
