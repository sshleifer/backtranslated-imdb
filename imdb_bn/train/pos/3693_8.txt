It's not easy to create a movie with 18 different stories. Although 18 different international directors have accepted the challenge, not all of them are good, some of them are annoying. But its entity, "Paris, J.T.Ime" is exciting, it shows that it is "love everywhere", especially in the city of love as "love indeed". Here is a resume of 18 different stories (I will try as much as possible spellar-free) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A man finds a parking spot, and walks through a lot of strange couples, why is not he finding a girl? And suddenly, a woman went mad with her car. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another poor order, about three teenage boys, Looking for 'donkey pieces', suddenly, traveling directly to a Muslim girls, taking help from one of the boys. Really basic, but it's with a sweet heart. <br /> <br /> LES Marais - it was a huge disappointment! Although a love story between two boys with an Arts background can be interesting by the great Van Sant. Finally, whatever comes after Uiliyya's integrity is good, before all things are just boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tilere - The order of the brothers in the entertainment order. Buscemi - even saying a word - is mesmerizing and the whole order is just fun. This one kept me hooked up to the very end, and this one gets you really hooked to the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - There is a beautiful story, even if the execution is poor. This is the story of a Hispanic woman who left her child, in the morning to take care of another sub-baby child. Beautiful <br /> <br /> <br /> Some types of shampoo salesman came to the Chinatown-Lstelike place of Paris. If I could understand correctly, the story is about the inner beauty, but I think I am wrong. <br /> <br /> Boston - Really nice arrangement. A man meets his wife in a restaurant to break her in order to escape with her daughter. But the wife has some devastating news. Beautiful basic, but really sad and beautiful! Place des Victoria - as well as a sad sequence. Juliet Binouch plays a sad mother. One night, he woke up listening to his dead child. When he comes to the position, a cowboy tells him that he will give his child's last farewell. One of the best parts! Tour EIFFEL - Those two fall into love may be great, but, although it has some excellent cinematic tactics, the story is not funny and funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU original and great sequence, the best one in the movie! A young girl and an old man discuss their future and their fears for a particular person ... The Kuoran does a great instructional job and the actor is amazing! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - An American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug dealer. Again a beautiful segment, a very tragic ending with a place day fitting - a woman comes to homeless people, she starts talking romantic to her ... because she loves her life. Nice, sad, frustrating, romantic, ... Place des FÃªtes everyone will cry. <br /> <br /> Paigal - The annoying sequence between Arthur and Hussein, who is looking for a new thrill of their relationship ... Very strange and overwhelming, Pigalle is a let-down. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> La Quinta de la Madeleine - bringing some diversity of movies, QdlM is a relief. A young man (wood) finds a victim killed in a vampire ... tourists and vampires ... fall in love! Dark, scary and weird Romantic, Madeleine fantastic <br /> <br /> Perry-Lachouch - Another lot-down segment. Guided by stars such as Wes Craven and Mortimer and Suevel, it could have been great, but the pair-layout is not only general, but also original. <br /> <br /> FAUOURG SAINT-DENIS - Rumors are true, Twyker's short film is beautiful, stunning and well-done. A blind guy picked up the phone and after listening to his girlfriend (Portman - really amazing) he paused him. He reflects their relationship. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - Although this segment is managed by Depardieu and has such a star as Rowlands, Gazara and Depardieu, this segment also has lot-down. Nothing happens, lack of chemistry among actors. <br /> <br /> 14th Expedition - The last sequence is ridiculous and sad at the same time. An American says about her trip to Paris in the French class. His French is really terrible, but at the end of the segment, he realizes that Paris is much more than meets the eyes. <br /> <br /> In the background, "Paris, J.T.Ime" ends with a sweet voice, I do not give it a break, although some parts disturb me from hell, the movie is great! A true movie experience for young and old. Paris, J. Tayam!
