A great Neil Simon is based on two comedy comedians playing his hit game. <br /> <br /> Great combination, especially when comedians questioned Matthew and Barnes. Little wonder why Barnes won an Oscar for this; She is sharp and as fun as ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is delighted to see each other of these two favorites, together with their scenes make this film a complete delight. I myself, especially "racing, nose, walk / enjoy"! View And if you are a fan of Barnes or Matthouse, then you will also enjoy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You really enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars Keep a little "sunshine" in your life.
