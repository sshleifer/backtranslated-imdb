Engrossing the four men's drama on weekends canoing down a remote river. They are pacifist Ed (John Voitt), Adventure, Violent Lewis (Bart Reynolds), Insulting Bobby (Ned Bati) and Exciting People Drew (Ronnie Cox). The first 40 minutes are superb - incredible dual banjo sequences, interesting interplay between characters and only the stunning widescreen displays of Villimos Jesigmond. Then the two mountain climbers Ed and Bobby attack. One of them rapes Bobby ... and the trip becomes nightmare. <br /> <br /> Just incredible. Visible incredible beautiful yet these horrific violence is happening. To be truthful, BTi's rape never bothered me - I'm aware it is being faked despite good acting. This film also shows how the characters change - Ed has tested his peace, Lewis has become weak, Bobby violated any person before him, and London tried to keep himself brutal. John Burman's guidance is also very reassuring and the sounds of forests and rivers greatly help the mood. <br /> <br /> The acting is mostly good. Voight lead is okay - he has been good. Betie is okay - but it's his first film and he boasts of taking such a risky role. Especially very good when Cox's Bazar start falling apart. And Reynolds is just gorgeous - never one of his best acting act! I can not escape how the academy is nominated for the prize. It is also very credible, like Bill McInnney and Herbert Quard Hillibili. <br /> <br /> A strong movie - Not for children. Try to see an uncut version - TV version is butchered. Also capturing breathtaking images seen in the private boxes are essential.
