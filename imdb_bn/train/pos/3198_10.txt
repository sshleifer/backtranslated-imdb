I feel like seeing this movie. I love it It was fun. But I was feeling a feeling that I saw a sticky scene in someone's mind and started laughing to laugh, because it was going to create an interesting point. A friend puts it this way: <br /> <br /> "I think we've broken into someone else's house and now seeing their terrible home videos without their knowledge." <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is a stranger than a piece of fiction. "Gourovin Gary", the original "Beaver Kid", is a small town man who wanders on nearby TV stations hoping for a movie - and, of course, as he was not initially expected. With high hopes of fame and prominence, he invited Harris and discovered a truly terrifying talent that he organized in his home town - by his own drag act "Olivia Newton-Dawn". <br /> <br /> Director, Trent Harris, this does a great job with a growing story. In the story of the release of sexual violence in small city America, on the basis of the next two revisions, some footage of such a painful child, who wants to be a morpheme. Harris simultaneously criticizes the American spirit, celebrity religion, film and television industry exploitative practices. <br /> <br /> Both the Sun Pens and the Grispin Glover acted in stunner. A young Shan Pen is the most provocative - he closely follows 'Gary Footage', but with a strong signal Haris feels interactive with the way he wants to go. <br /> <br /> The last Gary has ended Gary, who was removed from me - when contrary to this possible explanation. <br /> <br /> Do not miss a movie. I did not see anything else. <br /> <br /> Jacob
