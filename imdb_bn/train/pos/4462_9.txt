Among the best musical instruments, Anchor Aviu has several memorable music signings, such as Kelly Jerry Mouse dance, Kelly Dancing with 7 year old Sharon McManus, playing Jonna Itbery piano, Sinatra with Etherby, Kathryn Greson sang, and more. Technicolor is perfect, some innovative camera works, such as the below, transparent key, and the piano through the grasson song can be seen through the other cameras' finder. The plot is thin, but you are involved with Kelly and Cyanat. On a sailor's vacation, a boy escaped to their house (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra fell for his aunt. To establish him with aunt (Grace), Kelly proposed that Senate could get a myth with Jose Iturere. But this young man of Sinatra and neutral, and falls in love with his song very quickly. They are trying to communicate with Itterbury, who were never available, they started reading for another girl (Barbara Briton); But Kelly now falls in love with Grayson. Anchor Aweigh is often remembered for combinations of live-action / cartoon sequences with Tom and Jerry, but there is more to it that a look. I give it nine stars because it's not as good as the best music - Singin 'in the rain, the music man, Oklahoma - it's one of the first class of the big type of technicolor. St. Louis was the first), and better than the others.
