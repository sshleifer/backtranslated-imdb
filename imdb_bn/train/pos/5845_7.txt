I enjoyed this film more than I expected; From reading these other comments here, I think it will be of great benefit to a delightful and enthusiastic audience company, seeing the film's full-size screen. I was lucky enough for this experience, I got involved in the laughter wave around, and there was a great time with this weird comedy. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy which burns it, if it shines anywhere at all. The music is not something special - in fact, I did not understand it was a musical instrument, and it was astonishing when the ancestors burst into a semi-spoken songwriter - but I must accept half-threatening, half promise, 'Oh, what I will do ...' It was much more interesting than the time it seemed that it is still rolling in my head and going round! As it is, the history of the history of French is often pivotas, which is a prominent century painter and fur coat, a 16th-century portrait. His idea of ​​purity of marriage does not cry much with his remote descendant, Countess Angelina, and anyone can hear the story of the sea under the strain of production code to ensure that heroin is unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But where the script and movie actually come, follow the gender In war Douglas Fairbank's junior Betty Grable's married Angelina Jr.'s concurrence is similar to her follow-up in Batty-Grauble-A-Frances, which changes the whole role according to the hello fantasy sequence where she literally closes her legs. This is probably the comic climax of this plot, although the consequences of the colonel's confusion are working with the final touch of the remaining two 'performances' of the operat structure-frame and Fairbank's delightful, disrespectful awakening is more or less of its own admission price. <br /> <br /> The wrist is full believer for the establishment of two opposite letters, wisely gets the chance to sing almost all (limited) singing and honoring parts where quotes are related to dialogue between various oral duels. But in the case of unclear feedback he is really outclassed by his male support leader; Fairbanks are a complete treatment for a number of silent categories, which are designed for continuous screening and humorous screen. <br /> <br /> This film is very disproportionate to style, which is different from surprising respondents. To hackneyed tedium But it's really genuinely very funny, and finally brought a round of spontaneous applause and smile across the auditorium as light up. Contemporary audiences may fail to draw - but, in this exhibition, Gregor and Prammmer, (strangers) both really denied. This is not a great composition, but a small amount of leisurely work, and I remind myself for one and return home.
