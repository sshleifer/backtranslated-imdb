Albercoc is a film that contains all the elements of a West Way class, except for the other: the story, which is really a class or a part of C. It was acceptable when the film was made, when people were thrilled to see the west color, but nowadays it just looks very primitive. Yet for those who enjoy the old West, this is an entertaining, original color and the word is very easily placed in the DVD which has recently come out. Gabby Hayes is a good sided, Lone Chanie always means as, and Randolph Scott is a little more delightful than usual. In a movie called Alberkeque, you will see something that will remind you of the city, but the city shown here can be anywhere.
