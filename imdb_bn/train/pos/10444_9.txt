Sweet and impressive, funny and ruthless, less intriguing, but meaningful, "Sanire's Before" (1995), Richard Lincoln's third film, loved by all, love, love, love, but still devoted it to the dream and find it. Hope to get it. This is one of the very rare movies that will be equally attractive for teens / parents and even grandparents. It seems to be a very easy little movie with no spectacular visual effects, carriage, or long and steamy sexual scenes. In the early 20th century, two young students (American traveler Ethan Huq, who is returning home after summer in Europe and French student Julie Dellie, who goes to Paris to join the class at the Siroben) meet a train. As soon as they start talking to each other, they are attracted to each other, they stop the train in Vienna where they explore the city all night. They read and read. That's that, that movie. It can be annoying and stupid, but instead, it's a beautiful, trustworthy, clever, and ongoing romance that gets better with just about every visit (at least, for this audience). High praise and my sincere gratitude goes to two charming characters, excellent writing, always interesting and malicious dialogue, two extraordinary performances and directors and writers to distribute the magic atmosphere falling into love. Julie Dellie, who looks like Boscelli's angel, is smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young young girl.
