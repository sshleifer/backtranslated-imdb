This movie was so great! I am a teenager, and I and my friends love the series, so it shows that these movies attract attention of people of all ages. I recommend it to everyone. Logan Bartholomew says that my favorite line of the movie: "Pink Cheek", when she is talking about her baby girl. She is such a great actor, as well as Erin Cottrell. They are very well up, and have such a great chemistry! I really hope they can work together again. They are such interesting people, and very good actors. I finally found that the movie was found better. Recently, for me to find good films, and good morals, and Christian values ​​were difficult to show. But at the same time, this movie is not sugar.
