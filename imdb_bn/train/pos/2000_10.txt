When I was Scout 8 in school, I took part in a small product and my mom bought a video for me. I have liked it since !! When I was young, I enjoyed the music and spectacular dance style but since I grew up, I appreciated the acting and character of the character. Oliver Reid and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can not imagine anyone playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. The best character for me is Saturn Wallis' Nancy. He had so much objection to the boys, I think he is such a strong character and his final scene when ... well, you know ... always crying to me! Always my opinion is the best musical instrument. It's going on all the time, it will come many more years! 11/10 !!
