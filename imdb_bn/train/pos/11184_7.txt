The doctor from Chicago is going to teach Louis Cad Mines at the University, because he moved to a big house near a small town. Alongside him, his wife Rachel and her two children, Eli and Gaze, as well as Eli's Cat, Church. Soon, they meet with their new neighbor and the old man Jude Crandall. Zui not only warns Louis and Rachel about the dangers that are running out of their home highways (which is a way of continuous use of large trucks) but also shows that the family is in a pet cemetery near their pet. Jude began talking about the importance of the pet's grave, but Rachel was against her children talking about death and spirituality, because her sister Jelda was killed. <br /> <br /> In the first week of the new home family, Louie has already tackled dead people: Victor Pasco, a student who was injured in the automobile accident, personally refers to Louise, although two strangers. On the night after Pasquo's death, Louis feels that he believes that it is a very bright dream that he meets Pasco, who takes him to a cemetery and warns Luis, "Go beyond what you feel." Louis rose from sleep and believed in the morning the next morning that it was only a dream, until he discovered the beds covered with needles of his feet and pots. However, he dismissed the dream. Many strange things start to happen and the Church, Eli Cat, die on the highway. Louis Alley is worried about going to talk about the death of the church, but Jude is in sympathy with him, taking Luis to the pet's grave to bury Jude Church. But instead of stopping there, Jude leads Luis further on the horrific journey of "Living Cemetery": an ancient cemetery that is once used by Mikmac ('Indians ...'). There, on the instructions of Louis Jude, the cat was crushed, Jude said that the bodies buried there returned again. And wherever the horror story begins ... <br /> <br /> I personally see this movie very well. It's not the most awesome of all, but it's one of the best horror movies I've seen. Gaze dies, it's almost impossible not to be in your memory, especially a child. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A dangerous highway near his home? How is a gaseous tragedy or after a truck hit? Why does Louis every member of his family continue to be resurrected to know all their members alive as alive? Things that do not give any idea, but I understand that some horror scripts have some spiritual ideas to work. <br /> <br /> I saw good things in this movie, talk about death with children, your religion does not matter, or if you are an atheist and do not help in avoiding important things. Luis was afraid to be honest with Elijah, because he was facing him and his cat would not return again, all nightmares started.
