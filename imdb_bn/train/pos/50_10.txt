My kids just stopped this night this night and really got tired of my interest when things started playing. I had to bowl out for the bowling league so that I could record them in the DVR so that I could see the rest later. Well I got it done watching and must be soaked after shaking buckets in front of my shirt front. It was an extraordinary movie, though I often felt the pain and pain of these girls. And I could never have imagined the reason for this beautiful girl coming out of Anti-Social Goth for a million years. This is probably why my shirt was soaking because I felt the same pain that Alicia was feeling. I could not even find this movie, but I'm sure I saw it. Very moving, very touching. Great for those who love good plays or tiar-zakaras.
