Gandhi, The Great: <br /> <br /> The greatness of the world lies with the great people like Alexander, who lie falsely than being glorified for great great people. Gandhi is considered to be great, not to be great, but to be more human because I have always believed that humanity will bring us where there is the glory of human lying. Gandhi was human with humanity and who fought for his self-sacrificing struggle for humanity to fight for humanity but not to his enemies. <br /> <br /> Gandhi is about my father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director succeeded to illustrate this story of a son whose father was the greatest man to walk the world. The film succeeded in telling a father about the story of a misleading son, who led a nation to greatness. The film is called the criticism of the failure of the father to Gandhi's son, but rather I want to say that Gandhi as Father of a Nation created a father to judge as the father of a nation. <br /> <br /> I want that the essence of this film is not only in India but the land of Gandhi, but this world exists through the hearts of all people. <br /> <br /> Gandhi is a real human.
