Ten years after this event was first televised on TV, I did not believe and delighted the audience with the unique mix of comedy and horror. This exhibition has created a good part of modern British humor: Dr. Terrence's House of Hernell; Garth Merghey's DarkPlace; Almighty Boosh; Nose box Many have imitated the style of this show, and I do not deny anyone has exceeded her standard. But the ability to memorize Germain Dyson for his ability to start acting with actors Marc Gattis, Steve Pemberton, and Race ShraSamyme. <br /> <br /> They created together a small town of Ravenna Vassi in the brutal countryside of England, where the locals and strangers who come from an emotional couple by uncertain tourists and passers- want to keep free; Where the unemployed people are insulted and insulted at the job center; Where a farmer uses real humans as horrific; Where one animal killed all the animals, he tried to heal; Where a Gypsy Circus kidnapped people; And the Butcher where to hide the people, add food to the secret but inevitable. <br /> <br /> It is just a whip to see what the audience can find among the League of Generalmen. By themselves, three actors give birth to dozen and unique characters. Make-up and prosthetics so well I think I'm actually watching a lot more actors than the show. But they also performed very well: they changed their voice and movement of the body and actually became other people. <br /> <br /> Most of the trick starts somewhat from the real life and then unsettling by doing something, sometimes gut-wrenching. Sometimes it is pure horror, such as Papa Lazarou's character without a set up. Imagine a vague circus owner to make somebody go in the house and kidnap women to kidnap women. No explanation given. It's that weird Then there are numerous references to the horror film: Se7en, The Silence of the Laughs, Nassafratu, The Exorcist, etc. <br /> <br /> Fearful fans will like it, fans of comedy will like it. As a traveler knows to enter, there is a sign that 'Welcome to Rooston: You will never leave.' This shows that any viewer will agree on a chance. After discovering the League of Gentleman, you will not want anything else, you will not forget it.
