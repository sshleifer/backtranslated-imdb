A great story with a message. Joan Platyte is fantastic as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is delighted as "coach" and Richard de Clarke plays the role of "Carmin" nicely. Mishna Burton as "Frankie" puts on a good performance and "Hegel" as well as playing his first lead in Ingrid. This picture is wildly directed by Joe-Beth Williams. First rate of editing
