Diane and I have seen this great movie today in Framonte, and we both agree with the Perish films that it was the head and shoulder. I said that in short, we wrote five to ten minute segments, which wrote the film and this theme had a theme around which each piece was composed and the theme had love in different forms. <Br/> <br /> This picture apparently takes place in the varied array of Paris and thus gives a special smell to each section. Because of only a few times in Paris, I was not quite knowledgeable enough to recognize the locations, but I'm sure the Europeans and especially French people can easily recognize the locations of the city. In any case, the audience is immediately drawn to each story due to their productive excellence, so that the locations of these cities can be frozen in consequence. <br /> <br /> The movie moves quickly and the viewer goes on exploiting a new scenario. One is on screen. Some of these stories are not graphic like Hollywood's nonsense, they are too vivacious and idle and mild, as the best way to sell and sell and sell and sell the beauty of life without the media's instantaneous sales. Sell ​​... <br /> <br /> Take care of anyone with you and allow this witch little film to bathe like spa treatments and you will feel renewed when you leave my guess.
