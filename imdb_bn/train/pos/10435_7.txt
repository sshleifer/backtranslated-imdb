My watch came late too, but I'm glad that I saw both this and Siegel together ... which gave me a glimpse of romanticism, such as the pure and fundamental treatments, to appreciate these flare-makers ... and from the idea of ​​a very different relationship! Since the movie has been written long ago, it would be appropriate to highlight only a few parts of the movie that I personally liked. <br/> <br /> <br /> I think where Jesse and Celine Phoenie were calling their respective friends to each other, it was absolutely impressive that they did not extend 24 hours to travel ... both of them curiosity, one of the major influences on each other Seems to be able to throw. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actors will become what happens to them. It will be difficult to prove the right or wrong even the right holder ... to be character, the actors must go beyond life guidelines and stories ... here both actors are not just right! Kuds .. !!! And another feather before sunset that makes it even more beautiful!
