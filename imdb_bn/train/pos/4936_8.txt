When working hard with pneumonic plague (a form of bunionic plug), the US Public Health Service officer Dr. Clinton Reid (Richard Wydmark) immediately gave quantum quantities to everyone in the body. Unfortunately, this path has been achieved strictly by murder, and there is a good chance that the murderer will start spreading this disease, which will turn into epidemic. Enter the police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), as soon as possible to find out the killer and prevent possible national disaster. <br /> <br /> While the Panic in the movie is a quality film, it suffers a little focus and a bit too big (my score up to eight to score). It is surrounded by silent gangsters, medical disasters, police procedures, thrillers and even romance styles. <br /> <br /> It's not the best act of director Ilya Kazan, but it's a humiliating issue. Czan is named as Artist's named Designer (1951), On the Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955) as the best artists of this type. This picture predicted them, but Czan said that he was already "strangers" in the studio. The freedom that can take away too much may partly account for the explosion. This image is located in New Orleans, a city where some people "walk around in the night ... so I knew it well". He wanted to exploit the environment. "It's very awesome and colorful. I wanted boat, steam engine, warehouse, jazz joints - all in New Orleans". <br /> <br /> Cajun handles every panic in the streets well, but they can be combined better. The film will benefit only by staying in one or two moments. The setting conditions sprawl will still work. The part of the conflict was tried by gathering two stories by street panic writer Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quantinine" and "Some Like" M cold. <br /> <br /> Gangster material, which is at the end of the film With an extended Chase scene ending strongly in Thriller region, perhaps highlights. It is not surprising that Czan said that he believes that villains are "more colorful" - I've never been better The second element is the only element that reaches to the title "Panic" - an attempt to track and detect inventions of the plague and inoculate them and contain the disease. These two "mood" times Although very secret, most movies are also quite simple dramas, which illustrate the more common features of that style. <br /> <br /> Full conversation T wonderful. Many modern films stylistic differences could hardly be more pronounced. It's intelligent, quick and well enunciated each character is distributed. Contradiction "stupid" decision but is not committed by a smart move; Events and characters' actions are more like a chess game. When extraordinary stance is taken, as Reid prevents the plague from the newspaper, he gives a relatively long argument for his decision, which debates about other characters. In light of this, Kaizen believed that "autocracy, religion, ethics and middle class are killing us". This concept works its way through film or sculpture made by devils, by changing the ideals. For example, Chief Gangster Blackie (his first film role Jack Palance) is issued a "Get Out of Gel Free" card if he cooperates to deal with this plague. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are fine, if there is no exception, the real reasons for the performance are performance, curiosity, and good writing conversations.
