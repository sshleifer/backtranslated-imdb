I think the movie was quite good, this time it will add to my "classic collection". I believe I saw another poster who reminded some people that it is still a movie. Perhaps some more confidential matters deny the word "logical", but many religious issues on the basis of "faith" fail to pass smell tests. If you subscribe to any belief then you can definitely take a movie. Is it only me or anyone else noticed that Ajaa Egara is the same knife knife. Lamont Cranston was so worried "Shadow". It does not mention the movie here (IMDB) in the triangle section, but I'll bet Donat for the dollar. It's the same.
