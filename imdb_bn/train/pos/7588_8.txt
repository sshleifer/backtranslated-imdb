This project was originally conceived as the movie version of Japanese Manga Slumdunk! And this is nothing new to J. Choudhury, who started playing a character from one of the film's first explorers, another wonderful popular Manga Initial D. Along with this, it was decided to include some Kung Fu in the film, so even with the title of the idea, Martial arts and ball games with Steven Chau's Shawlin Soccer were not very real, as well. However, and the scenes that have impacted Kung Fu in fact, Minim, and Kung Fu Dein are really unnecessary, because they do not join the plot much and are not very excited and most of the time, some cheerful smiles And when Smith Chew used Kung Fu in the football game, he reminded me. Martial arts (none of whom had somebody else), as he was a martial artist, Fang Shi-ji, on the stunts of Ching Siu-Tung. As a genuinely credible face, he trash the gangsters trash repeatedly, like a trailer, only can you tell the case boss. <br /> <br /> The character of the Kung Fu practitioner is made, and for him a top shot is enough to give him an excuse, to actually produce hoops from any angle. And for a short time, Irsh Sung, who with Hooper's Chen-Liye, saw his potential and became his agent, he joined the university to play basketball basketball, but without the team's captain Ting-Wei (Chen Bo-Lin) and the party's initial operation, star Zia- LAN (Baron Chen, debut on his big screen). But you know with team members of the same team, long ago they did not combine their power to take the opponent to the basketball court. <br /> <br /> I would like to say in my heart that this movie was just like a basketball football game like basketball. Despite being so cold and lazy in the court, it is good because of its charitative letters. Here, special effects and cable activities were considered as professionals who could take the top position in the NBA league and looked really fantastic in all the truths, especially when they imitated dunking moves and thanks to combo-tech and stunt work. So the reality, Kung Fu elements will not really be in the movie. Stunt work itself will be able to implement most of the steps because they are quite certain with reality, only you can believe that the boys of the average height shake their legs and increase height for professional football. <Br /> <br /> While playing Peugeot in a large number of sub-slots, the game numbers were just a boxer, but everyone very rarely developed and when they appeared outside the story and beyond. Her parents are looking for abandoned Shizi to use basketball games to meet their parents for a day, who are looking at the role of gangstype sharp and influential games and the role of Charlie Ciu's other flowering sculptures in her love life, and only to do better nothing. Everyone played very little, leaving a little room for the main character to add deep characters. Here is one of the main things to realize the importance of grouping instead of personal talent and skill, and if players interact more than just, then it can become stronger. In addition to competitive games, high-quality and friendly passes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < It's pretty bad, good to look and probably fair on its quality, but again I want to emphasize that in addition to those elements, basketball stunts themselves also make a suitable film with Nifty basketball patches. And no hope of success in the box office to play Jay Chu for your team is a big boost.
