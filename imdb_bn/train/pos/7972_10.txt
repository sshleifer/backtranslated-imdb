I always watch this movie. I was 3 to 87 in the family, and everyone saw it in between; They all liked it. It really shows a true view of dogs, and shows you love and loyalty from a pet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Really thought out, and the characters are perfect. What I liked about the characters is true and beautifully mixed personality: Shadow (the oldest, a Golden Prairie) He is a knowledge of the dog and psychology, chas (American bulldog dog) is basically a puppy, a malicious, ridiculous character; And Sassie (Himalayan cat) she really shows the real cat that what a real cat will do for their owner, the real girly.
