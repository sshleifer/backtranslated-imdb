I've seen this movie about 6 times. And every time I see it, I'm more impressed by stories and acting. It's like watching a train's wreck set speed speed. Its fine in its manner, but its goal is very effective. <br /> <br /> <br /> Spiller-> Very nice dioxymi in the center of the story. On the one hand, our deputy chief, Eddie Calhoun (Cusack) is unknowingly separated from the old boys' network of New York administration chief's hat, and on the other hand, our public member Basu Jappati, who is deliberately trying to maintain this situation through all the necessary requirements. This situation ended nicely when Jupati killed Alsalmo and killed herself and ordered Calhoun to do the same thing to Papas. <br /> <br /> There are some really cool laners in this movie (my personal weaknesses): - You will not limit the life of a person at one moment - you do not know the new thing in this world history <br /> <br /> Everyone, a high movie that deserves a very high rating.
