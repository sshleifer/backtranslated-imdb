This film really deserves more recognition than getting it. This is really a bloody relationship between the crime world, the stunning and rich illustration of grace and loyalty. The film delivers nicely and delves into betraying you and power delves into all of the classic crime themes. This movie is a movie gear movie, it needs attention and understanding and totally rewards. It seems to be instead of Hong Kong's godfather and other wire frame wars, the epic of the martial arts which seems to be the main contributor to the film from Hong Kong and China. There is a system of great character, actor and development, but not to say that because of the many interactions in the film, I had to double to see what was happening to some of my characters. All 8/10 of the Great Plot Characters have ALL characters but that can not stand enough and the music really does not let me go and sometimes I think it did not sync well with the action. The way) So lose some points for that.
