A very good action comedy movie that went out in 60 seconds, which exceeds $ 100 million, but has been exploded by most critics. I personally had a great film on it. This story was believable and has the greatest cast ever for this movie, including 3 Academy Award winners Nicholas Cage, Robert Duval and very hot Angelina Jolie. At the end it is a perfect combination of action comedy and drama other than Lum Stunt. My score is **** (out of ****)
