The next two seasons of this genre series were at least minuscule. The next season's catastrophic reshuffle contributes to the short lifetime of its three seasons. Perhaps if the plug is pulled after the first season, it has earned the following one title. <br /> <br /> The first season was really ridiculous! Diverse, cute with fantastic writing was committed to it. In the first season, the perfect breed had the right material - characters / actors, stories and so forth. A comedy about the planner's reporter was original for booting. Nora and her colleague "photographer", night after night, especially day for the day. <br /> <br /> I do not understand much. How this show, and I liked another fav - Gross Pointer never "made it". If only the first season of naked truth is released and the DVD is released on Grise's Point, please do anybody there?
