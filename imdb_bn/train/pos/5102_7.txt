Nevertheless, Debra Wingner is always attractive and when it was a previous role for her, she was as good as Cissy, wrongly placed her in the trader, by the side of the track, (Travalta), only the city slicker Madeline Smith Replaced as a rival. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous review regarding Scott Glenn only is used for the plot, throwing to make the mix; However, I have come from the east, many of us did not like "Saturday Night Feevers", when it was a moment, the perpetual trend was beyond criticism <br /> <br /> <br /> Valuable for Debra Wing; She is still so liked, and that was not Hollywood personality that we are today attacked by many actresses. 7/10
