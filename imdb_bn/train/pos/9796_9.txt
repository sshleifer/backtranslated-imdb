The first season of Batman's success in 1993: Warmor Brothers blamed the team responsible for the hit-shoot with a feature-length movie, which was originally called for direct-to-video, but the situation arising in the theater. It will be known as batman: Fantasum mask. After ten years of fantasy, both of us have three feature films left by the freedom fighters at WB, Sub-Zero, Joker's return, and now join the family of Batman's mysteries. <br /> <br /> Plots are fundamental and in many ways, such as fantasic masks: A new female Vigilant model herself after managing Gotham John Bource Rupert Thorne and Oswald Kobelpot AKA the Penguin operated activities. Now, Batman must try to uncover Batman's mystery before crossing the line. Animation is the frozen, future style used for Batman: animated series' The fifth and sixth season (AKA New Batman Adventures). , It's done quite nicely, and junker animation is smooth as a return. There are some uses of CGI, but it is very small compared to it in sub-zero. Music was just fine. Like scores of different and external and judicial leagues, when the old animated Batman theme comes, points will be sure to send nostalgia waves through the hearts of the old fans of the radiant shape. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conrad, as always, does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also amazing to the old Batman: Former student of the animated series returned; Of these, Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Intelligence Bureau), his stroke (Barbara Gordon / Batglar; his Camo Huts and the romantic relationship between him and Bruce, which Batman was mentioned in Beyond), and Ephraim Zimbalis Jr. (Alfred) . <br /> <br /> Villains were also great - especially the Rupert Thorne, the old boss from the original series, was shown for the first time in the fourth season. <br /> <br />, MTBT animated Batman carries a torch nicely for movies even if Fantasam's mask does not reach the ideal set ten years ago. And if you have a DVD and are a hardcore fan, you'll love me five minute short chase.
