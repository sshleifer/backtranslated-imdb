When I and my sister received the movie we rent it and our parents became so crazy (but they give us) and I love it ... I can not find anyone living near me that I know. I'm talking ... I'm happy to see that I do not like this movie ... I hope I can find it in DVD !! I would love to watch this watch now. BC I love so much like a little kid ... and I'm 15 now !!! I remember so much ... from which I got a little Bonnie Puffoo song and all my friends know the song but not the movie !! I think a little girl went to the slides on her small playground and went there
