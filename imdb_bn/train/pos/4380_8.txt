This is a very good, low-rated action / drama / and a little historical movie. <br /> <br /> The original story is related to Rob Roy's 1000 paisa loan, his theft and his family and indirect problems that have happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Coldly cold and if you see his face, it seems to be able to close his eyes and see completely evil. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Niison) is excellent, but I think the authors use this term "respect" 1 many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well played and portrayed. <br /> <br /> Action is exciting and the sword game is very realistic, but very serious. The story is good and you really want to conquer Rob. <br /> <br /> Everyone is just shy of the classic.
