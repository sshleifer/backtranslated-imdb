It was the most fun and greatest citikom to hit national televisions. It's really unfortunate that the show is not set in the brilliant seasons where it's really related. The actor had a fantastic job and one of six points in his six-point show was season one. Although the Seven Sevens were not the coolest of the last six, it was still fun. Season 8 was kicked in real problems. The show easily separated apart from Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher. Danny Mastersson, Wilder Valerama Cartwright Smith, Debra Joe Roop, Mila Kunis and Laura Pinnon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are very good) did not have any other actors except two main characters. Display it will affect the same. And the involvement of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help him because he did not accept the show well by the fans. I believe, if the show ends a year ago, it must have gone into history as the coolest of Citicus. Season 8 was a little slow but last was excellent. I'm going to miss the show, I hope I wake up one day and see that the show is back again, those 80 shows with the same cast, because I'm going out of it.
