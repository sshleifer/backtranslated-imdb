I want to say, I like the vanishing point. I've seen the original, and it's a pretty good rebuilding. Although it does not follow the original story (for which I gave 8 out of 10), it was still good and probably it is a good story. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < It shows, the real story was a supermodel Hemi, so it is possible. For those of you who will not allow Arodenics for them, the usual aspiring Chrysler today could go to 300C 168 miles, and if you look at it, going to a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the air at 70 miles per hour. Plus, in wind tunnel tests if you keep the air dam on the Challenger, it is probably more pneumatic.
