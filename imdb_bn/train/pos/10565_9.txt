In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang songs and danced their way through three Warner Brother musicals, which expressed momentary anger over the loss of sadness in the depressed audience. The 1927 Gold Diggers, 42nd Street and Fleetlight Parades were originally set up across the Broadway theater around the world, basically the same theme would continue. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films feature many of Barclays Barclays Kaleidoscopic Corrigi, Stupning Tones and similar supporting players. <br /> <br /> All of them are consistently classics but I have to accept a clear choice for them. Football due to its speed power and lead James Cagney. Warren William himself on the 42nd street of Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter, surprisingly released itself, especially like killing Julian Marsh in search of the box office's last box office. Both are simply Cagney's lack of contagious energy, but Broadway praises the speed of singing. She is an absolute venture as the number of production, police with dishonest partner and a gold dig girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Certainly Cagney is not the only classic that is football. Frank MacHug, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kebbi and especially Joan Blendel showcasing scripts through a great supporting cast to get rid of everyone. Burberry Berkeley's dance numbers were overwhelming, provocative, and ridiculous and fixed at just 34 minutes before the advent of the Hollywood code. Sadly, for thirty years and even then, Pellet will not see so much musical instruments with verve and sauce. Again Gentility and morality ensure it.
