Before showing people, my impression of silent comedy was basically slapstick, and only slapstick. I could not imagine how could the screen comedy be possible depending on spoken words or countless reflections. But this great film proved me wrong. In my view, Davis was perhaps the greatest comedy actress to come along with Lucille Ball. I mainly refer to Lucie because Davis's behavior and facial expressions reminds me of that point that if I do not have one of the primary effects of Davis Ball I wonder. It's coming from a 21-year-old person who has never seen a silent comedy, and I must say that you do not really get any particular specific references (I have not seen it clearly), you will not be bothered by it. Most likely you will laugh more than most of the comedy. It's not just my favorite silent comedy, but my ten favorite comedy is always there.
