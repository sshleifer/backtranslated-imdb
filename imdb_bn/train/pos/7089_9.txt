Without any doubt, 12 Munksaye one of the best Saif-Fi genre films and director Terry Gilliam is unfamiliar with dragging the originality of this movie. A commercial movie that spells you perfectly, 12 Monchi never gives up and you have guessed it all the way. Excellent use of the Philadelphia locals and the NetWorld set creates misconceptions of tragedy at the wrong place in the wrong place, and two people are caught in the wrong time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " He is actually brutal, but the future man (or if you want), this man's head is so disturbed by the misery that he travels, so there is no surprise. After sending the wrong year to Ben to find out how to destroy the army of Bangabandhu, how to destroy the army of twelve monkeys, he sent the first world war. They finally found it to be an amazing playlist that fits in with efficiency, and we've seen cross-references for Willis, Madeleine Stove and an insulting Brad Pitt for 6 years. <br /> <br /> The shrinking of the stoke risk is slow and strong, those who slowly understand that Willis can not break in mind. An interesting element of the relationship between him and Willis is to "see" each other in another place or time ago. 12 Monkeys are basically time and insane people, and in the present time frenzy, when the killer and a psychological genius can change the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " She is collecting information. In addition to the film viewer, a pin drops, wills in a new setting, run the tricks on the viewer. It may be a very difficult picture, but gilliam seems to be the master of high-performance movies. He even had some great works such as Smith Bands and some of Brazil's memorable comedies. The screen is the canvas of this person and he knows how to portray the terrible picture of the world and its potential future big budget mainstream mainstream environment. If you want sincere frenzy and malicious tragedy, see 12 Monkeys. <br /> <br /> <br /> RATING: 10 of 9
