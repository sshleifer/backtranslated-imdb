Chris and Andrei are two average, common teens. Misunderstood by some and picked by others. But together they will stand and give up all. Together they constitute "two soldiers". They plan and plan "Zero Day". On that day when they decided to storm their high school and reluctantly killed 14 people with cold blood. According to the tape made of "Zero Day", it is simply a fictional fiction of the Kumble tragedy. <br /> <br /> After "Zero Day" a movie that will mess with your head. Two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Cakes) have done a good job that their characters look like a street-like DNF franchised. Their performance was very credible, you kinda loved these guys and that was scary. The video's shot almost completely feels "real" and "zero day" from Tin's perspective, as you are right there. These kids try to make their actions reasonable to the viewer and the actor sells it to you. However, since careful start to finish from beginning to end, it becomes somewhat frustrating and uncomfortable for the last.
