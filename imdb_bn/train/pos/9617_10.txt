It was a very entertaining movie and I really enjoyed it, I usually do not rent movies like these (like Indie Flix). However, I was attracted to this movie because it was an incredible cast, among which were Jamie Kennedy, whom I liked from the Spirits Trilogy The film director has taken risks (and a risky risk) while talking about different people (and I mean a lot) to be intermediate at different people and at different times. The risk that taking a good idea is because it is a very good film in the end result. <br /> <br /> The picture has a few main characters; DYIGHT (JAMES KENNEDY) - An unhappy fate cookie writer whose boyfriend is an argument with his boyfriend due to stones on the stone. Wallace Gregory (John Carroll Lynch) - An aviator loader / technician who loves for all living things (except, probably the drugmaker's meter) and who has been unfortunate despite his good heart. CR (Brian Cox) - a Chinese restaurant / donut shop owner who is a fossil and fears of germs because of this, his assistant / cooked Sung - (Alexis Cruz) puts pressure on her voice to keep her voice. Arne - (Christopher Bauer) is married to Olive - (Christina Krk) who believes in him that he is trying; Make fun of him, look ridiculous, get mad and do not live normal life. They started to have small and almost crazy arguments and Olive seriously started to doubt about Ernie. Gordon - (Grant Hesslow) A man whose life is not running very well because he decides to start adding bad things to his life. Mitchell - (Jon Huertas) Sure that Guy - (Alexander Westcourt) is his dream girl and he is determined for each other, though he is more suspicious. He tried to imagine every opportunity of his feet and he certainly tried! Johnston - (Michael Hitko) has just been fired from his job and doubts about his role of role, he has taken another job that he is not fit for. His wife, Anne - (Arbela Field) is comforting through her professional loss experience until she knows that Johnston was not very much a husband of love, she thought she was. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to everyone! <br /> <br /> Icra
