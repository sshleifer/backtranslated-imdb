When tradition indicates that an artist must be her successor and heir to the heir, he must be heir, pregnant and proud street actor, known as "king of mask", desperate to accept and cultivate a young beginner. <br/> His warmth and humanity, so, he was given some dollars for a small number of people, separated by the devastating natural disaster of China, in that case the floods in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> For her new, 7 year old companion, her Straw Houseboat, her private and beautiful monkey, to live with "General", she discovered that she-child child <br /> <br /> His life is transformed instantaneously, as the little maid feels the love for the girl, becomes a flexible tradition that forces her to send only a young man to her own art. <br /> <br /> There are many stories inside ... many people have touched, and China's culture exposes ourselves to keeping our western focus. Thousands of years have been taught to play a traditional drama, and some put the DVD down with dry eyes. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer itself is not big, because I have always found the level of sound. Meter, and could actually watch video transfer lines in different parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
