When I was making this film, I was living Ralin's life and I was lucky enough to be lucky in this. Both as special effects and both with Eddie Surkin. At Birdworld's Warden Office Floor, it was fun to see everyone behind the scenes while coming to power at the power station. It was also fun to meet all the actors, from Vigo to small Also, the gate that was cut in prison for the movie is still called "Disney gate" by the locals. Anyone interested and Rawlins is always, most of the movie sets are still in place and can be seen during self-guided tour. It was a lot of fun and no longer. Works with Harleen and I got the opportunity to do it again.
