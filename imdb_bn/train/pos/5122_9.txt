Trilogy # 3 John Travolta Blockbuster She disco, rock 'n' roll and country dance. He heads to Houston to find work and love. Gilley Hot Spot, and it's mechanical lightning time. Do not go outside, I bull bulls at a club in Nashville. I recently watched this almost forgotten movie on television and remember how good it was and how well 1980 was. I wore a black cowboy hat that year like Travolta. The deity Winger was his chief. She looks stunning in her red top. There are many things to do. Even if they traverse the trailer, Bid and Sissy think of the ideal couple. They feel so good to get back together because they are divided. The urban cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. We get to listen to Lyin 'by Eagles and Lukin' for love by Johnny Lee.
