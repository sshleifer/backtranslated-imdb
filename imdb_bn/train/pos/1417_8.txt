I saw this picture with my family and it was great! This movie is a long mono / -dudoolu and a documentary with many charts (which is not more than the cold events) ... The complete "energy" of this movie comes from impressive pictures painted under water, including air or arctic. Looking at this movie you can learn more about our planet rather than just reading our book, it shows that we are embedded in the circular stream of life. This film is not only "environmental fantasy", but people who want to see a good movie with a message can see it. This movie has taught me that we are not living in the world ... we live through the earth and through the earth and all the plants and animals grow with us.
