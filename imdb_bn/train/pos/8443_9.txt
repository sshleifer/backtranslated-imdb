My favorite police series has always been a TV-film. What does it work Yes Gee gets runs and shots for mayor. Homicide becomes the "Hall of Fame". Pembleton and almost all the police who played in this series. Many flashbacks help you not see the TV series, but it also attracts fans. The last five minutes solved another murder and eventually two dead policemen wandered. And a short look at my favorite Coroner Juliana Cox. This is a good film.
