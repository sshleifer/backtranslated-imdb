In any number of movies, you can find Nicholas Cage as a powerful, silent hero, Dennis Hooper as a high-end maniac, as Lara Flein Bohel's vamp / tramp and late J. Walsh as heavy Out of these four sleeping, these four plays can play their roles, and they have done so properly that they can see playing the borders on them again. Therefore, through a small step, a lot of mood, Master John Dahl, pointed out to these other Nourish thrillers. If Hooper escaped from going upstairs, Caiz shows a little more depth than his usual-official performances heroes, Boyle becomes proud, silly and planned, and one refers to the strong iron of the soul, which is central to its character, Wayne. Dahal's directive gives Big Blake a sense of country where the story goes and how close to show that a molten cone can point to the conspiracy of the store. Plot twists are top notch, and some supernatural characters that this movie is one of the other fantastic twists actually act as they have in the brain. It often does not have more brains than the sub-heads of titles like deputy sheriffs. But with Dahal's manager as smart, you will not be surprised by any intelligence associated with this movie. A nice movie
