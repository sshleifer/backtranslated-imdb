I got very touched by Spike and Hayton to stay together through this movie, saying there are not a few betrayals along the way. I thought I was left behind and I think there was a relationship between the two. I already have thought that there were so many homosexual purposes in Heaton's part. In my favorite scene Hiten and Spike were trapped in Marsh and the Spike runs off, I usually thought that Spike is not coming back. I say that if this is not for our film study teacher, we probably did not see it. Above all, I thought the film was good and I would suggest it to a person who is a fan of British-made films.
