I did not think it was very exciting but to talk about fashion and curious ways to solve a mystery. A little easier, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDB ... that's pretty cool! I really liked that part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Fleetter) is too ridiculous ... and Ned Nixerson (Max Thayet) looks really hopeless ... he could be more <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is in disguise travel and fashion. However, I recommend this movie, just for the fun of summer. Just for fun, Nancy Encore More teen spy movie by Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... remember? She is getting better at this cute detective job.
