I was repeatedly bellied up to be a hot beer in a sweltering Texas day but pleasantly surprised. After suffering through "stupidity on Saturday night", I did not want to recreate some of Bernard's South Texas ... and I did not do that. John Revolta was as good as a jealous Redneck, Scott Glenny played good as a thongie exclamation and Debra Winger was always happy. * The woman * plus, the soundtrack dynamite [and it comes from a person who can not bear the word of native music]. A fun movie is all the way
