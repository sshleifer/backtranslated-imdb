Very rarely is a masterpiece. So do not write well. I do not think of the beautiful cinematography. This movie was not very terrible but it was not much better than the average. The original story related to highly immoral teenagers should be more focused on banned romance and why it was ... basically instead of scraping the surface, it should have been acquired because "we can not say the mother." Some parts should be omitted altogether or two major characters should be reviewed for more seriousness. During the couple's time I was wondering whether the author / director George Lucas was a fan of the classic American grapheetti. It's not wrong to be a movie fan, but to show your movie in such a way, I mean! The worst part of this was that the small part of the Maden Amic, that means I have doubled !! He was the only one in one or two lines, who actually tried the southern accent. (Listen well, though its character was from California! DOH !!) Maybe he was a star but others could follow and we used to live in a more realistic sounding film. Oh well, what can you do when you are a director who is not a director or an artist too. very bad. Overall I think it's a B- and it's a little generous because 'I'm Ams. Partial partial
