De Sica is becoming one of my favorite managers, but this was a hit for me and missed. A community leader living in a secluded area outside Milano has become a frustrating young man. It is a detailed and amusing story of innocent poor people, done with evil capitalists and done with happy police forces, but gradually it becomes a magic fiction story, as the boy is surprised that Tito develops infinite superhero powers. After 10 minutes I was here with the sunny Toto, and when the magic ended, I went to the dust. There were many surprisingly arranged shots, many good characters in the settlers, which I thought was a waste that the film was not even more serious with its components. Combining neutrality and imagination, there is more to try to sort out "look-in-the-do-to-work-mom" than the fully developed pieces of work / industry.
