This is a movie which should be seen by everyone if you want to see the great acting. Mr. Torne and MS Farrell will do an outstanding job. I think they have to stay on TV so new viewers can enjoy it. Wonderful performance. <br /> <br /> You had to go through the piano both physically and emotionally. Extraordinary unknown movie <br /> <br /> This was done at a very young age. I always thought of him as a comedian, but it is definitely not a comedy and he's just wonderful. There are very little dialogs, but that makes it feel more realistic. Mr. is always broken as a great presence and just has great feelings of his breath. I will watch movies
