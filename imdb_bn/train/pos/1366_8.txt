Did I just see the connection between the camera's 'Fascination of Chess' and Marie's conversation? In Camus version a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a giant stone that he must roll up a hill. Unfortunately when he reached the top spot he slips the boulder and ends up ending up to start. His eyes may have been a molten pecking, I'm not sure now. The movie Mary spends time struggling to live her life together, unfortunately every time she gets a foot rib and she loses all. At the point where he drunk, he insulted his falafel boyfriend, and was actually attacked by Lieve Screebber. If you ask this theory, then how does this scenario end with the attempt to climb the star on the plane when the books do not go away until they end. The next morning when he woke up, he never reached the top of the stairs.
