I really like this picture during the War of Liberation, and I still do, because the story makes you optimistic about normal life and people too ... I like the movies of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to positive vibes from the film, there are other reasons like the Grand Canyon. One thing, it has an outstanding cast ... For example, Kevin Clayne and Danny Glover. In my opinion, the film was very similar to Crash, a highly acclaimed film that won Oscars for extraordinary pictures. The difference is that the Grand Canyon feels positive to you. The crash had the opposite effect with me; It was very dark. I will choose the Grand Canyon on any day crash.
