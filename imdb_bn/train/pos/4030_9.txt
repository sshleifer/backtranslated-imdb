This movie was absolutely amazing. The pre-partition time and culture have been recreated nicely. Urmila has yet another brilliant performance. I really appreciate this movie that it does not support the ongoing Pakistan-blast in films like Gadar and Elkee. With the partition as a backdrop, the movie can not return to political matters or focus on violence or what is right and wrong. The film always focuses on the sad story of Urmila's life. His weak relationship with Manoj Bajpayee has been portrayed exquisitely. The film actually shows that both Hindus and Muslims have harmed this party. Actually there is only religion in this film.
