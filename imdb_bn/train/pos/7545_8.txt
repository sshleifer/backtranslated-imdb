I really like it though it was quite annoying for me when reading reviews. But as an anime art fan, I fully understand this perfect art, though some of it was against my culture and believe ... but hey, it's the art of the world .. !! The beginning of the film is very strong, weird and confusing. It is difficult to understand things that resonate with the person who created me. Only someone who is very open can do such a brave movie. It is not for kids at all. Although the characters are cute and adorable, they go through some memorable events that can not be deleted from memory (sorry spelling is wrong).
