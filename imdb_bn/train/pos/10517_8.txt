This lucrative adaptation of Jane Austen's ironic classic about the wedding of the provincial 18th century England and between her marriage is lazy production value and strong performance. As a friendly mix of the Northam and Paltrow friends who should pass through jealousy and falsehood they discover each other's love. Good humor is a chronic quality that crosses a long way in explaining the accessibility of the older source material (which has fallen somewhat of its strict suspicion). I saw the appearance of the film and how the shot was set up, and I think it does not depend much on the success of head shots like the other 80s and 90s. Very good results
