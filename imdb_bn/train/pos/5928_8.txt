This is not a good movie, but I still like it. Cat claws are gold as a basis for cats as well as cats - internally opposes evil slipwalls. I think this film has much more than people, basically it is very harsh, but this atrocity can sometimes be better. It's got a lot of lines, a wonderful ending and a ridiculous element surrounded by foolless policemen. <br /> <br /> Has anyone found the bad element a bit annoying? Eventually this movie is casual and randomly intense, which is quite effective, I like psycho - relationship between mother and son, change of character. I think the odds work, it's not a movie that you want to expand them, it works only when it's small. <br /> <br /> I'm still not sure whether the director lacks depth or whether he has these things with the intention, we know Stephen King has the power, yet I did not read his book, I saw only a few of his movies. <br /> <br /> However, I like it. If you want a strict corny movie with overtones of 80 then just see it. But do not expect too much. It really is so good on its good.
