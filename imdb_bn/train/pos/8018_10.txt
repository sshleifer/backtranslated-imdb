The filmmaker, Kimmitt, Miss Piggy, Fazzy, Gonso, Rolph, Scooter, Camille, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Zaney, Janice and Jute College graduates decided to bring their successful college musical instruments, Manhattan Melodies to Broadway. Unfortunately, no producers will even meet with Muppets. After being rejected by many producers, the scooter suggests that Muppets themselves decide to move forward. But Kimit still believes that he can get his show at Broadway, but eventually and afterwards everyone knows that he has sold this program, gets the memory of Kimmitt and others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> There are more great scenes with a live action sequence with Suem Street cast and Traveling Matt (from Frogal Rock), Scooter's movie theater, and a scene with muppet kids, a wedding sequence filled with mespots. . Rizzo and other rats cook breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not to include more characters. Sure, many of them attended the wedding ceremony, but there should have been some important role for Bonsen, Baker, Baygear and Mistimas, and Leap was present as an electric hazardous part of the film so that he was in the muppet show last season. And the Great Mupp Pet Copper and Miss Piggy dog ​​should have accompanied Phu Phu (later, during the night of Rijo Nightmare performed by Steve Whitema, this was a big part of the film and he was not very familiar).
