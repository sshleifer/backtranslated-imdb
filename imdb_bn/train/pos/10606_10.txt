I just finished seeing this image and found it very enjoyable. This is a cool, short film that does not make you embarrassed by special effects or "big" performance. It just takes you to the lives of people living in a small loll in the retreat of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas has performed well as a young actor Raymond Tucker, who left a child in the woods. The look of the tokens for the child's parents leads him to a ride that will have a profound effect on his life. David Srathairn plays a slimy conman, Truman Lester with an inferior motive. And David Perfection plays bad guys. <br /> <br /> This picture is more than the eyes. Photo film with a wonderful soundtrack in North Carolina and traditional music, it's valuable.
