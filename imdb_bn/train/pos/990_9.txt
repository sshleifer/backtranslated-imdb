I really liked this movie. Of course, the idea is too much ... the federal government is trying to set up a tracking device in a small-time thief jaw to hide hidden hide / computer hackers. But Alvin Sanders, the person who "volunteered" with this device, is a very favorite person, and it has been very fun with his brain for a while. Alvin finally proved himself far more than a very good but distinct but passive or one-dimensional character when he showed that he can not remember that it can not be used easily. Definetly is a clock value.
