I found it in November 2005 at the New York International Film Festival with my boyfriend. We were quite impressed with the complexity of both the plot and found it to be moving mentally. It was very well guided with strong imagery. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a short while. This was a real fantasy aspect of a very real and serious issue: This film is about a young girl, which is visited by a monster gift to help her situation with her rogue father. In the end there is a striking twist which holds me off guard This Gothic feeling leans towards the side. I would like to see this as a full feature film. - Kerry
