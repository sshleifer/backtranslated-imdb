I saw this picture long before late on Night TV. Then went back to the title "From Stairs to Heaven" heading. Even as a young boy, I think the story is being moved deeply and surprised by the visual effects of the trial of the court (those who have seen what I'm talking about). Imagine that! A perfect blend of romance, drama, comedy, and fantasy, this movie is all right with the greatest classics of all time: Citizen Kahn, Casablanca, has gone through the air. This film has been rated highly by IMDB voters and correctly - more than 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10; More than 84% of these are rated 8 or more in 10. I was amazed that until I was listed on the top 250 films I realized that I've seen / rateed this movie than this movie. What a pity I hope this movie will be released for DVD1 (North America), so that 1), I will buy it and 2) Others can discover these hidden treasures.
