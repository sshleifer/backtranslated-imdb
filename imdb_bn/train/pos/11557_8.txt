Often the smiling smile, sometimes the sad story of divorced sons of two - Lemon is a neurotic clean "house husband" and Mathula is a slogan athlete - who decides to live together to spend the money. <br /> <br /> Fantastic photographs and managed. The script is very brutal - that is, there are multiple aspects on one side of almost every line. Especially in the funny scene, there are 2 British sisters (Evans and Shelley), who say that everyone is happy to see, but when Lemon gives pictures of his children and yes, if he is a former wife, then he will be with her Surrender. Matthu can meet the promised drink! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining.
