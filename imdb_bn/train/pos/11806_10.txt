Everything was fine last day. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock is quite simply proof of my point. While writing this comment I was fourteen years old, but in my two years I can not even resist the charm of the foggy rock. For those of you who are actually living under a rock (wreck!), About a curious and folly of the crazy creatures named Froggle Rock Frogles, who lives in a stone-amazingly. But they are not the only animals. The stone lives with hard working dosages and other species of living trees. As well as on the one hand, the inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sparkett (who later favors Gobh Froggl), on the other side of the rock, on the other hand, a family of Gorg's supposed ruler Five major Fraggles caught Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (arty and peaceful), Wembley (a friend of indecisive and Gobo), Boober (a dull domestic god) and red (loves to do something with sport and general feistyness) At the same time singing and dancing away with the episode. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock can definitely have complex details in a family show-plot that the child can not follow well, but the music and the dance routine will keep their attention. The characters are strong and desired, their conflict is credible and thrilling their adventures. Gargs are terrific, doc and spark entitled, Uncle Traveling, Matt Hillarios (postcard segments are very 80!) And the final episode, chain of address, indeed touch. Let's go down the rock hail again!
