There are a few spoilers in this comment <br /> <br /> Contrary to comments I just read by nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and would like to see it as a weekly series. <Br> <br /> I'm a fan of Judson Mills but a huge chocolate Norris fan and I'll admit that few step-scenes have stretched the line a bit, but the storyline is okay with another weekly series. Is currently being broadcasted. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes of blowing up their missiles, it was very effective for 15 minutes running from bad guys. I did not see that many "professionals" could not achieve any ongoing goal, but the action was there and Duke survived because of being a hero. <br /> <br /> To get the movie into the "playoffs can fill the time slots after the need" for the comments. This film was originally not scheduled by CBS in January air, and filing was completed in May 2001, 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the United States. <br /> <br /> If the author of the comment is paying attention, instead of trying to avoid it, , Perhaps they can realize the plot of the story: Rashid, character like bin Laden, in the US Ramanabika planned to set up the device. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
