A very interesting East-Mill-West film, influenced by the Jim Flint of the 80's, the closure of the Michigan plant and the closure and integration of Japanese automobiles in the US. Set in Western Pennsylvania, it features great performances by Michael Cutton, Z. Watanabe and George Wend. Music by Blues Legendary Steve Ray Vaughan
