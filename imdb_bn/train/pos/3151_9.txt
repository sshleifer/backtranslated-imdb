I saw this show 3-4 years ago. This dam was fun! When I first saw it playing at ETV (Estonian Television) and I started liking it. It's a bad show that bad times for me. Hyde Friend like a quiet guy who likes to sing sinatra! And he comes to the stupid idea. He got these glasses which H Brownies got. I like it And have FeZ. Group hazard. We all know what he will do when he is alone? She was even with her boss in one episode. Her from India And there's Michael, a fool of a whole group, maybe a fool in the city and one of his policemen! He's so stupid that I remember: Heid said: Did you say the police? - No Michael came and said. Does anyone know how to stop Serena? She is a city playboy. Then came Jackie, who is Michael's ex-girlfriend and then Haid's girlfriend. Then Eric spent his son Kate and the housewife in the miserable war experience. Her big pussy But she loves Donna, her girlfriend, with whom she plans for marriage. Dona is a hot girl. I forgot what? Ah Hyde is a basement bus.
