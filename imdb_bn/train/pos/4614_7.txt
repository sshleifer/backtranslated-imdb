This movie is ridiculous! I'm just about this piece of fun "piece" Pat Prist and Boch Patrick, including the original Marilyn and Eddie, are not easy to blaspheme. But look at the year and do not math. Pat Priest and Boch Patrick have long been spreading their part! That's the young star at the time. His role as Lily was to push Yvonne De Carlo, Big 6-0 (although he still looked good and still was the perfect "Lili"). <br /> <br /> It is a shame that Yvonne De Carlo has not given a big share. Nevertheless, it was good to see Fred Guin and Al-Louis in such a role that they were so famous! The main time of the season was during the season 2, it was such a success in the series Gwynne / Luis chemistry. The rest Cast Cast members had support, they did not say they were not necessary. They were! As long as the TV series survived, they could not survive. Giving a choice between find Patrick or Happy Derman (original "AD"), the choice was very easy. Jovan de Carlo is a better choice than Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not measure up to the original TV series, it still measures nicely and it is one of the better "reunion" TV specials. In the late 1970s or early 1980's, beat the tuber-tube. <br /> <br />
