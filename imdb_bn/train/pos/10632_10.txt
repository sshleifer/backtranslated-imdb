It is a film for entertainment; I do not think the world has made a social commentary from a small film. I personally find this picture interesting, uneasy, and memorable. This is a fantasy which is not becoming a Sandra girl princess. This picture was done very well, I was able to mention the sex of a person during the film's best test of 70. This film is not a homosexual, is it not love, it's all weird This movie shows some reality in gay or lesbian dating in Hollywood or 70. Beautiful guys are so careful not to care for the elderly men. Women who have a deep sense of emotional strain or careers do not have the risk. Bathhouse was an integral part of the lesbian community. <br /> <br /> then the imagination starts !! Let's mix homosexual with homosexuals and add some alcohol and what do we have? Well, this movie was better than that unhappy "The Next Big Thing" by any means. Perhaps someone wanted to ask the whole crew to watch this movie and then tried to do better. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the 70's and it still smiles on my lips. I sincerely recommend to anyone who wants fun, flexible movies - curls up with some popcorn and makes some fun. Some people need to be lightweight !!! And with this image you should do it! <br /> <br />
