This is one of the best JD Foster films and it ignores the misconceptions of the public as a misconception of the youth. It has amazing performances, especially a battle scene between Jodi and her mom, which was played by a believer, Sally Kellyman. Jodie's friends play that three girls are somewhat amateur but I think it's worth seeing.
