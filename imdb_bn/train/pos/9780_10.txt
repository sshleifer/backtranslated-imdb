I saw this movie at the 2004 Spring Brusel Festival. What a surprise! This German production, a stylish and imaginative shock, one of the scariest flic I saw. Be warned: this is not a joke! These terrorists have a great cast of good actors (for example: Peter Martel has a strong presence as a guru), excellent aspects, excellent production design, a very good soundtrack and many heavy heavy holes, such as the Italian horror films of the eighties. The flesh becomes cleansed bone ... and the blood becomes red ... this barbarous heart stopper will catch you ... and you will have some dark dreams ... must be seen !!
