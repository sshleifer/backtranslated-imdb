Yes, Georoi, a good feeling movie. A little romance, great music, beautiful scenery, comedy, (a great food fight), and a bit of bitswife's taste, the stuff of girozoos. Which movie fist will enjoy this film. Those who need extensive special effects, should look elsewhere. Now a festival for most of our eyes, ears, and heart, and then, how does it need to turn a little better? A must see!
