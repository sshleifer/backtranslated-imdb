When I think 'women in prison', my mind often goes to lazy Italian / Spanish productions by directors such as José Franco and Bruno Matte; And when these movies are often very shameless, they are the same and once you have seen it; You might well meet them all. I admit that such films are not usually my favorites; But outside of Italy and Spain many times the idea of ​​women behind women has been much better. And Roger's New World Pictures are responsible for the best of them. Caged hit Oscar winner director Jonathan Demmere was made the director and it works a great deal of amusement! Naturally, this film is a story about a girl who is caught in crime and sent to the prison where she was presented to several violent prisoners. This fisherman's staff is ruled by wheelchairs bound superintendent McQueen; And he takes a game for girls by crime; <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is much lighter than the one used in prison on Flickr; But it is more than compensating for some great scenes and dialogue, and they ensure fun hits throughout the whole time. It needs to be said that this plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically follows similar structures in other films of the prison that have come before; But that's not a big problem. The film gets annoying and is peppered with the standout view; With a escape attempt while working in a field and a bank robbery. This film helps people to be assured comfortably, who will have a wonderful custom with heartwash leopards and many standouts; Best of all legendary Barbara Steel in Head Fisherman Warden's role Overall, Caged Heat can not leave a lot of viewers to think by the end; But it's a brilliantly entertaining little greenhouse flick and anyone who enjoys this type of movie would like to track it.
