This movie is brilliant in every way. It touches on the complexity of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but not speech. The script does not condescends towards any characters, even helpless Johnny. It also has advantages from spot-on-direction, production design, casting and performance. Chair is so wonderful in film and unlike "grazed" that he has ever been compared to that a wonderful one of me. I've seen Moonstak at least once a year and have seen this Christmas together with my 16-year-old twin girls and they liked it too. It has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with delight at the end.
