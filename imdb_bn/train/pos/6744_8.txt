A senior police officer accidentally kills the suspects of murder and then covers the crime, but while trying to solve a murder case, he must deal with the guilty conscience. Andrews and Ternick have been reunited with director Premminger in a film Noar, which is as effective as "Laura" of their previous collaboration. Andrews is completely cast as heartfelt police, a good person caught in unfortunate circumstances. The act is fine around, Maden is the strongest police captain and Tilly's Tearie's protective father. Hector is a fantastic and cheerful photographer, and the screenplay is fresh and dubious, and promising creates a great environment.
