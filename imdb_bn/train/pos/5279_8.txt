<br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is not a nice film, just like the very human story of developing relationships between parents. His eldest son, but as a little window to practicing Islam, like me who are not very familiar with this religion. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is that the young man is concerned with his father's beliefs and practices, and how his views on religion change in a fine way, we see the progress of their journey with them. <br /> <br /> This is a very worried, provocative, enjoyable and well-established movie that I would recommend with the brain and heart.
