In the last five years I saw one of the best movies! In New York City's Lower East Side, there is a superstars to create two titles with a publicly spectacular view of the youth's love and barbarism story. Funny, charming, sad and inspirational, this is a completely refreshing reason for urban youth, which keeps the roots of the Latin Clubs frequently. Although I must admit that Bulli was a cut from his usual rent. Victor Vargas is a movie that you're missing for yourself ... so do not miss!
