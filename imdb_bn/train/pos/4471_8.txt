Stars starring Jean Kelly, Frank Sinetra, Kathryn Grayson, and Jose Eitbary, starring "Anchor Away," directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatara Joe and Clarence, two naval missions in Hollywood left. When they meet a young boy (Dean Stockwell) and take him home, they meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls for him. She wants a myth for Jose Iturbi They try to help, but there is a mix. <br /> <br /> It is a very energetic song singing and singing great dance songs and songs in Sainat and Sainat. Kelly gets dance with Jerry in a delightful sequence. Graceon Jodie and my heart singing singing. Not one of my favorite voices, but he's better. Ituriara piano work is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The senator has shown his multifacetedness and why he is pressured by the large blue eyes and the faces of the girls. For Kelly, it was a big break for him at the MGM. <br /> <br /> Wonderful movie, very bright.
