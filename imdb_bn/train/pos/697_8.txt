This is one of the first independent movies I've ever seen. It was done well for so little budget; As uncertain myself, I can be sympathetic to the main character, though my sleeping problems have never been as intense or annoying. <br /> <br /> Be well, have played well, I have not seen much in the theater, I lit and set the perfect for film settings. There are few noticeable goofs, but they can be intended for; You will see later on in the movie. The movie is very personal, and the price doubles observers. No movie shameless, but a Hollywood version could not do well. All in all, 8/10.
