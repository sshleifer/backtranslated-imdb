This one is the one who is good, Saturday afternoon movie. It's okay with other retro flights like Navigator Flight. Light things up to an intelligent movie with some delicate comedy. And it's fun to see how Kelly Preston and Lee Thompson have changed for 20 years. Jacqueline Phoenix is ​​not mentioned. <br /> <br /> I personally like these movies from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice story line. And I never knew Mr. Phoenix. I did not read the credits recently. She made this movie when she was a baby. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston was then very young stranger actress. He and Liya did a wonderful job in this movie. I'm not the Oscar Caliben movie. But observers are worth a lot. Especially if you have kids, then say, 8 to 11 years old range. Or are more interested in the space program.
