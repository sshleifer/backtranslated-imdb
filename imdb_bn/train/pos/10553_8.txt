When, at a particular time, the story goes straight to the evening zone ... nothing but nothing new ... and nothing interesting! When Dave and Andrew start exploring their new environment, the movie is really enjoyable ... the head high? Well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> This movie was, Emo, the biggest surprise in this year's fantasifilmfest ... <br /> <br /> It's just dense and sophisticated as Natalie It's a mere, curious but very special design, which makes it difficult to identify the location of the story or its time ... at any time ...
