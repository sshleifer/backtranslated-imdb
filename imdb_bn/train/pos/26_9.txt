When I was a child, I have seen this many times, and in most cases, the "Happy Cat" sings the song. All songs are great, and indeed memorable, in contrast to many children's musical instruments, where the songs are not trapped for any real reason. Scene and costume greatly exceeded, and acting very well, which is not surprising, considering throwing. Christopher Walken is very kitten, and does not require fooling, or does not require a cat's clothing for visitors to think that he transforms a cat into a human. And Karan, the son of Jason Connane's so intelligent, shy and strange miller, who fell in love with the beautiful and brave prince lamb. This is a really fun, enjoyable, feature-length movie, in contrast to most of the exams, character personality is given. Some of my favorite parts are when POS Karine is immersed; When the ball starts to dance everybody, as is "all the rage abroad"; When Waken is in the kitchen, dance on the table (he is a very nice dancer!); And when Vera told Corin what she was doing when she was younger, she said that she was a miller's daughter. I would recommend this film to children and parents, who love magic and love. And it's actually a movie that you can see together, because it will not drive walls to the wall.
