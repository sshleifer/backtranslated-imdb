I must say that I'm going to sit and watch this movie. I guess I did not have any good work in the class. However, once a TV movie caught interest in my interest. More important Helen Hunt caught my eyes. I really did not have her big fan before this film. Sure I like the twister and it's as good as well. However, something about this movie really did it for me. I will now see myself as a huge fan. This movie comes with high marks ... I Give it a chance, it will not let you down.
