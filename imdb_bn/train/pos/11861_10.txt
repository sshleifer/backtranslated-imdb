This movie is not very entertaining and sometimes annoying even around 3 hours is running. Al Pacino, Michelle Fife, and other actors are great and very credible in the film. Violence in this movie was a little extreme, but then it showed how detrimental drug business was during filming. One of the last amazing and probalby ever cooler scenes. Great movie and you will probably enjoy it really.
