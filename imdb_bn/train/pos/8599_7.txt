Gordon Gecko used "Wall Street" for 19 years, so that we can tell that the greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas took GG personalities and it morphed Pete Garrison, a secret service agent. Guess what It works! This is a tough political thriller that guessed me. The detailed work to see the safety precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and First Lady was equally provocative. All the leads were quite good, but as I tried, I could not accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. Although Jodie Foster just stops you from believing and really believes that she was "Fear of the Lamb's Silence" in the FBI agent Sterling, you will not get the same feeling in Langriya. Despite this, it is a fun movie, with Beltway as Pacific Entertainment, which is backdrop.
