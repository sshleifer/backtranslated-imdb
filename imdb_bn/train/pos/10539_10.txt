This is a good movie, but it is not recommended if you do not like cute movies. This is the hope that almost two people will leave the world, and they will get exactly that. Acting was not great, the end was predictable, and in fact it was a good story against most movies this day. People complain about the movie being very simple or very annoying. I think they just live in films such as The Toxic Avenger (I really like B movie) or Billy and Mandy's Gray Adventures. One note: If you notice this, the same actor except the four actors comes from the Cube. Make it two notes: wait after the credit (believe me one in this). Enjoy the movie.
