Perhaps some Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. The movie is already watching the movie without having to separate from the movie in any way. Characters are so complex, everyone can relate to them in their own way. The brightness of the adaptation is that everyone's own ideas are allowed to project in the character's life rather than the character's opinion. You can love them or dislike them, and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Wonderful performance by Ellen Burstyn and Cricetin Horne really brought the characters. I highly recommend it.
