Now this I want a good awful call. With the strange / supernatural underneath, this beautiful low budget French movie has attracted my attention from the first scene. This proves that you do not need wild fx or bulk cow to make an effective horror movie. <br /> <br /> This plot surrounds around 4 colleagues in prison and each of these characters (and their motions) becomes more and more attractive, the movie ends up creating tension. Most of the actions we saw in Carter's eyes, he just entered the prison and used to live with these 3 other prisoners. <br /> <br /> I will not say such things because this film is really worth seeing more widely. Although there are some errors: FXs are not good, but they are effectively used; Some mysteries left the plot open; And the things get very confusing in the end, but the Maldives redemems themselves ending in time. <br /> <br /> I had a very good movie on her, 8/10
