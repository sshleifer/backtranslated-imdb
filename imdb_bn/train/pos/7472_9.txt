I really liked this movie. I read a few comments, and although I do not understand those who do not understand it, I agree with some criticism. What, oddly, makes me love this movie more. I got a nice cast for the rebuilding of an intelligent movie for the general public, but it has many levels and is still great for watching. I love movies, like this one, which provokes many debates, theories, possible endings and secret secrets. Congratulations Crowe, definitely in my top ten. <br /> <br /> PSS. It was during my first trip back to Mexico in Mexico, it was late at night, and I had to go back to my hotel and I had a big paronon trip! Where does the dream end and start the real?
