Jackie Chan's police story is a landmark film for both Hong Kong action genre and Jackie Chan's career. <br /> <br /> Chan is guided / written, the police story is a fundamental plot like all movies of the era. And consistent, and like most pictures of police story type, there is nothing to get bothered about this script. But the plot of the film Jackie Chan, who plays a good guy, struggles to convict the local gang lord. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> However, Jackie is very good and respectful to handle the work. The film's outlook comes with war scenes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Other actors also gave good performance in the film because Jackie is reluctant to share with the groom's reluctant witness, although he does not show the potential for acting. Acting actor Jackie Cheung comes from Jackie's grief girlfriend and Bill Tung as sympathetic and fun police chief. The performance of this movie is not enough quality to influence the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> This film really distinguishes itself from the daring contemporary dancing photography to the urban, modern settings, this is something in the biggest battle scenes ever seen in the camera. There is a shootout in Jhalakathi at the beginning where Kung (ganglord) is making a drug deal, though John Wao is not a sequel, but it works as a great starter for the film. Then the famous hill comes along the hill and with the heart of Sallam everything is visible. This is an exciting sequence which was later copied by Bad Boys 2. In another middle of the film, Jackie tries to transport Broadgate Lin from her home. This is actually the first scene where we see the horrific hand-to-hand wars from the war, since all modern sets have become the model of the martial arts film. This sequence is apparently edited with the greatest number of dancers, time and seclusion of the cruelty of the scene. However, according to tradition, the sequence of standout wars at the end of the film is sequenced. This sequence shows the choreography of the best choreography, stunt and camera / editing work. This sequence is now famous for two things, the number of people sent through a high-density glass, which is called a remarkable amount of people, and in the end sticks where Jackie jumped from the 5th floor balcony, holds a pole and slides down through a glass roof (believe this To be seen). The two mentioned reasons are both brilliant, I think the most impressive part of the sequence of events is the power of Chance to include something in the sequence of war and the perfect originality of the script, which has never been established for me. I believe that police story activities are one of the best illustrated and educated works of Chance Carrier. On the other hand, despite its legendary stories and script, police stories, overall police stories Running in the middle of the plot due to plot padding, it is one of the best action films of Chance's best dance, best illustrated action, and above all, to always watch his spectacular stunts. After all, we see a Chan movie for action !!
