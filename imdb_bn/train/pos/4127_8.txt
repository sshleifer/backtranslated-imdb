I know that there are some pilgrims who actually root something that is not original, but sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own eligibility. I like the new Iron Chef because it is as good as the Japanese version but at the same time the American soul also supplies it. I love Alton Brown as the actor, because he explains things with flash. The iron chef itself is very interesting. I probably thought that the planet was probably the best chef at that time, but Bobby Floye was the only American Iron Chef to defeat him. Mario Buckle seems to be the most fun while cooking, commenting and being fantastic. I have seen the series and all the players find good work together. Judge is not always the best choice, however. There are some exceptions, such as lawyers eat food, but most judges who are served are suspicious to handle. I enjoy watching chef hostels and challengers are wonderful. At the end the food always looks amazing and sometimes it inspired me to the kitchen. Probably anyone can ask, what really served what you want to eat. What I am really going to change about the series is that people ask for showers to lighten themselves. Sometimes the mood becomes a little longer, and when you're expecting more entertainment, it's not always fun. I like the version of William Shaton (Iron Chef USA) because it was more than the original, but I can say it is an expensive expensive offer. I used to live and host this version - between Bill Sheatner and Alton Brown, which would make me green for an hour. As long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and you can take this series on your own merits, you will see it an enjoyable hour.
