Again greetings from darkness. Stunning photography highlights this Disney documentary and gives a glance in the hardness of animals living in the desert. For some 40 years, the Omaha Wild State of Disney and Mutual has given our insights to wild animals from our childhood ... When there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> which always fascinates just how difficult it is for situations of a lot of these royal creatures. The elephants crying for the day, often flowing from the lack of water, oh painful. But their night war against the lions is thrilling. <br /> <br /> Some water shots are breathless. Mother and baby hemps are cool and cool as their "jaws" by seeing the beautiful and great white shark attack. The most amazing scene for me was the breathtaking view of the Himalayas. I have never seen detailed details of this range. <br /> <br /> Today, most young kids will not be very excited, but of course I have the most beautiful photographs ever seen.
