"Great farewell" introduces our first boldness, in which Captain Picard gestured as a personal investigator Dixon Hill. These episodes create some types of standard patterns, repeated in TNA as well as several times in the DS 9 and Viagare. After entering Holodeck something goes wrong and characters will have to deal with the program (programs representing Holodeck's security program failure) under different circumstances outside the game. <br /> <br /> This concept is used to extend the possibility of Star Trek and to enable a combination of customs. Pikard's Dickson Hill example is an example of the crime of 1940s, and his presentation on the screen is often referred to as a movie star, see the leadership of stereotype antiroos (for example Chandler's Marlow story or Polanski's classic "Chinatown"). Star Trek never keeps track of the story (mostly it is a simple "how-out-out-out" scenario) but enables actors to enable their characters for a different approach. Those Holodeck "games" are generally used for entertainment and reflect the personal interests of crew members. Therefore, the technical aspect is always neglected, and from that point of view, the story is never a voice (but it was a technical, scientific point at the time of the Star Trek, I mean, besides some ostentation ideas)? <br /> <br /> <br /> " Big Fare "shows a gentle Patrick Stewart, the McFadden Star Trek episode (at least in the beginning) looks very good and the data shows some great scenes Io I believe that the light is difficult to pull the plug on the wall was really surprised him, that's why he and the customs of the period studied). Wesley continues to be a peaceful trace among potential killers (why do not they take him to Hollde and gangsters kill him?) But all this is fun ...
