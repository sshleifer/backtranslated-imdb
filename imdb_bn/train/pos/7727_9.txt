The Forbidden Planet SF is the best SF movie of the golden era of the film and it is a great film that is astonishing. As soon as the Spaceship Visitors Level - Human Cruise Through Ship - Travel through an intelligent and sometimes terrific adventure. We are the unforgettable Robi, mysterious Dr. Marviss, meet the daughter of her beautiful and innocent girl, the Ultyre, and we can learn about the planet's former inhabitants - Croill died overnight. Or did they? <br /> <br /> You can nippy and say that this planet is depicted in pictured strips with backdrop, but it adds to the dangerous feeling of clustrophobia, and the electronic music of Bebe and Louis Baran adds even more atmosphere. <br /> < br /> I do not hit this image in the top 250 IMDB movies.
