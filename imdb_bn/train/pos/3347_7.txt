Robert Mitchell is in this small but difficult western country like Clint Tollinger: Man with the song. Tollinger is a professional town tamer - in a city, when someone needs to save himself; She is one of those who are brought to make it. The last gigabyte of the tolling comes as an accident: The city wanders for its flowing past, he plays in a city like a local Western gangster puppet. But many people began to start the rental day of tolling, because the way to clean the city becomes very rude (suddenly high plane drift seems less original). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The forgotten and run-of-the-mill ends in darkness and character-centered. The whole picture is very good shot and the cast is very enjoyable. Man View the song with the song with the song with the song with in Mitchell is his usual natural self-image. Not one of his very best performances, Mitchell was still present on the screen of his classic and effective tough guy in high gear and he wasted the action parked, meaningful, and frustrating scenes out of Park Park right out. A nice micham with the Man of the song is Western and easily worth one.
