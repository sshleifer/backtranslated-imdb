When I started watching "Faye Grimm", I had no idea that it was a series of "Henry Flower". Now, the latter was not a movie which I guessed as a signal. But one has arrived, and it's pretty good. I guess you've seen the original, so I will not explain it. This beginning began with Faye (Parker Pci), with whom he died Henry (Thomas J Ryan). Simon (James Arabianak) is still in jail. One day, the boy was expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to the boy. But this is no ordinary toy. It contains a secret that explains what happened in the first movie. And this secret goes deeper in geology than "Syrna". <br /> <br /> I must say that I'm pretty good with what I've done here. Perhaps this one does not value the original value, but it certainly takes a good look at what is happening in the world. And the last page can open the possibility of another signal. <br /> <br /> also played Jeff Goldlam.
