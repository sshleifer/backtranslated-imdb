Until the end of 2005, Star Wars Saagar Six and the last episode, I have always watched the long 1983 entry as the favorite movie of my long-running series. Various action scenes and really different characters (Jabba the Hats, Furro forests etc.) have made this particularly interesting movie. <br /> <br /> No work has been paid too much attention at one place. The last half hour reflects this at the most, because the scenes make the laser-dual switch between Louis Skywalker and Dr. Widder in battle between space ships within a few minutes from June. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two were not in the absence of fighting between the previous two stars. Curry Fisher and Harrison Ford suddenly became annoying. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see. <br /> <br /> Finally, it was just a wonderful adventure story, more than anything else.
