People of Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios did an incredible job with just a small budget for an animated film of just $ 60 million. <br /> <br /> They added modern digital animation. Cast Ray's Romano, John LeGuZamo and Dennis Levi (many of them) totally voice the whole voices to create a very entertaining, family movie with a strong message about care, friendship and care for your fellow group's members. And sometimes it takes different creatures to create a rug. <br /> <br /> Seeing this picture, I received a strong political message in order to contact the people sharing your location - perhaps it might be necessary to look for all the world leaders! David Newman - Still another member of the Newman family of Hollywood musicians - provides a great score that is not sincere, but still takes action and sometimes tapping positive fingers. <br /> <br /> The overall look of the film is incredible; An intense colorful, ice, geyser, mud, rock and ice weird credible fantasyland. Was the character of Rom Romano distinctly reliable even with facial expressions ?? Manfred 'is a special behavior. <br /> <br /> The entire sequence with the Doodles will not leave any doubt that the word 'fool' comes from a doodo. <br /> <br /> This is a good family movie that keeps things that can make children scary or frightening - but it's real. <br /> <br /> It would be a great movie to see the theater and buy at home.
