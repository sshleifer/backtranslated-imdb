Eddie Murphy is one of the most fun comedians ever - probably funny. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I've ever seen and it's a must for those who love to laugh a good! I have seen this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it - I still have side-split fun. This is definitely one of your video libraries. I guarantee that you will have to see it many times to read so much because you will be so ridiculous - you will miss half of them! Wonderful sunny! <br /> <br /> Although there are lots of interesting curiosity - after watching this stand-up comedy, most of them would look like second-class citizens. If you have never seen it - get it, see it - and you like it !! It will have to be done by you !!! :-)
