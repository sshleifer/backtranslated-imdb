Director John Byerman, with director of Pacinpah Straw Dogs and Clockwork Orange, confusedly gave Man an effective movie about the violent direction, which is reasonably a sure film of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, John Voight, Ned Batty, and Rony Kox portrayed four Atlanta merchants, who called the royals "a big, dead lake" to take a canoe trip down the Wild Kahulawesi River in northern Georgia. /> <br /> But locals see a painful clear scene of their "city boys" rally through their jungle. And the next day, continuing beneath the river, Bati and Voet are accused of two rogue mountain men (Beel McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" cover) and victims of sexual abuse (the film's infamous "Transparent" sequence). In this way, nothing other than a lark by Adalachchian, which has started to become a nightmare, in which four of our plays came to see the thin lines existing in civilization and barbarity. <Br> <br /> James Dickie has adapted the screenplay from his own best selling book, and the fruit is often sticky and annoying. Often "recognized" for him! And the "Dualing Banjos" sequence, Deliverance is also extremely dull, with four top people being superb in their roles, and MacKinney and the Cover made two for the most terrible villains of all times. A must see film for those who are willing to take an opportunity.
