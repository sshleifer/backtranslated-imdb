Since the musicals have gone out of both fashion and are incredibly expensive without all the talents needed to build under the contract with the studio, I suspect that we can never get a real life of Enrico Carouson. <br /> <br /> But if there is anything else, then no Hollywood studio has attempted to do this work until Mario Lanzer under Metro-Goldwine-Girl's contract. No one could do it, I doubt whether to doubt it. <br /> <br /> and why it should be. I think Enrico Caruso himself was pleased to sing on the screen. His tone was his life in the voice, his reasons for staying in the world. <br /> <br /> It is common for her to take her life independently. Caruso, like his illustrated person, was a big hungry man with much more self-discipline. He had a lot of relationship with several women and two married boys who were not present in this film were born. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the recording industry is considered to be almost a thought. He is shown in a recording studio late in his life. In fact, he started recording at the right near the last century's celebration, and for the RSA Victor, he made the recording industry with the Irish Tenor John McCormack. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCarthak were at their heights, you virtually see which of them live to be a ticket heir. But many immigrants had a phonograph and a record of Italian and Irish families, or three of these three. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Opera Stick Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and got nomination for dress and set design. <br /> <br /> Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RSA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately due to contractual obligations, we could not get an actual cast album with Anne Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jermilla Novotona. <br /> <br /> While Blayet sang in this movie, Langer was one of the biggest recordings of the year to make The Great Curtuso popular. <br /> <br /> If you look for the life of Enrico Carousar, it is not. You do not miss Great Carso, you want to sing a great artist at the height of his career.
