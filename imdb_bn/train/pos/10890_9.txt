Come on people. This movie is even better than 4. I see it happening ... rich people have done crazy things. And it was funny. <br /> <br /> I see a comedy, away from world pressures for entertainment, and do not take anything seriously. This movie perfectly suits that purpose. I'm not judging a movie on her own competence and living out of Christmas living Saddles. I saw to be completely cared for the sick people, the desired ones could easily live down the street from my home. It will remain on my favorite list ... Must watch for the holiday season. If you want to have fun for 90 minutes then check it out.
