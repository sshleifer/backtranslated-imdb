I basically saw 8 general rules in the Disney Channel UK for the first series and were completely submerged. When they do not show it is more annoying, but then the ABC 1 shows the second series. I do not think another sequence will start after John Ritter's death, but the second series was not surprising, the last series is an excellent quality. I hope they are going to produce more shows though I can see every show thousands of times. Perform amazing in my favorite character and skinny as Kaley Kupo airhead Bridget. Rory is good, he shared my name and gramps. Until I finish it until the end, I hope it's fun as before
