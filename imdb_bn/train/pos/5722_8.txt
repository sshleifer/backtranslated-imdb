This was great. I saw the Japanese version first, perhaps it was probably the most horrific movie I ever seen. It was not blood and emptiness, it was ruthless, atmospheric and terrifying. While giving my mother on the bed in Japanese version, I had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be filled with water, and Bufi would take away the strange version of dark version of Bufi. I do not need to be concerned. The creator of this movie kept the same Japanese people advertising, who was involved with the original film and directed the film to the same person. They set the same place in Japan at the same place. In fact, the Japanese director suffered the pain of being criticized for reviewing the film, which was originally the only difference was the cast of American actors. It has actually become an advantage because it added "strange strangers" to the overall horror. Not only were they not afraid of utterly terrible and unselfish ghosts, but they were completely trapped in foreign lands due to being united in society. It just added the overall concern created in the movie and I had a nice touch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She looks weak and able to express her fears well. There are none of the general Smart Alak comments on horror movies in America, or a lantern that is frustrated by the dark and horror of character status. Actually, it was as good as a ring that I absolutely enjoyed. I hope the start of Japan's New Wave Hinger will start with the incredible success of the Ringer more closely in the horror of America's future. We finally get the movie which can be classified as "Horoscope" !! 8/10
