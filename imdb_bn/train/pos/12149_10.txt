I agree with another user here and say that it is one of the best Kung Fu movies! I saw this as a kid and absolutely loved it! Folding scenes are bright and he is regarded as an outcast because you can really empathize with this guy. Excellent humor and fantastic kungfu rock this movie! If you like Kung Fu, you will like it !!!
