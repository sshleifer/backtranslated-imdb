Many humor can be lost on non-NZ'ers, but give it a go! <br /> <br /> Since the Y series matte and Chris are behind the big and good (?) things have gone away. NZ's greatest brave-devil Stuntman, Randy Campbell has often appeared in the British TV series Bull of Styles. Yes, he still f ^ @ ks up all his stunts because he is very drunk <br /> <br /> 'House Band' was released from Dejoo Videu 2 album, Brown's abbath and Back-in-Brown. A member of the band's Y-Team team and the single 'I will give you a donation of my beer (but I only got 6)' and you are also a member of 'not even born in 80'. <br /> <br /> The South-by-Southwest Film Festival has released its feature length film 'The Devil Made May Do It It' which will be released in NZ in early 2008. <br /> <br /> All, if you guys are not funny then you just F% ^ K OFF !!
