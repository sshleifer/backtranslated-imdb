Intriguing Exciting Dramatic Explosive Complex Epic The word that is called simply the story is touching the ice tip. <br /> <br /> In rare visual influences from acting, LOST is an essential show of television for fans of science. - Fiction, imagination, action, adventure, and a lot and a lot of mystery. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It can be "smoke monster" for smoked beer, trustworthy in terms of LOST eye candy. <br /> <br /> As far as the story goes, this show can not be compared to the vastness of viewers like I do. Beginning in the end, the continuity is virtually perfect, the letters develop, and the growing story slowly answers many of the answers to her questions. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is virtually no error at LOST. For the dramatic / science-fi television that has been arrested, it has improved for the comedy: it sets bars. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend patience, talent, and love every moment of the journey, how long it takes to reach the end. <br /> <br /> Check out this show.
