When I was the chairman of the caf√©house of our college, our work was to review the team and film for students' activities. One of the best things to do with Groove Tube was in 1972. In the original context, it was shown off-of-the-clock on the theater where television monitors were placed across the audience, so everyone had a great seat. The evidence is that the Scot will be changed regularly- Ala Saturday Night Live, keep it fresh. They decided to make it in a film for the general distribution. <br /> <br /> I believe the developers say that this was the first time that Chase was in Chase. Although he was nude, yet the jungle was crying. Like many before me reviews, it was a matter of Saturday Night Live before it exists. I highly recommend this vid. I asked my 13-year-old son about Koko - he could not wait to get a copy!
