This is one of only a few films where there is a lot of boyfriend apart from pornographic, despite having only one very basic plot. There is no live word or dialogue; Instead, actors voice their experiences, voice over-over, why they participated etc. <br /> <br /> This is a document. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I totally understand why nobody tried to do something like that. There already is something like this. this. :-) <br /> <br /> NB: Producer does not have the right to distribute DVD versions. I have not seen it being sold anywhere; Someone can email Mr. Bonner and order a copy in VHS.
