I saw this series at the age of thirteen years old and after 30 years I was watching again in the DVD. The pictures on the opening credit did not leave me. It has affected my eyes in the world and in humans. My parents had been with me for a long time to watch the series, and we always discuss the program later. This gave me a love for the history history and the highest mark in our school's universal examination! <br /> <br /> Voice and delivery of Sir Lawrence Olivier is timeless and perfect. I think the people living through it will think that this is their version of World War II history. I can not imagine ever getting bored looking it. Perhaps a similar Shawn War series can be considered, although it is difficult to imagine that Sir can replace Lawrence. <br /> <br /> Buy it!
