Jackie (Iris Gavin of Rick Myar's "Vixen" and "The Wall of the Dolis", Jackie among them, after being sent to prison after 10 years or more for being at risk of drug abuse), the role of the last movie) is to be used to living in the big 'doll' room Or, at least this early film has to be tried by Jonathan Dummy. Due to his intellectual nature and intensive observability, I would rank it as his "Lamb's of Silence" and "Stop Making Sense" as the best film on the right, but far away from any other film. This little classic is not only fun and gratifying enough to be guilty of a very guilty blissful pleasure for the campsie, lazy and fun, and never goes to the overboard on all the parodies of the jail in Inner Generation-in-General. It washed out the harmful bad taste of the "Fieldlandia" from the smiling publicity of my face. However, the film does not decrease (the 'antantent show' sits for a long time and goes far and wide, repeatedly and again in the other small things), but these stops do not stop you from watching or otherwise enjoying a movie. <br /> <br /> My grade: B- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: 5 minutes Roger Chronon interview; Cast and crew Bios; Original trailer; And Candy "Juvenile Brown, Cheryl" and "Candy Lip Nurse" (with nudity), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (with nudity), and "Crazy Mama" "Rainbucks" Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ela Reid, Linda Gold, and others all show skin
