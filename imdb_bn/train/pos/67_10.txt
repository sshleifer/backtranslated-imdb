Industries dropped the ball over this The trailer did not judge the film and when it opened it was in one hand with the screens. People had the opportunity to see it, it was very successful in the face work. 2 lead actresses give each really great story and especially the emotional performance that you draw from the characters. I checked it based on the recommendation of Rave Ripper of his book or (Ebert and Roper) RAV. An example of a great movie which was not completely released without a few screens.

What kind of words are we living? AGHhh. So the world right to see this again and recommend it.
