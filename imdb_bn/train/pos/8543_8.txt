It was one of those films that I probably would not have liked for Sandughti, but it came one day in the IFC and I said - Erie Stodge, William Forces ... why not? If I had changed the channel, I would have really missed a treasure. <br /> <br /> This is a sad - young writer paralyzed to rise to an accidental accident at the center of low-grade rehabilitation. It is so easy to make a manipulative tear-jarker and it's tempting. But, it does not happen because it was written by Neil Jimenez, later he himself died accidentally. Here's no Hollywood happiness. All patients in the ward come from different backgrounds, but because of their mercy towards others, they share the feelings of helplessness. Storge is very good like a "lone wolf" type, forced to depend on embarrassment over his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is as great as a former man-woman, whose family is separated; But William Forced takes care of the cake, and it is determined to give someone a hard person money to get his freedom back. <br /> <br /> See this picture.
