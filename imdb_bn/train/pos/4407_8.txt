For those who commented on Patriot's accuracy (which mainly shot the English), it was interesting to watch this movie. Through all accounts this bloody battle was that Americans were ever involved, and they were the only nationalities. Therefore, historical accuracy from the Atlantic was very refreshing to see something similar, which does not portray America as a martyr or a civil. Although the film is a real threat to any conflict and any action that takes place in the war, it only does bad things, which often ends in the pain of innocent people. This was not a movie where you screamed but both of them expressed sorrow.
