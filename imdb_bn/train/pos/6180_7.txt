At the inaugural night of Vanities, a female catwoman died on the stage. If the program is going on, then the police can cut into pieces and kill them and why the final screen is before. <br /> <br /> I've always heard that it's a great classic comedy mystery so I was excited to find myself a copy. Unfortunately someone told me and continues to go about musical numbers. Although what Hollywood did on their glorious day, of course, they became frustrating because they stopped filming despite efforts to make work around them. If the music was half good then it would not be so bad, but it's not. There is only one good song. Worse, the studio knew that they had a song, a cocktail for two, and we were forced to endure four versions of it: a Dualite, a large production number, vanity end, and background music. I do not think Spike Jones and his City Slickers have never played so much. Victor McLaughlan is nicely with Jack Okey, the rest of the movie is pretty good. Charles Middleton is very funny that his view as an actor of love with dresses wearing accessories. <br /> <br /> If you think you can get through musical numbers, or want to scan, I can not recommend it anyway. Through them. This is a fun movie that they do not have anything else to do.
