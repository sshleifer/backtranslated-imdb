This film is really relevant to the threat of biological terrorism and also about superbugs, the West Blue Virus and Sirs threat. As a thriller, the tension is fairly intense. Richard Wymark and Paul Douglas are more than qualified in their role. The main plot of the internal scene between Widmark and his wife provide an excellent interlude. The actor of this photo who has put his mark on the maximum is Jack Slanas. Its intensely defined features and seemingly easy extrovert always ruin the way the harmful and cruel people expressed below the surface. Chase view through packing plants is even impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
