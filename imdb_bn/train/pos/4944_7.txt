Nothing much will happen in this movie but there are a lot of money. She thought she was all she could do in her life, but it was not true, and when she conducted some research for her next job, she found herself. It should really be like movies, I'm not as old as "mature" (IM 13) and I still get the idea and point of the film. My opinion of the main point: Do not think you might have had good life, just because you have this one. <br /> <br /> Although I acknowledge I was thinking of watching another movie after reading all the reviews and I saw the trailer I decided, though I did not know that most of the work will be present in this picture. I recommend someone to watch this movie because it has very good points in the film and it's really good finishes.
