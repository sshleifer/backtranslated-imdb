I have seen this movie three times. In the last time, I continue to get around the confusing scenes to find solutions for the plot. Perhaps the plot is not logically intended to be held together. Or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because the withdrawal of Anne's remote events is rather flawed. <br /> <br /> Take the young en grant (Clayer Danes). Here a young woman who came with an affluent family in an uninhabited college. He will have to help afford this very expensive education, but there seems to be any family ties at all times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then <br /> <br /> When Harris gives Lilah comfort after the sad demise of her brother body, Anne suddenly bothers him and hates his behavior. I must miss something remarkable here. Ann's behavior seems completely unavailable. Anne relinquished her relationship with Harris and married Lillar's marriage to one of the girls. Despite Harris's rejection of Array, he maintained deep feelings for her at her death. <br /> <br /> It was clear from his behavior that Harris had deeply hurt Anne and she was happily married with him. Lilar's wedding scene showing years of marriage shows that Harriss has still expressed deep feelings for Anne. <br /> <br /> The film showed a pattern for Anne's romantic relationships. He was always a Fallen with his men and he rejected them. This pattern is held with Harris and two husbands. In contrast, Lila married a man whom she did not love, and she lived with her husband until she died. Perhaps Lilla could have developed a relationship because she refused to fail her marriage. <br /> <br /> Then comes the very convenient restoration of lily juice beside Anna's bed. Clearly, Ann's nurse Lila was able to find enough information from the last few of Ann's last few days to detect and contact Ann. This conversation did not appear in a picture. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that Anne lived in his last days. How was he able to buy such a house in the small earnings of his singer career? The financial disaster takes one step ahead when Ann always raises her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I enjoy film setting and music very much. The seaside palace was just so heartbreakingly beautiful. Claire Dances was as bright as Young Anan Grant. He is a really talented singer. I liked her natural brunette in addition to her bottle blonde look in film. If only those painful CGI fireflies will go away, I can raise a whole point of movie on my vote!
