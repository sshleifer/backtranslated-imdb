When it came out a year after it reached the American film, I saw it first. My little head flew away, I was only 16 years old and it was the first new wave music, which I heard, strictly lucky, the classic child was growing up. The amazing appearance of the Hejel O'Connor and the performances of the charismatic vocalist, and Phil Daniels's harsh but soft cakny director's music stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Price's Sax Player. He was out of place in the band and so cruel and unfortunate places, he just begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes, lights out when performing, and love scenes on trains. <br /> <br /> OK, so the movie is not everyday! But it was for the limited budget and it was surprising for Britain's screenplay in the early 80's, exploding with rebellious youth, looking for a way out of the Dol Row. I went to Britain only a few years later and when I was there I found a very refined film of the environment I found. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, with some extraordinary performance and music will blow you away. <br /> <br />
