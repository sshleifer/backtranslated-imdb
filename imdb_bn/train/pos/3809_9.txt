Have you heard the stories of the unwilling heroes who appointed a king to kill a dragon? Oh, are you there? It was set in a world of fully floating small islands on top of the clouds, and the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from an island next to their ride? Water flow levitate on the horizon of upward and great residues of the city? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> I threw this movie accidentally and I'm really glad that I did it! It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Like Pixar movies, it is a part of computer animated art that is possible in today's world. Animationers have thought about almost everything on the screen, and this attention is expanding in detail (the scene where the front mushrooms roll in green smoke, one of my favorites when the letters run unreasonably in the background). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Our characters are desired and interesting, in the world of viewers To make sure that they are almost impossible to reach the finish line and often destroy the dragon who can destroy everything on its way. Of course, hector will fall in love with the character. Tremendous tendency to talk about a small blue animal with crazy green and nonsense and English mix, Hector Jar offers a comedy relief similar to Jar Beng just like a dream. <br /> <br /> In summary, I'll recommend you get the chance to watch Dragon Hunters. For incredible animation, see the battle scenes for breathing and a different light from what you saw on any movie or television screen in the world. At the very least, this is a fun way to spend one and a half hours - you are neither nine nor nine (which is actually I)!
