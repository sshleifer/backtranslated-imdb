I wanted to know how critics of this enthusiastic, inspirational film responded to critics, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was disappointed with the discovery of Pumpus Peanut Gallery in our country's film critics, which is 43% (or "Rotten") rating. <br /> <br /> I can say that if you can not remove this movie you have no heart. (It is interesting to note that the same movie received 74% rating from the same movie viewer). <br /> <br /> The critics' opinion is not so important to me. After all, I can not seem more vulnerable, overpaid occupation. Some skymos pay for going to movies (what a difficult life) and the rest of the planet do the same thing: forming an opinion. But these champs have a way to get their ideas that are more important than you, and even worse, they love to hate. <br /> <br /> I'll arrange this movie for you as old (better, except for F-bombs), Syrapea, and a little expected ... Finally, you know right from the beginning that Cuba Gooding Junior, naval hero in real life Karl illustrates brasserie, will win in each run (ultimately) by way of simply across it: determined and lucky; Strong intentional and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But its performance and De Niro (Billy Sunday, as a composite character of many real life people) is so strong, so inspirational that you will be much of your foot film scenes, especially courtroom climax cheering. The mud you do not move by this scene will be a real stick. The films of our country are like critics. Michael Rapaport is a nice and well-liked sweet, stateroom diving student who has made friends with Goodness's Brasier. If someone has seen "higher education", then this character completely rearranges that character. <br /> <br /> However, confirm what I felt: Do not listen to critics. See this movie and get inspired.
