It's one of the best "our gang" shorts of all time. Spanky is her very perfect and funniest, and she is sunny in the children left to get that babiesit. The little pretty is coerced into watching all their younger siblings by the gang. The first shot to drive them all to the kids, a beautiful gog entertained by various things stuck by the gang from the fishing pins. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because of its response - "Hey, you will not find that stuff - I do not care for any kids!" The little colleague says "Excellent" across the film, adding all the beautiful Gaga, and adding the Spanish "All about Tarzan" to add this best "Our Gang" which you can see.
