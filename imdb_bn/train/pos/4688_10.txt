I showed it in my 6th grade class almost 17 years ago and the students liked it. I liked it very much. Their interaction stories with Termites and their environment are amazing. Throwing animals deep and they all play well in their part. The really cool footage in the two cold bloody titans. <br /> <br /> Allan Root has done some incredible cameras and it won the best documentary Oscar. My copy does not describe Osoron Welles (Derek Jacobby) and this is not called "Cluster of Clays", only "Clash of Clay" It reminds me that it has been added to get Star with Welles and added to an Oscars. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to find this VHS recently and it is now my kids favorite movie. They brought it to the last family gathering instead of a Disney movie. If you can find this movie then you are actually lucky.
