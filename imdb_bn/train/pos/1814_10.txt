All dogs go to heaven, in my opinion, the best animated film ever made. I'm not really a big fan of animated movies, but there's something about it that I found to be better than any other animated movie. Music like Bart Reynolds, Dome Deloise, and especially the King Gateor, especially the performance of the Cain page, is a wonderful music. "Let's muse music togaste" is probably one of my favorite songs from any movie music. This must definitely be seen for people of all ages.
