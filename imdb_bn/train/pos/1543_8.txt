I think this movie looks like years ago, BBC2. I want to see it again - does anyone know how I can get a copy? I think it was a particularly powerful movie, especially the view that stood, was the mask of the horses. Still, I can not remember much about the story - that is why I want to see it again! I trod the web but did not find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - probably not a DVD or VHS in the market. Nobody would appreciate any help that this can give me. Thank you in advance for your support. Best of luck, Albany234@googlemail.com
