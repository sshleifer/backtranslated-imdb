Although it's a "Revenge Price Plot" quality, this film is my favorite Vinceant Price. Gallico has many horrible movie characters that are missing characters- favorite. When you see it, you feel for him, you feel his disappointment, injustice against him, and you encourage him when he goes for revenge, though he is afraid of his original anger. The film continues, its character becomes tragic. He killed him, but now he has to cover it. And cover that one again. And again ... your stomach sinks with his soul when it goes down to its spiral - seeing the brother of love becomes a hood. Even if the revenge story is outdated, the plot itself is the original - Galico uses its techniques to kill more and more innovative ways. The shame is not available for veiwing this one home.
