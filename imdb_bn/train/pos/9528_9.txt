Actually, this film has mostly gone away from the opponents' head. <br /> <br /> The opposite of separation (lost) is being saved (reserved) and this movie has fewer ideas to deal with them. The film also explores the love and frustration that comes in relation to the relationship between parents. It should be noted that none of these are currently fashionable themes. <br/> <br /> <br /> In this context, parents have to do Hit-Man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hendz) and his criminal John John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their boys and do something to protect them. But Rooney's son Connor is worse than everyone else. He killed one of Rooney's own terrible soldiers to steal from his father. When Conan saw Sullivan's son Michael that he saw it, he accidentally killed Sullivan's other son (and Sulvan's wife) to try to silence the Witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decided that he would like to take revenge on any price even even very high cost of destruction. One of the scenes of Roni, who was born in Connor, refused to leave his son Connor Sullivan, and hired a contract killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. Rooney to Participation joined his son Conn. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film, she follows Connery Rooney under Sullivan Road to Paradishan following her surviving son Young Michael and follows Maguire Sullivan. When Sullivan encounters Rooney in a church basement and claims that Connor leaves Conn in the murder of his family, Rooney says, "Michael, there are only murders in this room ... and there is only one guarantee, none of us can see heaven." After the movie is over, some predictions are reserved, one character is reserved and one character's remorse. <br /> <br /> I'm not fond of big Tom Hans, but he resigned from the character to play Hit-Man Sullivan firmly, performing a delicate and laconic performance. Newman has played well as the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing a tough line in his face and manner, his eyes were scared by Connor's mistakes. Judaism plays Maguire as a good creator. Tyler Howellin is naturally and without any impact the young Michael plays. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a continuation of the dark, reflecting the themes of salvation and destruction. Cameras impressed from a palette of greens and grays. Grays belong to the Illinois Urban Landscape of the grandfather and depression era. Green leafy green boys and the state's rural flatlands were involved. Thomas Newman's lovely, golden, and hunting music was in a tangible Irish overturn and was played in a system like Copland. The authentic Mid Western Urban set was in the factories, churches. Shining buildings with shiny woodwork <br /> <br /> The film's excellence includes its progressive theme, independent acting, and the unique feeling of engraved music and painting. The only negative reaction was the removal of a small anti-gun message that was scrapped, the film only protested the political majority. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 out of 10; In time it will be recognized as a great film.
