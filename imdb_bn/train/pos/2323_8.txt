A beautiful picture of "The Man in the Moon". It is very well done at all times and is well done in all cases. I did not say that this image was very original, but what are these days? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cast members did a great job about their respective roles. I'm really glad to see Reese Witherspoon at a very young age, and work quite well. Jason London works well. And Sam Waterton, the only person who was recognized, was an excellent performer with his role. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Trant). Sometimes he thinks how you fear your father, but eventually you like his character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would suggest reading plots synopsis and if you want to be interested in Think of something, then go for it then. However, hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading, <br /> - Chorus
