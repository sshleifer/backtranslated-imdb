After receiving some great ratings at the point of SUPERB, I was very pleased with the film. The image was dark, moving, angry, pain, crime and very impressive monster. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to see many special effects at first, and like the lover of the lover, it blows me off. With it's subtlety and its accuracy. Brian, I have again flown away with the story and your artistic with your special effects. You go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> was the first number of Best Actor Award Eric Ittbury. You see Junior Lopez as a child compared to Kasadiya. :) <br /> <br /> Overall, acting, story lines, high quality filming and extraordinary effects, it was fantastic. I just had it long. I'm looking forward to Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
