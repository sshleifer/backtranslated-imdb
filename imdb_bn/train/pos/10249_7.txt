This is the first out of the Guinea Pig series, and one of the more notorious movies outside the collection is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This notorious film Party I bought the Guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection by the date of the release. So I popped in this sucker and sitting. <br /> <br /> From what I read on the Internet, and realized the content involved in this film, I was expected to complete my tough nerve test. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wrong Film shock is failing. It may be this year because I've been helplessly feeling helpless in my feelings, but I think it's safe to be sure that Gorehound can sit easily. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the person who does not have good knowledge of this type of film may be frustrated and annoyed by the images that are seen on the screen. Although it failed to frustrate me, the film has a slightly brighter and graphic view of violence. A needle through the fingertips of the lungs, the unconscious woman's intestines, and the eyes. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think for most of this board, Gaurhand thinks that you can get your hands on just one copy of this film for its innovation, but I suggest that you have to do your work for such a new actor .
