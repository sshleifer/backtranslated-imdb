The fourth of the "Dirty Harry" series, I played one of the most hateful, vulgar, obscene, disgusting, disgusting women in the film: "Ray Parkinson," played by Audrey Nien. He is the latest nasty low-life version of the 1945 "Detroit" character, "Anne Savage." <br /> <br /> His deadly face and brutal attitude has blocked me so close that I have not achieved a prejudice filter which is close to him .... and at least something! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Harry Collaughn" (Clint Eastwood) goes everywhere, following the violence immediately! Within minutes! This often gets ridiculous, but it creates a satisfying finish for a fast, entertaining movie because all the squabb villains are deleting each other. <br /> <br /> This is a very horror film that appeals to our base instincts ..... and connects, the connection is called. Many of us want to see these durbs, eventually it ends, and who is better than Darty Harry?
