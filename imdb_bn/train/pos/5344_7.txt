This is a very good Spanish movie but I am worried that many people will be lost because many people around the world have no idea about what happened during the Spanish Civil War or in the war. Being a history teacher, I had a great advantage but you can easily see how the film can be confusing until you combine all the pieces. I doubt whether this movie will be a big concern in the movie where it was made in Spain, but for some other viewers, they may be a little confused after the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 12 years old Carroll and her mother is returning to her mother's house. The year has passed and you gather that you are coming to Spain from New York City. Despite curiosity, Carroll is reasonably well-spoken, and mostly about how he adapted the movie. Why do her and her mother alone, I'll expand it for those who do not raise the issue that Carroll's father is fighting for war on the Republicans (who have finally lost in bloody conflicts). <br /> <br /> The movie gets exceptional marks for her lovely camera work and music. Instead of slow and rainbow speed is not bad if you are someone who can take movies in such a way. I have seen a number of Spanish films about this war and it's good to them - not bad or bad - just a backdrop as well as a wonderful arrival of life, life is a decent part of the film. <Br> <br /> - If you did not know which side, Republicans were mostly socialist and were supported by volunteers from the Soviet Union and Mexico and many countries (including the United States). The leadership of the United Nations led by Franco and was assisted by the assistance of the fascist kingdom of Portugal and Germany and Italy.
