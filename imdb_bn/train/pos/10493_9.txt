This movie is inspiring for someone who is financially or emotionally difficult to jam. The best medicine that you will definitely laugh! :) Look at the bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace has to find a new way to earn some money and it laughs, which is not entirely legal. Even my boyfriend liked it so it does not think of a chick-flick.
