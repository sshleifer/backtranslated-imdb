I saw this movie after watching it on Broadway. I love Broadway musical and I love movies. Broadway shows are not related to movies. I was a warm reader and when they turned into movies, I saw what happened in most books, so I really developed a vision early. Guess that this movie will be based on (or musical in this case), but the story line can be the same, but it will not be the same, it will be different so it will look different. <Br /> <br /> I used to dance to dance 12 years ago. I was a good dancer (working as a child in local productions etc.) but I was not very talented. But I was very talented as show rider. I was told by my dancing instructor and my trainer (I spent several months a year on his farm outside the state) that I had to choose from when I was 14 years old. I had to dance for two hours four hours a week and 7 days a week, we spent 3 hours a day and devoted one or the other. So I love to dance and I like many of these movies and other ballet and dance movies. What I liked to see for this movie, it's a great movie about raw emotions and human interaction. When you really work hard to get something you want and when you do not get it, then it's about the power of expectation and despair. I love the movie. I love Broadway musicals.
