This movie is really good. The plot, which works like maze forces and acts like guesswork, will do next. Such a strategy brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solving a puzzle. The war scene is very good. There are different war styles (though one of the styles was somewhat uncomfortable for me, but this is just my opinion) and it's interesting to see. The only thing which can be annoying is to look at actors. A bit too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at Kung-Fu films, especially in the 70s and 80s, so the "Five genome" (or other versions) is a great choice.
