My second attempt at Devil's Playing Joseph Sara Product Although I would say it is more enjoyable than the painful and neutral Swedish will, it is still a little slow and vague for my taste. <br /> <br /> This is a group of vampires resident surrounding a group of girls, who want to revive their previous murderer "leader". To do so, girls dance near the nude and kiss each other and have strange chant - and of course get some blood. When a doctor and his brother's car breaks down and they have to stop in the fort to stay - they provide ideal purple for horny vampires ... but they can not feel helpless ... <br /> <br /> Plating of DEVIL The 70's first absorption sleaze is a fantastic example. With a lot of nudity - some full, some lazy underworn - colleagues and, of course, jealousy ... but these scenes are still very bad by today's standards. These beautiful women could benefit from some more explicit sex, but I think it can not be all. It also benefited from some heavy violence / gore, although it was a vampire film, but I think the game's purpose was more of the skin, rather than blood. Still a bit slower - and absolutely wood played for the most part - but it should be expected from some of this era and this budget. A look for fans to exploit is valuable - others might find it very little nuance for their favorite. 7/10
