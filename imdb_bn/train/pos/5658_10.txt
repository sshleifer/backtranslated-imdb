This is one of the best shows made for TV. Mysteries and conspiracies and twists are full and active. Compulsory viewing I was lucky I saw in the UK. They may have missed the episode order, I can not remember, but at least it was regular time each week. My girlfriend and I jumped from the trailer, and none of us is a big fan of American series. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew it was something special. We missed a few episodes, and it made you sad and crazy for a week, who lost that guy. <br /> <br /> Great casting, superb acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as a cast. Lucas Black turned an amazing performance for a kids, and Paige Turco was very well from her five party. And Nick Circca, of course, along with Sheriff's long troubles. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and confusing bits, which I guess would be later explained later, and there is no doubt in the next series. That made the last weak, and you could say they would kill it. What do we have to go? Why do they do that with one of the best shows? Shoot the Exec.
