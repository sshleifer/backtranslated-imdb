Deliverance is impressive by James Dickey, hunting and sometimes even annoying stories, becoming a brilliant movie of John Burman. This is about four businessmen who are conducting a canoning weekend in the hills, managed by childhood and machining behavior. There, they face every dark direction of man and the worst of the worst of human beings ... poverty, idleness and even physical harassment! These four men wanted to leave the river to be excited for bravery, but their civilization soon changed into an audiovisan through violent and secretive mountain ranges, which completely abstained from all forms of civilization. All these elements actually make the most nightmarish films Deliverance I've ever seen. Just about what happened to these men, you pray that you will not get yourself in such a situation. Pure conversation movie, Deliverance as well as a very important movie. John Bojman's Best (followed by Gerardz and Acalibur) - and still - is a very influential film and it has many memorable scenes that are already featured in numerous other movies. Just think about the horrible "Dual Banjos" musical score and, of course, unforgettable gay "scream like a pig" rape scene. All actors (haha) provide perfect acting performance. Especially John Voight. Must see a motion picture !!
