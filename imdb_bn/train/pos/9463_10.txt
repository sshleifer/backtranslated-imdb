I liked "Dan in real life" A wonderful travel-to-love story such as when you received mail or while you were sleeping, but the ridiculously visible gog and funny jokes are not full and it's not romantic, so it wants to throw you away. <br /> <br /> Dan Barnes (Steven Carroll) is a popular consultant columnist who can not find things in his life directly. Until one day, the family service / trip, he joined Mei and immediately associated with Marie (always beautiful Juteet Binouch), which is a brilliant example of a woman who is made up of an eleven filter coming back to the classic movies starlets. The cup of chemistry takes place on a cup of tea and muffin, but Marie will certainly stop for the previous selfishness, and they must take part. After <br /> We treat Dan's tight-boot, fun-loving relatives who are not only very large but also use many intellectuals and intellectuals as sweet bunny Dan, enjoying it as a joke. I loved so much that even though family features may be viewed as objectionable to somebody, I think it is a great illustration of a big family that does not run parody or crude excessively. The Barnes family is simply a close, loving group that really is best for Dan. There are wonderful awkward family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is dirty, but not money-spirit or gossipy; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dan then falls in love with his brother's girlfriend, gathered in his family. And thus a roller-coaster interrupted greed and fun love-budding start. <br /> <br /> I could go but I thought the movie was just awesome. It is not particularly "hip" or "tricky", in modern cinema many comedies, such as dry humor or not intelligent, are very sound and obscure. There is a wonderful balance of storytelling and interesting-but-real dialogue. Indeed, at the beginning of the film, the initial romance of love began with a classic Hollywood-style conversation, where the characters started thinking with a lot of enthusiasm. So perhaps I thought and repeat myself, but I highly recommend "Dan in real life". It's a great movie, trust me, you laugh, and if you're a singer like me you'll get a little lusty eye. Full of fun and magical love, "Donate to the real life" will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> =================== 4 out of 4 stars in grade A
