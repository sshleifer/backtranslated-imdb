A special day (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /> <br /> Once each time, you touch a nerve that really covers a film. This one offers a very simple compound, almost flawlessly executed every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It's astonishing scandal, "Una Georanet", and even hated by some critics. Time out is 'garbage' and Leonard Multin, somewhat light, 'happy but trivial.' Not only is this film going deeper, I disagree, but in its simple story, I found that I have seen more insight into everyday life in fascist Italy than most movies. Cinematography is obviously curious, even a little tone, and simplifies the story, which can explain the film's relative ambiguity. Audiences of late '70 did not completely lose with the great Italian movies, even the strangers did not even get along with the critics. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a ten-minute collage of archive footage. On May 8, 1938, from Hitler's Italy tour Set against this background, we meet lonely housewife Antonio (Lorraine) with the six children of the first Roman apartment building. One day, when his boy escapes, he meets his neighbor Gabriel (Mastriani), who thinks he is merely a building without attendance. He is well-established, Sanskrit and soon he is attracted to him. During the whole film, we heard the Fort-Mount rally from the Kangyar radio through the courtyard. Scola playfully uses the camera as part of our activity. After the initial scene, the camera swims across the premises of the modernist (at Hypermoderne) apartment block, which looks for our main characters, which we have not yet met. <br /> <br /> Marcelo Masstraani and Sofia Lorraine are unforgettable in the two leading roles, more surprising since they are completely disconnected. Canada-born John Vernon starred Lauren's husband, but he remained on screen only in the first and last scenes. I think his voice was dubbed, because he was not an Italian descendant and did not live in my knowledge, so I can not imagine that he speaks Italian. Her voice has been dubbed, I do not notice at all. On the contrary, he is fully trustworthy as Italian, more than the rest cast. The story is simple but highly effective, performance outstanding, the finishing is simply perfect and framing does not come as ugly but works perfectly. Do not miss this one. <br /> <br /> Camera Asphuara --- 9/10
