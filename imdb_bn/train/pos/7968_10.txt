I saw this first 6 or 7 year old film and really it does not particularly feel special. As time went on I saw it a few more times and it started to grow on me, because I started to understand the morality of the movie, which I will go later. For a while I kept this picture alone and did not see it for a while. While looking for an old classic movie to watch a few weeks ago (now 15 years old), I dug VHS outside the homework. After watching this I could not really explain that I was left on a natural high. The film gives a great feeling of joy that you will never expect. The nature of the films that are combined together of three completely different creatures really send a message to find their habit, no matter how different you are, you can always find the common ground, which you need. The character of personality of character is really fantastic. In it you are an old cognitive golden stranger, little cute, a little weird young American bulldog with a weak but confident cat, if interesting loving 'looking' or guide guide. This journey follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is not really real, it creates magic, so that you start believing that this journey can happen. <br /> <br /> I do not want to hear sounds like a soft tissue occupier when it comes to film. I assure you that I am totally opposite, but the most encouraged part of this movie comes back without any doubt, when the shadows try to escape sternly And the scope and sassy, ​​painfully called to leave him. When both animals come back to their beloved owners, they are silent until the shadows fall on all the horror on the horizon. There is a fine line in the heartwarming and authentic trash but this image is also a true magician at the age of 15. This picture may not be the Lord of the Rings but Disney could produce such a fantastic film using animals and could promote itself for it even at this age 10.
