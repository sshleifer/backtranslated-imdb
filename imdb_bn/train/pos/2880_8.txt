"Cinderella" is the most beloved of all the Disney classics. And it really deserved its status. Based on Charles Perreault's alleged classic fairy tale, the film follows Cinderella's judgment and misery, a good girl, who is misused by her mischievous and equally unlikely rituals. When a royal ball is held and all the eligible young women are invited (read: Want to get married to Prince Prince), Cinderella is taken to her house when her sister takes her gentle daughter along with her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The rough accessory letters of animals Mouse Jack and Gass are original sideclicks and their own generosity is the parent's cat Lucifer. Their antics usually intertwine with the main fairy-tale plot, and for the most part wonderful. Certainly, the film gradually moves slowly and slowly gradually, slowly and slowly, before the films are presented in the main character and for a slow ball. All the time, most likely) are most involved in Disney stories. <br /> <br /> The animation and art aspect is beautiful. This film and Arielle Blair's style of styling and concept art has managed to wiggle their way to the screen by having all the miracle nine Old Man (he has designed art and color styling for "Alice in Wonderland", "Peter Pan", "The Three Caballeros" and many others). The colors and designs are beautiful, especially in the Fair Goodmader and in the scene of the ball and in that beautiful little moment here and there. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Cinderella" is best recommended for Disney characters and young people, and dreams of Disney philosophy can be true.
