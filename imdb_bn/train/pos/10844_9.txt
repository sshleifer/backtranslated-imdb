This reminds me of the SPINAL TAP at a more serious level. It's a band's story doing reconciliation tour, but things are not synonymous between them. I was particularly impressed with Ray's performance with Bill Nigio. You felt sorry for her, yet there was a certain surprise about her. This is a great movie for you, if you've ever seen your favorite band skeleton, old and kind.
