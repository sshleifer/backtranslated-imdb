This story was not among my favorites in Christi's works, so I was delighted to enjoy this adaptation. If there was a small overdone, the mouse motif was effective, there were bones of the story, although the 'crime in the past' has been emphasized. The students were so beautiful, even though I imagined them, even though it was not uncommon for them, they were not more global groups - perhaps the revised thirty did not allow it! I thought some bold risks were taken by filming; Perhaps this is the reason I can not read the book again, but it seems quite obvious to me that the murderers have already shot their shots a bit earlier. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first Poirots. Sometimes it works but I received a lot of heavy transfer in this episode (though I was laughing at 'Lemon solely' throwing line). Overall though, the series is not the best one although a solid entry.
