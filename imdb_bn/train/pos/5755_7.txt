This is a fantastic kinky movie. It is seen as an exploitative film in a topical violence and illogical circumstances, but it is unusual to be built around rural characters in the war with each other, while the other 'aggressive' is aggressive. <br /> <br /> <br /> This film is a stereotype of Vietnam veterans, in a long line of films that portray combat vettors as dangerous psychopaths. The last line of Chris Christopher's 'I still have not lost the war', because he got involved with his death after being dragged along a long way of killing and destruction, especially in the city of Chiling scene with the main police and his brother's girlfriend. However, Kristofferson is a good enough actor, and enough artificial, to carry this villain with this wonderful depth. Vincent is definitely a golden boy, but with enough intensity layered on his clean-cut welfare. The film is similar to some plot in Winchester 73. Where Jimmy Stewart is forced to work against him, the criminal brother tried to endure. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> I give it a 7 for the long-lost view of Vietnam / pre-reagan surrender, the American mentality of paranoos. , And confusion, and a film industry that was willing to deal with such issues at that time. <br /> <br /> I saw on this channel, a great network that plays some of the oldest films in the '90s of the 90's, irrespective of political condemnation.
