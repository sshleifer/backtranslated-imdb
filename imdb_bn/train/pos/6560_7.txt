I think a lot of great visitors have completely missed that this scene is a parody of Western movies. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie - it's a cute tongue of cheeks in the west. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture has become more unique, it is about 4 powerful, beautiful women, two black, one Asian, and A Mexican / Hispanic character. <br /> <br /> This is not your normal western woman - they are tough - they can draw quickly and shoot straight away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will get you! "Only in this West, a female sister has been shot dead and she has come out to take revenge for the gang. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " But there are hidden in the city where gold and gold are hidden. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that are not understood at all, they are hawks They can not be ignored, but they are surprised why they were there, so the film can be used a bit harder, but in the end, it is a well-made movie that has failed to detect the audience that it has detected it. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbian movie is a fame - "heroine", one clearly straight, other sexuality is not released They are <br /> <br /> 7
