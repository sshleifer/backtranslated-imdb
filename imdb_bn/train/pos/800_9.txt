I can not be more thrilling; Just eight years ago in 1983, I was going to see a Star Wars movie in the theater! The best days of my life were going to happen. At the time, my only Star Wars experience was a few of HBO's Star Wars. I still have not seen the back of Empire Strike back <br /> <br /> And boy, that day provided for my less critical eyes. Jabba Big rebellious spaceship. Emporer. A green bladed light lamp! How nice! From that magical day, I have seen this movie hundreds of times. I could not even form a proper guess at this time. With this multiple view, I must see that this film - the original third, has errors. <br /> <br /> In relation to the movie of Star Wars, they prefer "Errors" more like "Quirks". <br /> <br /> There were millions of people in his witchcraft day in 1977 and 1980. I was in May 1983. And this was my star Wars movie.
