The stories and the characters I've ever seen are some of the best. Graphics were good for the PS and the cut scene and amazing over the voice. I lose the game at least 3 times and love it every second. I felt trustworthy and realistic problems facing the encounter hero and I believe it deserves a sequel. Or at least a rebuilding. If they recreate it for ps3, then I will only buy the system for that game, and it is enough for the mgs4 amazing and dragon system to be used for hire and on top of the innovative advertising, though sometimes the deception (fool busters) wand The system and the plot makes this game a certain buy.
