My best friend for the first time and I was sitting to watch this movie, we were watching this for Alex of the "Bill and Teddy" fame of Alex. <br /> <br /> As long as the movie was over, we knew that it was love at first sight. Although the film was not entirely historically accurate, it was its greatest genre. I have seen other films describing this famous summer history and in my opinion, nobody else can compare. It sticks a bit with some details, but those parts are not far from the beauty of the story and the romance. I have seen other films about this summer and I think most of them are good, but such a person can not congratulate. <br /> <br /> There is a painting quality in "Sleeping Summer". Colors and settings seem to be something that is available on canvas, framed and in the museum or on the wall of a zombie house. The clothes were beautiful and, despite not having the most comfortable clothes in the world, I would like to find Simstress for myself to create such a dress. The whole movie is set in Geneva on beautiful water (where I hope to see this movie one day) and these historical images were set on the peace found. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With all the exemplary punishment of England's rigorous execution, curiosity surrounding this adventure is also inconceivable. Yes, there was medicine. At that time it was a fairly common practice, a time when medication was not illegal. And the ludenum (opiate fluid size) was medicinal and recreational. Shelley suffers from cost. Lord Byron suffered a clubbed leg. There is nothing to be surprised about these prescriptions preserved by them during this summer. And they had experience in the experience of the poet during a time. There was no time for careful discretion. Emotions and experiences were a major part of the romantic era. And a legend has been created out of science, religion and philosophy thinking and discussion: "Frankenstein." <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie we saw the beautiful and free Goddown Godwin, at that time Shelley) played beautiful and talented Alice Crease. As far as he goes, he gives too much experience, until the control factor. But he stood his ground and felt things in his own terms. He had the power to inherit from his mother and father. <br /> <br /> These actors and actresses were perfect for the parts they played. Music fitting. The tip holds the essence of summer, as I read. This film was based on An Edwardes's extraordinary book "Hunted Summer". If you like this movie, read the book. The author receives the story from Mary Godwin Shelley's real journal and from other participants in this story, which he can combine. <br /> <br /> If you're a person who loves history (even a little flaw from time to time) and romance and Gothic, then it's a movie for you. It gives birth to the birth of a monster, which still teaches us about the morality of "God's Play". <br /> <br /> To see a certain film!
