I did not give this picture 10 because it is an amazing series, but its audience has the perfect ability to express emotion. The story of women-struggle-all-opposition of a woman is now an old clich√©, but very few few films carry it with so much warmth and sincerity as the colorful purple. It shows a different aspect of African-American experience - it has been shown that after giving the freedom of slaves many people had fallen in the way of 'white man' and insulted their own people. I find it an important point because it goes against white-black-violence-o-win-a-oscar trend. <br /> <br /> It's also fantastic performance - especially Oprah who I now have a new honor. <br /> <br /> to see good value - but keep some tissues easy.
