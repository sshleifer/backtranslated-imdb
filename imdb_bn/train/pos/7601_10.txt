A kind of losing ... It's so appealing and mysterious, thrilling, and full of the same. I have never seen any similar TV series. It is full of jungle thrill and has a good play. Actors have lived on an island in such a natural way that I lost myself on the island. This is a wonderful piece of work described in a very smart form. This series is a survival of an island surviving on an island like an image. I saw an episode after another and I highly recommend this series for TV show lovers. Watch it for some lost magic.
