I recently bought a very intrinsic dreamcat and went to town town to find some games to use them. I bought Soul Calibur (a classic) and then I went to the domain of the Resident Evil Code Veronica. My family has Evil 1 and 2 and Race Evil has done many shows and I have influenced them all, especially the number 1, which has gone down in history. This is a classic. <br /> <br /> Some of them do not come close to 32 summer summer Gry Gameplay's dreaming efforts. It's only worth your time and effort every moment to buy a dream for this game, it was not so fond of any computer game that it fascinated me. Anyone whose Redfield carries the story from the second story of finding his brother (from Chris - the first story), who is not absent in the absence of a conspiracy of a terrible shadow corporation. Although you know little about this corporation, you have destroyed them in previous stories 3 times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > Position your brother. The second CD enables you to control Chris, which if you manage to manage until now without a room outside the room. <br /> <br /> The controls are very shiny and movement of characters is pragmatic, when the character is in danger, facing the direction from which he is coming. Pure junkies !! <br /> <br /> Overall, I've given this game 10/10 because it's just a game of the year, game of the decade and the best game in the world! Please buy this game as soon as possible.
