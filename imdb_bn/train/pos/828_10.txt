I noticed that the top 10 behind a new hope and empire, but this is not even the top 100. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> - Jabber Han Solo recovered: this The officer wins the debt sub-plot of Han Solo when we first completed the character in a new Happy <br /> <br /> - The emperor finally expressed: Okay, this work will not work yet, the estimation has ended, but for the first time we saw the emperor's kids. <br /> <br /> - Spider Bike Chase: OK, so it was a special effect moment. But it was certainly one of the most memorable and exciting moments in the movie! <br /> <br /> - 3 parts Climax: 1) Endor fighting (under the leadership of Han and Liar) 2) Luke with his father and the emperor's fall 3) The second death star destroyed (the moment of Lando) <br /> <br / > - Final celebration with our heroes: As I said, this film is tremendous due to Echo, but I think it is quite cool that during the celebration of the collapse of the entire Galaxy Empire, our heroes are jungle with each other Have their own private party. <br /> <br /> All of these were a great final chapter for our heroes and the story of Star Wars is a worthy ending.
