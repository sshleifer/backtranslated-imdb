Peter Strauss and Pamela Reid have a cruel disappointing script and some subtle low-key performance and some good location shooting in Ohio. This great TV movie gives strength to the tough time of the road belt. The mills were closed and the union jobs disappeared, everyone in blue-collar workers is in danger: management, owner, their wife and children. Strauss is completely credible in his role, and Pamela Reed, as always, is wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before losing weight. <br /> <br /> Heavy metal scores - someone is being punished? - Occasionally, annoying boring, but counterfeit cinematography by Frank Stanley, especially in Milan scenes.
