Actually not really This movie is very entertaining though. Last night I saw it with Girlfriend and saw "I think there is something in my eyes" routine to use. A great combination of movie comedy and generally romance. Jim Carey looks down on his fortune reporter, who has given himself the ability to live and live in the city. In fact all the characters are great. The movie is not too funny or unfortunate, it is good to see a wife. <br /> <br /> All 8/10 ... Note * I'm not an easy grade. Everything from Big B over!
