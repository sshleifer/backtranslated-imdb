After reading reviews for this movie, I realized that it started with a great suspicion in my mind that it would be really good. However, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Most reviews that I have read, have said that it is very difficult to follow complex plots. And when some parts confuse you, many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you missed so much. It's not like "lock, stock ..." or "snatch", it's not funny (actually it's pretty dark) and it's even more intelligent, the way you look at the scenes of different perspectives (and, one of the best scenes in the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in the lift, disputes with himself). What I have just decided is similar to the two films, which coincided with the memorable characters, especially Statham, who gave excellent performance as leadership and Ray Leota, who spent most of Spidos's films, but did not give a great performance. If you have the time, and then have time to think about the film and even see it again, but start to see all the symbols and hints that you have actually given through the film. I think it's fantastic, and that Guy Ritchie is a director at the top of his game.
