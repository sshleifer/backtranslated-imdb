A good film, and one I will look at many times. Rich (Previous Commenter) Correct: There is a lot more going on than being clear from the title boards, and I am surprised that the translation has been so difficult. Was there more? Or wanted to read lips of a native-language audience? Or - the script was written by the author of this novel, based on which it was - a popular story that was already known to the audience? In a nutshell, a look is very valuable, but in reality, more work is needed than contemporary visitors than the actual visitors of 1913. <br /> <br /> The publication of alpha video highlights a new score but the music does not match the story progress in any way. Certainly, it starts with commitment, but falls in a repetitive, Philipp-glass-like monotone, which does not reflect any action on the screen. After listening for a while, I closed the word and looked simply: very good!
