"Midnight Cowboy" was not a great movie to start but it's a classic. You know it's a classic moment, its first theme song, 'Avarvidis Talking' soundtrack starts (actually not for movies), and the camera introduces us to Joe Bauce (Nude and Shower). We saw John Voight before but did not really notice him, but when he tells us that he is a 'Halloween stud', who is he to doubt? This is an extraordinary performance which has full sense of character as well as icon star status, and if the voice does nothing else, its performance will be mythological here. Voight is rarely frustrating on the screen; Even this glorious garbage "Anakonda" is a ham cured of its performance as well) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a The crowd-pleaser was, (even with its downbeat end), funny and sexy and recognized 'real'; (It was the tail end of the sixties and all the characters were true). It was also the first 'X' rated film to win Oscar as the year's best picture. Adapted by James Leo Harleyvie from Waldo Salt, (brightly), it was perhaps the first major stream commercial American film to deal with 'forbidden' issues in terms of homosexuality and drug abuse.

But when he shook himself, then 'Ratso' Rizzo, a little voice (fresh from Dustin Hoffman, "The Graduate" and a revelation), he realizes that the reality is probably different from the pipe. - Primal <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both are completely alone, both of them are poor, and they are the guardians of others, (with his physical skills, Voight, Hawman is intelligent, intelligent on his street). They are misfits from the mainstream, tolerance of their own specialty and others' deviance. Although 'direct' is not much more than a homework in a 42nd street movie, but a lonely boy. (The whole picture is like a wonderful 'Christian' attitude). <br /> <br /> It also played nicely. Viet and Hoffman hold the screen everywhere Brenda Vacakero and Silvia Miles and John McGivevar, Bob Bailban and Bernard Hughes's fantastic customers, and fantastic vignettes, such as hangers-on, are nicely illustrated in the characterization of cross-acting. Above all, the film is a documentary as well as a documentary by Americans on the orders of John Schlesinger Under-pale all Kikabhabe different views and criticism without feeling that movie. Second thought, perhaps it's a great movie after all.
