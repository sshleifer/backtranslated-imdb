I'll revisit this picture to everyone. Not only fans of Luciano Ligabue fans, but all to film-buffs. Because it is sincere, moving, funny and true. Because Ligabu is a born storyteller and a film lover, and every frame of his film is made with love and care. Because its characters are asked to be loved and loved. Because most of the Italian movies are frustrating and this is done by someone outside, real pleasure to watch and listen to it. Because Stefano Accio is fantastic and reminds me Andrea Pazienna, Frankia, beautiful and gifted and good, and lost her life due to heroin, because Leibbuti is helpless and ugly, as does not seem to be involved in simple morals. Because it is a movie that talks to our hearts, our ears, our souls. And I've had experience of FM radio and it was the same. Thanks, Luciano!
