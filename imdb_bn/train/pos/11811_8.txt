Dick Tracy was originally a comic book made in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is an ordinary clothing detective who tracks the volume crew, which includes all kinds of visual characters, such as Flatp to the Blank to Big Boy Caprice. (These revolutions became so popular among 40 that Warner Bros. made Duffy Duck's Tracey-style villains their own self), Tracy's comics were known for their songplay and their anatomical technology advancement. Especially the wristwatchman), which got their fair share during the screening of this excellent movie. The song was amazingly done by Danny Elfman, and Madonna's original songs were interesting, but they did not have the ambition of her career. This is strange because you see the movie and see the suspicious moments, the film feels like a Batman, because the words of Elfman's memories for his pieces. <br /> <br /> I like to talk hard, Passrinos played Big Boy Caprice (and that cool!), take Madonna's villainy, and cinematography and guidance were faulty. This film was very professionally produced and was known for some time as a famous actor (Warren BT, Al Pasino, William Forcieth, Dustin Hoffman, Cathy Betts, Mandy Patinin, Catherine Oahara, Dick Van Dyke). The film itself was directed by director Betey, which was interesting. Beaty looks at it as a tracy in the past life, or for some reason it fixes that part. <br /> <br /> I have to give this picture 8/10 which is brought to the movie which is ignored (for whatever reason). There is a lot of misunderstanding about the rating of this film in IMDB, and I still do not understand why. Characters were completely original and vibrant, such as sets, dresses, lights and everything in this movie. Go buy it today. You will not be sorry.
