A road movie of old fashion trains in Slovenian summer summer provinces. At the beginning you saw someone in a black cloth underwear sewing trouser and when the same young man left his house with two suitcases, you see that the trousers-parts are not missing on the mourning flag. (Probably his father had died). In the train, he met a young girl and almost words, but many small gestures, a wonderful love story started. It's a weird, very poetic and slightly diverse film with strange characters and strange phenomena. Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.
