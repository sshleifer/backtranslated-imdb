When I first got my N64 at the age of five or six, I fell in love with it and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I like it! The graphics were time, a good plot, great course and all of the above, I heard a Nintendo game the best music. <br /> <br /> I do not think the plot is full, but it seems that the princess has abducted Pitch Bosser, and Mario has to rescue him. The game can get 120 stars from prison curse. They can accept five or six rounds of stars each. There are parts of the castles to protect, where you can get more stars. But of course, you hit Bowser. * I think Bussar has three levels to defeat * Let's start with the letter. Mario is the main character, and Todd gets helpful advice, so he is basically one of your only allies. I have heard that Luigi and Joshi are in the game at the end. Bennser's main villain and a bunch of other characters like Boo and Guombe. The letters are really cool. <br /> <br /> Next, how the graphics? People say the gameplay is more important than graphics, and I totally agree. But he made great graphics with great platforms. Especially its time. I have more other nintendo games such as 007 and do not have graphics that compare Super Mario. Right colors, great effect and extraordinary sound effects I found very good graphics in water courses. Bowser World, it has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now, music. This is my favorite game. When I played it in my childhood, I gladly left the game all night so that the music allowed me to sleep. In particular, Jolie Roger Bay, which was peaceful and wonderful, from the music. Others are very good, especially, again, with Bosaser, the world, who is with me the most and my favorite. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer, and I like it. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) Play the game!
