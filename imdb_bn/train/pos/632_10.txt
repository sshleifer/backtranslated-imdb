Ok here how do i do it I grade material on 10 elements. Each element naturally starts with 5 points. Then it can gain 5 points for losing or potential 10 or 0. Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this element 10 points. It was a perfect balance of five directions. The action was fun and exiting. Romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. I was strict and long sunny throughout the movie and still I was captivated by the fantastic drama, and riveting suspense <br /> <br /> Plot - I give this element 10 points. I have already told all the good fairy tales. I sat back to my husband in the theater and returned to my husband, I came back to my childhood, and at that moment I once again believed in a single, misinformed, and falling dream that the dream was the truth. <br /> <br /> Movie Photography - I give this element 8 points. The film held the story very well at most corners, but I tried to identify what was happening outside my camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give this element 10 points. I love that they are CGI Using Broadly The epic scene was credible. Magical power was terrible realistic. All in all, and this was all! Cast - I give this element 10 points. No name and season actor likewise, the cast was wonderful! Michelle Pfeiffer was surprisingly mischievous, when Charlie Cox came to life in Cincinnati, Clair gave the star of Dennis Starr, and I would see again and Robert De Niro same again. <br /> <br /> Acting - I give this element 10 points. Even new actors have played their roll of perfection. Again, again and again Robert De Niro will not look the same. <br /> <br /> Character Development - I'm giving this part 9 points. It takes a little bit and thinks that if the movie is a little higher then they could have a better character. <br /> <br /> Dialog - I give this element 10 points. Conversation was smart, malicious, fun ?? Even Mush was good conversation. <br /> <br /> Score - I give this point 7 points. I can truly remember a small piece of music from the movie. I am not complaining about this music being more memorable. <br /> <br /> I'm finished - I give this element 9 points. Almost perfect finish! I think the last aspect should have been more pronounced, others were more redundant, but there was no thread left. Total: 93% Buy DVDs? Yes yes See it in the theater? Most definitely! Bottom Line: Nice movie for everyone! EPIC! I strongly recommend to see it in the theater, I know I'm going back for seconds!
