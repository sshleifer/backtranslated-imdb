What did the Rock-n-Roll Star wash in the late 1990's? They launch a return / reunion tour. At least, Strange Frut's members, there is a (fictional) 70 stadium rock group. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stefan Ray) condom vending machine allows him to go to the son of the promotor, a famous music festival. In the 70's, that festival was a strange result. 70's "retro" and the wide right of the wave in time. He stopped searching the band's other members. <br /> <br /> Keith was the part of the band's breakdown, the death and replacement of the lead singer and the brilliant song writer. The band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back in the working class to come back. Driven by a Timothy Spall (who was brilliant in the Secrets and Lease), a seam, a roof of the lightning player, and their main singer is still a rock. Although he owns a huge palace, he is forced to sell it, although his fate does not last. Brian, lead guitarist, is dead, so he is hired to replace a young guitarist. <br /> <br /> Some unintentionally the band agrees to try to reconnect. To abandon their job vacancies, they begin to re-read and their directors come forward to their label to resume their album. But he wants to start their first journey again. And so they hit the club circuit across Europe. Club scenes are not kind to this overweight, date, old rockers. <br /> <br /> This is a tour that really begins to develop. Old conflicts all along, with figures moving across Keith and Brian. They all are hanging together because they all had the glory that they had received before them for a second chance. And they have discovered some of the interpersonal chemistry that have been able to play together together. <br /> <br /> Crazy still starts again as the musical tap II, but gradually becomes more dramatically focused film, after band relationships. Although it's still a very funny movie, it is struggling to deal with the growing characters, Brian and Keith's death, and with their personal giant, which works in the film.
