Tenantino once commented on a melodrama named Bellevot in the 1930's that "tragedy is like another character". The same can be said- and as a result of encouraging Tarantino for the best works of the year of Sarin Lumet, the character is not the only concern because of a melodrama being involved in the character. Kelly Masterson is not a great piece of script here (it breaks crazy killer mode at the end of a series of climactic events that usually work towards the end, and even the suspension suspension is the maximum), but her script reveals the character before the plot, and a story where the tasks are hidden behind a Surrounded by surroundings, they wanted to know that these people were shaking with a beat You know the. It is as silly as hell, apologizing to the devil, but only 90% of time wasted. <br /> <br /> Day before the character's character, and most of the time, the 'Mother-and-Pop' Jewelry Store Post robbery, but due to the casting cast cast (which I can add, Lumet's specialty). Philip Simmur Hoffman and Ethan Huq have their own financial F *** ups with the brothers, and former people come forward to look like fool proof: loot their own mother and father's jewelry store in Westchester. Huq is related to another shadowed character, though murders happen, and suddenly it affects the virus and his father on a Greek scale, which is played by the perfect Albert Finney. This is the kind of material that most actors love - those who like dog day afternoon are painful, bone flaws, but just want to fix love and / or things and they are completely incompetent to meet their needs and <br/> <br /> In this case Hoffman and Huq have been nicely combined; Huffman's last ten minutes, a very quiet and sometimes fun habit that reveals him as the brain of the operation, but then he suddenly shocked the small scenes where he broke up emotionally (i.e. with a car or a scene with a trumpet). Limit talent; Meanwhile, Haq is said to be damaged by his ex-wife and daughter, can not pay any debt and is called a child by his father and meets the part in which he participates - he has not lost like his elder brother, But do you want to select which stra for the title? And as the Finney mentioned, spot-spots are everywhere, big fishes seem to be playing their child's play (the final scenes with them are terribly tragic, their face rebuilt in a horrific created through the second half.) <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A brief, accurate impression, this is a great movie and a movie with a heart - but if Not a meditative heart - a story that does not show a double detail with the description, so that the absorbed plots can clean up all the steps of the family's permanent downward spiral for the device. If it is not leakage as a sepico or network or Practicor or 12 agrid man, then it comes from anything from lumet.
