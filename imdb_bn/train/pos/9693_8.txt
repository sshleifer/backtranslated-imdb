I was very surprised with this picture. Polly rushed out to find her little girl and to find her little girl. Humor was very good and it did not hurt the story, because I think it will probably be. Actually I hope "Pillie wants a cracker," but it was also a humorous scene that hit the film's research lab press conference. So if you want to see that a good "animal that speaks" film checks it out, my opinion is Dr. Better than Dolittle. PAULIE also has a wonderful twist at the end that is also done very nicely.
