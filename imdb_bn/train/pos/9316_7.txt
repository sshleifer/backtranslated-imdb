Walter Piszon is a civil attorney who is a civil attorney who filed a criminal case in "The Unknown Man"; In 1951, Anne Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keff Brassell and Richard Anderson acted. A great believer in justice, Pizadon took a defense case against the murder of a young man named Ruby Wallach√©que (Brazil) and called him innocent. Shortly after, he realized that the man was guilty and collected money from his shopkeepers as well as other shopkeepers nearby. He suggested by DA (Sullivan) that Rudy's small changes, so that the organized crime could be eradicated, he should find the top man. Mason has found the top man and faces a conflict. <br /> <br /> "The Avenger Man" is a small, black and white film that captures the audience's interest in plots with a plot twist, though the plot is somewhat narrow. This is really the story of finding a good man who is willing to do his God, justice and to achieve it. And that's the most additive part. I think there was some time before O.J., Menendez Brothers, etc., when people believed in the integrity of justice and attorneys. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Pizadan has had a tremendous career spanning 60 years, but never got into superstardom. He is a tough actor who can play just about anything and. It may be that, at the time he received the lead, he was good in thirty years and failed to become a mother tongue; Or it may lack that specific thing; Or, as a big star, Garrar Gerson, he first typed in the second. It is difficult to say. He gives an honest and sensitive performance here. <br /> <br /> Very well movie with good acting.
