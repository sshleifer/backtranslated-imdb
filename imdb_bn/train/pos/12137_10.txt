How amazing this movie is! I've seen over throughout the year and I'm always spelled by it. Why is it so easy to look after the film again, is the performance of the arrest of young Bate Davis. He only stole every scene in his home studio, Warner Bros. (in this film), in more movies than in any film, made by RKO radio photo). She is wearing a very impressive make-up and very interesting hairstyle and the lovely eyes of those who look beautiful (especially, restaurants in London, Soho restaurant shows). His body was very curved when he was a young man. To wear her big explosive collision with Leslie Howard, she wore a load of her cheap niggling. And oh boy, he's an absolute power in the scene. Howard is a little more annoying, but he has taken the sensitivity of the hero. Frances D Score is a sweet, beautiful young Sally who really loves him. The highest stenner score is both impressive and disgusting. Excellent performances and thirties will see this classic novel version of smell.
