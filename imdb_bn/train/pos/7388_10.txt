The 74th Oscar was very good. Huawe's work as EmCee was very funny, and lightweight. I personally love her last love, which has received some intensive reviews due to incompatible language and comforting jokes, but it's right. The audience liked it. Hell Berry, Dingle Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen, and Sydney Potier made the Oscar broadcast to remember. <br /> <br />
