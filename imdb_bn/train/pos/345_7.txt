The first hour or so of the movie was mostly annoying to say. It is also developed after the start of the Valentine party. Finally, as well as the introduction of the murderer's identity, the hot bath kills scene is one of the relatively memorable aspects of this film. The scene was very good in the garden with Kate and so the last scene was 'Twist'. In those scenes, there were some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath was on the edge of the scene a nasty (should be a slash). The previous murders depreciated Gore's disappointment.
