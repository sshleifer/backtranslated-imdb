It's the incredible return from film director Masterman, Sui Harke. This is one of Steven Chau's few films facing Shawlin Soccer. At the moment of the film's opening, there were amazing backdrops on each side, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> equipped with superb style. If you are a science fiction or a "gaiq" of Chinese martial arts, you love to have too many 3D effects and excessive amounts of realistic computer-generated weapons. There, playing "Sky King", who comes in a nice performance (as always) from Eckon Cheng. He teamed with Luis Ku (Red), I was very surprised by his flexible "wing", which reflected the coming attack. These actors were efficient in every way towards the movement of war. Not only is the action fantastic but there is a somewhat complicated story. Many critics of this film have complained about the lack of stories / themes or simply "moved to the random bits of the Pallabi" and even described it as "The Legend of Pool". However, viewers can not rely on watching Dragon Ballge and other similar manga cartoons to understand the film. Others who are imperialists with the movie "Wu Zia" will have better expression. Due respect May be foreseen that there may be a weakness. The war that the enemy has reached in the last fight can be made more and more destructively. Despite all this, it must be seen.
