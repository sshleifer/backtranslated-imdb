There are not many movies around, which make me feel like Stardust, and the film is full time. Similar to the magical fairy-tale like Princess Bride, Stardust is one of the most wonderful scenes in the 1990s as well as in the 1990s. Equipped with breathtaking, ridiculous and wonderful imagery and unforgettable characters, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Denarrow, especially I challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film, you know perfectly well how it will end, but this is not the journey and the destination that encourages visitors to start from the end. <br /> <br /> Ten star and not less than decimal.
