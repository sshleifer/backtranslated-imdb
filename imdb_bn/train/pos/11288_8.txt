By almost all critics Johnny Wesmuller Tarzan films are considered to be the best, I have no reason to argue with them, although some think that I am just recreational. One thing: I saw the longest 105 minutes in the series. I only saw six of them, but for the long time I've used it and by the end of the drone-out operation I think the whole thing was a bit more. <br /> <br /> It's a good mix of action, mystery and romance. The only thing missing is the color and stereo word. Primitive special effects do not disturb me, as they came back in the 1930's. <br /> <br /> In some of these, this image is one of the most famous for the thing: the skin! After this movie, "Jane" did not wear this dress anymore because later the hess code was introduced when the movie was made Tarzan. His outfit showed what a great character Maureen O'Sullivan possessed. The naked water scene, though, did not have it - by a long shot. Under the water, she was not a good figure, anyone who had it. <br /> <br /> There are lots of steps here. In the end, it was not overdone, it is not. Finally went for 15 minutes, and was so much intense that it was almost too much to visit. However, this movie offers everything - except for "son" (their adopted son) - if you want to see a Tarzan movie, even Sullivan and her Tarzan hold down almost twice and often. Her pair of "lungs", there was no problem.
