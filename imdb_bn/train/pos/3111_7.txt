She now has a name, an identity, some memories and a lost girlfriend. He wanted all that was invisible, but still, they identified him and he rarely destroyed the world created. Now he wants to explain something, and the journey of the people how he made him. Yes, Jason Bourne is back, and this time, he is here with revenge. <br /> <br /> This film does not have the world's largest scripts, but its themes are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course, like every Hollywood movie from the end of the 90's, "The Bourne Supermatiti" is a super-hero story. Jason Bourne is a Captain-America project-like, who has gone completely wrong. In the first film, the hero invented his skills and he took them to the second. He now battles against what is considered evil, a person close to him (his lover, "Supreme") was killed. This is also a part of the superhero story, with which there is a character (realistic but still impressive: he is almost unknown) Super Powers <br /> <br /> Interesting thing is that he fought all the evils around the world. (The sister's film has no boundaries, the characters are moving from one continent to another), in the best season of "24", the American enemy, who believes that he fights for the good, his country is completely blind to him. Funny, how "crazy patriots" are now enemies of N1.1 fake Hollywood stories <br /> <br /> In addition to all these interesting theaters, the film is not helpless: the character of Nici Persson's women is now completely in vogue and the direction is quite unreasonable. But that's not really important, "The Bourne Ultimate" is an action movie. And action scenes are rather impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone is talking about "Waterloo scene" and "Tangar pursuit" and everyone's rights here. I especially enjoyed the war of tanners, which reminded me of the greatness and sublimeness of extremeness. Apparently innovative scenes, part of a lot of intelligent action and a good reflection on American contemporary thematicism: "Bourne Ultimate" is definitely the best film in the series and a very interesting and original action flick.
