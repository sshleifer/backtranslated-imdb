(spoilers ??) <br /> <br /> I'm sure what was thinking about the movie. A child's film is not too much. Must be seen with a parent definitely because it includes death and dying. But I was surprised that I was a little modest. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed during 81 minutes. (Even without credit) and the trailer that lets you think that gems are a major animal. But alas, they tortured him. The movie is right till the end. Those two firmness movie 2 star Doc But I do not recommend movies. Even for a signal. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Repeatable: 7/10
