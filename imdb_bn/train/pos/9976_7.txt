Sure, it was greasy and non-corny and occasionally corny, but at least the filmmakers did not try. Though most television movies are limited to the medieval edge, this film actually has some release points for it. Cinematography was good for a TV movie, and Viggo Martensen showed the shadow of Aragona in a film about a person acting by her own rules. Most of the flashback sequences were chassis, but the view of the mountain lion was intense. Jason Prisley's role in the film was disturbed as a rebel shock-joke, but then again, it's a TV movie! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was violent. However, Tucson was very nice to look at, Arizona Mainly featured in the film.
