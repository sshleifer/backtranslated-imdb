In the late 1800s, San Francisco, poorly groomed Eurel Flin (James J. Corpette) worked in a bank and participated in local "fights" (boxing), including co-worker and alcoholic Jack Carson (as Walter Lori). One day, the fantastic Alexis Smith (as Victoria Waier) went to "Comstock Bank", where Flin works. Flynn is taken with the smiling beauty of Miss Smith, he carries the purse of his withdrawal. Smith is secretly involved with Flin, but he is away from his intensity. <br /> <br /> The good work of Flint (in fact, pick-up attempts) has received a complimentary membership called "Olympic Club", which conveniently has a gymnasium (with boxing equipment). However, Flanny's arrogant system, and real fun (she tikka men in parallel bars) irritates members of "club". When English boxing entered the Champ Club, members tried to fight him with Flint. They are hopeful that Phillin will resign, humiliated by his defeat - but, Flin won! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> Mr Baker certainly saw the studio's bright "Yankee Doodle Dandy" looking at the success of his play. Unfortunately, this story is funny ridiculous. There was a "Gentleman Jim" - this story is probably James J. Filming of Carberry's autobiography "The Roar of the View" - however, this film should be notably fabulous. <br /> <br /> Flin is a very attractive leading man; He used the script lightly, and was recognized as an extraordinary actor in the early 1940's. Flin's characteristic features were quite contrary to many (e.g.?) Extraordinary performance, and it was one of them. Smith transmits her passion for the audience, as well as her feminine interest. Director Walsh makes smooth and extravagant appearance of silliness. The supporter cast is from a billionaire troupe, Lan McClister ("Mr. Carbot Paging"), walking from Alan Hell (Pat Corp). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Wallace ~ Irhol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
