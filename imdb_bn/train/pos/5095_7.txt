King of Solomon's mine brought us Patrick Swayze (playing Alan Quotermen), who spent a lot of time in Africa, but decided to return to England and be the father of his son. He saw that his wife's parents took custody of his son and had little chance of getting him in custody with a lot of money for the lawsuit. Alison Daddy (playing Elizabeth), whose father is in Africa, and Elizabeth's father sent him on the map due to African descent for release. Elizabeth wanted to find Quotamen to return to Africa in search of her father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The movie ends up keeping an eye on you. Patrick is again a daring handsome man who comes to rescue the daughter of trouble. Patrick is an extraordinary dramatic actor who can easily illustrate emotions, losses and frustration, helpless silent good people, anger and power; The heart of King Solomon's heart actually smiles a few times. I again want to see Patrick Soze a discouraged live-loving story, in which he will not have to tear his jaw and be very strong. Maybe a little dance will help But it's a good movie for the whole family and watching it.
