This is an extraordinary movie, which constantly tricks you. It seems to be heading towards the cliche on several points, and then something pretty happens that really startsles. It will be far away to say a lot more, but stay with this movie and you will be rewarded. William Henes is absolutely delightful - he must be a star worthy to be discovered again. The gay comedy of his relationship with Jack Piccord is amazing - there is also a scene where Henes walks on the chest of Piccord (Picforard remains cold). Both actors play this sub-less with subtle and emotional depth, so the moments are very running. And I never thought that I could have been so involved in football in this movie - and I do not even understand the rules! Also Francis X Bushman's son, Ralph, has been called Henes' rival to the girl (yes, this is not entirely a gay movie). Wonderful silent classic - Twenties with a edge are a great example of commercial movies.
