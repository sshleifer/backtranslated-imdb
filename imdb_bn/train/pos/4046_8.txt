While in France on top of the Revolution of France, an English woman came back to her historical drama in Rome in the real story of Grace Elliott. One always doubted that Row had a conservative, but who knew that he was a red bloody reactionary. If you can combine the unstable defenses of Romar's monarchy (and it's not easy, for example, French lower-class images are pictured here as hidden louts), it's actually an elegant, intelligent and polished film. The lack of money for a major 18th-century filmmaking entertainer, instead of Roeh, the actors play against the clearly illustrated cardboards. It is a blatantly artificial pride, but it works in some way. And the new coach Lucy Russell has not been able to create a character that is sympathetic.
