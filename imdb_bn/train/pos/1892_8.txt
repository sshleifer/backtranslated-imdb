Doodle Moore's role in laughing many times in the TV watching Arthur, a happy fate like Arthur was strange to drunken drunk, but John Gilgood was equally funny as his servant / father Hobson. I bought the DVD a couple of weeks ago and saw it, even after nearly 27 years had passed, it was enjoyable because it was Lisa Minerali's role, since the love interest was impressive, chemistry was both magic. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a drunken millionaire who has a bar like a national debt, which is growing up and does not have the desire to act like a child. His activities were supervised by the dry English Butler Hobson (Gilgood). It seems that none other than Arthur does not think about it, Arthur's father (repeatedly) Ultimatam offered that if he would cut off his son's heir of $ 750 million in weeks of horrible blonde socialite Susan Johnson (Ikennery). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marriage. When Hobson dies, Arthur finally grows up and closes Susan before the wedding, leaving him both money and his true love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
