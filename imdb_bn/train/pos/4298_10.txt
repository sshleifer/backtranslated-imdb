This movie makes me so scared that I see it at least once a year. At the time I find it uncomfortable. Occasionally I find it empowering. And I always find people and real characters. This is a movie that shows you the great reality of life in LA, which starts with scans of repetitive helicopter search lights for the dangers hidden by ordinary life-bearing risks. This is a film that shows you how a newborn's kindness can change your life and enables you to make a difference. The Grand Canyon reminds you that there are strong reactions to the actions you take, whether they are intended or not. I found Robert Altman's film Short Cuts very similar to this movie in many ways. Both were full star cast and actresses having a star-steaddated raster and both films allowed you to slowly influence how the characters relate to each other and affect each other, good or bad. Grand Canyon did a good job of delivering a message (hopefully optimistic in hopelessness) than Altonan's film, although I have shown both of them a debate on their own way. This picture must certainly see !!!
