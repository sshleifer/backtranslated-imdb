Wang Bianlian is an old street actor who is known as 'King of Mask' for Sichuan Changes in the art of changing art. Liang respects Wang as the famous opera actor of Sichuan industry and as an artist and as a person. Liang does not have to die with a valuable art wang and that is why he sows heed seeds in Wang's mind. The film is about prejudice, male dominance, art, values ​​and most importantly the warmth. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this picture enough. The whole picture is loops. Everything has an significance This is a long story that is so well edited that the length of the film is only 91 minutes. Total satisfaction It's an artistic film for five minutes, a tragedy for the next five minutes, a thriller for the next five minutes. It just keeps changing its mood to change its mood changes. The last scene of the rope is phenomenal. Stories and scripts are flawless. The actor is bright. Both title artists can tell you the way they are performed. Very impressive It was not even nominated for the Oscars. That year, 'English Patient' was bestowed by Oscar and won the foreign film category 'Koyala'. The 'koala' was right and said little about 'English patients'. See it at 9/10.
