I released the DVD when I came to the market and bought it. And I think my money was exactly the same as I expected before buying. What else can I say for Will Smith, an extraordinary film, he was always a terrible actor whether in acting or serious? Always give her a record breaking performance. I think this movie after this August Rush, which gives a cry to someone while watching it. The way the director described the story was really awesome. His previous life and the new life of the film were correctly described to the audience. Even I did not find any fault in the story or the way they shoot it. I think its DVD will be a family because it will be a really nice thing for your collection. It is not a movie that requires pop-ups for enjoyment, this movie lets viewers learn a lesson. Now you can see what you see while viewing the lesson. And I suggest the film critics, if there is any criticism about this movie then please talk to me.
