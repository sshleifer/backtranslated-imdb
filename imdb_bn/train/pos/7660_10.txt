This movie is nothing short of a dark, Pallet Masterpiece. I can be favorable, like the racist era is an area that I've always felt. But I say it is standing on the shoulders of Cree Freedom and right-wing. Unfortunately for a few days till now I have never heard of this movie. One of the most undressed films all the time inside, maybe it was a small film company, even before I even heard it about it. However, one of my favorite actors, Eric Stoltz is credible and dramatic, Nigel Hathorn plays a great role. Do not look for humor in this movie, there is no one. It's genuinely brutal and endless, ironic, and sensitive, I'd like to bring a box of tissues. But as great as these, the more surprising it is, why are not the greatest movies ever heard?
