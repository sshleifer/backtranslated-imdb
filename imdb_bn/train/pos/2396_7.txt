This is a very entertaining movie that follows the rehearsal process of Macbeth's New York production. Although there is much to say about the power, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth's theme) in our modern world, the film does its best, but without taking it very seriously. Recognized actors such as John Glover, Gloria Rubbs and David Lansbury, do a great job in the main roles, but the highlight for me is the Halloween scenes where the "murder" of Benco (John Elsen) is repeated. Perhaps more entertaining movies for those involved in the theater, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare will enjoy this movie.
