So we compromise. It was a fairly charming movie, I liked the industry side (it was felt more "real" than most children's movies), and the dress was not very intense. Child actors were not bad to see (fat acting towards veterans). They saw how a stupid kid stood in front of others as well as rape for the kids. <br /> <br /> I do not know how big it is that they want to see it for themselves, but it's a great film to take a baby. And since "Bernard" apparently appeared at the same time with 100+ kids, I'm really glad we showed little presence of "worm" instead.
