This is a fantastic Swedish film. It was the first of the Swedish film I saw. It is simple and deep .. What a great combination! <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist has a great performance as a famous <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Michael lost his battle with Michael and secured Michael's good reason, his own dancer helped find his peace of music. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I did not like was the end .. It was not good but it has some deep meaning.
