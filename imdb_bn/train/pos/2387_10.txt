I have a six-month-old child in my house and at that time sleeping really bad. One morning while sleeping in the morning, he was having a particularly difficult time when Doodle came to the theme of Thap Theme. He often stopped crying and the subject of the rest of the show was. I was sitting in his bouncy seat and kicked his leg, grabbed his arms, and actually smiled at the show. Keep her full-time entertained and happy. I got a video of them so that sometimes my little sister could calm me down slowly. Please, if he is walking late with me in the night, Doodle Bop is not his cup of tea, but definitely comes in handy when I will take some time to work at home etc. The most surprising about the doodle box is that my child does not like watching TV. Instead of playing with toys or watching TV, our small toy will be in the playground with Puddle, still the doodle bobs draw his attention. I do not know whether I can choose them in the future, but now he's connected.
