This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It has played very well by both the Hanks, Newman and others. Of course Jude Law's best performance. Cinematography is excellent, editing is good as well, and a great original score that really fits with movie mood. The production design also makes this movie a special factor. To me, it takes much to defeat Godfather, but surprising cinematography shows in this competition. Of course, my book is nominated for the best picture.
