Fay Grim ten years ago began to start a story with Hartley's Henry Flower. I did not see the previous movie and it is a good thing or I do not know. <br /> <br /> For most people, the style of making Halley's film is something you love or not. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry, satirical humor really resonates with me, and no exception to the Grape Grim. It has an air of cute parody of loudly writing that fast-paced myself in the audience of Melbourne International Film Festival and there was a lot of that. It was relentless for the first half of the film and was distributed with DeadPen Swatzaat. It is sad that one style of depression is welcome for the lack of cinema and the psychological teen trick that pumps out like a Hollywood pancake. <br /> <br /> During the second half of the film, comedians started to become thin as a metaphor of an international spy / conspiracy theater. It is not clear whether Hartley's purpose was whether he came out of the idea or not, but I think the film's main momentum will be retained for some fifteen minutes of editing or re-writing. <br /> <br /> Performance was generally good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, which was mostly screen time. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Karl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn all play the role of good support. The film's scenes were beautiful (New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also by Hartley) was better without penetration. The film is well written and I enjoyed it very much. If you like Hartley's previous work, you probably like it.
