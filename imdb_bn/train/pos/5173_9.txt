Very rarely I see a movie that I have become totally mad; It's one of them. It was good acting, dialogue, plot, and scenery was beautiful. I shout louder, especially the deal with the kitchen raid scene. The slapstick comedy handed over to Lennonhead kept me in a floor, but I admitted that I was a fanatical for slopstick. The story was present 20 years ago with a 30-year-old returning to a summer camp with a group of people. It was the weekend of camping, because it would end permanently at the end of the season. The camps were different from the adults, and they felt each other separately with each other. I recommend this fun, moving movie to everyone. <br /> <br />
