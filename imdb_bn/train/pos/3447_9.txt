I do not have any director than Mamara Oshir. But sadly, although he managed several films, which gained huge international attention, there are some pictures of his films that have been broken through the cracks. Touchguce is one of them, and even though I like to bite it, it's not difficult to see why distributors in the West are unwilling to free it. <br /> <br /> Among his big and serious movies, Oshi is known to make some small and quirkier projects. Although Tchuewishi must have read this section, Oishi really took it with himself, creating something that is very difficult to classify, even as a scary Japanese flick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> But instead of fooling the existing sub-culture, Oshi invented her own and abandoned the life of cooking heroes, ate free food and kept Japanese cooking levels. Oishi's view on this topic is closely related to diarrhea, because the gravitational gravitational direction is directed, but the images on screen may seem ridiculous. Deadpie humor is extremely impressive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All is not well, instead of just shooting his instrument shooting, Oshi decided to create a new visual technique using superlaviation. A peculiar mix of live action, photography, digital animation and dolls on a stick. Japanese animation industry is edited and performed by the Maharaja (or if you wish), the lesser project is considered as less as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think it's just about cover it, know that the film is highly dialogue-heavy, it's a good companion piece for innocence. Greeters' effects are analyzed from all kinds of cultural, political and even philosophical corners, with the continuous stream of viewers and dialogue being fired into the audience. And to make it even worse, the whole film is fully grounded in Japanese history and customs, making it a foreigner more difficult to get a better consistency in content. Not to say, multiple views suggest that it is advisable to optimize all the details of the ticks inside the film. <br /> <br /> It is easy to follow the film, at a conceptual level, and is already quite enjoyable. Various graphters were known as the most influential historical identities of the Japan War. For the release of any other important film, the film that you expect from a serious documentary, such as the plays, shows that in some way large and angry animated cut-out photographs are collected with no numbers, it does not make it too serious. Character range range is magnificent, Shinji Higuchi accepts cows like an ankle when he accepts fast food chains with his lightning / people. <br /> <br /> Oshi gives regular Kanyaji, without a fantastic ridiculous performance, a score from an atmospheric and dark to astonishing, weird and ridiculous. Too much fun is the exaggerated sound and effects, to complement the animation and to make the whole movie sound completely incompatible. Apparently the film is very atmospheric, although it must be said that the animation is very low and effective when effective, finally finally spreads to hyperactivity curiosity. Which is not a bad thing, Thegucci is watching so much dialogue-heavy. Despite this, the film is still a lovely masterpiece, as each frame looks absolutely lovely and is suitable for improving the film's general atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Be careful, because TwentyVision makes a lot of demand from viewers. If you do not speak Japanese, there are many reading works and there are many cultural references that claim some attention. Above, many psychology in film areas can be quite stretched and difficult to follow. The film is still lacking in English subtitles and although my French enough about it was enough, I'm sure I missed a lot of points in the film. <br /> <br /> Touchgusi is not easy to get the film, but through almost half it reaches full vapor and it is not closed from there. I still hope to see this again with English or Dutch subs. A dub actually will be good for a film like this (like many containers), although I think a quality enema dub is asking for a bit more than enough. <br /> <br /> All of that, I just congratulated Oisir on another extraordinary picture! Finding a movie is very rare, which mixes many styles and influences and creates something unique that is unique and still works. The film is smart, looks and sounds great and is beat with creativity. It's too funny, even if you can not catch all the details in the first view. But do not forget to get it at least with subscription, since the automated English translation floating is totally worthless and the film is not a trial. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that the French were released, Still waiting for the sign of this movie. But like Oshi, who commemorates the dry and dead smile and wish for creative spirits, this is a film that can not be missed, although it can be a laugh. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
