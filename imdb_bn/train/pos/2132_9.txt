Cast this really a nice surprise and normal-versus women-debate-all-time-but-wind up-holding Hollywood sculpted romance / comedy love kind of cut top. <br /> I'm not usually going for that kind of movie, and that was a tiring storyline but it was refreshing, fun to watch, and very elegantly with a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan closed each other and made another good and a very nice couple. Supporting cast is outstanding - always favorite to see Wilson Joseph Shieldcratt from Felix Breastre <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He took the film and with some dramatic events, it turned it into a completely different mood for a while. This is another reason for "Twist" which is different from this movie. <br /> <br /> Again, when there is a good mix of films section, it is usually successful. This is a great example. In this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's good. I will accept it to recreate the "I have received the mail" any day. Comparative
