The FATTY Drive Bush Drive is just fun, the most original and entertaining pieces I have ever enjoyed seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie is not like Hollywood's standard, even live camera work, editing, acting, budget or anything else from Terry "Halk" Hogan Video Movie Fluff Comedy from the actor. <br /> <br /> There is a key to this movie though it is a very original and enjoyable story, and it is definitely made by those who love to make it, and all cast and crew's enthusiasm really break through all its budgets and acting downfalls. <br /> <br /> This movie proves that you don`t need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great movie, you need some basic ideas and some emotions for everything you need. <br /> <br /> Only Best Movies How can I not get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, just watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I hope they will create a DVD version.
