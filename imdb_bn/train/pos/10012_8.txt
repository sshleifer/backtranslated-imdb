The Night class is probably not one of William's best roles, but he has created a very interesting character in some strange but very different movies. I can guarantee that you have never seen such films before. Some people might not like slow pacing of this movie, but I think it's a great plus for the movie. This is clearly one of the best movies that came from 2006. It has a great content, a curiosity performance in a movie with dramatic feelings. This is not an American film. No it's an anticipated movie. You just feel that this is a movie that is secret that can set a difficult time for you to determine. It's not a nice movie that has everything, but hell, it's a great and very original movie.
