The last film in Lucas Saga is amazing, spectacular-visible production. It is often considered to be the ugly dubling of the original trilogy, but I think it is a groove on the fourth episode (and only the third in the episode and the V-low notch). Actually, I think it's the third best movie of a 6-part cat. As far as I'm concerned, it's still a grandly entertaining film. This is not a movie, beginning and ending; The film's process operates with the sole aim of his mind: Lucas closes the universe. The final thing is to connect with the whole thing, which makes the film very sensitive, but emotionally effective. Also, it's a lot of fun. New characters are introduced and older ones are experiencing new, unexpected challenges. Provide C3PO and R2D2 (as normal) great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still a great character to detect. Again, it is the internal conflict of the Luke (and the Vader) that gives the guy his background. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still very clear, and firmly resuscitated the allegiance of the movie, expectations and release. I'm glad Lucas finally abandoned the idea of ​​making the seventh, eighth, and nine episodes, because this film is a long, impressive and impressive songwriter, a great pamphlet. Do not have a perfect movie, but the best matinée style is fun.
