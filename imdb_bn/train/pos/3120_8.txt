Paul Greengrass definitely survived the best Bourne for the end! I've heard that many people complained about the way to illustrate this film, and some even compare the camera style with the Blair Witch project. All I have to say ... are you kidding me? It was not that bad at that. I think this helps to make action scenes feel more realistic, which I like highly stylized stunt corrections. I really did not notice it for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> You can say that the Damon is really comfortable with Jason Burn's role. Sometimes that might be a bad thing, but in this case it is a really good thing. He really became Jason Bourne in this installment. A great supporter of the repression of Joan Allen, Ezra Crumar and Julia Styles David Strathren was a great addition to cast, because he joined the deeper CIA organization. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is filled with great traffic and nonstop action, they are in a fair amount of character development along with them. This film has grown far beyond the other two Bourne movies and is one of the best movies of the summer of 2007!
