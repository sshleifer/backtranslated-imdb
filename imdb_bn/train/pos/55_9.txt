At first I was not sure that I did not want to see this movie during my guide, so I saw it in IMDB and thought that the cover was quite quiet so I thought it would try to hopefully hope to get a movie like elephant. <br /> <br /> Once I could not play the role of Alicia played by Basile Phillips, I realized I realized that this film is working well for Alicia and Das's relationship. Alicia has had so much money for Erica Crichsenen throughout the whole film, but we have finally found that despite being opposed to the pole she is still in the shooting, while one of them is a common one. They share loneliness and how much the film's progress is manifesting. <br /> <br /> I am happy to see how well I liked this movie and to see all the positive comments about it. I could not even go through elephants because it just seems to be exploiting the Colombian tragedy. On the other hand, this movie was compulsory and realistic. Busy Philips Chain is off !!! This is a good thing and I would like to see its progress in some more mature roles.
