I saw this movie in sixth grade around Christmas time, and I was really excited to see it, and when I heard that George C Scott was there, I was really excited, because I really love George C Scott! When I was watching this movie and my class, I was really in it, and when it was over, I was really impressed, I thought it was completely fabulous! This is the best version of Charles Dickens classic novel I have seen! George C. There was something else like Scroog's Scrooge, I think he was the right choice, he was a screwdriver, he's right screw! I saw two different versions of a Christmas carol, the other one with Patrick Stewart, but this is good! <br /> <br /> Is this really a great acting, I thought the actors were fabulous, everyone was, spirits, small teams, Bob Crichit, everyone, they could not find anyone better than anyone. They were part! But George C Scott was the best picture! When I saw him, I thought he was great! He is sure the Ebenezer screws, I do not think they found anyone else! I do not think they found someone to replace someone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the adaptation of the classic Disney movie adaptation of Charles Dickens, and I really believe that you agree, you think this movie is awesome! I'm probably going to buy this movie in DVD, because I thought it was completely fabulous! I totally recommend you see this best composition! This is the best version of a Christmas carol. <br /> <br /> 10/10
