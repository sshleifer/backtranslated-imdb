Another IMDB reviewer commented that the movie starts slowly, but it is good enough to go along. Yes, it is published by Roger's order and yes, it crosses the same theoretical ground, which is much more budget predecessor such as the Fatak cycle and POISON IVY. However, the rationality of his wife's career as a rising blues singer against her husband's loneliness and his almost Freudian needs to be filled with emotional and physical "ineffectual" or "holes" when the low impact and clever use of the settings goes. Beautifully done. Even though using this small number of locations and characters, and using both of the water in almost every scene as a symbol of both cleanliness and drowning, this film is clearly suffering from a small budget, reminds me of various ways to realize me more fully and the recent situation , Such as the French film "Swimming Pool" which I think is at least "Umar B Ruddhe UPA "has borrowed some useful ideas. With a small tool set, the UPA against UPA sometimes preserves its mystery with the basic, serious view of surrender towards emotional temptation, but it makes it better or better just like other series in this series. Hate the Father of the Past (again, very Freudian) Happiness is very unique in this style and fun too. I agree with other viewers that the unexpected and sympathetic response to the tragic reaction of Amanata is this aspect of the story. I think cast is excellent. <br /> <br />
