<br /> <br /> "Blake House" does not always keep the best adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel. One of my favorite novels, I was very happy with this television mini series. Late, Great Danahell Eliot was shot perfectly, as was the perfect perfection of the great John Jardis and the Diana Rig disaster Lady Dodlock. The film captures the main ideas of Dickens era and makes the book very believable, creating small skits that do not affect the story. All a bright, moving and atmospheric film.
