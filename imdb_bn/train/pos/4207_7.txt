MacKay (Richard Wyommark) Pick-Pocket Candie's (Gene Peters) Walat, which contains an important microphone, is intended for communist reasons. Being followed by 2 federal agents who are waiting for a pounce once he hands Microfiche on his contact. However, avoid everyone steals purse at the subway under the nose of everyone, and so the police and Joey (Richard Kelly) and candy both start searching for those who want to return the microphone. Skip sells the information of criminals who can only be identified through the ladder (Theelma Ritter). It is believed that theft that he stole is considered important and both parties want this movie, but he wants to wait for high prices. This was followed by Zoe Hunting and the cause of contradiction between Joe and Jean, who fell in love with the school. Joey has a deadline to provide her boss microfiche. <br /> <br /> This is a well-liked film and it is a good start that gets directly involved in you. It is a bit unrealistic to see how Gene Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point otherwise why she needs to keep from Joey as otherwise required. This is a good film.
