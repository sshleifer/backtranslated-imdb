A very enjoyable film, providing you how to see the old musical / mystery. It may not be near Agatha Christie or even Thin Man's mystery, as a movie noor, but your ideal "meets boy girl" or "let's do a show" is much more interesting than the backstage musicals. As a musical instrument, it is not a Busby Berkley or Fried Unite, but it can enhance the classic "Cocktail for two" and the weird "sweet marijuana". During a stage show in the implementation of the film, "Vanities" opens on the night of the night, where a murder - and soon - the other finds it - to come back. Is the murderer screen found before the collapse? Sure, however, the search is fun, although somewhat predictable and fatal by the explosion of comic relief (fortunately, chorus girls' hats are female-shaped goddess). The stupid police are very little cute, the main hero is just a little more likable, the leading lady is a little more kind, the wicked is very wicked, and the enamored waif a little denying, but go as stereotypes, they are quite stylish. Truly gorgeous chorus girls, who have a beaver selected better than girls for a Busby Berkley musical of the same time, who sometimes tend to a bit of coarse side. Yes, this movie can be much better than that, and Duke Allington number is a shame, but if you enjoy diving in old movies, it will prove to be an extraordinary tantric journey.
