On September 12, 2006, at the Toronto International Film Festival, it was reviewed on the second screen of the Paramount 1 Theater. This image was premiered the day before the Algin Theater Visa Screening Room. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freon is one of the main actors who once came under the roles of his career and who is undergoing a fundamental plot, but he still works with a positive attitude that he knows he will pay rent. . For a long time in the role of lower flip-flop dvd dvd with his flickers with flickers and his caffeier himself is not sure of any production assistant who has shut down Freeman in the local community market, where he is going to play as a director of the supermarket. He soon discovered the real-life market that iron-deliberately "10 items or less" checkout lines run by Clarke Puzz Wage. When Freeman's journey does not come back, and Viaz needs help for prepping for interviews, the conditions force them to return to Freeman's house and join the city across the city to help Verga get more mobile career paths throughout the city. <br /> <br /> Although the picture is enjoyable, it still seems to be a sketch or progress. There were two enhanced musical sequences (the cause of singing children with Wag and Freeman after each other, which could literally play like Paul Simon's music video), which was felt like a padding to increase time, and even the film is about 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the best things Morgan Freeman liked was because it was not too short for him. Sure it was funny in part and was also happy, but it was not enough here because it was not complete. <br /> <br /> They lost me while talking about Morgan Freeman's car stop. Asked for directions and Paz Vega said that he does not do that. Who has heard of a man whose direction is seeking and the woman is not saying! It is just the opposite in the real world. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay on top of credit. Just a delight to know how to sell the bit mortgages Freeman Hessel with a target shop saleslady teaching! One source of Freeman's Chaufur's arrival is that Freeman's voice was also interesting to read "Tape Books". <br /> <br /> Director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a short question answer. Screening Silberling responded to a question that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and once he took Freeman's role, he changed what he actually was. A lot of praise is also for Sylberling's writing and how Freeman can play a role and it can fully feel like it is born to play.
