Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God has given all humans the power to love the whole world, but the human heart is very small, every man has a special place that he likes more than anyone else. It seems to me that it may be the policy of some prominent managers while promoting endless love for this prominent place of today and describing the situation in the life of its deniers and visitors. The result is a great collection of short films from Paris Jesse'im, our guide, Van Saint, Koeketate, Kavon, Penn and others, walk us through an exciting way through Paris's heritage, human feelings, desires and expectations. <BR> <br /> There are always some quarters, always running stories about ordinary people for love, it can be a parking lot, art studio, tube station. And Paris J'Ta'im is a great array of love - a partner, child, parent, for those who want to understand the world but are no longer there, need to awaken for love, tender love for your love for the stranger. , Or love that just does not mean ... today, but tomorrow - who knows? <br /> <br /> This picture is not for love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, daily ups and downs. And its most important quality is that it is not Sappi, rather rather optimistic and hopeful. <br /> <br /> I can give this picture 9 because the last part of it can be further developed by introducing some stories, but not all of them and I am missing, and by "further development" I have some specific references to the future of the letter I do not want to say. As far as I am concerned about all other things I can only say - concentrate. If you want to leave everything behind you, flee to Paris and live in those little romance yourself.
