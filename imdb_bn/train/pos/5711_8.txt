Le Million, Ron Cleier, one of the great directors and great pioneers of the film, has created a mosaic of light comedy because all its light is a mobile phone and technically bright film that clearly influences the next filmmakers like Marx Brothers, LÃ¼beTouch, and Mamoulian. This plot is a diverse narrative of a poor artist who has won huge lottery jackpot, but for missing tickets, there is a serious search across the city, essentially it is just an instrument that supports a series of wonderful wonderful comic scenes in the world of dreams. The director's imagination <br /> <br /> One of the most fascinating things about this picture is that although it was set in the middle of Paris, and this is not really impossible, it is a permanent and fairy tale / fiction where it seems quite normal The way people speak, they can sing, or take a clash on the stolen jacket as a football game. Another memorable element is Le Million which is the most fun opera that can sometimes be filmed (O Blond-Breaded Sleeping! "I'm laughing, O! O!") Casting a pleasure: Claire has assembled a group of amazing, totally different character actors, A bourgeois French "type" with each of their deadly satiric accuracy, which is one of Dummia's prints Etera looks like. It is illustrated with. <br /> <br /> Hilary takes a little while to get the rolling, and I think the characters can not stay in a light comedy (as they are in many luvit films). That is why I refrain from giving the highest rating. But these little caves will not deviate from enthusiastic recommendations. <br /> <br /> Do you see it? All the way Highly recommend if you want a classic and influential work in the movie or just a funny comedy.
