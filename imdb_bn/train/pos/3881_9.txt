This movie kept me in the incredible opening sequence which pushed me from the perspective to the opposite direction, so I had the warning when it came to the headline. The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting, trying to discover themselves, but not in complex ways like identity or general suspense, but the way we try to make life a little bit alive, we find ourselves more. Fun Chicken warehouse views. At one point, Jorgen (who owns a chicken farmer) attended a seminar, where he was the worst student. His uncomfortableness lets you see the depth of your change. This movie has surprised me with the hidden mystery hidden, which I see every day on the back of the most common man's page. There is not much of plot here. It is very easy to guess the secret of old people, but trying to guess the consciousness when they recognize it and do all other characters. This movie appeals to me the same way that Sideways did, although the letters could not be different anymore.
