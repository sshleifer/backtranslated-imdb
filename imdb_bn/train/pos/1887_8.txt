Arthur is a middle-aged 'child' who drinks like a fish. He does what Arthur thinks, and says that whatever comes into his mind. He likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a distorted brat. He does not know he spends money and finds everything fun. Arthur will have to marry a high class girl to inherit a great fate, but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really weird). <br /> <br /> This is a great funny picture. I have seen this picture because a very famous Indian film 'Sharabi' is based on Arthur's character. Although 'Sharabi' is definitely inspired by Arthur, I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun At times very very corny. There are so many pretty liners in the picture. This is not a smile riot but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his drunk father and he talks about 'Moos'. Duddley Moore sure has some comic timing. He is very good with words and body language. I like the scene where he talks to a small couple in the hotel and he speaks to her husband in two different ways. John Gilgood received an Oscar for this photo. I do not know the actor. I do not think he did a great job, but if I saw more of his work then I can agree in the future. There are some flat patch in the movie but not too long. Looking forward to seeing the sea.
