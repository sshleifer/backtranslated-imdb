It is perhaps Monster Ink and Sherrock that can be noticed in the same market, but it is different in the minds of the low cartoon (though deliberately, despite the cartoon features of Lead creatures). This story is not the one that was moral on your face (it's more like a toy in your shirt) but likes to talk about relationships between different animals. You know the results, but you can help being not drawn. Most Disney movies have more characters than their voices (voices less prominent actors). They are well rounded and completely trustworthy, wonderful. Group dynamics are presented nicely well and character revelations and quirks are fine and enjoyable. If you want to think of yourself as soon as you get rooting for them <br /> <br /> The animation will be bright, as you expect, and you will be offered the opportunity to go to the Sky Slide movie. You will fall in love with letters, especially the ridiculous relief of prehistoric cavity and the great effort of his almond deaf. I came out to ask for compulsory merchandise, especially dust toys, I would be frustrated when I did not find anything unusual the next day. <br /> <br /> Which, surprisingly, makes the movie more pure. <br /> <br /> Monster is better than ink or shake
