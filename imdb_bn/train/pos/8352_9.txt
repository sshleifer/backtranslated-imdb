This film is a stunning piece that the most suspicious spectator will believe that Gerard Depardieau is one of the best film actors of the 50's. Shock her performance, hobbies, hates and charms you when you are breathless. This film was shot in the early days of his film career and is very raw, but still can demonstrate the skills of Depardieu. A must see by a Depardieu fan and its best preliminary work.
