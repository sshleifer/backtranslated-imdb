Very slow, but complexly structured and finally very touch. The appearance of a beautiful, true living in a small Florida beach town of winter death - I was there, and it's absolutely right. <br /> <br /> It's actress's first starring Ashley Jude, and she makes a big impression here. It is hard to believe that this film is 12 years old - it looks like in the theater, and recently I've rented "Ruby". Except for the 80-odd dresses, it has been arranged very nicely. Ashley is so bright and touching here that it is difficult to think about winning her next career. Boy, your failure to meet your first promise! Ashley at "Ruby in Paradise" saw anyone who went to "go" the girl for the movie industry and slasher movie - instead of going to perform all the artistic arts films and serious acts of this elegant, normal beauty! Very frustrating, but at least our initial performance is reserved for displaying its initial commitment. <br /> <br /> Some other commentators say this is not for everyone because it is very slow. This is not an action film, nor is it really a romance The director (Victor Nunez, "Wells Gold", another excellent character study) treats this deeply respected young girl with deep respect, which makes her stories gradually and makes a lot of detail. In this way, I think that this is one of the most running and respectful primitive stories about these young women. This is not about Ruby's sexual awakening or "how to lose her virginity", rather her life's preferences and her growing maturity. <br /> <br /> A beautiful picture, if you took the time to look at it ... I think it will be a really nice movie to show teenage and young girls (or boys in that case). And give them a chance to think and talk about them. <br /> <br /> The director of Nunezh Kuds, who wrote this script, is so realistic and beautifully described that I took everyone through this movie that it was based on a woman's written novel or memoir, but in fact it was Mr. Nunez's original work. 10 out of 8 rates.
