The film really realizes your recognition and the society we live in. It's good and very powerful. The filmmakers are honest and revealing about the world outside of universal ideological perspective. I believe this gives great insight into a sub-culture that reduces the viewers' views of society. It's repeatedly and it's more powerful because it's shiny. Most of the reality is because some parts were difficult to see, but it was not done. This is the first time you see it, but it will make about a second or third time better; Because you got the chance to wrap your mind about the topics that you discuss and challenge.
