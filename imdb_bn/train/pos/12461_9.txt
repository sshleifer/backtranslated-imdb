Two final skills of late Sebastian Jupiter and South Performance - a clever script in an engaging and entertaining thriller - Alin Dillon and Charles Bonson (or it should be just another way). <br /> <br /> On top of the generic score from Gen. Jane Herman and Francoisius de Robbicus, but with an efficient score, this film becomes so easy because of a great timeless quality. <br /> <br /> This is a friend or friendship story. Lone, both confusing and tired in the world, back, probably from Algiers. Like other colonial powers of this period (60 seconds after World War II), France struggled to appear abroad. Losing Algeria was a bitter storm. <br /> <br /> AIDI Eli (original title) describes the activities of our two (opposition) heroes, because they fight for it after their discharge. <Br> <br /> One thing will happen after one and the audience must pay attention, because the zodiac is weak and profitable with the help of its script: if there is, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This two men, both physically and emotionally, fight it a long weekend. Their motivation is quite different, their goals are different - their survival depends on each other. The Alin Dellon and Charles Bronson are extraordinarily different - the former, intelligent, a beautiful boy, and the next adds an ugly cheat, chemistry. <br /> <br /> The search is a great story, which turns out to be <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is forgotten by women, and also true in the Zaporian system, they are also memorable, although almost like tubewell Not; Not saying that one's joy will be ruined in discovering their real nature. <br /> <br /> Farewell, the friend has been released in the UK; An unformatted image, 16.9 Advanced; Only in English (not even subtitles for hearing power); 110 minutes running time; Mono soundtracks but D-Rubik's music has lots of punch! <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
