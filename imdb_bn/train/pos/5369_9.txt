Light Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold is as big as Ben Richards, a wrong person 'The Running Man', coerced to play a fierce TV game show where people will continue to try and escape from brutal 'in the hands of STK 'Death! Of course, people expect the death to prove the system wrong, and as a result it is proved wrong until Arnold. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book of Stephen King, but it is a great film, the best of Arnold's. He works best in the operational role, he provides death with the unforgettable one liners. After classally strangling a guy with Barba Cords 'he had a real pain in the neck,' and 'he was split!', He just mentioned that the leopard someone saw vertically. Dawson is completely annoying as a TV presenter, and all 'Stalkers' suitable camps. The action fell, but it's an action film. That's the real thing. The film is fast paced, and it does not welcome in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> With Helk and Terminator success with Starkey and Hutch Paul Michael Glazer, this image was probably seen as another stupid operational vehicle for Arnold and very remote. But today, anyone watching TV can see how the film is getting closer to reality. I would not be surprised if I started a 'nearby future' TV and saw a show that did not go away from it. <br /> <br /> In the sad note, however, of course, 'Running Man' who likes me like 80, Arnold, ridiculous work or violence or just a good action film. 9.5 / 10
