Actually, you can visualize the talent of a movie without a huge budget, like: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McNally, Brenda Fryker, Hugh O'Connor and Fiono Shaw? There is no doubt about the eligibility of their rewards: the Freaker and the Day-Lewis, but it was perfectly reasonable for O'Konner (such as Young Christie) and McNally rewarding: Cliche is true here: They do not play the role, they live in them. Day-Lewis's performance is a tour de force - a transition that is intimidating, but it is truly a sign of the Academy's intimacy, as well as respect to this performance, as well as the neatly restrained, still and heartwarming work of Brenda Fryker. As Christie's mother. However, if you have not seen this wonderful actress in "Swan", then it is another good film to test for its contribution (and the magnificent Mirinda Richardson).
