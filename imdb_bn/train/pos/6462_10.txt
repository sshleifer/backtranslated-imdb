I am not going to loot any material, but I have not seen this flawless composition of this poll. <br /> <br /> A world-famous conductor played brilliantly by Michael Nyqvist wants to seek peace from her childhood return to her childhood. Villagers who follow the silent genius, are gradually being tempted to share their majesty. <br /> <br /> Each role in this movie shows a very specific purpose and a tremendous feasibility among the actors. In short but specific words, playing their own words, a symphony of love. <br /> <br /> The love does not love the feeling, but the soul is buried deep in each of the letters, everyone expresses their present stories, their needs, their skeleton, desire and much more. <br /> <br /> I do not forget to mention, the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose plays are emotionally played in unforgettable harmonies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> or pretty. And pretty it starts from the beginning, is not less than a second or enough, you're going to have a feeling of change and a little more taste. <br /> <br /> Today, of course one of the best movies I was enjoying watching.
