Did you ever want to know that you can never go out of Hollywood before it was officially implemented? Well, unfortunately, "Convention City" has been lost, so to find out what's right, "Tarzan and his partner" will be seen. For 1934, there is a tremendous amount of sexual disrespect and even open flesh. Just look at Jane's naked swimming. Although Tarzan is often considered as a B-Adventure movie made for young boys and anyone else, this picture proves that the series was largely very adult. Even after seventy years, it was still sexy, when it came. <br /> <br /> In addition to pushing the forbidden nature it is a fantastic and exciting adventure story. I've always enjoyed jungle films, which have become slow in the 30's and 40's, but I want to do some of the smaller movies in the genre. "Tarzan and his companion", this long unanimous decision is the best movie. The sequence of safari attacks by Afghanistan or the Negatives also continues to tension. Also, all of the animals are very cool (definitely throwing apescial stone). Acting will not win any major awards soon, but certainly not enough for this kind of picture. This image is again stolen by the cheetah, the most intelligent monkey in the jungle. Pre-code code is one of Hollywood's most entertaining examples.
