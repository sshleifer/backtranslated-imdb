... On the stage, on TV or in a book, 'The Woman in Black' is a wonderful ghost story. Other critics have already said about telling about this film, but I thought I would add my little review. The London film is a deliberate first slump, which has been written by Arthur, the original character while leaving London as a solicitor in London in 1920. I understand why these palates may not appeal. Yet, for me, I love the story of this British-style story, which is similar to the adaptation of the work of great James Anderson, like the BBC's "Story Story for Christmas". Under the second act, Arthur was sent to the provinces by the boss to clear the ghost story suddenly to the client's death. The third thing steadily turns to the vertebrate-shrimp conundrum ... I saw this game as London. I bought the book, DVD-R and my iPod has an unbundled audio book. Sure for me, 'The Women in Black' is a ghost story with a few in equal measure. It was almost time that we had a valid zoning 2 DVD release.
