Wow, I can not believe I've waited so long to see this picture. I do not get around watching it. I have no interest in the plot. I do not know anything about football (football.) I am one of the American fools who have no formula. I did not see David Beckham before this photo. When I was released in America, I chose to visit around this movie. Enough about me <br /> <br /> The truth is, ignoring this small fragment of cinema was wrong. What a fun film It is full of color and exuberance. I had a stupid grin on my face through the whole movie. Parminder's city is so sweet and loving, you can not help the route for him. American television show ER Why did he rob him? I have a new perception for Indian culture. Those people know there is a good time. The wedding scene is dazzlingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem was the British bureaucratic commentary and dialogue through dialogue. I've introduced English subtitles to make sure I did not miss anything. (Not to be criticized by this movie!) I'm sure it is difficult to understand the problem of constantly changing American movies of global audiences. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date movie. It's a great sports conspiracy like Rocky, and empowerment for women that has a strong sense of feminism. I saw it with my wife, and the sixteen year old nephew, and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.
