I saw it a few years ago. I remember this in a very mysterious situation, and the mix of depressing things like Dorothy's fate and personal future of Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> I got to see my VHS copy and then I was reviewing it more. And more. Nowadays I'm waiting for a DVD version, at any price, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > /> <br /> All the characters have a wonderful, funny situation, great acting and many dialogues that have become a civilization for me and I've seen many internet or movie clubs. This may not be casualties. <br /> <br /> I think title life is a hope! As much as you want and laugh, as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know that this might be a special comment for this movie, but really I like it, it seems that the movie has identified me and I Do not forget.
