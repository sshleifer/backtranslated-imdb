This movie is really special. This is a very nice movie. Shah, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi, started with three orphans, poor children living on the street, but one day they were able to steal a bag with money and then they were able to buy it. A house, and their lives seem to be much better. They are making new friends, life friends. But some have gone wrong and they are becoming enemies and they all are eventually killed. <br /> <br /> I was negative about this movie at the beginning, because the singer (Gacht-Solo, ex-singer) Malis Meyer, Haid-Solo, L'Arrock ~ N. singer in Seoul, is very famous in Japan and Wang Li-Home-Taiwan singer) is trying to be an actress, but it is not like any other singer-actor-actor. -movies They are doing a great job and there is no previous experience in the film (except Leo-Home, who were previously in two movies). <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's a big fan on Hayde, because - this movie has discovered me. <br/> <br /> <br /> Gacte (playing the original character - orphan show) was a part of a script that wrote, and he loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly said, at that time, Not familiar with, at least not like friends. But after the movie they became really good friends and it also shows us that they have really worked hard on this film and they have good cooperation. <br /> <br /> There are stories of different feelings of love, love, hatred, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness etc. I think the best of the first hours, so beautiful. After that people are dying, who are going and all of them have changed. But still it's a great movie, it's the only movie that has ever made me cry, it's so tragic, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie then you must. Because it's astonishing, but sad You do not regret it. ^^
