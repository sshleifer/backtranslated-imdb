Todd Rohal is a crazy talent "Nichalfas Jones", its third, and most fully realized, has a humorous sense of the small film, and will leave some potholes on his head. How this picture is about the heart, and he would not agree with me about this, regular Joke found confidence through life with little encouragement. Or not You just have to see for yourself. The brief is creating intermediate festival circuits round, so keep your eyes empty and you can catch it if you are capable - you'll be happy. It's fun. And other small movies from Todd also popping up here and there from time to time: "single spaced" and "slug 660".
