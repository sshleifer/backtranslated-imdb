It is a complex film that explores the effects of the Fordist and the teleman system of industrial capitalist production on human relations. There is a constant reference to produce assembly lines, where workers are considered to be machine-crooked, clipboards are supervised by directing operators, workers remove hair and stonemakers (Stanley) that meet all criteria (such as their supervisor, always time , Hard working, doing good things) but there was no mistake in a particular future Maybe. <br /> <br /> This system destroys the family - after losing his job to Stanley, his father had to send a nursing home (where he died quickly). Iris' daughter is the single teenage mother who went out of high school to get employment in the plant. References have been created that both partners should work with wages reduction, which means that there is no one in the house to care for the kids. Iris's husband died due to illness, and with more references to the cost of treatment of the film, the observer must think that he may live with better and costly care. Another unsuccessful day in Iris's brother's unemployment office becomes abusive when his wife tells him to buy a beer with his mouth and / or tooth work (even without leaving a stage with the working class). Perfection and beauty to buy them in the traditional bourgeois concept). A reference to the nation in the film is done through the black factory line worker whose husband is in prison (probably, he is also black, and black men incomplete enjoys higher prison rates). He commented that he "is doing the time" like him - his family is made up of captives and wage slaves. <br /> <br /> Although Stanley still believes in human relationships and so most of the film is outside the system of Fordian capitalism. According to the law of Iris, he cared for his father for his father's job of selling his father's illiteracy because of his marriage - he still did not reduce human relations with his illiteracy. Wrong sister "). Iris says that she is not in accordance with the work-and-sleep routine of others; rather, she uses technology and industrial production techniques in a technological and creative way, such as the Baauhaus ideology, as it is known to the early modernists and socialists of 1920 (such as bauhaus) There was a dream - to use technology to provide all basic needs, creative human work and full human resources He also allows more time to free his life.He also cooks, he cleanses, takes care of his family, and knows how iron is iron, on the other hand, Iris plays a traditional male role - he is a factory worker , His (extended) family's source of income growth, and he brings Stanley to the public, which is traditionally closed for the closed women. By learning to read and write, he gives him the opportunity to enter the world of knowledge, also traditionally awakens the man. <br /> <br /> Literature here (traditionally man-made) are used as metaphors and systemic symbols (circulation (financial, transport, cultural) Enables participation in the public. Apart from this access, Stanley is women - her job is to cook and clean open jobs. He is excluded from all regular circulation, vehicles (can not open bank accounts), vehicles (drivers can not get license, can not operate the bus), and social <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In reality, organized religion is rarely present - the Bible also appears in a dress as a camera pan to find Streilly and Irrise's sexual relationship. However, it is recognized as a moral force - Iris, clearly a character employed to live a "good" life, mentioned at the beginning of the film that his silver was in a missing object in Paris. Once able to read, he enters the system and adjusts a healthcare plan, a car and a home-owned position, takes his place on the head of the family, RotiVinor. Most likely, he is an industrial designer, has dreamed of products that must endure hard work of gathering for others. This ending, perhaps the only bit of Hollywood in this movie, is so inconsistent that something that happened before that I could think that if it is not forced by Studio Exclusives, suddenly a feeling-is worried about the lack of good finishes. And its possible impact on the bottom line. Now, according to the scholars, we have been comfortable in industry-industrial capitalism, the film also has little nostalgic feelings, although the historical distances of analyzing what we need to do during that time. However, it is highly recommended - at least if you want to practice your brain. The last unused, and it's a perfect around 10.
