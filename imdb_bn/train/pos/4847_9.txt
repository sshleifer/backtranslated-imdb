This film is one of those nostalgia items, and I do not expect anyone to "get it" but when I recommend it, they are happy and someone enjoys it. My late father was Hat Arthur Aski, but he really enjoyed this picture and his constant encouragement for "The Ghost Ghost" and "Old Ted" Olmos "transferred me as a child." Years later, I enjoyed the contact, watch it repeatedly. I always wonder if it does not have to be the same but I do not disappoint it. There are many to enjoy. As the Axis and Maradouk are going to disturb the arrogant men, the order of the train is really inspired. Then amazing with the whole section of the station is going so much to keep you going. Yes, it is full of English and English full of dates and platforms, based on the original play of Actant and Plot (Father Army Fame Arnold Ridley!) But has played an outstanding role - Kathleen Harrison is like Dotty Spinster. The atmosphere is really as sinister as an Arthur Askey might get in the car. UK's chips are available as cheap as DVDs so treat yourself. It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon light-laced recreational pieces. I thank you .... <br /> <br /> Old movies can be good movies!
