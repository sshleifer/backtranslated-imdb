In a word ... amazing. <br /> <br /> I was not interested in watching Pingor first because I thought it would be another movie that would show sadness on partition and bias towards India and Pakistan. I was so completely wrong. Pinjar is a heart-twisting, mental and intelligent movie without any visible error. I was scared by it after watching it. It lingered over my mind for so long; The theme, pain, loss, emotions-all were real. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a really wonderful work, which is rarely seen in Bollywood today. There is no bias or ancestry and gave the humanitarian story to the partition. Here, no one country is portrayed as good or bad. Bad Indian, evil Pakistani and good Indian and Pakistani have. Cinematography is excellent and music composer, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar Sahib) and hunting. Everything about the movie is amazing ... and acting just took my breath. All are completely cast. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching an intellectual and truly amazing movie ... see more This movie gives all. I recommend it with all my heart. AMAZING can not describe how nice it is.
