In this season, I have enjoyed shamefully for every episode of Pishing Daisy and hope that the author will not end up brutally at the beginning of the hartal very well. Ned is a pie manufacturer who owns a restaurant in the middle of the city and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a personal investigator with her own unique quirks like knitting her love. Charlotte (Chalk) is a dead-but-no-childhood friend and a sunny place in the river life. Olive is jealous but well-hearted waitress. Oh, and add dogs. The Jim Dell Show combines all the characters with its wonderful details. Along with Chalk, Ned and Emmorson, solitary and occasionally the dogs solve the mystery of multiple killings with the help of Nedi's special gift to bring the dead back to life. The show is very fun, happy and heartfelt, fun, clean and romantic, and I recommend it to anyone.
