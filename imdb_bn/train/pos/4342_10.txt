This movie really did not surprise me, for example, it got better and better. I thought: "Paul Ryder wrote this writing, well ... we'll see how he is doing ..." Then I saw Peter Folk. I appreciate Colombo. Although I have never been a big fan of the show, I always like seeing Peter Folk. <br /> <br /> Peter and Paul's performance is so normal that I was flying on the wall. They felt giddy with each other off so good that I actually enjoyed! ... and I did not even drink alcohol! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that I want to get Paul properly and how much I enjoyed him! But I can not find his number. To be unlisted or something. <br /> <br /> It was a movie that I had no idea what it was going to be or was there in it or someone else. It just came and I thought: "Oh, why not? If I do not like it - I do not need to see it ..." ... and I love it till the end!
