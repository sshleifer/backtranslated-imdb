A Christmas came together before my time, but I have raised John Denver and songs from this special one were always my family's Christmas music. For years we had a cracking cassette made from a Christmas record. A few years ago, I was finally able to track a video of eBay, so after almost 21 years of listening to all the music, I found myself in John and Muppet for the step. If you ever get the chance, it's a lot of fun - great music, heart-warming and delicious. It's interesting to see the 70's version of Mappettes and compare them to their new versions today. I believe Dave has actually taken some heat for a show - I think the actors usually do not compromise their images to sing with Muppette, but I'm glad he did. Even if you can not track the video, the value of the soundtrack is also. It has some Muppified Traditional favorites, but as well as some original Diver tunes.
