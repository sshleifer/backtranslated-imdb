Rated E (violence is). <br /> <br /> For me, PC was playing the original Spider-Man for several years. I still could not find it because there was an error at one point in Windows XP. Because of this, it can not beat. So if you have XP, be careful. Try to give this game to those who do not have XP. It's a fun clean family game and it's great for a spiderman fan. In it you play Spiderman and you take different criminals who are criminals. Spiderman would like to play a funny little game and I would like a fun, clear game for any Spiderman fan or their kids, a parent suggested it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
