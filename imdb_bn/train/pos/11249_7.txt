I just saw the whole 6 episodes across the DVD. The whole acting is excellent - no question. I did not have enough work for me I would say. No real mystery, just like lots of development of first-class characters. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in the "Whodunnit" post. If you want a good story slowly and carefully then this is for you. Peter Egan is like a magnate led by Magnus Pim. <br /> <br /> The picture illustrates the traitor's life. A British who was a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but was so psychologically affected by his unhappy childhood that fraud became the way of his life in all things. As a child, he paid homage to his father but his father revealed time and time as a cakatelian personality. Palm does not betray ideology or money, because he has to cheat his closest (wife, son, counselor). Palm is severely damaged by the effects of his father - it has eaten away his moral fiber. She has no true love or loyalty. <br /> <br /> 6 hours of heavy emotional content in the series and a lot of light moments Although very well done.
