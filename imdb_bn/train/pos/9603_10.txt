I have a word of this movie, wow! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater will be able to This film shows the pain that Darius Mascull suffered with Disstrife. The film is very well done and really made you part of the movie, I moved emotionally through the movie because it reminded us that we are very fortunate to be completely healthy, some people in this world are less weaker. And sometimes we should give them one and the very end, should help them. When I did not ask Darius to ask ten of them, they asked Darius to the west of Derius, they did not do what they did for Darius's needs.
