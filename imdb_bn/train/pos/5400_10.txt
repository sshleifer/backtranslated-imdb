This movie wanted to revoke the emperor to return to the throne in the history of Japan, soon after losing a great fight against the Shogunat dynasty, shortly after the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate, he received a great education in Japanese history. In fact, I had to read many history to get the whole background. <br /> <br /> One of the four Hitokiri (also known as Jyotishi), Shinastat Katsu (Ezo Okada) gave the extraordinary performance of Bukumatu's Slyare). He is a general Samui who hides all his possessions. He became a conservator of Hanpay to look for a better life (Tatsuya Naqada = played from the sword of Dodd by Ryoonsuk). Hanpie is a highly-nationalist politician who allowed Hitokiri to kill many high ranking Western politicians to achieve his political goal. Izo Okada really follows his leader without asking what they are doing. As long as he has money and drinks and spends his prostitution. Okara's assassination becomes more cruel in the film and is proud to achieve a reputation based on where she feared. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful portrait of a common paraphernalia which is caught in political matters and is really stupid to realize what is happening. After the betrayal and torture first and always talk about the Sacamoto (who reject Samoan violence), he changes his ideas and life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Each actor reaches their role. Sword-a very unique and quick fight ... probably faster than a few movies nowadays ... <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, check it out !!!
