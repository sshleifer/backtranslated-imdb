Although I did not start reading "classic" until the age of 47, it is not too late. Jane Aire favorite for many reasons, mainly because I did not like the part of the book, only the parts I enjoyed more. What I expected was with the 1983 TV mini series Jella Clark and Timothy Dalton. I saw it as a full-length movie in 2006. Dalton's' Mr. Rochester was great, but I absolutely like Jillah's 'Jane Eyre'. Relecting on another 'classic' movie I saw recently, I was frustrated in the production, direction and dialogue. It was only faithful to Hollywood's arrogance and arrogance. Great work in literature is nothing short of the artistic license theft practice. The use of the title after such a license is fraud. One of these right (among others) to get it to leave Brits. You can not re-read the movie without proper reference and spirit. Well done BBC
