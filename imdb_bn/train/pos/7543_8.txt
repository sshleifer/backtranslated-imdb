This is a visual orientation of Manga with very little dialogue. There will also be a conversation between the balloon and the conversation that will be displayed. This plot exists but only accounted for vaguely. It is a matter of Monga that is collected in the explosion book, 'Comics underground Japan', and it is a true captioned dialogue that explains the plot more and more here. If you like it, then I propose to test the volume, because it explains some of the "plot" of the film, which is otherwise ineligible. According to the animation it is quite decent, unreasonable use of computer and images are well understood in most cases. It races in and out in episodes, such as the letters, cats, and the dead older sister cat of her brain roaming in and out of a series of weird pictures: a boat, a circus, a desert. For just half an hour, they crossed several semi-plots and settings, which I believe the Director preferred to adapt to a number of long-term issues, but the premiere was apparently elected. Knowing what is going on can be a bit of grateful appreciation. This reminds me of most of the MTV shows, cartoon sushi, which shows the characteristics of a cat that chases a cat around the house, chasing powders and cheeks. Only in this case the cats are more like the Hello Kitty and their courage has been expanded to include death and resurrection and many other themes [even though it is not easy to say]. There is DVD's DVD commentary and "create" features, but I can not comment on them because I could not turn to them. I'm giving an 8/10 for this, there's not much to compare here, and I hope more like this.
