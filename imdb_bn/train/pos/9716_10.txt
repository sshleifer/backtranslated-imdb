D) To fully enjoy the movie, you must love women like Curstranted Donost, which is very natural, sweet and immoral. E) You will appreciate a little annoying person with a creative, great and extraordinary personality <br /> <br /> If you meet these requirements, you can rate this movie at around 10 points. <br /> <br /> I do not laugh at watching this best composition as half (!).
