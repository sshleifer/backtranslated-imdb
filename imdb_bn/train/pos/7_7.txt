Although I did not think of Stanley and Iris as extravagant as the film, I appreciate acting. Jane Fanda and Robert De Niro have a great role in this movie. I'm not always a fan of Fondara's work, but here she is fine and strong at the same time. De Niro has the ability to make every role played in gold. He has given a fantastic performance in this movie and there is a wonderful scene where he will have to take his father home for the elderly because he can not take care of him anymore, which will break your heart. I really would not recommend this movie as a great cinematic entertainment, but I would say that you will not see many bits acting in any place.
