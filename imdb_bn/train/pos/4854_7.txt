Curl up with this in a dark and windy night and alternately amused, prepared to bothered and scared. The Crakki old plot may be impossible about a phantom train that is believed to be run through the only English village of night, but it is very interesting. Some people in the locality may have some wonderful old cloves like "surprising" but they will not talk. But the film is basically a car to showcase its special brand Vaudville style humor among the horrific bits of comedian Arthur Aski. Askey's curly humor is not very common these days but if you let it wash on you it may be fun. This is probably the best of Askey's movie.
