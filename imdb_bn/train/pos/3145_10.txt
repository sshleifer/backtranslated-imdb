The 70s show is the best TV show, sometimes. It's with Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live, and The Simpsons in my book. That continued to continue for the 70s show 8 seasons, all teenagers / young adults behave with a relationship, separate from adults, and focus around a group of their overall futures. <br /> <br /> Two main characters, Eric and Donna, are living together beside each other. They are living next to each other for most of the life, and at the beginning of the first season, each other started feeling more. Moving around the way their relationship is going on in huge amounts of show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The key is just the opposite. Although he drinks a lot, he takes care of Eric and his friends. Bob, his neighbor, probably Dona's father. Bob runs around a number of different women in the cover of the show's story. Bob also bothered red to his full extent. <br /> <br /> The remaining characters, Hyde, Kelso, Fez, and Jackie, Eric's friends. They play a major role in the show's story. <br /> <br /> Well, the first season is great. These characters begin to think of new things for each other. The first season is real, fun, and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, though it is not as good as the first. It is a basic series first. Eric and Dona together, and everything works great. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. It went back and captured the feelings of the first season and humor. I think that character enhances a bunch of chemistry, show that fun is all fun <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not as good as near. Erie and Donna are not together this together, the show is a little less fun. It's still funny, though I did not enjoy it as the previous season. <br /> <br /> the last season of the fifth season I enjoyed all. It's the senior years of the gang, so really helps with the story. The fifth season was also the best end of all seasons. <br /> <br /> Sixth episode is good for most parts. This is very interesting, although it does not feel that other seasons feel. The gang is out of high school, so I believe that it did not hurt teenagers, the previous seasons. I did not like the last three or four episodes that they had a big dramatic feeling. <br /> <br /> The same sentiment was noticed in the seventh season that there was a way in the 5th season, though it did not have all the way it happened. I enjoyed Seven Seasons just as I did to everyone else, and the end is great. <br /> <br /> Flat in the last season. Eric was not, which it destroyed. In most cases Kells did not help, which did not help. Until the last episode I hate the eight seasons. I was really good at the last episode, and a perfect finish for the series. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you enjoy the comedy then try to show it to 70s. They have stopped making new episodes, but it's still on TV. I recommend buying season 1-7. If you want to buy Session 8, it depends on you.
