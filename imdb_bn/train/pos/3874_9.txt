And I absolutely worship Blais !!! He was so beautiful in this movie, and "Quebec-Montreal" was far from his role, where he was like a man-voter. I think he should be nominated for a shoe. I mean, Civil Mourou was good, but Isabella is much better, IMO. Pel√©ieri had done fine for her first time, and I saw that she was in Rock A Belle Orleales, Ga. Leopa and Andrea have stuck in some of her friends. They had fun watching it, I do not know that they will be present. <br /> <br /> I do not think I saw the romantic comedy of Cubes which I did not like, and this one was as good as I had the pleasure to see. And if you are in the state and wondering how you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca has supplied it to me in less than a week.
