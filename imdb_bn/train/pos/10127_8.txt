This was all started! Imagine, it's not the best of friends, but it was a pilot, it should not be forgotten and it's not too bad. We launched the gang and Central Park, where our story begins. Even from this first episode, we've got a sign of Ross-Rachel's relationship that will come in the next ten years, when Ross says: 'I want to get married again' and there is a storm with Rachel's wedding dress ... Perhaps the authors were going for Monika-Joe's relationship, deliberately It was not, but looking back, now fits nicely. Other things .. In this episode, Rachel has got acquainted with Chadler as never before seen, but in the later stages, the so-called 'Flashbacks' match with these three previous events. However, the point is a fine start at a great show. This episode can not be a normal friend, but if we cast them with mere inexperienced, in the next few episodes we see why this event was! Keep watching, the first season is an explosion !!
