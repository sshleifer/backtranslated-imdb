I've seen this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival, and enjoyed it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Great writing and direction, excellent and trustworthy interaction and good comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie touches the themes of universal family and separation. As a result, I find all the similarities of European, Asian and American visitors meeting this film and their own life. <br /> <br /> If this is not enough, it may be the best underground movie of the year ... anyone distributes it to the US, <br /> <br /> Finally: Thank you for Maria Flome! It's really a great film.
