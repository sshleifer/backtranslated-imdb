This plot does not begin to describe the film: A man is writing a movie, or rather * this * movie. It's completely self-recognizable which you think it's going to fold itself like a black hole. The author wrote something and it happened, or something happened and wrote about it. <br /> <br /> This is very philosophical, like "life of awakening" but more zen and in that case, my opinion is much better. There are individual-on-the-street interviews at one point and then you are watching these people's shots and then you discover that their responses are scribbled when someone shakes their lines. There are beautiful scenery and optical illusion. <br /> <br /> I hope it comes to the DVD so I can again see it again. See in Sinquest (San Jose, CA Film Festival) on 25/25/2002.
