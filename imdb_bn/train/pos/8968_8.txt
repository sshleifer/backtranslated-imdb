This movie is a Jimmy Stewart film, scavenger, charming and very enjoyable. Kim Novak has been acting as Gillian, who is a beautiful man, a strong man, his facial expression, his every step and gesture, all of Giliano's unique and somewhat hunting character, he hanged on each of our words. I would not be able to mention the highly acclaimed performance of Archie Kovacs and Elsa Lancaster, because the sketch would be arousing the writer's magic magician (Quax) and later as a loving aunt, the romantic scenes between Stevere and Novak are done nicely and chemistry is fine, but again Jimmy Stewart And between a leading lady The chemistry does not seem to be worse off if you use magic!
