I'm surprised that someone still mentions two versions of this same movie. The lion's footage is similar in both, but here it is different: here in a version (version that I have seen on most broadcast TVs), the elite group "Protecting Brotherhood", a "imaginary" splinter group and "excommunicated" brothers group by church to defend the gateway . In another version, which I saw only on TV, the gateway defender cleanses are portrayed as the official church priest, which means New York's Arkadocosis (or perhaps Brooklyn). Also, in the previous version, in most relevant scenes, clerical is referred to as "brother" (and in some scenes, you can see where the lips are called "father" and the dubbed audio is "brothers" and so on. In the next version, I believe Let's say that everyone is referred to as "Father." In any event, it seems that one of these two versions is partial or partial " Rudderhud "parents again shot again like" Arcadocosis "scenes or opposite pictures (I would like to remind Raymond Burr's cutaway scenes of" Godzilla ".) I have uploaded the video both of the TV broadcasting version, so no, I imagine this No one can spread more light on the story behind these two versions of this film?
