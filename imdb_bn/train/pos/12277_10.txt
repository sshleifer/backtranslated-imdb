Perhaps the best Isabel Aland's book, The House of the Spirits, describes an alternative Chilean history, it is full of magic, a mysterious screen, and a bit of universal sadness. This movie is a great cast with such a script, plus a great art direction that can not contain the quality of this book. It's great for almost unknown people like Chile, which is very well represented by this movie, which should probably only look at the higher level of sin, and as a result the illiterate public has been annoyed, because they rarely understood.
