In my honest view, everyone will see this movie at least once. I've seen it really keep things in perspective of it. Although it was fictional, this movie is something that can happen to your kids. <br /> <br /> It shows how easily two kids hide their hatred and plans to kill innocent students in their school. This film will not work in any other format. They pulled the handheld camera completely. <br /> <br /> It reminds us of April 20, 1999, when Eris Harris and Dylan Klebold kill 12 students and then kill themselves. This followed by the media storm reminds us to follow. Everyone wanted to see Rampert's video and everyone wanted to see basement tape. <br /> <br /> This movie is a mythical version of the dream coming true. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If it was a preview of a single blockbuster movie, then everyone went to see a big deal on Zero Day. . <br /> <br /> I believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting that has really tried it a few. Shooting takes only one and a half minutes, about one and a half minutes, because it mostly focuses on Cal and Andre and what they did at that point. <br /> <br /> If you still do not meet this movie, rent it, and watch it. I guarantee that when it is finished you will be stupid.
