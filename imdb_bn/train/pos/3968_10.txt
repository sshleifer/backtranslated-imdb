I first saw this picture as a small boy and recently bought it in DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stuart Chip Hardesty, who came with a deeper depth in the role of a hard-working and dedicated FBI agent. His life in the bureau is interactive with his family life, which is not all pink. His wife (an excellent screenplay from Vera Mile) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job, and they are also separated for some time; Chip's best friend and colleague Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) was killed in a gunfight; Chip's son, Mike, is listed in the Miren during World War II. Through this, the family carries with courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> Action sequence is quite exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. And Max Steiner's music says it all; Faith, Courage and Integrity <br /> <br /> This country carries a great debt of gratitude to the FBI men and women and yes, J. Edgar Hoover too. If Mr. Hoover's caution is taken, then we could have increased the crime against 9/11, children and abandon many harmful politicians, which were kept from our passports.
