Normally I do not like all of the series. They are all predictable and they become very annoying and very slowly. <br /> <br /> This series, though played well, follows the story through all episodes and if you miss, the story will still continue. <br /> <br /> These episodes represent everyone in the hospital and the dark and old secret mysteries In between you go further and furthermore, which is located just below the powerful hospital surface.
