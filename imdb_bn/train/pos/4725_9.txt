Despite the lack of logic in the story, Kill Shot is a very enjoyable movie. Through an ongoing performance, Caspar Van Deane illustrate the emotional conflict between a hard-working rich father and his confused son. Supporting cast is bright by each member's strong performance, by the bright acting of a young Asian man, whose name I can not remember. A sudden tragic ending can disturb some young viewers, but the murder shot completely delivers a death blow.
