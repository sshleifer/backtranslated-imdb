The movie is ok, its moments, music scenes are the best! Soundtrack is a true classic. It's a perfect album, it starts with Let's C Crazyie (initially as a great party song and very up-tempo), Take Me We We Wish You (a funny pop song ...), The Beautiful Public (a The ridiculous Ballad, probably the closest thing to R & B in this entire album), Computer Blue (some angry songs to Apollonia), Darling Nikki (sometimes it's very unlike most funny songs) Definitely fun about Apollonia), when Dove Cree (Climax) is the best compilation, I want to be 4 years old, I'm a star, and, of course, purple rain (a true classic, very suitable last for this classic album) movies and albums Both are very good I highly recommend them!
