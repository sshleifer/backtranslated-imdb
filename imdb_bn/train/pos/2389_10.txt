I work with children from 0 ?? 6 years old and they all love doodlopp Doodlebops are energetic, vibrant and interesting. Once they start singing, "we doodlopos we do not have a doodlab as we have doodlabs oh yes yes and join the fun because we are laughing and we are singing all day" is almost impossible to join the dodlobes viewer with color and fun Comes to the world. Every show is an adventure, doodlobes do not try to change the world with their promoted messages, which they make fun while adjusting daily life challenges. Doodlebops is a refreshing, high action alternative for regular children's television programs.
