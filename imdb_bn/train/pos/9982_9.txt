I saw this movie last night after waiting for age and age to get here in Canada (still limited release). It was awaiting and then there was some value. I was a very warm reader of Margaret Lawrence and I was excited to see this novel transformed into a movie. I actually like movies better than novels. I like that the character of the Bram Shipley was a little rigid, and there seemed to be more stories of love between Hogwar and Bram, which was making visible at the end of Bram's life which was going on more and more. The damage seems strong. Hagar was not more favorite than the film, but Alan Bartin was a genius in this role. He was through and through Hagar. Christine Horne was brilliant and I have many more great things to make sure. His scenes with the Coal Hauser were the electricalization. I could go, 9 * out * 9 * in full, and can not wait to get out of the DVD, it's definitely my own collection!
