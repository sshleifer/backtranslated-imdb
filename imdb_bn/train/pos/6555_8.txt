I have read over 100 NANSI DRUO books, and if you are not yet interesting enough, this film is about NANSI Drew's young Nancy Drew, not 18 years old, who does not go to school or book. This was when he was sixteen years old. So naturally, considering it as the 10th grade, it will not be as smart as the book itself. More than that, I thought the movie was very beautiful. It was clean and suitable for everyone. It was fun at times. I think Emma Roberts has done a great job. She was clear between character, and cute. I like Nancy and Ned's curiosity surrounding each other because they probably were not old enough to have a serious relationship with them in books. It was a tricky, PG movie that I enjoyed quite a lot because I enjoyed movies without my age, like most people, sex, drugs, or superstition.
