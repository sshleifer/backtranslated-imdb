All right, I've seen the preview of this movie and wondered, what are the producers thinking? Hutton, Jolie, and Dukovani? How could the accumulated actor possibly compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, there were both chemistry that showed intense care without a kiss. Even David's smiling Jolie's spark and fire match. As Huton, he played psychology well, David's life was in conflict with peace. Overall, I was very impressed with writing and character development. I gave it 8 stars.
