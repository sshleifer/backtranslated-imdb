For people in real movies, this movie is a must, because it works as a perfect little paradox for movies. Johns Rook / Boris Karloff's science must be associated with discussions and discussions from cosmic events. This may damage the light, or it can be harnessed to do well. On the one hand it makes its soil blind, on the other hand it is used to heal blindness ("I can see!" Cried a young woman whose eyes are published in this light). When Rukh / Karloff himself is poisoned by the dark energy of this light, we see that the person we see is actually a projection. The entity can be seen in the film (visible only as a movie theater, when the lights are out). <br /> <br /> At the beginning, there is a wonderful way in which Karloff / Rukh explains his study that the information is still being reported that the Earth was still molten rock at a time when the endromider was coming out of the light, then rolls through space for millions of years It was all that happened. <br /> <br /> This new science is mentioned in the old cultural activities as well as the mention of the film: among the writers, Bulla Bondi / Arbella Stevens personality; And the symbol in the statue of religion, the local cathedral carl explosion sculpture with its projector / siege gun. <br /> <br /> <br /> To see if this image was happening in Germany, and especially in the years before using Rifenstall's film, to promote such a government, if it does, to do a lot of damage: Will Triumph <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Suddenly interrupting the mother (Violet Kimble Cooper), the first rule of science reminds Johns Rukh. <br /> <br /> If only more movies are made, then you want to stand in the theater and scream: "I can see!"
