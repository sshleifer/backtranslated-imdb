I saw almost every review of this movie was quite bad. It's not quite bad, although it's not quite cool, though it's pretty good. Judy Garland's character may become boring, but she did not allow it. Nowhere along the line, at least 40 of the first, Van Hefflen became a fan overroaring, brooding, overbearing. Judy singing is great, but the film missed a great opportunity by showing more of their relationship. I gave it a 7.
