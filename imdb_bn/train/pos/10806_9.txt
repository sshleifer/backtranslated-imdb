I felt this film - Sara. I am fascinated with Russel Crowe's progression of his relationship with Lily, as a soft mixed mixture of soft gently slowly, slightly less humiliating and very stable Truly cinematography and choice of direction. Pace was just fine and almost all the characters painters were impressive. <br /> <br /> Gosh, Russell's talent was not even in 1993! .. and I still have to see the gladiator.
