Remember these two stories memorable and set the first in a distant future, we are preparing a young boy for the exam day, state i.q test. The boy was somewhat surprised by his parents' concerns because some of his friends have already done it and eventually went to the exam. Reaching he is given an injection and why as enthusiastic. The tester laughs and tells him that he is telling the truth to be sure. The son then asked, why did he become crazy again? Later on, when the parents are anxiously waiting for the screen and announce the message, their son's IEK Layers are more than the national range and they ask with pleasure that they would like a personal grave. A finishing scene is a rude! A message from charity was the story of warming a heart about a girl from the past and the emotional connection between a man from the present. Which pans out into the strange story of past magical accusations and delving into history pages. An excellent story with an impressive conclusion.
