I love this show. I have seen everybody that every day I have seen them every six times. <br /> <br /> It is about two sisters, Holi (Amanda Bains) and Wall (Jenny Garth), who is in New York. When Halley was transferred to Japan, her mother went to live with Val. Val has a perfect life, he has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment next to the high eastern side. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems through Vall and Holly. The main problem is boys, but also responsible and other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holly 16 and the total free spirit, although the whale is completely opposite. He has plans for any kind of person organized. <br /> <br /> Another character is Henry, Vince, Gary, Loren and Tina.
