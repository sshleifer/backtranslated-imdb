After all, I do not understand why some people think this film is anti-American. Of course, there is time to be directly accused of the United States, such as Yusuf Chahain, Kya Loupe and some like Mir Nayr. But let's not fake it; Instead, they confirm this example based on real and documented information and all the documents released by Chile. <br /> <br /> But to come back to the film, which I have enjoyed most is that we find it in different moods. We are being educated about respecting the death of children who died in the event; We will find an unhappy couple that will be changed by that tragedy; We find the common people to reduce their feelings in the shades of September 11 and respond differently to dignity or despair; We find someone in the movie for which the collapse of the tower is the real ground for a happy moment. <br /> <br /> All these philosophies and others - strong or consistent as this or more - combine and help to show a glimpse of how many people have spread around the world to the viewer in response to the September 11 episode. So, what we see is the panorama that is more complex than white and black, and it can make some people mad; But in this world where we live, there is no place for human ideology, regardless of which President or priest can tell us. Finally, I do not feel ashamed that there is not even a date for the release of this film in America. This is shameful because most American people are asking why this disaster is taking place, and this movie can give them some sources. This movie expresses very clearly - some people in this forum think differently - what we do today will determine our future, and the past mistakes will affect how we live today.
