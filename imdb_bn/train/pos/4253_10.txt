Really nice movie, I saw the best one. Touch and easy - like life, sometimes you cry sometimes you smile and it's just beautiful. Not so much, just as it seems. The idea of ​​the film really loved, no one was bad or good, all or just people, sometimes due to pressure of society, everyone tries to stay strong and some are more successful than others, and most importantly, you have no reason to be angry - you It can do, but eventually the anger goes away and then you will come back to love even though it is hard, real happiness. <br /> <br /> Great actors and acting <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .
