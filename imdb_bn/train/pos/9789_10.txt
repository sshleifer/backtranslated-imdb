The story is being said fluently. There is no obstacle. Flash backs are seamlessly woven into the current. Casting was fantastic. Ya Yara looked very much like Yara saw her age. His illustration of a blind person is done firmly. Director Daniel Siracin did a fantastic job of getting various actors to work together in this story. Cinematography is very good. You think you are walking along the sea from the edge of Yaarara and Talia hills. English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very closely. It is interesting to keep in mind that "out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Limerit Iain", but both names are very suitable for the story.
