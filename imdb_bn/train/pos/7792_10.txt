Hollywood (and others) that is going out of the sea of ​​Craf, it is one of the diamonds. A small, simple movie that is very entertaining and you feel that you are not wasting just one and a half hours of your life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ashley Jude is really nice in this picture. I have never been a fan or have noticed before, but I am going back and seeing his initial performance, I am sure he is very talented. <br /> <br /> This movie was an appointment for me in a college course. I suspect I would even care about. I thought, "Oh boy, some stupid lip blows or feminine men batch Indie Breff ..." I was glad. Without much relevant theme analysis, I would simply say, if you do not see it, then do yourself good and test it. Sometimes down-to-earth, slice-of-life movies are the best, and it's a great one.
