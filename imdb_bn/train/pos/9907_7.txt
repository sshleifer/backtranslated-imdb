"Slaughter High" Probably, the most partial slasher flick of the 1980s. This is one of the series which is excited for a lifetime. It is said that it relies heavily on standard slash sources: a group of men and women killed one after another until the final showdown. <br /> <br /> Why "Slaughter High" stands at the highest level, its successive movie goes on top-up. Marty, the killer, have a good reason to keep angry against his former classmates. The girl locked her in the locker room of the locker room, seized her with a jelly, seized it, and stopped it, her science lab examined so that she could detach her. <br /> <br /> So, the victims of this movie can get as unlikely as you can. When they reconcile a few years later - Marty herself began to reconcile high school - you realized she was not so mature. They are a bunch of paganities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And who would think that the beer and alcohol in the building on the bed are old lockers - as well as Marty's exhibition? The viewer has lots of faith in this movie to enjoy. The last little or no sense makes sense. And the screen authors have a weird understanding about how the April Fools' Day works: The film claims that noon is not allowed anymore after noon. Finally, the film is one of the best examples of slash, despite all its flaws. It is difficult to understand why it is still not available in DVDs, while many more run-off-mill slash flickers are associated with a special edition.
