There is a problem with the presentation of this film, even those who are looking for a temporary and cultural loyalty can be objectionable, but it challenges the viewers to reflect on different topics. One of the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another Bible and the historical nature of faith is that. And third, Jesus' humanity. The excitement of Christ's treacherous relationship was developed and held through film. Jude's emotions are presented as a dark parallel to Christ. When Judas takes his life, the audience can rush. Peter's denial and crime, however, moving, is not strongly impressed as Judah's plays. Chris Sarandon proposes a novel and provocative Christ, whether credible or not. I want to read this movie in DVD or even VHS, to use in studies or discussion groups.
