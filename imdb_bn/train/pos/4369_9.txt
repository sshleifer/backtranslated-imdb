I like this movie. The scene was exciting, the plot had some nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. But in the two front, "Rob Roy" scored more than roughly. First of all, I rarely saw the "popular" movie where the quality of the dialogue was so much. Brightly there were many oral slashes and scolding with the dancer's sword. I could give many examples, but why? Just watch the movie. Second, the film understands a policy that rarely admits. To succeed in a drama, it only requires a hero, but needs a really credible villain. If you do not have any, there is no pleasure in routing for good son. And one of the "Rob Roy", not three - Earl of Montros, its Henschen Kiln and Archie. Not one dimensional villain is, but completely fleshed and very nasty. It may be more patient than "brahheart" - there is more dialogue, and pronouncements are a bit harder, but it is even more clever and subtle pieces. (Like I said, I love this movie!)
