I have always believed that David and Bathsheba were originally a film produced for the 20th Century Fox tiren, although Gregory Pack gave himself a good account as King King David with a terrible eye. <br /> <br /> Many of the biblical topics covered in this film, adultery, liberation, sin, punishment and what usually they expect from their followers are covered. <br /> <br /> When you become a king, even in the Bible prophecy, the reign of King you certainly have many perogatives open for our rest. David, the daughter of David's predecessor Saul, is a really poor King David, who has many wives. But his eyes could see Bathsheba in his garden on one evening. David married Hitti unexpectedly with Uriah as a couple of women. Uriah is one of David's commanders. David has sent Bathsheba and he is the king, he has come to Rennenin because he has also kept an eye on him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What happened, a matter for Uriah, a pregnancy, and carefully arranged death. War. But for all to see and to know, the gods have been caught and punished not only David and Bathsheba, but the entire kingdom of Israel is punished with drought, disease and epidemics. <br /> <br /> The day calls Batashiba to throw stones. David shows the weakness of his previous actions, but here he steps up the plate and asks that the whole thing put on him. He even placed his hand on the chest of the film, which is seen in the movie instant death. <br /> <br /> My explanation is that God is wrong and even leaves David, and both of them forgive them. Bathsheba became Solomon's mother, and she and David were the ancestors of several heirs of Israel and Judah divided kingdom, until they both were victorious. <br /> <br /> Susan Heard was caught in a lonely marriage. Uriya played with Kiran Moore. The only thing waking up Moore is a good fight. I like Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse behind. <br /> <br /> No one can take away the law like Raymond Messi. He played two films with his character Nathan John John Brown, the same intensity. <br /> <br /> So when his own laws were called for death, why did God leave Bathsheba and put David on the throne? Maybe he did not want to train a third person for his job. He will already replace Saul with David. But I think the Christian interpretation may be that it was an indication of the arrival of the New Testament, anyone who sins and receives repentance if someone asks for it. I will leave it to explain to Bible scholars. Look at the movie <br /> <br /> and you can come up with a whole new theory.
