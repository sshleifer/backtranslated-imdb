I just saw Hot Million at TCM and I totally forgot this gem. Ustinov creates a tricky and divisive plot which makes him shy of the two dot people is impressive from ... well you'll see. Maggie Smith is a left-wing secretary / perfect neighbor, who has spent a hard time maintaining a job but this photo has a warm and vibrant personality. He is a warm, malicious and real person who runs a long ... well ... <br /> <br /> The role of Balal as the top officials of Molden and Newhart To take the challenge. And let them come out in a ridiculous life. <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Sisera Romero are very happy to see and I know at least in the field of Romero, Ustinov is working to increase his hand. <br /> <br /> This picture is meant to be a shot in the growing computer age, and for this there is a problem for the average man or man, but in fact the characters are so involved and it is much fun to see. Computer sub plot is almost lost ... I almost say. <br /> <br /> Reduce the usual expectations of your modern comedy and look for great performance and friendly, forgiving and deeply involved plot in this movie.
