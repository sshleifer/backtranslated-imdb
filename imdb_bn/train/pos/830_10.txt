I'm not going to expect much in the film, but I was pretty impressive. Pierce Brosnan is a very different role outstanding. She has dumped the slick arrogance suit for a ridiculous look and she shows off showing a nice actor. Pierce and Greg Kieyner play each other well, and in the long run, they create better friends. Humorous Darkness, Brosnan, Kinnar and Hope Davis performs well, blend with sensitive elements in the story of friendship and you have a great movie. It's probably one of the best friends comedy in a long time. This is a film that clearly shows that we can expect something amazing in the post-bond era of Brosnan's career.
