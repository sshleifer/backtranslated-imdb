It is the most compulsory and excellent performance that Robert Taylor has ever given. It even exceeded its amazing performance as "Johnny Ezer", which is coming 14 years after the film is complete. His appearance is still a wonderful sight to see, but now he has a maturity which gives him the edge in this great, violent role. Charlie Gilsson (Taylor) is the last of his lineage, a beggar hunter who is not killed for money but for pleasure. His wild eyes are not just torches, but people are stunning to see. He is essentially a lonely man, people around him, but they hate him because of social behavior. His partner, Sandie McKenzie (Stuart Granger), who is sick of the victim, and only goes alongside, because he fails to do anything else. Along with the way Charlie murders a family of Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her for any benefit, but Sandy shows that she is interested in her. Granger was very sad to see, so she wanted to take the girl and her baby, so he got excited with the hunt. Lloyd Nolan as drunk sniper is surprisingly with playing her wise crack and accordian. Russ Tamblyn plays half-reproduction trying to fit a white world. The group is an odd mixture of good and evil, young and old. In the end, Taylor gets spooked by torch, had many hunters before, and ran off with Sandy to leave the girl. After her return, she kept Sandy's page with that woman, shot Charlie on the attempt to find Sandy, and kept the girl for herself. The final clash comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so frustrating that you will not forget it. It's all the way Taylor's film and he was really a much underrated actor of the era.
