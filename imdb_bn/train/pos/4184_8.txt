Some war movies are successful where others do not, and it can be judged from different angles. The human aspect, where you can feel the raw emotion (the attack of attack attacks, the army in the soldiers, when people face them in the fight, etc.) Always think of movies I'm compulsory. Two examples of movies like Dasha Boot and Midnight Clear are two examples of movies that you feel connected to the film characters. <br /> <br /> This movie is also successful at that stage. It speaks "highest honor" and that respect is doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they had respect and were fully recognized with Western dissonance, but it was ultimately a true story of honor. Unforgettable movies Based on the true story.
