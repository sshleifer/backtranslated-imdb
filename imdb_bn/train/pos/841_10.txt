I found this a deeply amusing dark comedy. Since Bronjan is gifted someone will no longer testify, he is not pigeonholed in the role of bond. The role as Kinnear could have been as workflow and fun. I do not know that during the course of a movie I was laughing hard! What an unpleasant pleasure! My favorite line 'After leaving the Navy, I feel like a Bangkok hookah.' Brozen delivered this very non-bond line with this unexpected comedic mood. I was very impressed with the performance of Hope Davis. It seems that everyone in this movie has been promoted from their previous work to a degree that has actually improved the comedy. If you like the dark and ridiculous 'weatherman', you certainly would like it. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
