I do not usually like the reality show, especially those who stop the success of "American Idol". But this one I can stay with. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < . Then ten or twelve comics were selected to live in the house together and use "Comic" techniques to make "Survivor" style contests. Then one will be set as the "latest comic standings". I like the comedy stand up, so displaying this one reality must be interested in my interests. There are some fantastic fun comics usually selected. It started the career of Algonso Boden, Ralphie May, and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative reviews are that these comedies have been selected for their contribution in reality. Drama display First they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now they have worked with them, thank God. <br /> <br /> And many comedians I felt, not because of being elected. They are funny, but due to race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, etc., other comics clearly beat them. But overall, it's a well-established reality show, which till now has two terms, I think it was an oximon.
