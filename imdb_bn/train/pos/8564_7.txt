I hope this movie is not well understood by the audience from Romania. It certainly says something about the price, or perhaps the lack of universality of the film, but in Eastern Europe than in other countries, there is a general history of Romania and some even about the life of ordinary people. <br /> <br /> Controversial novelist Marin Preda, adapted to a novel, who died during the Communist regime, shortly after it was published. At the end of the Stalinist era, an intellectual of Philosophy, to tell him the story of the story of being freed from prison after being sentenced for a false accusation. Basically, the first part of the film tells the story of his survival in prison, the second describes his recovery after his liberation. The issue of his release is very clear, 60-year-old Romanians ask him about different types of conflicts and crime, but still surviving his fight is morally tough as the prison. <br /> <br /> This film has played some of the best Romanian actors. Stephen Edward's leadership role will be another time and the other place will be a mega star, we can get a good glimpse of his excellent acting industry here. While refraining from a confused story and sometimes falling in non-essential detail or character comics, the film plays an important role in Romanian films and is still important for the process of restoring moral and historical values ​​in Roman society.
