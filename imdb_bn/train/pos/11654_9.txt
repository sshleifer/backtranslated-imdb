I agree with the above comment, I love this kind of reality, and in many movies (not just sick eating movies) the producer may forget about it. They take a problem every day and create a very dramatic scene and then the end of the movie is perfect again, which I dislike because it is not reality. Things might not be better, and this movie does not mean to say things, but it does not spend most of the movie making these problems, and the film's ending is perfect again. . People do not recognize and do not want to do good when people are sick, and then life takes life, takes time, and I like how we grow up with characters in this movie, we can go through problems with them, good and bad , Because it is a very important part of the movie. It gets into the minds of the harmful people of the disease and shows complexity and pain, it is a very realistic way and I like it. I love what it looks like, unhygienic and betrayal when people suffer from illness, it seems that when they recognize it, it is frightening to see how people react. I was very touched in this movie and said beautiful and well, and defiantly one of my favorites.
