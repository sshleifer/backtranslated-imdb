One must acknowledge, Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. She played the role of a successful model Janet Aman, and the former winner of the beautiful patron title, which was made for her debut. Her neighbors, rocky faces, and passionate musicians, in her love, made an instant darling of the audience. This film is an eye-catching look, its scenic landscape, ethnic people, the Buddha Temple, and the Sticky, Naughty Mumtaz, who look very attractive among its ethnicity, and dance skills. Dev certainly, adorable, and this is one of his commercially successful performance. Rama managed to move towards interest, it's a carefully written script, editing, and fun music. Like Des Pardes, another movie, Ananda Dodakashanti, has led the youths in the habit of habit, and their invented families are coming from disturbed family and problem-styled childhood. A good entertainer, this movie keeps up to date!
