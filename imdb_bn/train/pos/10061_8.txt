One of the most heart-rending foreign films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The young girl is a wonderful talent. Performance of stars by his (doggie), old man (king of mask), and Liang (living Boddhisatva). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) Unhealthy treatment of children, especially female boring. <Br> <br /> Love music. The original Chinese dialogue enhances performance and psychological intensity of the story. <br /> <br /> It must be seen - enjoyable family films, though not very young children. The DVD release has been rated more and the transfer includes the WideScreen version if the soundtrack is moved much better to the DVD.
