At the end of the week, I met my 10-year-old girl and watched herself completely. First off, it was clear, and I mean by my standard. Most of the kids' films today are crude toilet humor and fair jokes to get cheerful cheer from pre-teenage crowds. Nancy Dru is smarter than that, and humor is fine and clever. <br /> <br /> The title role is played with the impression by Emma Roberts, who is never boring and perky and courteous. Unlike Brady Bach movie, where the narrative characters are disgusting and ridiculed, Nancy's childhood is treated with respect and dignity. This is a great moment when Paris Hilton Streetwear 's "Style-aware" girls' clothing is dismissed by the booty owner, when Nancy is hugging her penny ruffer and home-made boutric pattern dress. This movie accepts many Hollywood movies of our need-illuminated-these-healthy girls. Nancy remains true to herself and her values ​​<br /> <br /> <br /> This mystery is busy enough to get attracted occasionally. There were a number of suspicious moments, where my daughter kept my hand firmly, but there was no surprise in the eyes. It's all based on tension and mood and a lot of fun. Supporting cast is good, especially as Marshall Bell's obscure caretaker. Eddie Jameson, Chris Katan and Bruce Willis have some great quotes and many moments that adults may laugh. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good rating for some people. I was just not happy to be dragged into another computer animated film where animals can be talked about and gas sent across all the places, but I was also very modest. If I used to live without the child, I would still enjoy the movie. This is a DVD which will be the name of my daughter under the Christmas tree.
