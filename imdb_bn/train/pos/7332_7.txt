I saw the snippet as a small child from this, but when I bought the blue underground set immediately because of the limited edition, I only fit it on my viewing schedule - and this is mainly because Bakhshi's American POP (1981) has just finished late on Italian On TV (see my review of that photo below)! However, I have seen the film have a very good sword-and-grandfather animated epic, especially with impressive-described backdrops (rather than the unwanted rotation characters, fewer) scores. The plot was not original again, but it was proven to be fully involved in the young stage and with the main characters - especially the attractive sculpture Ice-Lord Negro and mysterious combatant Dark Wolff; But the hero and heroine, rather flexible tendencies - but some may rarely complain when Bakhshi and Frazzeta acted well (her bra could break a second) and half naked to boot (her little pants forever disappeared her ass)! Despite this, it is clearly an action-based piece and it certainly supplies at the front (which seems to be particularly barbaric). Although the short final ceremony is operated very well and our Hero Austrade Pterodactyl attacks villain's layer inside a cave. <br /> <br /> In addition to the previous major fraternities backdrops, the main appeal is to me this movie as my nostalgia factor, in my childhood days, it was my childhood days in Conan the Barbarian (1982) and The Bestmaster (1982), even the Blaster (1981-82) Coming back to me for watching animated TV series come back. And the Master of Human and Universe (1983-85). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Fire and Ice" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the live-action performance (in the studio) in the studio Examples of examples - which will later be mixed and illustrated in the background. Still, in the animation industry (such as Disney Tins and Lonnie Tune sets) saw many behind-the-scenes features, it does not create a very interesting piece ...
