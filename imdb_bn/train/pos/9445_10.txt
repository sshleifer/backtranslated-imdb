It's one of the best movies I've ever seen without any doubt. For the first time I saw I was about 9 or 10 years old. I saw a few minutes before the rape scene. And when I saw it, I was really surprised "What is this kind of sick film?" I have seen this from the beginning and have really realized how wonderful this movie really is. It's exciting, scary, disgusting and annoying its own unique way. But the best thing about it is that the audience has been shown that this experience will lose letters for the rest of their lives. It will torture their conscience and they will think about the rest of their life in the river. And they can not do anything about it, it will stay with them. This is one of the most unhappy ending in the history of the last film, and very smart, brighter and awkward <br /> <br /> And the performance is also great, especially John Voight and Burt Reynolds. This movie has a magnificent performance. After all, the movie based on the novel John Buorman Dick Cheney created one of the best movies throughout history. One must definitely watch for all movie lovers
