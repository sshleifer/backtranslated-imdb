I can not agree with the above comment - there are many interesting and truly amazing film imagery, it is an unusual structure, and it is running well on a horrible climatic sequence which is significant for the effective use of silence. What's more, it explores the strange desire of suicide in a very candid way, it does not interfere with what it shows, even though it does not make things realistic and very sensitive. There are documentaries about it and documentaries about the horror and art house movies, and deserve a place among the canons of 'different' horror films like The Blair Witch Project and the original ring (both of which it is an ancestry and it could be good). Unauthorized effects). It is definitely valuable if you are interested in horror movie edge.
