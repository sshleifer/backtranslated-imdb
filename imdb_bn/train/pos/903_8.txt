I can honestly say that I never expected the film to be good. I do not like family films. I am far away from Shahid Kapoor's fan. The director's last film (MPKDH was completely stupid, and the song was very annoying and delightful, but Amrita Rao was the one who became my favorite after me, but there was also Sameh Biswas, Alanknath and Anupam Kher who were very talented, so a few plus points <br /> <br /> I finally saw the movie and I was very impressed. He married us at HAHK, young lovers of MH The storyline is similar to HHC, which starts in critical mode at the beginning, the director also created the character that you can relate to. The thing that I do not like about HAHK, the letters are very bright. I am surprised by Kapoor's performance, it is a big improvement, and most importantly he plays the role Amrita Rao, in fact, is her best performance, her presence on the screen is so electrophifing, that you have played the role of Samir Soni, Amrita Prakash, Aapam khair, Alak Nath and Seema Biswas for her acting. An actor does not find the place. <br /> <br /> The songs were quite frustrating but they would look good after watching them. Muze Haq Haay and Do Ojjane unknown song is excellent. It's nice to see Milon Abi Abhadru Oh. The songs are not colorful and dancing, and they are more like ballads. Excerpt Hmari Shadi Maine, which reminds you of HSHH and HAHK. So what was the movie's fault? The movie gets quite slow, and the end is quite stretched. But the movie is still going well, making it a perfect family movie.
