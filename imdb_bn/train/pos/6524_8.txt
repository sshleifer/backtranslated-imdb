<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans / American history in the early 19th century, or Yule Brenner, watch this movie for yourself and make your own mind about it. Various lackluster reviews will not be closed by. It was my reaction that it was entertaining, well-played (mostly in part), there are quite a few dialogues in it, and this is a great act of private life, the charm, appeal and legendary attraction of Gene Laugh. Although not all the facts of the movie are historically accurate (although you have shown me a historical movie that is successful?), I think the film is the role of acting in the role of the movie in New Orleans' history and the correctness of her love. The hate relationship between New Orleans's "respectful" citizens and one of the most beloved sons of this criminal. Do not worry about what the film does, but see what it does, that is, see it for New Orleans and its America's most fascinating historical images.
