Often, films of this nature come across as a mixed bag of great works, including little wine to meet runtime. Whether it's the big name support or the project itself, Paris J t'aime never fall in this state. I believe I can honestly say that the whole film is better than its parts. In the series of wonderful changes and excellent finishing sequences, in the last one in Paris love combines the characters, I think that if any cog is deleted the film will be damaged. True, there are definitely some standouts that shade the rest, but in the end I have a permanent picture, even if there is a second in the short format. Love takes many forms, and here the genius is encouraged, through Sriram poems and the audience move through the elegance of many elements of the audience and move. <br /> <br /> Quartier des Enfants Rouges: Maggie Gyllenhaal Wonder as a drug parlor with parrot shooting actress and her dealer. <br /> <br /> The Quantum Latin: Ben Gazzar and Gena Rolands (reworked the relationship between old cassabat films?) The publication published in its conclusion makes you a bit unbalanced. Sharp wit and sarcasm as they meet for discussing their upcoming divorce. What their conversations are and really to make others angry, it's all enjoyable, leaving a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Guinard Chadha gives us a touchy picture of love. Beyond religious and ethnic differences. The sweet little story of shy love between the two, perhaps it is a connection feeling, but it is unable to sound too loud. <br /> <br /> I hope to be disappointed that Sylvania did not get an animated sequence together. However, this live action story of waxing love in the Paris prison, the same playful nature like her film Les Triplets de Belleville. <br /> <br /> Tourism: Coen brothers give their wonderful humor and some delicate smiles. Steve Buscemi is really saying a word and sells performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Sergio Castelito and Miranda Richardson face this couple with hardships and find out how strong the true love bond is. <br /> <br /> Perar-Laurage: A wonderful funny story from the awesome master Wes Kraveen. Little Oscar Wilde's humor may be associated with any relationship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Down the street Nick Nolt and Ludwig Saginia finally come to the close-up view, we find the true context of their "alleged love" conversation. <br /> <br /> Porte de Choisy: A very real look at Paris glamor. This is probably the most weird entry, but the play that will not move away from the madness that you get away from. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know whether there should be any results or happiness for Eliassa wood. Nice to silence the shots and silent blood vibrations, this is a little weird, but still love. <br /> <br /> 14th Expedition: Join this deeply to Alexander Pine's wonderful feeling. This voice-over story tells Paris of finding an American love. With his strict, uneducated French true utterances, there is a vague contrast, which we heard from this point? Only close clerk is funny enough and true to the truth. <br /> <br /> Montmart: An interesting role in the proceedings. Paris can be a city for daily activities like finding a parking spot, although love is found, but it will take any prisoner anywhere to continue the journey. <br /> <br /> Lon Dua 16 IM: Katalina Sandino Moreno brightly shows how love for a child is done by her subtle activity by singing to the young child, but each time it is completely different. <br /> <br /> Place Goddess Fetes: The bunch is my favorite story. Saidu Boro and Aisha Miyaga are just awesome. The shining nature of the story and how fortune brings two letters together so that Boro can finally ask her for coffee. Sometimes your final moments are enough to leave this world. <br /> <br /> One of the best stories about a mother trying to deal with her little boy's death is: Place des Victtoires. Juliet Binoch is devastating like a mother, frustrated for the last glimpse of her son, and Will Duffo is oddly perfect as a cowboy, who gives him the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Saint-Denis on Facebook: Sometimes it should be remembered that he does not like to take this relationship for full investment. Melchior Baslen reminded, trying to find out where he went, through a sharp sharp series, meet him with a nautical portman, and how much time he needs to "see" him. <br /> <br /> Van Sant often encounters some forms of tearing his films to show us a story about the time of contact and communication gap between us. His photographer at Elephant is a Paris based American who loves gasper oiled artists and is a catalyst for the relatives of the Rampal Sometimes there is no need to know what is being said to understand what is happening in the interval.
