Yes, promise. Let's say "Fever Pitch" it can joke you in the belief of a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> However, you will not have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this Persian Brotherhood film. But of course, if you are one, you will enjoy more; All references to Boston Red Sox and its Bittsweet History (quite right, I would say); Everything from Bamboo's damn and everything else, in which you can not speak in front of two Boston fans including: Bow Baker <br /> <br /> Dres Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon have illustrated both of them, who may be generally concerned about one of the relationships: a successful workshop that is rich with a school teacher? Things, Falon's character is funny, caring, sweet and perfect, perfect being Barrymore's heart win. But his friends ask him a logical question: if he is such a defender, then why is he in the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. Since his uncle passed his Sox Season ticket, he was so committed to his team; She has not missed a Red Sox home game for a long time in Fenway Park. <br /> <br /> and the fine balance, how much workshop you want to avoid the emotion of its people? And how does the filmmaker want to compromise to compromise for the love of the other life of his life? <br /> <br /> At first you may think that sport-passion movie bits are exaggerated for comic relief. Well, I'm sorry to admit, they're not. Just like the Houston Astros fan, I can tell myself the truth. I will try to see each 'Strauss' game; Listen to their radio or follow them on the Internet. I read Chronicle's sports section every day. And yes, my room shade looks like a gift shop at the Minute Made Park; 5 jerseys, a closet with 20 shirts of exquisite Astros gear and you know the rest. Falun's character also has Red Sox MBNA MasterCard. <br /> <br /> The Fallon was credible enough to be trusted by the treacherous Red Sox, although he could have pulled it without a cartoon (Thanks Adam Sandler was not there); And revolved around how these couples try to manage with each other's emotions. <br /> <br /> I want it to be a classical romantic comedy. Not enough of the best movies in history; But of course the style is applied to a mold break and is equally suitable for men and women.
