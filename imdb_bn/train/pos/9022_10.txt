Well, Teanko is no doubt the best British television show, performance, direction, throwing, mystery, drama ... without any doubt about it. <br /> <br /> While shortly after the show fell into the last season, this last film nicely lifted the threads and showed a fantastic story for fans of the show and newcomers. I can not recommend this movie more, find it and see it. But I recommend to watch the first series, because the first two seasons are better than this extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> A clear (10/10)
