I'm 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dome delve made a great pair. This movie is really fun and I love the song. My favorite songs are "You can not put a good dog down" and the song that I share, I think it's called "What's going on me." This was the last movie with Judith Barse, who played an Anne-Marie voice. My favorite character is Charlie but I'm so glad to hear the voice of Ichir. Although some scenes I've been really scary, I found it difficult to see the scene with Charlie's dream, and the Corfaces pretended to be shy about me. I really enjoyed other characters like King Gate. The last was adorable and actually sad, make me cry a little bit. I give this movie 7/10.
