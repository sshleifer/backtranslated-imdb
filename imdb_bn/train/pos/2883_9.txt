"Cinderella" is a movie about a young girl whose mother died and her father was married. Once his father died, Cinderella's parents became very meaningful and did all the work around the house, just as two clean after the bad rituals. One day, the king sent a message to all the single women present for the Royal Ball in honor of his son in order to find a son. Of course, Cinderella did not go, but her stepisters did. Cinderella became very upset and thought that she had no choice in the presence of the Royal Ball, until her team was present. So she did some magic and made Cinderella beautiful woman, but she had to go back to midnight because the magic came back. During the Royal Ball, Cinderella wasted time and the clock decreased midnight, so she ran out of the palace and lost her glass slip. Then the king ordered Duke to find the sleeper woman. Duke searches every room, but eventually finds a woman related to Cinderella. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> About this picture is a magical elixir. Cinderella was a servant of her own family at the beginning and no one could love her, but her whole life changed with a little magic and finally found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing is "Cinderella" music. When Cinderella Fairy Godmader was working on her magic, she would sing the song "BBBD Bobby B". When I was a kid, then my favorite song was to sing around my house, so I will never forget. While I was singing Cinderella and the Prince, I liked that part when they danced, they sang this song because they realized that they were in love. Overall this film was my favorite movie when I was young because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale.
