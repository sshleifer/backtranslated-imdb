My parents took me to this movie when I was 9 years old. I have not forgotten it. I have not seen anything beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor before. (He walks the elephant, at the age of 22 he remembers), I am not, so feeling is not sex, I can not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit on her feet like a puppy and looked at her. He started to show his age, (he was almost four hundred) but I still believe him to be one of the most beautiful and exciting women. <br /> <br /> Since I've seen this movie many times, and it's a sad melodrama Miss Taylor's beauty, beautiful scenery, very impressive elephant stamped in the face of nature, and what it preserves a specific point of pride of man. <br /> <br /> Everyone is watching movies for a few hours of movie channels or rental videos.
