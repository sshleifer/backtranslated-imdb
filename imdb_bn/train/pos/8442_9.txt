The movie was excellent, save for some of the scenes with Esposito. How did I enjoy combining the intelligence of the series and uploaded some platinum that was never resolved during the series (thanks NBC ...). Pembleton and Bayliss were great to see their most humane, and most fundamental people together. Braugher and Secor did a great job, but would be ignored as usual. It seemed like it was the end of the killings. The memories, tapes, and repetitions on the court TV are not exactly visible on every Friday. But the film does its job and it works very well, after the retirement of Al, presents a great picture of life and presents existing family relationships among unity. I enjoy this much
