A great movie, rather challenging than really entertaining. Sadly, there is no memorable quote here, but it's my favorite: Alexander: If you're leaving someone who you like, then you have to say what you have to say: "Goodbye, I'm going." But hide like a criminal, is invisible, ignoble. (I did not see it with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it expresses all. There are so many strategies involved in the relationship between Alexander and others, and yet everyone is still waiting for more truth. However, as Alexander's experience, true intelligence could hurt more. The general explanation is that the film depicts the undesirable effects on the people involved, the mere possibility of "free love". It really shows a firmer, but if it is treated with depth depth, I would be grateful: It is not free that it has been destroyed for its failure, but people (especially men, I think) should work on themselves and through freedom practice Do not try to defeat the ruling morality before. He says that the film is realistic and in reality a proper observer.
