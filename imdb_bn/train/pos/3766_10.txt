Incredible style visual creative epic <br /> <br /> This picture does not have the most dramatic or most artistic acting. But who will say this film is an art? I am not convinced of the idea that an important movie must be serious, non-commercial or annoy me with questions. There are even many movies, I'm hungry for these features, which I like. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture does not reflect the reality. Her friendly-homemade and utopian Imagine the future world described by Rufus - it's a beautiful time-space adjustment for me! Without music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well made. I always like cinematography and sceneries of this movie. Especially at this time the Bogus Journey away by its prequel top. Also the effect is good, and I think most of them are made without CGI. I usually like the good old effects of large budget movies. Out of certain people, his 'only another Hollywood movie' But I think it's very a charismatic way. <br /> <br /> A short word for soundtrack: All the bands and orchestral music are very good in the film. There is also no lack of sound design. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but the view was getting winger's track from 'station', Van's Bill and Ted Robots. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is very naive and very cool! It's a better way than Panzercartier Potemkin, The Godfather, Eregerhead or Aguirac - God's wrath. It's the citizen's purchase at the far higher, universal now or the Chris Markers Sansuli ... ... better than the complete withdrawal ... there is no way ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! (Big surrender?) <br /> <br /> PS: Part 1 is not a good movie. So Bogus is a superior sequel to Jorney. Even the Terminator 2 is not a superior sequel! It's not!
