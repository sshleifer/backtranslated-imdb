I used to write comments on IMDB, but I do not do it anymore. It has happened that the IMDB has become widespread, and as a result the scores of content are destroyed. What i mean If anyone is not particularly interested in the movie and does not have any expertise in the subject, he shows some bad (or opposite) and if he likes it, then he gives 10 and if he does not go, of course 1. Of course, to properly measure some Can not Now for the film. I'm really sorry to distribute 10 out of a few few movies, because I can score it with 12 or 13, which is not possible. There is something in this documentary that I do not expect to see again in my other life in any other film. It's messaging, and it's not just a way to say; Okay In the last 25 minutes there is power, visual pleasure and wisdom - words spoken by congratulated people, actually ... there is no possible match. I do not keep movies, very rarely I find a feeling of doing it, but it is a kind of movie that you should keep and keep, and from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times a year. I did not find anything to say. This is a real, purpose 10 for me.
