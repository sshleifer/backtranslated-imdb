Gino Costa (Masimo Girota) is a young and handsome drifter that comes in the street bar. She met the owners of the young, beautiful and dissatisfied wife Giovana Bragana (Clara Kalamai) and her elderly and fat husband Juc√°s Bragana (Juan de Landa) Bar. She has business with her mechanical skills, and Giovanna by some food and accommodation. They both decided to kill Zeuspe for a car accident. Their relationship is affected by the feelings of the guilty and the investigation of the police. This masterpiece ends in a sad way. Lucino Wisconsin's silent and innovative-realistic films are outstanding. This is the first time I see this version of 'Postman Always Ring to Twists'. I liked the 1946 version with Lanna Turner, and in the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scenes in cinematic history, but this is certainly the best. My vote ten
