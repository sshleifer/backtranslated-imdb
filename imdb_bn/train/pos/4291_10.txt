From the opening shot of lead actor, we get an initial view of how many men are guided by women and humor occurs every day on the normal day of normal life. <br /> <br /> <br /> Eurek Leertigau, the director of many European men, believes that they are in complete control of their lives, but things can not work without the help / assistance of women around them. . The use of facial images across the film is fantastic, and his intelligent position is on the family (senior members) spot. <br /> <br /> There is enough smile in the movie, though it is still a single parent / police with the power of the adoption and society's family. Really rewarded for watching, and able to create a French SIM again. <br /> <br /> One of the 50 best films of this year, and five ratings are good for starting. I look forward to adding it to a DVD collection when it's released and highly recommend it to all ages.
