When Paris is out of the flames, I totally dismiss it. I was not the whole Madonna and progressive events. I think it's going to be campy and silly. I'm wrong about this movie. After the movie has passed for ten years, I saw it and I ran it and ran it. It took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. Even though I personally knew all of the characters as well. The 80s were spectacular and the movie has captured the essence of gay culture. What a terrific job! I went to the Internet and found out what some members of the original rooms are doing now but I'm not able to identify them all. If someone has some information in the counter, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they will make another documentary. I love it
