I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, at the top of the Cannes Film Festival's 200-seat movie. <br /> <br /> I was absolutely. I love combining imagery created fantasies. It's amazing set designs. The scenes depicted in the 1920's or in the 1930s actually showed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have 9/10 this experience. <br /> <br /> * ahead of the spoilers * <br /> <br /> The black and white look of the documentary black guy, with guitar or singing, tells about the awesome blues-men. It's really amazing. But it also mixes in new bands and this is one thing I can dislike from this documentary. This is a modern way of modern rock-bands that are highly linked to playing blues songs. I do not really appreciate the trash of trash them playing such extraordinary blues songs. A wonderful musical taste found in Wyndham Buente Visa Social Club is a taste of it. <br /> <br /> The documentary in this first screening was so moderate that the next documentary was shown to everyone and ordinary tourists in the open-air croissant sea beach. Although the sand, the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the word probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy in the sand for thousands of people on that night.
