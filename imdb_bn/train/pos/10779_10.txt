A classic cartoon, always enjoyable and fun. This is an interesting plot full of lovable characters. Road Rovers is a valuable exhibit, it's a short 13 episode, and if you can manage a chance to see it then you should. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Bros. Studios should publish a DVD that is in 13 episodes. If they do, I'll definitely buy it, and if they do, then you have to buy it too. If your kids love dogs, they will love road rovers! Road rover should have attracted more attention while it was being broadcast, it was certainly an original and very special show that should have been much appreciated more than that.
