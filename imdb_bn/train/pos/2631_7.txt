Lion King is a serious story about the rising rise of a young lion in order to take revenge on the death of his father, but the king of Lion is a total opposite, half-hearted and happy. The story from Singh Raja's Singhal side said, less than half of Timon and Pumba's view, which is less than a perfect jewelery made from Myrand, because he could not dig tunnels because of leaving the house. A warthog who has friends and neighbors and has a smell problem. The film is a little short on the substance, but Disney Timon and Pumbaa are a good job of filling time with various sketches as they "watch" the movie with us. With my favorite Guy-that happens halfway through the movie, make sure you see the bouncing bug! Disney advertised as "half-story" in advertising, though it is not really. This is a different view of the lion king except the most extensive material in the second half of the original Daily Classic. Timon and Arnie Sabella as credit Nathan Lane may not work in the movie, without their efforts, as Pumbaa for their voice work. The songs, they entertain, and they smile us. They give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a warthog.
