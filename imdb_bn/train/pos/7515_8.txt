I am now familiar with the Betty page for many years. Soft-core porn images have since become an iconographer since the 1950s, and even today it is a strong draw. The appearance of "Betty Page" is still very popular in the fetish world, and it is as unique as it is today. So I saw this image started with a few contacts. The results were not frustrating. <br /> <br /> Among other things, was it really entertaining for entertaining the movies of real movies like Evving Clo, John Wiley, and Bonnie Jaeger ?? Consider all trailblazers today. Marie Haron has done a great job creating the desired environment of sexual violence and hypocrisy in America in the 1950s, which is extremely innocent with today's standards. I've found myself in a psychological and psychological climate, especially as a visual shortcut using monochrome v colors. <br /> <br /> I think Great Chain has done a great job of presenting the character of Mole Betty. Innocent sexuality and all its fools naivet√©. Betty likes to look beautiful, likes attention, saw nothing wrong with nudity, and enjoyed dressing in "stupid outfits" for the camera. All of the implicit sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires were completely lost on that that arose. In this picture, she still does not understand what "all the concerns were" about whether she does not come to the picture or the S & M content. <br /> <br /> He is uneducated or very easy to understand that he only "does not drink it" about idolatry and never do it. There is no harm in there. Betty Page is simply who she is. This picture is pretty nicely captured. <br /> <br /> The 1950s, published by Mrs Harron, and her work with Guinean Turner, make me really happy that I am happy with the day and age I am in. The hypocrisy and repression associated with the great ignorance about our sexuality all combined with the world by stunning terribly stumbling. The film captures well and makes it happy, because Betty tolerates it with its incredible faith and its obsolete casualties. <br /> <br /> This picture was a bit slow but it hit all the points. Good of them I did not even know this movie about the Buttie page and its effect on America's culture, even for those people. Those with such interests, then this film must see a must.
