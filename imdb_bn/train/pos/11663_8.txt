Kells of Secrets is an independent, animated feature that gives us a story about decorated around the book's Kells, an enlightened manuscript of the medieval period that coordinates four Gospels of the New Testament. I do not know that this book actually exists, but now knowing it makes my explanation and analysis much easier. There are some stories and ideas floating around how the book came, who wrote and survived it for more than 1,000 years. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We are familiar with Brainnac, who lives with his uncle, Abbott Collac (pronounced by Brendan Glisson) at the Abbey in Kells, Ireland. Abbott Selak is building a huge wall surrounding the villagers and monks to protect them. Brendan is not a lover of the wall and not a beggar. They are paying more attention to reading and writing, there is nothing else to do with Abbott Kollac. He is "Northman", who looted and burned cities and villages, and burned them on the ground, he was afraid. <br /> <br /> One day a passenger came from Aeolo Island near Scotland. This is brother Eden, a wise man who carries a special book with him that is not yet finished. Abbott allows Selak to stay with her and contacts her with Brendan's friends. There are special plans for IDEN Brendan. At first he needed ink for the book, but he needed specific berries. The only way to catch them is to be outside the walls and outside the area of ​​Bennen in the area. Eden seems to have the only chance to continue his work, before he gets informed of his absence in the absence of his uncle, he decided to go out and exit. <br /> <br /> Brendan Ashley in the jungle, the defensive forest. Jungle He allowed the crossing of Brendan to the berries and became similar to his company. He warns about the dangers in the dark and does not get involved with it. There are worse things than Vikings. From there, Brendan has met with more challenge with the book and with a long overdue assault. <br /> <br /> I love this story much more that I know what it is like. Now let's tell you what the Kells book is and what it is, the animation makes perfect sense. I have seen copies of photographs or old books hundreds of years ago, along with freelance borders, colorful pictures and extraordinary patterns, animals and pages sorting. Disney's The Story In The Stone's opening frame is much more. Here are many similar designs and patterns in animation. It creates a very unique viewing experience where the stories and animations try to overcome each other. <br /> <br /> I could not stop my eyes incredibly. I have seen several of the best 2D animations of the year. It's vibrant, stimulating, and full of life. Characters are constantly floating around designs, doodles and tree patterns, walls and in the air. It enhances the film. <br /> <br /> The story is satisfactory, though I think it might be a little too late. With just 75 minutes of runtime, I think the final law may have something special. It does not provide much information and does not accept the significance of the book. We reminded it of importance but did not fully understand. We are told that it gives hope, but why or how not. That was really the only lack of film part. Otherwise, I thought the story was interesting but the animation was completely exhausted. <br /> <br /> I guess it's a certain degree okay. Animation can carry a film before it starts up sooner. The story lacks some parts, but it's a fascinating role in an interesting piece of history. To get the idea of ​​what I'm saying about myself and about this film, simply suggest to see the Kells book briefly. I think it will help you a lot more of your viewing experience. This is a very impressive and nicely illustrated film that must certainly not be missed.
