Peter O'Toole offers an opportunity for a treat and swagger in a drunken stupor to watch his role where he is well on the role line. The beautiful Susanha supplies a good foil for the dramatic presence of York O'Toole. <br /> <br /> The movie reflects the immitability of a person - without a clear view - but is able to entertain the audience with its brutal social speech. Although it is not a major movie by any account, it will be remembered for its entertainment performance. <br /> <br /> Even signed in the end documents in York, a treatment of extinguishing silently tragedy, a treatment. Here possible weakness back to Thompson's back. But due to the film actor and the script, the film floats. <br /> <br /> I have seen the film twice in 20 years for both shows in "Brotherly Love". It's an outstanding and inappropriate title for the movie "Domestic Dance", wherever it's released.
