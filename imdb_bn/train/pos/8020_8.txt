I found it as the most enjoyable Muppate film because I think it was the lightest heart and most of the lines were best comic distributions. Muppets tries to go to Broadway to sell their original music, but as well, they carry common problems with memory loss in the kimetir. The original "Muppets Movie" is not so great, although there are some with the Joan River and Dobni Kolman. Just a lot of time in the line and delivery is great, and the muppetts themselves feel happy. The original songs are also good here, and are finally satisfied. There is nothing more to say about the film, but Muppets fans should definitely be sure. This is the most fun Muppate film and sure to enjoy everyone. <br /> <br /> *** *** *** *** ****
