What can you possibly say about this show in a level? The term "The Soprans" actually defined the television, as we know it. It has broken all rules, and has set new standards for television excellence. Everything is shameless, writing, directing, and for me, the highest performance. If you look at this show, you will realize that these characters are not real. The acting strategy is a real Tony Soprano, or any character in you thinking. This show is very versatile. Some people do not see mourning because it is violent, it is not about cruelty, it is business, family and many deep things that all depend on you as a fan. For me, when people show grief, I do not like a show about mafia. For me, it's a show about family. Through a family, generation, the crowd must be different. Overall it is a best composition in a show. Is this what television should be? Here it is. From the stunning performances to the complex characters, the brilliant story lines from the bright writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? Define excellence in a display, and dare to be different.
