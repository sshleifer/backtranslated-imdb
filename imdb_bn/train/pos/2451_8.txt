Funny people in addition to George Lopez sitcom. I first saw these first episodes often joke at his mother's expense. I have seen this more, have been much more. A person in Caste is not really safe from his intelligence. <br /> <br /> I think this season has progressed so that the George family is getting more comfortable with Citcom Baba's land. At first he did not, but he got more and more in a groove. This makes him and progressive funnier both. To add George to this year, they added several letters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> George's comic timing and talking with ABC's lack of good sitcom Like Worth, I think George Lopez's George W. Bush had the opportunity to stay in ABC for a long time.
