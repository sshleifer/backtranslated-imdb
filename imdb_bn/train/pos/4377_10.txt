In the mid-90's, in my opinion, there was a high point for the historical drama. The last moment, Brahheart, Rob Roy - all represented a special passion and intensity within their respective periods. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy represented a unique and imaginative image and the picture was rarely represented. It really has everything - interesting stories, great acting, extraordinary dialogue, and exciting scenery. I was obviously influenced by the actual genuine dialog. I can imagine how people spoke and behaved in the early 18th century. <br /> <br /> Something that surprised me was obscenity expressed by letters. Films found in modern times are most available, although it is often more subtle and frustrating. The film had a very warm and sexistic tendency, which was unique in the context of the era and was probably very realistic. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​was very difficult, rarely a dull moment. Many conspiracies and political concubines were complex, something that was a bit complicated, but still not separated from the original story. <br /> <br /> The action also works very well and is moldy. I will find something extraordinary that there is no soundtrack during the highlighting action piece of the film. This creates a very exciting, exciting sequence, because there is no music coup in our scene direction and resolution. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is always high on the list of my favorite films. I would recommend it all.
