I could not see this picture in the theater. I admit to an anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who made John Trouvalta the movie? I remember the broadcast of Oscars that year, when Trivola did not win, she was completely destroyed. How dare he was when he was a "real" actor? I'm sorry John, you will win. After catching this film years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Aunt Bob, Wes, all done nicely. I, I, never acknowledge when it passes by the surf channel. I have to close and watch. Over the years, I have learned to dance with most of my dialogue, with my fingertips in my waist, and learned to praise Trivalta more. The only frustrating thing I had to do was track some music, soundtracks from the city cowboy. The film "Finding for Love" defines the film, but the city cowboy was full of shiny classic which did not create soundtracks. It should be a double CD ........
