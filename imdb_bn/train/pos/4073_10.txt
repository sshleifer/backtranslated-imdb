Do you ever want that you can run away from your neutral and stressful life at school or at work and you can continue your own witch adventure, with your closest friends next to you, facing all kinds of danger and villains and its mystery Uncovering is a lost civilization that just waiting for someone to discover all his secret? Even if you are not many imaginative-lovers, do you ever wish that you can feel like a child again, and can not take care of the world for two hours? <br /> <br /> This is exactly what Miazaki's "Castle in the Sky" is. Paju, a young man, but a very brave and ambitious engineer, lives in a mining town for one day, a girl named Shia descends from the sky like a sky and travels far from the cloud. All the time they pirates and the military are warming their legs. Simply tell, this is simply an incredible adventure that each child sees at one point or another's dreams, and I can not help but when I see it my anxiety goes away. <br /> <br /> It takes place in Miyazaki's old works and many places in the everyday world, this movie is not visible or spectacular as Away, Hawles Moving Castle, and even Princess Moneo. Yet, I say it is difficult that any movie is better than anyone else, because these three films are mysterious to the mysterious subject at some time or at any other time, if not confusing, especially for the youngest audience, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky" on the other hand, does not make much effort to form a metaphor, and it is not a story of any age; It's probably one of the best illustrations in the mind of a child I've probably ever seen. Artwork is not nice, but the use of perspectives from the eyes of the kids is just amazing; Although it is panning to see the upper part of the big tree or the cloud from "camera", or the height of the height of the soil or the sea looking at the sea, I can not only help it, I am with paju and winter, only children of other worlds , Far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even the kids do not have a complex relationship, which is ashira / san or chihiro / haku; The cold-witted angel, one day, came to his life from the sky, from the beginning to the perfect person. As a result of the film's development, their true adventure childhood comes through their similar words and beautiful realistic facial expressions. They were not the only ones I remember. Their memorable reminder, but their loving friendship does not cover the whole film, only becoming the most powerful in the last frame. Because of that, I love more than two of them with any other Miyazaki couple. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Casal in the Sky" is an easy-to-reachable film, but if you do not have any kind of film, you'll be sure to find out your fix here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, mystery, science, romance, and even some western ... here's everything, people can go to movies (probably without fear). Why I can easily recommend this as the first Miyazaki movie; It is perfect for them who have no expectations from those who have already seen the incredible curiosity of some of their recent work. <br /> <br /> The ending song of the English translation film, expressed its lasting feeling for some kind of lost civilization, and some soul-companions, which were not found in our human life. "I'm the longest reason for so many lights that you are one of them ... the world spins, and carries you both." Miyazaki has always provided poetic songs to finish songs from Joe Haasashi's superb score, but this is the only I saw that it is a touching love song and an inspirational dream. Mayazaki does not have the most advanced, spectacular, or meaningful work, but it can not be perfect for what it really meant. : The true vision of childhood imagination, and the wonderful escape from reality for any adult, who may wish to have a wonderful idea, like their imagination, when they were only young children who lacked. Sit back, relax and love for it.
