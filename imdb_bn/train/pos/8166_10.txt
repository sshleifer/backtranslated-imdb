This movie is very great! The acting is fine, Carbine is an excellent cast of Barnesen, who works as perfectionist dentist and tortures his patients. At first he saw his wife with the police, and then he became crazy. He took vengeance on patients as well as his wife and Pullman. Most of the special effects are beautiful, although some are actually fake (like drill-out tongue, it is kept out for 1 night and still red in the morning). But the torture scene is absolutely good work. Although the film has a weak point it is very slow; The heavy part is sometimes just the extremiously annoying part. But for the real horror / thriller fan it must be surveillance!
