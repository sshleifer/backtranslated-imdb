Spoiler is about such an idea about this movie. Williams will lose any less to replay the football game that frustrates his life. Russell plays the final ex-joke at high school. Finally he gets his shot under the dog, and Williams can save his face instead of being a shoe. A great reverse tragedy 7/10
