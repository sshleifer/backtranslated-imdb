It was a low budget (this is something that they recorded with the home video recorder). However this is a good plot line, and it is easy to follow. After 8 years of her sexual assault, her father, Amanda was released from psychiatric ward, with a doctor's help, she kept a secret. The doctor hired her house and ended up buying a car. But Amanda killed her in the first 20 minutes of film and threw her behind the house. Then he sees Richard, his neighbor, close to him, and stops until he does. He worked harmless but after seeing another neighbor's lightning, Amanda killed that doctor and Richard's wife tried to kill Lauri (after Amandara and took him to the hot bowl). Then he stopped acting so innocent and killed Buzz and later he was supposed to take care of Richard and tried to kill him. Find out if Amanda dies and you have to rent the movie. Overall, the good movie reminds me of my life that you are falling for the whole neighbor and you do not know to stop it until your part.
