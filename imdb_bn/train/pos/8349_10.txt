Depardieu's most notorious movie (1974) Groundbrake of Bertrund Blair It shows a lot of sex scenes in the X-rated, among which Jane Morou works with a trouse with two hairy French Hippies (Depardieu and Deire), along with a 1970s version of her Zeus and Jim Manage. There is no such thing as a sacred area in this picture; Everything is fair game. <br /> <br /> It is very odd that America does not like this movie very much, although many French people I've met find it a classic. There is something about how Americans are programmed with 'like'. <br /> <br /> With Gerard and late Patrick Deare, most of the sexual insecurities have two bitch, hippie drifter, hatred of women and minor acts committed. . They are Kings and anti-capitalist, euro-committees, out for slacker 'freedom'. Blair searches for these two people and the bourgeois society ultimately feels too ridiculous. Although the best, the great Stephen Grasply score is the unstable spirit of the drifters, deep unconscious awareness or 'high ideals' that encourage all the harm involved.
