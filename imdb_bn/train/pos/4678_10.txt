I chose to watch this movie in Tribeca based on Judge Hirsh and Scott Cohen, and it was found as one of the best films of the festival. Both leading actors seem to match letters at a personal level in a good round-sensitive performance. The director has done a great job that brings letters and stories efficiently, which is not usually seen in production for the first time. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect of this movie is the woodwork and New York City (the specific Brooklyn). The film revolves around the business of building furniture and protects the wooden structures and both of the fine Brooklyn painters? The director of this beautiful choice again Kudas. <br /> <br /> This is a jewel and I will sincerely recommend it (I'm sure it will be made on screen).
