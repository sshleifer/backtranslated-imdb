I thoroughly enjoyed this sprint. I firmly believe that Matt Stone and Tray Parker are our time comic talent. Their level of pop culture has tremendous power to add to the oddity and makes it superb but realistic ... if it gives any idea. It's basically what makes South Park soooo fun Once you've used it to be the most obscene and unknown cartoon, you can see the message being published in each episode. That's obvious in BASEketball. Although it is directed by David Zucker and is absolutely impressive, it has sincere message about disrespect for corporate America and major league sports. I am also a fan of sports, so I think it's sometimes funny because it is so strange that people hate to love. The opening delights are bright ... smile fountain tears from the football players every time they start reversion! Someone can not love this movie because it is not just the cup of tea for everyone ... but just like the South Park, when you have seen the ambiguity once ... This is a true message that is expressed through literary comic genius. I did this picture 8 out of 10.
