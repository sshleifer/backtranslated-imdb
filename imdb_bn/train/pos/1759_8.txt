I'm not sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, I'm not sure whether I can apply it too. In the last few years, the movie theaters have been filled with comedy movies that are too stupid for us to be stupid. Therefore, I have considered films that do not meet these requirements as a "serious comedy". <br /> <br /> 40-year-old virgin is fit in this guild? That finally you up, but in my opinion, it's a very funny movie. You can laugh a lot of things, plus it provides a social commentary through some really great characters and situations. <br /> <br /> I have a pretty 40-year-old virgin there and even those whose specification can not be fit properly, can be characterized by a character in the film's characters, especially men. <br /> <br /> As the story is titled, Andy, a shy, silent guy who collects action figures, sees Survivor with his eighth neighbor and whose favorite band is Asia <br /> <br /> Tomorrow's Smart Endeac Endeavor Until Andy's mystery is revealed, Anandi seems to be from Monocoth. Tom is definitely a sexually distorted but he thinks what he wants with the opposite genre. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And J, a man in a relationship who is influenced by his continued cheating and is caught. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that the majority of young people aged 13 to 21 have already seen this film, but this is not really an age limit to be able to enjoy it. So if you do not see it and go to your video store and enjoy a little smile with social commentary than the rest from deep and depressed independent movies. <br /> <br /> It also includes DVD bonuses that you can really see from below.
