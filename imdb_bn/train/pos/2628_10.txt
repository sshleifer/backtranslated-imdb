I think lion king 1 1/2 think that the best singer is not the best of three lions movie movies! Where do they come from Timon and Pumba films and reconciliation with others like Timon, there is a problem to dig tunnels with other Mercers! Timon and Pumba find their dream place and find it and find it soon and it is possible, but soon they help their face or face to face her evil face and declare her right as a lion king. Rock! Filled with nice new letters like Timon's mother (Julie Kawner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stilhar). I think my favorite character was Uncle Mac, because she was very funny and was spoken by Ben Stiller's father Ferry Comedian Jerry Stiler. The role that Disney starrer could play! Wonderful characters, animations, and stories and songs filled with lion kings 1 1/2 According to my opinion, Simba is better than a signal than pride, and even though I admit that I was really like that! Lion King 1 1/2 can enjoy the whole family of a great Disney Sequel! It has a good story and is very fun! 10 out of 10!
