TCM has kept me awake all the time ... they are coming up with a movie that I have never heard of ... Senso .... now in the Osagean ... VISCANTTI A very initial movie ... ... wow ... postman's Italian Version always rings twice ... bright !! Beautifully played and operated ... no one ever heard of a lead, as Clara Kalamai, Geovana, and especially, as Masimo Girota Gino ... a sensual man !! In 1943 no other muscle on the screen is more attractive! His appearance was ahead of his time ... In the 1950s, he was probably inspired by many men ... he could be a big global star !! The film is even better compared to the version of Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange and less glossy than the MGM version (which I really like) with Film Garfield and Lena Turner. Who can forget .... This Italian version is different .. more realistic and ending completely different ... see it ... I'm going to buy it !!
