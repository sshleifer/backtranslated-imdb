Hal Harley's Henry Flower composed an independent film and of course his best work. It has immense character depth, delicate, complex dialogue, and a wonderful, emotional end to which captivates. During my first visit, I felt it several times to absorb what I was seeing and feeling. Henry Flower was a complete movie starting from the beginning, and no signals were needed. <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I heard about Faye Grimm. Faye was not one of the main characters of the first film, and in order to force her brother to meet him face-to-face as soon as she faced, in the real world there was more of a worrying imposition on frightening and ignorance. In her own movie, Fe works harder, though her maturity takes a very different road. Simon had gone up to a somewhat ingenious genius from autistic separation. Fay started off as an unfamiliar, completely normal, punk child and responded to ridiculous situations by becoming a mature, completely normal, experienced adult who is no benefit to her adult journey. He resolved the problem with determination, a bit of thinking, and tedious misconduct in a human way. Although Simon learned to control his mind, Fey learned to control his emotions. <br /> <br /> This film has several memorable elements in its prakal, but it is quite different for most movies. In contrast to Simon's internal emotions and creativity, Henry Fool has shown you a harsh, annoying, unconscious world. Fai Grim In, a lively, crazy, emotional place in the world that shows the glamor of his young life and discovers the intelligent woman inside the contrast, which had not been developed or nourished by his weak mother earlier. <br /> This movie has two parts, the first to deal with the hardships due to the beginning of Fai's struggle and authoritarian animosity, and the second is related to Henry's fight to be just flexible enough to recover. First of all, fans of Henry Flower might think that how this film can be considered as a seagull and it seems helter-skelter to follow such intense movies, including spying game antics and physical comedy. But this is the Fife Grym's intelligence. Regarding the journey of Siegel Faye, and as I said earlier, one of the seekers of life in his existence, not a creative disorder at the permanent order. Parker Posey is an excellent actress who perfectly captures Hal Hartley's tongue in the cheek fun Elina Lauwenson has probably picked her out of emotional commitment for her role, allowing Parker to play straight man and joke both against live, stage-comedic people around him. <br /> <br /> In the film begins with Henri's entrance, the movie starts a sobering turn. All the drama of Hal Hartley's movies, and every game will come full circle. In the end, you have been shown to Fai's new character and honesty, suddenly with the sharp Henry, the descendant of his time, whose holes integrity and unique emotions illuminate a spark that meets with him. <br /> <br /> Faye Grim is an excellent film that does not exceed Henry's flower, but by the hall's range, it shows that the dynamics of his art is his genius. <br /> <br /> Really, I think that none of the losers will miss the point. One mile (and in particular the subject of Parker Possi's episode), but the film was no more interested than Henry Flower.
