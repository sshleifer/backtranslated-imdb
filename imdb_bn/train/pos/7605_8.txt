A very well made TV series about some people that lost Lost on an island. There are a lot of twists and turns that you can not really determine your favorite character, after a minute, he does something, so he does something so that he is beautiful and impressive to do something, so it makes the most beautiful and Then as you finish the episode and any like you ooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! So you have to wait the whole week, the next episode will be seen, but it is worth the wait. Suspense, action, romance, humor It got all of it without allpless girls but it means that you can actually focus more stories and stories can focus on all of this. So if you like a good story and you like suspense it's good but 24. I think it's probably good. (I also reviewed it that you can test it.) I've got good 8 out of 10 because it's so unpredictable, you do not know what will happen next.
