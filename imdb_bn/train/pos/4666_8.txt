It is very intelligent for the 60s of this movie. Humor is quite mild, but it's more than I expected. Cast is the first rate and they seem to be having a wonderful time. Ustinov wanders through the film muttering some pretty funny things under his breath, and all of it is very inconsistent; As soon as we get out of the DVD, we will buy the movie. The plot is that Ustinov was freed from the prison because he was released from prison and money was leveraged from an American company in London. Maggie Smith is part of the fun part of watching his secretary for some time, and fired from his various jobs. Bob Neighat has fun working on the London Office as his usual death self-loop, and Karl Mulden's frequent and sleazy executive. The last is funny and pretty cynical.
