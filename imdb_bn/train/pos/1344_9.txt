Pruffulim and highly influential filmmaker Martin Scoris compiled a selection of his favorite American films as three different types of directors: the director is confusing: Dr. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who has created new editing strategies among other changes that later made words and color outlook; Director as a runner: Douglas Sirac, Samuel Fuller, and most of the filmmakers in Vincent are filmmakers, directors who used to disguise their rebellious messages in their films; And director as iconclust: Those filmmakers are attacking social observations such as Osnain Wells, Irich von Straheim, Charles Chaplin, Nicholas Roy, Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Pen and social hangouts. <br /> <br /> He shows us how Hollywood's old studio system was oppressive, because of how medium-fashioned filmmakers were bound by political and financial constraints, looking for moderate progress. During his clip from the movie he has shown to us, we never discover movies we have never seen before, but we are also made to look at what we see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, Canon only argues with the "best" and film canon fans that it is a valuable activity to identify and produce a selected set of "best" movies, like a great speed tapes, if it is an initial aspect As film students. Above all, one experience has been shown that all the films related to the film, including reviews, work to create a canon. Some film Canon can definitely be elitist, but others may be "crowded." For example, the top 200 film list of the Internet Movie Database lists many of the "Elitist" film cannons, but there are recent Hollywood blockbusters, which include many film "Elitists" Skull of the Dark Knight, which is currently the top ten, among the first two Godfather movies, Shindler's List and One Flu Over the C Ku nest, and are more similar to the volume of productions, such as Iron Man, Sina City, Die Hard, The Terminator and Kill Bill: Volume. 2. Writer Scorsese taxi driver Paul Scraper directly referred to his canon as "Eliteist" and claimed that it is positive. <br /> <br /> Scorsese is not particularly voice about its social and political ideology, but when we look at the lessons of this intense and confidential history on the birth and growth of American films in both ideological areas, we see that, especially in the country of elitism or public There is no special quality. Elitism focuses attention on the outstanding ones, recognizing and thus concentrating power. This discrimination can easily easily lead to selfishness in order to overthrow the filmmaker's production process, such as the harsh work of Michael Garnard or Michael Hankerk. Yet population representation calls for a belief of independence as a protest against the will of the people. Almost all the misconceptions about the public film have already been said, the potential of the public and the effects of the movie can be ended. Someone can only continue to watch movies, because it is a very important social and spiritual practice. And Martin Scorsese is talking about spending around four hours around us, which can not be said, which can not be seen first.
