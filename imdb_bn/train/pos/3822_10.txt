Lee Chang-Dong's unique "Secret Sunshine" single-most emotionally annoying experience of the year. It is a repetition of the loss and the death of a noble monument immediately after the honest, cruel, good-natured pieces that are resuscitated with the strong density of thought, yet it is unknown to the passions that it observes. Through its layered naturalism and the stunning scenes of the dynamics of small towns, Lee records the creative Korean meladromake severally impressive and trim its characters in the impressive manner and dissipates the effectiveness of a stereo reality. <br /> <br /> "Secret Sunshine" works extremely strong, fluid across its 142-minute runtime. For the first time, his baroque is filled with barbarism, which is derived from inner inner inscriptions, extraordinary forecasts and reversed human repression of vowel. Adapted from a small story, Lee infrared the film with his sensitivity to life's glorious reactions, eventually seeing his opposite humorous and unexpected "osis". It is understood that how the personal revolutions are awakened when our universe changes, but Li does not only see the mental disasters of widows sorrow through the scope of investigation, but turmoil also thinks the currents of existent existence when the film is reduced, the experience of human beings <br /> <br /> Congrats to the best actress in 2007, Do-Yen Jeans ("You're My Sense"). Her acting remains a continuous mystery as widow Shin-Aa. As a character drawn drawn by the forces beyond its control, this performance is intensely central to the unsteady nature of the greatness film. Gene created a cyclonic euphemism on one hand, and the film gradually slows down gradually to its achievement. Instead, it finds a fine balance that breaks the charge of the throttle and general tragedies and subsequent trends of its fall. He became the center of our center as well as the film's universe. Illustrating in the glorious hands-directed cinemascope, the camera never misses its view from Shin-Aye when it is an eye and forgiveness, when it quietly gets frustrated, as the visible intensities break the frame and the compilation of cinematism. <Br /> <br /> Lee describes the life of Mirang's life in small, suspected cities ?? Unreasonableness in communal situations, its uncomfortable silence and its devastation spread to private dramas. Interactions with people in Shin-A's city rarely inspire dividends, especially when their son is obliged to become fit for June (Sioux Jung-Yip). A repetitive introduction of Jung-Chan (Song Kong-H), a graduate mechanic of uncertain motives that helps him on his way to Miryang, in the bright trend of the film set in a submerged stream of sunlight. The song has established itself as one of the biggest anti-South Korean heroes of South Korea, but its low, low-key distribution here reveals the process of direct thinking to express more clearly than necessary. <br /> <br /> If the pain is harmful, then depression can not really be wasted. And Lee finds out the complexity in living. When Shin-Aha tried to bow down on the path of settlement, he could face an unimaginable heartfelt, because of failure, he failed to resolve the fellowship of Christianity of the Gospel for his suffering. But Lee knows better than him when he understands that religion, it is never easy to solve the problem of human canvas in conflict and sorrow. But Li never opposes religion strongly because he can understand the value of liberation by denying the denial among others by high power. In his next half view of religion, the scenes do not allow themselves to be aggressively aggressive, considering the extent to which the filmmakers allow their stories to be taken from the true words of truth in their story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In a movie so rude and genuine, it is strange that emotional Catheris There is no such simple, just suppressing and reducing pain. "Secret Sunshine" exceeds our loss of tender pity, and points towards deep understanding of frustration and belief.
