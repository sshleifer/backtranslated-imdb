A sweet fun story crossing cross 2 cross as they are ready for their wedding. Former police super and public school teachers fall for each other in this great New York settings, though they are marrying other people. Probably a short trite in personality type "partner", when our plays are more comfortable. Nothing heavy, but it smiles me And for the boy Hey - Natasha Henestige sells corn, and gals - sell their sad romance, everyone win!
