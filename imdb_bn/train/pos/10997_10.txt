How nice. One of the greatest movies of all time - never seen. <br /> <br /> Absolutely love! Before completing the opening credit I had glue on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is a science-fiction thriller - and the edge of your seat is Hoodunt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, anyone can eat it. The main actor, Jeremy Northamam was the perfect geeky guy. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to me who likes war games, snickers, and track down. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8-8-06. L.V. in Walt D.
