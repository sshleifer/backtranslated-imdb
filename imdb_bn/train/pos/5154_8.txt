As an amateur historian of WW2 / Nazi Germany, I could not wait to get out of the DVD. For the first time in 2003 I missed it. Do not want to repeat what I said in the comments on the historical errors about the past 8 pages. A good job may have been to portray "charming" Hitler. I had a small problem with some acting choice, not so for their acting, but for their presence. Peter Stormer did not see much like Rohim, why did not he laugh at Babson? And my biggest allegation was always made from Hitler's striking blue eyes, why did not they approach Carlisle Blue? On the plus side, I thought that Gerring and Drexler's acting actors looked very well. Again, as long as people realize this fact that it is considered as the 1st entertainment, in history II, I do not think there will be much harm.
