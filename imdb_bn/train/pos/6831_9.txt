I only know of another movie which is probably opening night and it can compete with Bergman's personal personality. Both movies are simply amazing, they have a prosperity of ideas to realize at first sight. We have a deep focus on art and life as an actress Marath Gordon (Guyna Rovers), she wanted that she wanted to act in stage-acting character. An accidental death of one of his devotees, a young girl announcing her love for Murtail and then hit her car, leaving the actress's deep mark. He began to ask himself questions related to growth, the only solution that began to affect him until he became alcoholic. But it does not help much and Marte is one step away from the whole crazyness. One of the most exciting scenes I found in the Cassavette film was the scene of the death of the deceased girl's fantasy (or not) killing. The film ends with the display of talent on behalf of the director, because he is a theater scene where he and Guyana Rowlands enhance a scene, because Martel has become very drunk in the open night for his part properly. This scene was spontaneously portrayed, with live viewers, laughter is real, chemistry between the cosets and roulette is absolutely amazing. If you like Persaona or are interested in a movie that gives enough ideas with great entertainment, this movie will fine you.
