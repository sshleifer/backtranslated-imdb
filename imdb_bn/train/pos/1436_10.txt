Worked in the city of Manhattan and at the park near the City Hall in the summer, I ate my lunch during the summer, I found the mayor came and went. It is great to see what it was like to cross the City Hall door and look like in the lobby and the entire building. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Papas), "Gogli", '03' gave amazing performance through the whole film, especially when he delivered lectures to kill a young boy in the African American church. John Cusack, (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runway Jury", '03, Mayor was a devoted slave and he worshiped all that he had tried to achieve. Bridgette Fonda, (Meribeth Cogan), began to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and played a great supporting role. Last, but not least, Danny Eilou (Frank Anselmo), "Off key", '01', played a public, whose picture had some tough selection at the end! NYC great film with great acting and fantastic photography!
