I found this picture to be an interesting study of a family of crisis. When Leo, the oldest announced that he had responded to HIV + alone family members and touched with each other and was still weird. <br /> <br /> I never saw a family that was physically exhibited as such; Not likely to scream each other. I did not understand why the family thinks that the youngest news can not handle it, but once it has been hard, I have seen it as a perfectly moving movie. <br /> <br />
