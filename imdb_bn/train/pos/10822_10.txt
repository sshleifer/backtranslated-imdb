I was lucky to see this film in England many years ago. I have seen hundreds of movies, but I have never forgotten it. Although the Senators did not play a very respected character, they were excellent in the introduction. Many people think that he did not really come from "From here to eternity" to his role, he did not have his own role, but in my opinion he was fantastic at Kanoko. The other role that I have in my land is William Conrad. I have never seen or heard this photo before. Konrad plays an unusual part in this movie. I think his deep and impressive voice and he used it nicely to improve some words that set the voice of his character. I also remember the music, both of them present to Conrad, and whenever they appear they seem surrounded. An extraordinary movie and my only disappointment was that I never got to see it again. It seems that the face of the world has disappeared. I saw the title that it saw the black and white picture, but when I saw it was in full color, then I think of the blue shirt of Sinatra.
