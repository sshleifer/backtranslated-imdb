I always wanted to go to the film business of David Ducheny, and finally he did it, and he made me proud. This movie was for what I had hoped for. Duchovney played his character very well, playing Agent Moulder instead we are using, compatible with something new to manage. Therefore, I give him extra credit for his role, because I can not see that particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to the psychological Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that you do not get tired of throughout the film, because he does not fail to surprise you. She has weaknesses, and strengths, making the story all the more credible. I enjoyed very descriptive, it added a good deal to the story, and there were some memorable quotes that I still use. This movie was a harmful score. I recomend this for those who love the drama, and do not think of blood.
