This series of Lloyd Bridge as Mike Nelson and his boat was all big. When I saw it was so good to me that it was the real feeling of going down the water. The show shows the power of a young energy to look down under infectious waters. <br /> <br /> This exhibition showed educationally as well as viewers about scuba diving who appeared as a Consumable Pro, Mike Nelson. There were excellent shows, and the program always appears to be produced. Undetected, dramas in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes of more than 1 episode, but in this era, every show owned by American Television is owned by any other show produced in childhood.
