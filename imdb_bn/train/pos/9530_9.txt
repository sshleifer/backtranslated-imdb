Conrad Hall went out with a bang. The great movie photographer passed his extraordinary career with this movie before passing. He feels proud because he is one of the best films you can see. <br /> <br /> Of course, acting is not bad when your Tom Hendes and Paul play Newman Lead! Here the action amount is just fine, not too much; Not very few. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> WHO <br /> <br /> <br /> As good as acting and interesting as the story, this movie is the real star cinematographer, who draws the scene after a beautiful scene with his lens. His work is just awesome.
