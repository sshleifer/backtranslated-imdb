"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies ever. I own that image in DVD! The film is related to New York's widow (Chair), who loves his boyfriend (Danny Iselo) angry brother (Nicholas Cage) who works in a bakery. I'm happy chairs that won an Oscar for the movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are very great. Norman Jeuxine's Direction (who referred to "Fiddler on the roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is a nice movie to see and laugh everyone. Must be seen! <br /> <br /> <br />!
