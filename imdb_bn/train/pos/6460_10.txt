The painter and director wanted to open up the movie with the movie so that the musicians did what they wanted to do with their music, they were successful with me. The current human situation became the main, personal and instant so that I personally feel touched by each situation. I believe that the movie credits music from the person's point of view. Without looting, I can say that I was very moved by the way of film life. Really did not shout joy? Sympathy? Just deep emotion? Very long time I like to find ways to show it to others. It has been seen at the Seattle International Film Festival.
