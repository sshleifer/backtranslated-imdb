I always follow Docker, so when my husband bought Charlie's 'Race to Dakar' DVD home, I could not wait to see it! When we were in actual race, we would see the nation's broadcast, but it never gave background and specific teams. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the Long Way round you will not be surprised <br /> <br /> I think the only thing to bother me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but before Dakar he became styled. So, my daughter's needs met; As the LWR I lived without 'Flime' undies lol, the preparation itself was every bit as attractive as the nation. When Charlie broke his hand, I cried almost, and he won over the severe injuries he suffered during training ... and of course, the death of Andy Caldict ... which was a tragedy, but then every year there are some. <br /> <br /> Ras Allah's Messenger (াল) made me brown, though his attitude increased thousands of times more than the reasonable punishment of LWR. It looks very good to see Charlie now very well. <br /> <br /> What I learned from this Audisi is - 1. Do not prepare your car to do Scorpio! They spent a few months preparing for the X5, and on the day before the group left for Lisbon, Scorpio did only half the work that needed to be done, and there was pain across the car; 2. Dakar organizers need to work a lot on their rider / driver recovery plans - leaving Matt (and potentially, no other rider / driver was as scarce as they were nothing to blame; 3. Charlie is 'rough and tough' adventure There are sincere encouragement for the work but to do according to his will have to work very hard and finally 4. Charlie Bang Yan is planning one of these Ipses called Long Way Down in 2007 and I can not wait to get my hands on it! D: If you like to go bikes and / or really nice fools, you will see it, I'm sure you It's very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Simon Pavike - you're Sir Hero, I'm going through your 'ultimate earner' approach. I was impressed and so strongly influenced by the fact that you ended ... .................................. .................................................. And for Charlie, Matt and the rest of the group - the whole mark to stop it. It is to be remembered that a relatively green group could really achieve achievable achievement. You all are wonderful.
