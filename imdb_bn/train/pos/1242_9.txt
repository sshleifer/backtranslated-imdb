I love this picture. It has good writing and acting and good cinematography. Great set of stories and mixing action, humor, myopia, and tenderness with beautiful location shots. See it, buy it, show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> Performing a fine job portraying good and morphin, especially reluctant / unlikely hero. I've enjoyed all the characters and found them better with interesting and improved dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I cared about what happened to this guy and the result was quite predictable (good boys won, hero won), surprisingly attractive girl and saving the lives of holy children - who can not see who is coming?), everything It has made me happy even after working well till the end. Thank you God for the dignity of this photo, not with a crawfil seagel. Take some popcorns, hug on the couch and watch this fun, happy and entertaining movie.
