How do you rate this movie with 10/10? I say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is to tell you stories but not history! It was the first 'real' movie of the movie history ('Le Prince De Galles' was the first, but it was technically not perfect perfect?) And there is undoubtedly a huge international value. These people were able to finish their work day in a film that was an opportunity to participate in a historic moment, who is becoming the first person to see themselves running! And a nice shot above all the shots! And it seems like you are the first person that saw it too! What a moment! Historical for the first of science (because Lumiere brothers invented cinematography for the first scientific reasons) and after the industry. To worship a movie!
