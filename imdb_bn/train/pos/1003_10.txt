Another Australian Best Composition, it delves into an unknown and supernatural world, and it is very good. It does not have major effects on American flickers, it focuses more on psychological effects. Rebecca Gibini and Co., which is a relatively easy plot. It follows the story of a couple, who bought an old house, which was supposed to be an old woman's house that never went out, and whose husband disappeared in a mysterious situation a century ago. The strange thing started to come home, and the man who disappeared by John Adam was actually a mass killer. Highly recommended. 8/10
