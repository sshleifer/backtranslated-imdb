I like the film Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I especially like the opening scene where it was a semi truck. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also lots of interesting pictures of the picture. I like how very bad people are portrayed too. I'll give the image 8 out of 10.
