I'm usually not strictly romantic a fan of cinema but this was good listening. I was shocked. I have the most romantic things ever seen in my life. Stunning Bright, sweet, funny and full of heart. Chemistry as writing and instruction is shameless. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphi together are so natural and sweet together that you really think they are couples. <br /> <br /> The movies hold you directly and do not let go. You can not look away and you can stop listening to them. Even at a slight moment just dissolve your heart. <br /> <br /> It's gone in my favorite one. A Best Composition
