Among the movies that I have seen, and most of them, it was a primarily created seratum about the United States Naval Airships (blooms) in the WWE-II era. Yes there are other good LTA related movies, but most use more effects than real time shots. This Man Navy Blim has many real-time footage. Actually, there are plenty of dialogs in dialogue, but today it makes more interesting Hollywood movies. From 1942 to 1959, I spent 10 years (in 20) and spent more than 5000 hours in the navy's air.
