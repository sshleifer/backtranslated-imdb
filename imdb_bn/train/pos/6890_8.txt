It was one of the highlights of the ST: the semi-forgotten second season of TNG, before they grow up or in the third season and after them they grow. It was not just a showcase for up-comers like Bill Campbell and Terry Hatcher, but through the concept of comedy it was a continuation of data search for humanity. Still one of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, before the annoying hurdle by Lit Verf. I think this episode is my first comedy shop to see on the first day of the day, and we all think that she might be the Gene Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be better to know who this beautiful lady is ...
