This movie has some pretty amazing things to do. First, it is supposed to be based on a true story. That, itself, is astonishing that multiple tornadoes fall in Nebraska the same night. I'm surprised if the original city was called "Blensworth" (which is the name of the city of the movie). There is an Ainsworth, Nebraska, but a city that starts with some of Blains. <br /> <br /> It shows the slowest running tornadoes in the boys where it is seen. On the other hand, where the TV becomes obscure, it is actually based. Before Doplar Radar and Weather Radio, we were taught that if you do not turn on your TV on a specific channel (cable only) and you notice the brightness properly, you can tell if the tornado is coming. You will be able to hear this problem until then. <br /> <br /> Since I know something about Midwest Tornado, this movie has made fun for me. I enjoyed it than the twister. I mean, give me a break - there is no way you can make it through and make F5 a pipe chain in a good house.
