Before I start, tell you how well these stand-up special words are when you play Sonic Sonic Adventure I DX: Direct Cutter (especially the Red Mountain level) at the same time. So while watching this stand up special, I recommend - no, you do it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> there, she makes all the fun with absolutely no apologies. <br /> <br /> I thank you very much for God that Carlos did not do the thing in which he used the same joke and simultaneously over and over again. He makes fun of everyone with a great work and at the same time be truthful about it; I said, a few times, Carlos said after a joke, "Well, this guy is a good point!" And then the game over the screen came on my TV because I forgot that I'm playing Sony Adventures IXX: Director's Cut. Bad to me :) So yeah, there's nothing to complain about this stand up special. If you have a teovo or something like this, please kindly please yourself and record this historic hour.
