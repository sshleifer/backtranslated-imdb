See "Dragonlord" Chan in the role of "Dragon" from "The Young Master". Although much more than the first film was born. "Tiger", his elder brother, is not seen anywhere; Not only Marshal, his daughter or his son, Ueno Bia also performed brilliantly in the original movie. Although the Dragon has the same master - perhaps all other students have removed other things. (The picture of dragon laziness in this photo is widely illustrated, so maybe he is still studying!) <br /> <br /> Originally titled "Young Master in Love", this picture is followed by Dragon (at least for the first 60 minutes) And a villager in the way of slapstick. For his revenge, his rival, his friend (unknowingly "Cowboy") has long played the role of Chan stunt-member Mangal. We see different scenes where their firm backfire the scheme. One of these scenes is that we (thankful) find "dragon" on his head. <br /> <br /> This picture is notorious that the box office expectation failed. Who said, I was sure the expectations were high, and I think this movie is not based on its own qualifications, fair trial. But when I try to do this, I still think there is a problem in this movie. It seems pretty sticky, sometimes running, and I think that this work is not as bright as the other works of the moon and is not brighter than this work. <br /> <br /> The image that really stores is the last order. As "The Young Master", there is a fantastic final rail that is full of incredibly tiring steps - you really feel every blow. And again, Chan rose up against the same opponent from "The Young Master" (this is the same character?), And here is the time and energy bright. Chan's style of using the last bit of his environment to defeat the opponent - not only depends on the physical physical skills - is evident from elsewhere. They are full of little prop gags and improvisations clearing the barn in battle. This is a final highlight of the film and one of Chan's incredible career. <br /> <br /> Prior to viewing "dragroll", the prawl is not required to see, in fact it can even raise even more questions than the answer. But it must be said that the original film is the best movie, and "dragroll", it chases girls and focuses on team-sports and it seems annoying. Fortunately, it offers some battle scenes (plus in a fantastic shuttle-cock scene) in this series, as a film seen, the lines are placed on the line.
