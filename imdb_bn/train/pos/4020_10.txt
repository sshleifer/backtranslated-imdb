Mr. Pengara is an extraordinary movie by Dwivedi. This is definitely the best of 2003 and the best. It has very good performance. Dwivedi Master Master knows what to do from Urmila. She is like before you ever seen. One true great performance. Along with him, he is a good actor Manoj Bajpai, who has shown Bollywood with Vicky Matreya. The film is about a girl (Urmila) living in pre-partition Pakistan. She is a small town from the life of a Punjabi family. He kidnapped a Muslim man to continue fighting with the Punjabi family. And then followed a series of twists and turns because the marriage of Urmila's wedding is within a few days. This movie is really a very good movie. The storyline is difficult with an amazing screenplay. Lillett drowns, all performances like Ishfa Copniker (you do not believe, but he can also work in addition to Juice Dansin), khulbhushan Kharband and many more. Add pre-partitioning positive points set to set with Pakistan, clothing, cinematography, sound, background score. The question has been raised from the beginning to the end, what are you asking? This movie is not worth the wallet, but it claims to be part of your collection of movies. Final scene movie ended. I suggest this nail-cushion-happy-poet-goom-and-no-heart-to-mad-hearted person to see this amazing flash. My rating: 10/10
