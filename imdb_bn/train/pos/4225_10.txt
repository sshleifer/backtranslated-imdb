Ruth Gordon is one of the sympathetic murderers who had to face Colombo ever. And, plot almost all the way fascinating. This is one of the best Columbo Mountains ever. Mariette Hartley and GD Spradlin have excellent support in their supporting role. And Peter Falke Gordon had some extra supplies in his view.
