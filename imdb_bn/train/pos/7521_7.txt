Because my playboy was visible in very intense days, there was a vague idea about the Betty page (apparently, when she took her picture and her Santa hat, she did not know that there was a mage). Co-director and directed by American Psycho's Mary Harrons, this film is well-known for its important parts of life. The girl in the church has some bad experiences in the Bell Bell and she is thrown out to find a better time in New York City, where she went to modeling and there are many more.
