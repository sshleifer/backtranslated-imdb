This photo is my wife and I came out in 1978. It was a revelation to us. We really think that we were the only lesbian and lesbian couple who got married and had children. Of course we were wrong. Love may not be where you expect it and maybe it might not be like it. But anyway we love that love both of them. <br /> <br /> And no, it does not change our sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> When we were young we both had a problem, but never had the opposite sex. As we are old we closed off the wedding event. <br /> <br /> This story is not too far away. However, the suggestion that they became heterotoxius seems very unreal to me. For the last 40 years my wife and I were sleeping together. We are still gay At the end of the story.
