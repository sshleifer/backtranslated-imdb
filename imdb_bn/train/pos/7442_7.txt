I hired the movie (I do not think it got a theatrical release) Hope to be bad. Make the film look terrible in the film. I was really surprised, it was good to see; It's absolutely scripts, almost like an ensemble piece of film. It had some fun moments and although there was a bad show, there was an effective mockery on the show and the people. It is basically flawed by the horror soundtracks of the fragile 'comedy' effects, but overall it is the most upright and generally seen in the form of a look like altemesque or Larry Sanders. <br /> <br /> Jerry Springer is the moment of fashion to be critical, he is also a simple target. Springer can create a citizen and it will be announced as the 'worst movie ever made.' I recommend this film for anyone interested in the show. The film is a flawed but innovative and interesting piece.
