This is a truly "80 movie": After returning, they have made 100 times more movies than it is nowadays, and it makes them mostly attractive ... it is a cultural event that no longer exists. Nowadays, maybe the same kind of people who created "entertainer-direct-video", in eighty years, have also been doing very cheap pornography. Thinks to sell porn. However, it is above the middle trash-movie level: it's a good and interesting story, and it seems pretty good. In one scene you can see the microphone swinging at the top end of the image. Of course, Oz and Gene Simmons have a slight decrease, but they do not contribute too much to "success" movies, though they are good on their small land, although they are good in their small land. The monster, the heavy singer "Sammy Karor" really looks terrible, especially when he is doing the song. One of the terrible monsters I saw horrible flicks. I could have nightmares next night. Intellectual movie is not recommended for movie lovers.
