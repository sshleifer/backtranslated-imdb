I am undoubtedly the target audience for this photo. I'm just 50 people who have recently been scattered throughout the independent film. It happened accidentally with the idea of ​​a late film on the television in a night, a film called Clark. The two things I noticed about the first film are 1) technically amateur and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director on the local paper and he said that one of his influences was Clark, I started to get interesting. When he said, his main influence was on the station agent, in a movie I saw the DVD before a week, I decided that I would go and check it. The results can be described with the same line as Clark, although the two films are not content according to overall content. Both films suffer from technical gossip that are overcome by the amazing writing of the film. When Clark is a day in the life of a person who has nothing in his life and is afraid to ask himself a difficult question about himself and his situation, a person less like me who forces himself to be busy, he is always running one way or the other, little She has to fill her life with things so she does not have to deal with bigger ones. The themes and ideas of this movie are strong and disgusting. From this, I can say that I have not changed much rather than grown up, the youth still have the same problem. The authors have decorated these problems and themes in modern local languages, composed amazingly honest characters and made their complete credentials. As Indie goes to the movie, it can not be perfect from a technical perspective, but it is very close to an artistic direction.
