This is a very, very basic bug Bunny cartoon. As a result, the character is still not drawn as elongated as he was later - and in the course of a transition - and his voice is not quite right. In addition, chemistry between almars and bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is some poor snake who bought a bug from a pet store - there is no gun or desire in his part to burst the bomb blast for smuthereens! However, despite this, it is still a very enjoyable film. The initial bug was definitely more sassy and cruel than its next avatars. Later in the film, he got involved with Elmar, Yasmit Sam and others because they started it - they got involved with the rabbit. But, in this movie, he did more like Duffy Duck at the end of the 30's and early 40's - a blurred love for others. A true "anarchist" instead of the next cartoon hero. Although it is not among the best bug bunny cartoons, it is very interesting to be sure and it is interesting to see how it has changed over the year.
