I enjoyed it. In general, I'm not the fan of curiosity and intrigues, but I like hype. I'm part of the Sci / Fi Fantasy And dinosaurs are insane. I read for pleasure, but when I feel over pressure or really feel the death, I saw TV and movies run away. Theodore Rex is able to do me so. It makes success in my eyes! I did not walk away to do anything else when it was running. Whether it is rated as "good" or not really important to me. And no, I'm not a young man. No i am a moron
