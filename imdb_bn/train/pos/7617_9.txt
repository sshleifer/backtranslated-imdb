A very addictive series I have not seen a proper combination before in drama, action, mystery and sci-fi. I'm impressed on every chapter. The script is very intelligent, I do not know how the creators have discovered these amazing stories, each character has a strange past, problem, storm relationship, it shows the human senses needed to create intimate letters. <br /> <br /> The most incredible thing is that all the letters are related to them: numbers, they have been seen before knowing it, etc. Others, mysterious security systems and good workshops are those elements that do not let us lose a chapter. <br /> <br /> m JJ Abrams, what do you think of creating this amazing story?
