No, there is another <br /> <br /> <br /> Because every Star Wars fan had to give me opinion about the second and third, and because this opinion was biased because we missed the atmosphere of the main trilogy , I would like to know the good points of "Jedi's return" and some similar bad points of Prequel.

Deadly Bolt's light reflects on his black helmet. And when he hides and hides his master to save the look, which makes his life risky! Oh, boy! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with Prix Innhoh? - The whole human factor was able to push the original custom that is missing in any way - the army looks more like the director-general and with some light - many screens on the screen and much less light on the screen - lack of some actor experience often threatens the rationality of the plot Is faced <br /> <br /> If you are OB Web (OB WEEN, I mean) and by Yoda B Enjoy ya theory as a force, then you do something about Buddhism and the ancient Japan in the form of books to read. <br /> <br /> Star Wars, IMHO, mainly a teacher from the spiritual heritage of his beginner, his father to his son, despite the problems. "De mind mango ton mango", (from my soul to you), such as Bijard to late Jane Master T Write to Deshimaru.
