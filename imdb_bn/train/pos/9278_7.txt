In the White Balloon and Crimson Gold, what I saw is the director of two other films of Jafar Panahi, dig deep in depth in a little page that seems to be on the page. On the offside, Sharahkomic respect for Sharah, women of Iran stands for their rights, I do not think he is successful. What he says is not important, of course (and it is very bad, like other Panhei films, Iranians can not see it). But, after a while, the film feels a flat flat, and it feels more than 90 minutes long. I'm not saying that, though I do not like it. The actors are all superb, and infectious to celebrate the end of the film. But in my opinion it is not an important thing.
