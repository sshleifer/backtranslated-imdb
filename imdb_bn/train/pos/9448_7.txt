This, undoubtedly, is the most annoying movie that I have ever seen. Although the first part of the movie is weird, it has a light and compelling quality. The journey begins with this peaceful note emphasizing the details and importance of the beauty of the Apalachia Mountains. But that belief is confusing outside. Obvious social problems (Inbreeding) and disturbances of rural people are the first dangerous aspects of the film. I can still hear moaning pain, and I shudder the thought. Luis's feet made me fool Yet, when the film was completely annoying and annoying, it raised some interesting questions. Is it right to take the moral, or other person's life? What can morality do to us, or in some cases, do not? And glory and moral integrity is more important than life? Although it can draw any conclusions from the film, it is an achievement (some aspects that was frustrating and scary) in its own right.
