This is the first movie made by Juan Croft and Clark Gayle and they are going to do a lot more. Crowford found a young girl in a crash in Star Market, and there is nothing left for him and his brother. They've never worked before and brother William Bockael got a job with the gang, who Gangster and Baccel thought it would be a simple job but got very fast on his head. Crownford became the reporter of a newspaper but wanted to work in big stories but provided the perfect thing to do. They had a genocide that killed some of Gaibel's killers and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. This is not a good movie but their best one.
