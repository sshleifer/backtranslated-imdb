This episode of the Twilight Zone combines a silent chapter (1890) with melodramatic acting and sight-seeing, it is a tribute to the original Buster Keton films. Many of the slapstick: fall in the door of a bachehead, running under a pedal, falling into a lotus. An intelligent scientist remembered Time Helmet, a flash gordon concept of what would happen in the future. Cheap prices for female prices of $ 1.95, or 17 cents for the beef, are more harmful than boosters. Even the world of 1890 was much more for booster / muligana. How frustrating if he misled the "modern" world of 1960! Booster was trying to go back! The "scientist" of that time wants to return to a quiet world, in 1890 he was educated and admired. They go back together, and Booster / Mulligan is happy now and does not regret the "scientist" electronic equipment, modern bed or electric blanket. So Buster sent him back with a crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> There is no heavy message in this twillight zone. This is his last attempt since the death of Booster Keaton in 1966. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
