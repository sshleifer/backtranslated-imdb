After dark, my sweet is filled with a great, modern silent, intelligent character, dirt road and of course, sweaty characters. It seems that in the last two or three decades the true big round people, where men's glissen and women, um, glysen. Why? Because it is tweak to hootate. And because everyone looks good wet (at least men do - sweating girls leave me clammy). Anyway - here may be some spoilers. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful example of a picture that should be a noisy - although regular pacing (although it is referred to as 'slowly' due to some attention disorder), clearly and broadly (although not easy) Tons of letters and atmosphere. Noir, if anything, about the mood and attitude. That's why great people's acting of 'great' is not characterized by your traditional definitions (see bogurt, micham, heart and nicolson) (they and their characters) were nothing but real - but their style and sinus was and there was a crime movie Which you just want). Or fast paced adventure (again all great noirs seem to be a slow burn like a cigarette). Great Noirs created an environment and you just live in it with letters for a few hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> After Dark Dark Sweet you do it - and it lets you enjoy some very interesting and complex characters company. Uncle Bude and Calli Plotter - Do not let the audience know what really ticks them - and Patrick and Darn (I love Bruce Darne) Pick perfect, especially Dern (see previous comment). They take the main outline of a character and give it depth and express our sympathy. <br /> <br /> The story is also interesting. Noir has the best plot in the world (rarely any mystery here - mostly it's mystery), but this one is difficult. If there is anything, the 'OK' plot can do more with Jim Thompson than anything else. With Thompson, the plot is almost secondary; He avoids the Hamat and Chandler laboratory stories for simple stories with powerful, more confusing characters. Check out a novel like The Killer Inside, and you'll see it directly (from the title). When it comes to Thompson, it's not about it, how about it (to quote Roger Ebert). So, really, a kidnapping is not a relatively easy plot point, and if you do not like it, good joke on you. <br /> <br /> Because of her daughter, why is 8 stars more than 10star? He's not bad, but he's not Angelica Houston or Anneet Bening (See Jim Thompson's The Detective's adaptation if you do not know what I'm talking about - this is also a good movie and your contemporary silent - it's the best of 1990s and bloody for the best title from Chinatown Challenges Challenges). She simply does not have chops (or look for that matter) and although she and Patrick have some chemistry, I do not have it with her. So there.
