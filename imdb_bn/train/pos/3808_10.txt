I voted for only 10 out of 10 because it's the best animated story I've seen quite a bit. Animation is stunning Artwork behind every landscape was beautiful. Do not rent the price from the industry to rent. I was overwhelmed. Moving out of beauty on the screen, you immerse yourself in a story which is constantly timeless and fresh. Although the development of the character development is minimal, it is still necessary to make these touchstone moments clear and clear to the viewer of how and how and where they have stood. I am fascinated by the whole thing and think it must be seen for the whole family.
