One of those beautiful intense movies that attracts us so deeply, it soon ends! I was looking at the screen, "No they are not!", Lull. Good performance around! Acting incredible with the outstanding Emily Blunt! I knew that the young film would give strong, credible performance to keep Victoria's reign, mood, and weakness through the whole film. Also, production is outstanding in every way: styles, materials and sensitivity. At an extraordinary time in Britain's history, an extraordinary surveillance queen said to her reign, through a very private and sensitive lifestyle of the school-age prince, afterwards she married Prince Albert, compared with her last birth to nine children. It was a well written playplay and flawless editing. Before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), before protecting his love, Robert was hated, wying to win the young queen's attention so pathetic and sympathetic young man as ever as a friend. Likewise, the drunk and Victim William (who does not like his mother) had a relationship between Victoria and his mother, which was occasionally angry. Acting and scenes were extremely emotional, captivating. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the historical and political situations of that era and, in fact, anyone likes a real romance story
