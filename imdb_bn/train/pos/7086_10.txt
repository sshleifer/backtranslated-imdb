NB: In Spoilers This great film "almost" many things "successful", their success successfully: science-time travel, troubled psychology, dostopian society, key-real syndrome, gradual weakness of belief system, global biotechnology and a stranger love story <br / > <br /> Violations of the story revolving timing raises the load of hot discussions - testifies in this site; Or, as an extreme, check out the research at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. In the room! In order not to mention the inspiration for Chris Marker's "La jetti", this kind of shock from the great works of author David and Janet People's people speaks of most brilliant conspiracy. Without any doubt, it is one of the most successful, interesting time-travel movies ever thought of. But there are many other levels here to talk about. <br /> <br /> The original genius of the film James Cole (Bruce Willis, while doing his career best) is here). His journey slowly progressed from gung-ho vaccine-hunted fighters to unhinged victims ?? And back again. Another broad piece of the story is James and Dr. Catherine emphasizes personal stories between the railway (wonderful Medellin stove). I love the aspect of relocating / opposing these two characters at once. For me it comes a head of fleaagag hotel room scene. By this point, James ?? Once gripped by an unshakable firmness ?? Now slip suspicious doubts about his own reality; When Railway ?? Cool and reasonable scientist ?? After absorbing James's evidence, after its horrific prediction, finally became wildly convinced. James frustrated with disappointment and to miss the mission to show how far he came. <br /> <br /> Zilliam makes us aware of these characters, especially through the tension crossroads of his life. Psychic roller coaster and mounting science-fi riddle / balance held in the thriller is fine. And the vacuum in the airport is heartfeltly intense because we see it coming so clearly through the dream of James. Right after James decides to leave all the mess here ?? And his madness is never a war ?? He does back up to the plate and does what he needs for mankind. See Jose and the Guns ?? (Previously, Hitcoak's "Vertigo" and identity switching / confusion are bright.) This is a movie that is far from the thoughts of humans. It only holds under the repeat view, claim it to them. "Twelve monkeys" are intelligent, provocative, bizarre, funny, and suspicious. The helpful cast is wonderful, especially Brad Pitt steals all of his scenes and shows great flexibility, such as Jeffrey Goesen, mad and deprived, but never survives. And as Dr. Peters, David Morse (interestingly how the film leaves the audience for his evil motivation) and Christopher Plummer. But Terry Gilliam's biggest honor is here - only - his outstanding "Brazil." (Parallel Lots, of course, the lonely warriors are trying to flee to their growing surroundings: without luncheon.) Each frame of this movie has its unique stamp and tone. Soundtrack is very awesome, <br /> <br /> <br /> In this 90 unique achievements it is my favorite, my favorite, and for a long time to be sure.
