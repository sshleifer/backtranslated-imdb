Virgil Manven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural farmhouse. One morning in the morning, his beloved cat had put his property in the woods, Manven's mind seemed like a kid in the middle of the wood. Police reported that he reported crime, but no body was found. After breaking his view, he investigated further and eventually led to a wicked orphan where the events changed to supernatural ?? "Soft for Digging" is a terrific experimental horror environment. This short film is almost completely omitted from the conversation. Some scenes are indeed wonderful at night and amazing acting. Location sets supply lots of turmoil: Arry Maryland Wood competes with rivals used in the "Blair Wight Project". Awesome film an opportunity. 9 out of 10.
