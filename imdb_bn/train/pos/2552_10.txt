Deadly error is a really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Shombing, Malcolm Stewart, and David Lewis are in the film. All cast of the movie really played. Robert Wagner played well in his role. The relationship between Saboto Junior and Turner was a wonderful one. There is probably a big difference difference but they have a unique couple. The two actors really worked together rather well together. The music of Ron Ramin's film is really good and Flickr fits very well. There is an element that happens in the movie which you do not know what is happening and what is going to happen next and this film will run from the beginning to the end. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr. and see this wonderful movie by Janine Turner!
