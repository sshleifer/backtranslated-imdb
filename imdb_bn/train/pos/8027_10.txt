I saw it for the first time when I was really impressed. The director created such a mysterious environment, especially to the end. All stories can be expected by the audience that Richard will really kill Thomas or he will do it first. But .. The main issue was not a conflict but friendship! The old and the mature one wanted to save herself, who has a whole life of life. It's amazing. Every time I see it! But this is very violent as every actor is filming but I think it is acceptable. Many thanks to Louis Lisa and Tom Bakerger! Amazing movie! I advise everyone to see it. I'm sure people will not regret and really get a good time.
