**** = A masterpiece recorded in books and can never be forgotten <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = a classic time; <br /> <br /> **** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Or a target error <br /> <br /> ** = Still still considered good in the area, but this action is prevented by serious problems or inevitable elements (e.g. /> <br /> <br /> * 1/2 = Most of the light blurred slightly by little moments <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > /> - Immune (strong violent elements, significant sex and language J) <br /> <br /> I hired this movie for you to celebrate the summer-summer-Brad Pitt face blockbuster-quality, but I was pleasantly surprised and frustrated. This is really a drama more, and that's too fierce ... I feel some emotionally intense Duchovny voice-over. <br /> <br /> Pete is probably playing her sex unreasonable film with her superb talent. Those who were frustrated but still disappointed as "white trash" husbands, they were perceived as fierce psychologically, shocked and nervous alcoholic. For some time in the next stage of the film, it was difficult to see him - he was unpredictable and scary. It proves very good writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is filled with bizarre, exciting scenes that do not hold me in my breathing multiple times, and I do not have any action scenes. I winped the conversation scenes so brightly that I actually winced and gasped at what I saw. It was like watching a lion and a lion in a hole and watching as they gnawed each other's death. Again, I am very impressed with the printer (s); Whom they have made impossible: mixed oil and water. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Juliet Lewis's performance. This day is so rare for this gifted young actress that it is such a joy when she does this. He brought me tears in his photo a few moments. I mean that. The passion that this girl can wake up on your head is unbelievable, and I clearly think that she has received a blueprint for several occasions. <br /> <br /> I think I am cheating on the proficient craftsmanship shown by filmmakers. *** Rating only "KALIFORNIA" *** A rating. But the dark feelings that it decreases are very strong and it's boring to raise. I believe everyone will see this movie though. I really do.
