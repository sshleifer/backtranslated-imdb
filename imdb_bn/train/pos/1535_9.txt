Thankfully, as a student I have been able to see "evaluation kill" for several years now. It is basically a doctor who resolved the murder with the help of his son LAPD, a young doctor and a patient specialist. Couple provide exceptional entertainment 8 seasons. It was different than watching it from other cop shows and price many times it was its cast and writing quality. The main actor gave good performance and Dick Van Dyke heard the entertaining roots of magic, dance and comedy. The best aspects of breath were speed-fast, malicious scripts and of course ankle-tapping scores. Sadly it has been compared to "Murder, he wrote". DM solves many difficult mysteries and more different pride. Now it's gone TV is a bad place Feeling days, family-friendly police shows have been. Now there is just 'silky' to be sad.
