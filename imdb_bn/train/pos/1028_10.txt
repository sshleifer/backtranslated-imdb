I started to say that from the beginning, when I saw a Stargate movie movie, I did not have any brightness or it was not like any movie of any science, with many possibilities, even though the film was not there, as well as outstanding, amazing stars such as Star Wars Like other Saif fi movies, if you are wise, you think one of the two titles is amazing Even though I am not as wise as some people, but I remember any lines in those movies, I'm not a big fan of Star Wars T-shirts, if you actually see me, then I want to see an average person in you. You do not have to be a hard-core fan fan to choose the series, which unfortunately is 10 amazing to reach its end in late 2006. After Tu ended. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie, but I was looking forward to the first season in 1997 and told you that special effects were only one in the bridge. Excellent thing about the series, chemistry has made a special impact in the characters, which is not better than most of the current advertising in today's day. I have to admit that if I am not for graduation, I will never go to science and my father, who gave me wisdom when I was 6 years old, and I was happy, otherwise I did not want to see a great show like SG1, Which is my opinion now sets the benchmark for almost all scientific fai series and movies, basically if a new science fiber series is not good or is like SG1 It is not worth watching but it is not worth seeing. Basically it's the best science movie of today, and if you do not see it then you have no idea that you have no absence!
