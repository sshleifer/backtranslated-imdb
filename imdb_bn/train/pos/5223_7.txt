It does not seem that this movie has been directed to please many people. First of all, many do not seem to see it in the first place (I've just accidentally entered it), and then reviewed and rated by rating, many of those who do not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. I usually tolerate cravings for her looks and her elegance, and even though I do not think her a great actor, I know she's very crazy (I like her Mr. Jones). But this performance is all different. She is not one of these beautiful, and she is not charming. His character is totally different from what I saw from him - old, ugly, broken, determined. And Gere, pulls off nicely in my best performance, so far between me. I think it's a sign of how well a senior actor shows his work, if you can not imagine anyone else instead - Hopkins thinks as a Hannibal Lacquer or Alongono on Washington's training day. It was so good that <br /> <br /> <br /> the others were fine for me. I think I could not play Dancing in this role, because in most cases I think he feels very good. But he did a really nice job, which held himself with a cage at the top, which is not a small achievement. Strickland provides the best supporting work, which requires a significant range from it. I actually think he owns the scene with Cerr and Danes, and it's pretty much achieved. <br /> <br /> So what is the status of the rest of the film without some extraordinary performance? This story is probably not surprising in the direction of 82 mm-yes, but the story of the drama "scary break in the ruku" and the attempt to save them is the girl (chin silence) A backdrop to develop these two main characters is that they help each other set their respective new stations. It's a lot to do in 100 minutes, but it's done well and we'll take care of the characters and finish what's going on with them. <br /> <br /> Direction and photography were enough. I used to work on the modern music-video camera movement and without cutting, but then I'm old-fashioned, and it was not really bad, actually I think it helped in the film's atmosphere, which might be guessed like you, big and big is a happy Not. <br /> <br /> valuable.
