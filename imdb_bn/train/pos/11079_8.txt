I always enjoy watching movies that I think and only dry up the answers to their audience. "Revolver" is one of these movies, and although many critics say it's hard to follow, I got it with a little narrowness and an open mind. First time True, it does not compare with other mind-disciplines such as "The Suspicious" or "Memento", but it is an intelligent and thought-provoking film in its own right. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really liked this picture is how beautiful! Every view, every camera seems to be thought of for ages. If you see it, you will know what you mean. So, to finish ... to see it open and you can enjoy it. If not, well, nobody is ever "Revolver" for everyone. And that's my 2 cents.
