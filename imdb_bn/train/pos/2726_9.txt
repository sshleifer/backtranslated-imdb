This movie has all the time with the classic. Music, camera shots, and acting are excellent. The black and white film has given it a good look and the music like the siqo is perfectly complementary. I wonder how so little people commented on this movie. My guess is that it is a hard movie to find out. I gave the picture 9. Watch the movie and you know what I mean.
