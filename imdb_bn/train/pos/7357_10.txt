OK, where do I start? ... this picture has changed my life! The plot was seamless. James Cahill has done himself. After initially seeing the first I was disappointed that I did not see it on the silver screen. However many of these DVD's were before exploring the features !!!! Oh, the story of my God, Jacks Kahl, was almost shameless as his acting. He told about the artifacts used by the film that you simply get to experience. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed by other actors. The scene of the girl talking to the security guard on the Hallway reminds me of my favorite blue pornographic films. I certainly live with Gangsta when she expresses her frustration in a continuation. <br /> <br /> I'm still moving away with every philosophy of martial arts efficiency, only indicating the location of the library, the mark matched the school ... and perhaps the man is maintaining it! A timeless classic and best movie for all Europe to come out of Europe! Where is my Oscar dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
