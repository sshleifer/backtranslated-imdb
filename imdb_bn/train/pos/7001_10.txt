I have never commented on a movie before. I saw this movie with my girlfriend last night. I commented that this movie is with you. Do it It has been around 24 hours and I am still fully influenced. This movie left me asking my own question. I can probably compare myself with a character as Ben who is completely selfish. I like this movie. I love to guess that until the end of the movie and keep surprising. I mainly experience two emotions, happiness and sadness. An amazing good movie and very very sad one. I wanted to be together Ben and Emily, but in the end, they were forever. If you have not seen this movie then check it out and see it. Just make sure you have no distractions. You want to see every nuance in this photo One for my library.
