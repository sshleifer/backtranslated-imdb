People are very sick about eocos! True, they are not the best things ever happened to Star Wars, but they happened, so tackle it! As well, they are beautiful, and I do not care if they are not marketable. Ibn Nub! <br /> <br /> This movie always leaves me in tears. It's okay. The end can not be the best. I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly bring the whole story from Luca to the next. I love how I am finally revealed - it will be settled very much in any other way. So take a moment to think about those who are complaining that the gentleman's helmet has been removed. It's very useful. For 20 years, the man who hides behind the mask has finally been released as a sick man. She is not completely machine - she is weak. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the casting director will choose a good actor in New Hope. They all are so good. They are credible characters. Hamill does an excellent job with the development of his dramatic character. Fisher has done a great job, which is a female role model (I mean, he came! Even when others failed, he even killed Jabba!). Harrison Ford - Do I Need to Say More? <br /> <br /> Again the music is bright. It is very sensitive and significant when choosing the theme themes in different parts of the film. When Luke "NOOO!" Shout, the best is Climax. And in the final battle blows to fight with his father. John Williams is not a talent short! <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is much more meaningful to me because of Episode I. I can not wait to finally see the theater (what can I do ???) Then see the original trilogy again. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bravo!
