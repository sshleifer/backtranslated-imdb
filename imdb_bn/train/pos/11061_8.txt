I too crossed the painful personal loss (double) and this film portrays the reality of the deepest wrench of that experience, makes life unbalanced, nothing understands, money relatives etc ... <br /> <br /> Ali was nice to see again. She is one of my favorite movie actresses of all time. <br /> <br /> As the story unfolds, I laugh. Great Story and Cast Savass!
