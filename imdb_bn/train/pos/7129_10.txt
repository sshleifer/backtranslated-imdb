This picture has been in my wish list for ten years and I recently got it on DVD when it was given to my partner's grandson. He saw it and was excited to know about my generation - was born in 1930 and moved to 1939 and he wanted to know more about it - and I Thankfully, I borrowed it from him and saw it on my own and I called everyone through it. It's not just that year's emotions, class differences, hardships and warmth of relationships between people of those years (as well as crypts (spoken and unmistakable), but it was right! When I was in an oracle ARP uniform, ambulance (LCC), in the right color (white ) And the operation of the bomb site and the prevention of the work of the Heavy Rescue Brigade. I am in error from my memory I could not stop it and sandbagged Anderson Sanctuary and WVS canteens brought it all back. The difference between the relatively unpredictable life of the village and the anti-war London was also intensely presented, I lived again in 1939/40 and my own Ecuition from London with this product! I know Jack Gold's work, and more such details are more than that It will not, but it went far more than the true right, and touched the human reaction and the trial of half the worth of those years, which was deeply touched by the fact that Sarta was one of the coolest stains in John Tha's acting career and Golden Direction and better known. Qualified. This is a fantastic movie and I have already ordered to send some copies to friends.
