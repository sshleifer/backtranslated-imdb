After 13 years of playing a game like The Great Acquire's Former Runner, this little British movie runs it directly with a thrill and gives the courage to overlap. The first part of the film is the set-up of our plays and the next exemption, the second part focuses on survival while trying to reach Sweden. The film is simple, effective, and yes, it relies on pure characters with reliable dialogue, and it achieves its goals in a disciplined manner. No small mystery keeps the film alive and as an adventure story, it works perfectly for a long time, so a big part of the film that can be the first of its kind? <br /> </ br> 7/10
