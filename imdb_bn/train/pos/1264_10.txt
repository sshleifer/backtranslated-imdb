The only reason to fight the death penalty Everyone in Europe who are satisfied will think. Everything in the United States is different. This film is shown in the first phase that the racist rebel may win justice against the American execution of the death penalty. In the death row, a young man has been released from law enforcement who goes back to defense counseling in this special case. But the image has a signal. In the United States, justice is completely targeted by retaliation. Justice abortion is simply driven by retaliation. A man from the local public attorney office told a man accused of lying The public attorney officer threw the complaint after a while and the young man went free. But he lost his college scholarship and some vengeful people thrown him, for which never smoking without fire. He hides his shame and oath to get his vengeance. But her sexual needs must be met, which is more psychological and psychological than hormonal and more powerful than hormonal and she can only do it with younger girls. The team with those other serial killers who apparently after preys similar kind. One day the local police followed their insights, some unclear situation in the killing of a young girl is managed by the material and they arrest the young chap we talked about. They beat him and mocked him for 22 hours and interrogated him in addition to bombs and telephone books and guns and Russian roulette. He admits. To be sent to death, he asked his grandmother to know the law professor of Massachusetts who was the husband of a local public attorney who accused him of false accusations a few years ago and was punished for revenge. This fails but it shows that as soon as the line of justice, police work and other security forces stop the line of full validity, some wrongdoing is done which could even destroy the case of the best accusation and it is the deepest thirst for the worst vengeance. Charging someone in a sensual way just as bad, the situational elements ruin the police or the trial. The best purpose of the police party is to be destroyed by some personal involvement and revengeful intentions, just as a person's life can endanger the material of excess situation in the form of evidence, in which only his circumstances will be threatened in full-time only, so easily canceled, with a good lawyer. If we do not want to go wrong, the film is a deep reflection of respect to respect and respect for values ​​and regulations, along with the police and the judicial line, which certainly does not justify the execution of the death penalty. Americans have the deepest belief: "We keep these truths as self-evident, the men who are created equally, are given by their Creator some immediate rights, of which life, freedom and pursuit of happiness." (Declaration of Independence) Life is an extraordinary right which was given to man by his Creator, which means that none other than this can accept it. Only God can take away the life of a person. The death penalty is an abomination that we do not have. Even if we do not raise God, we can not justify the death penalty without revenge, and here the movie revenge is the worst motivation for justice and public peace establishment. If the vendetta is kept aside, there is no other reason for this death sentence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
