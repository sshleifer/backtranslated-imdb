The movie starts fast, there are some slow moments in the middle, but usually it works well, there are some very good moments, then PETA comes out at the end of Act 3. I was able to see it twice in the LA premiere (with 2 different ends). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not the leading tomorrows of people. She is ridiculous and holds her own, but she served as a helpful actor as well. Julia Styles is 'OK' in a comedy role, new to her, but she should not be 'stolen', she should be a star of her ability. For an actress who has a lot of potential (10 things, save the last dance, hey), it is very difficult to play so many 'average' roles, and then she does not take her role and escapes with the movie (like Daniel Day -Louis 'Ganga'). Selma Blair is also a good young actress, and a 'okay' works. I do not expect the Academy Award performance from him, and he did not give one, but his performance was sufficient. Chris Coach has distributed another film which is 'above average'. Probably the problem is more than the scripts than anything else. I like this movie! But, this is not a movie where you go and say ... 'It was awesome!' ... This story has been long ago and there is nothing new here. The rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the film, and Larry Miller gave incredible performances in a supporting role (he might be the best actor in the film). If you want to watch a movie that may make you laugh a few times and enjoy an enjoyable evening, I can still recommend this movie, but if not until the end they change ... again ... leave the church scene, Or you will surely be disappointed.
