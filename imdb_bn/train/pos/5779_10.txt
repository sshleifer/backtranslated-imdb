At the beginning, I did not even know about this show for one year or more due to the Internet. I did not see it on TV in my country once, and many people usually do not know about this show. Although it is very unfortunate, because it is easily the most original and cute animation I've seen it for many years <br /> <br /> I'm not getting 10 points so much, but it's a show that really gives 10 points to everyone. Although at first glance it might seem like a general cartoon, but remember that this is not a baby show. When the whole story expresses itself, you know that it is a real deep story with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is basically based on the soul-animal, an old Indian believes that it has been preserved for many years. It gives a real twist to the shot that you do not often find in animated shows. <br /> <br /> The overall design is different. Occasionally it is a bit similar to spawn rug design terms, and other times it takes on more cartoony approach. I also believe in David Fischer and instructed cow and chicken to be animated in a section on the show (as he draws that segment of comic). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a mind-shaking show, but showcases various issues such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then it is something you should not miss. Once you start seeing, you are probably going to see it eventually. A small incident may show in lesser comic elements, but it is not very annoying. Where is the DVD but the only question?
