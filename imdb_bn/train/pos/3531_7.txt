Robert Seyodmak starred AB Nira, starring Ela Reyns, Frank Tone and Alan Cartes. And he does it, I can add without his help from many male actors, such as curtis and tones. It's all rain, a beautiful, tail actress who has not reached a point of one or the other's "silent" opponent. <br /> <br /> The use of symmetry in the use of sex, light, shadows and music is really remarkable as he tackles this genre. All effective in shadows, lighting effects, and camera angles. But the highlights of this movie are performed by refitting Alice Cook's very sexual drum in a nightclub, which is partly flowing through an enormous rain. This scene brings "Phantom Lady" to a new area. <br /> <br /> SyodeMac's promise for this element is met by rain, which gives sincere performance as a woman for a man's love. Frank Tone calls it. Allan Curtis thinks he can die and he does not seem to be happy as he lived. And he never seems in love with rain, except for a brief moment in prison. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting thing about a lot of pictures, as the progress of World War II, the interest in psychology is deep. But the words are often misinterpreted in films as "Possessed," "SpellBand," and "The World's Greatest Show". Tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomes - Tone probably has some paranoid disorder, but it seems to be close to the psychopath. Indeed, as proved by his headaches, he may have a brain tumor to push against his brain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
