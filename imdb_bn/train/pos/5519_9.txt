I was sitting in both parts of the night last night, I returned with a little bathroom break, and I could not remember before the 4 hours were over. I have to intend myself for a week because I have real 'things' about the director, producer and editor who pays attention to the long epic poem in front of me and I think it's perfect for 2 to 2.5 hours a movie. So 4 hours my extension of tolerance stretched and I was very suspicious about the whole initiative. But I will say that it is a beautiful? Could i say loving ?? Made movies and I really saw it I saw it. Director Steven Soderberg congratulates the transparency of his views. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Throughout the Cuban Revolution of 1959, Batista When I was a child in the 1960's, Che's pictures were everywhere; On the bedroom wall poster, on the T-shirt, magazine cover. Che's images will never be one of the more exploited. If the famous pictures are dependent, Che is a man looking secretly, symbol of revolutionary romanticism. If he was ugly ugly, did he think that he was so popular with universal imagination? Of course, helping young people die. <br /> <br /> Movies have been created earlier about Che (notably the excellent motorcycle diaries of 2004 that played helpless intelligent Gale Garcia Bernal, who traveled to South America and played helpless poverty) formed Marxist politics) but I do not think that Nobody has ever tackled the last story from the beginning, and these two potter is an ambitious projectI hope it will stop for sodergurges, but I can only imagine that the instant commercial success was not the maximum in his mind. <br /> <br /> The first movie (Agentin) meets Castro in Mexico and follows his journey. To begin the Cuban Revolution and then in 1964, the United Nations started its journey to New York. Cleverly black and white images look like contemporary film but do not. In 1966 again the new movie (Guerrilla) came up when Che came to start a new revolutionary movement in Bellevia. The second movie almost completely takes place in the forest. As far as I can see, it was shot mostly in Spain, but I still believe that it was certainly terrible for the movie. Fantastic as Benixio del Toro Che, he was born playing a part. <br /> <br /> Personally, I felt that Argentine (meaning part) was strictly more and more 'recreational' to watch movies. Sense, because it is passionate. They are victorious; Revolution will be successful. Che is his revolutionary cause leading an unequal band of peasants, workers and intellectuals to his element. The second part is very difficult to monitor due to the inevitability of its defeat. Recently Velacri - while having a good movie - exercises to show heroic failure, so I felt similar to the two parts of Che (guerrilla). We know at the beginning that he died, we know he fails. It is frustrating because the way the story has been told, the warmth of the revolution in Bolivia has been lost, it is quite evident. Cheke was considered as a foreign infiltrator and he failed to connect with the Cubans to the indigenous people. He continues to be abhorrent to see which is frustrating because I can feel that when he should leave and move on to the other side, perhaps more successful, enterprises should know. The movie is not very romantic to him. He killed the man, he executed, he struggled with his asthma, and followed the reasons for a long lost after leaving and leaving, he left the only wife to bring five orphaned children. <br /> <br /> But a classic exercise in making classic cinematics overall. One note; When I saw the United States-trained Bolivian soldiers pulling the small band of Che and his fighters together, I reminded me in the Butcher Cassidian final. I often go back to my husband and say, but frustrated, it seems like he will find such thoughts and go out of the place. After we left the theater, he turned to me and said, "Do not you think the last mercury was like a cassidary ????????????!"
