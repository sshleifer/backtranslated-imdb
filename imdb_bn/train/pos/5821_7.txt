I'm really surprised to read some of these comments. Some people were looking for a plot ??? Okay, after the video was released a decade ago, I saw it for this: Music Videos Collections. This is not a movie. It's not a plot, it's not a central tale. It's rather artistic dancers rather than most taller videos, but all of them have been done smartly or creatively. These days, Michael Jackson may be considered scary, but, above all, this person who gave us the thrill (many considered by most to be the greatest music video ever) and created trends in Billy Gene and Bit Bricks. Along with Munawalkar, he and filmmakers and artists who cooperated with him again took his music and dances to create some different recreational elements, soil, special effects, live performance footage and even self-parody ("Border" sequence). And to be surprised at what Jose Pesci is doing, this video just tad out before becoming a family name, and he is one of the film's most memorable appearances. And, IMHO, I think the smooth criminal order (choreographed section) Michael Jackson hit something else!
