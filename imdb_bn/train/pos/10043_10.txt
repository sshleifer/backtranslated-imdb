This movie has re-written the history of the film every time. Nobody thinks about anyone thinking about this movie, because it crosses criticism. Each error in the movie is easily overcome by many wonderful things that are going on for it. This is a very beautiful movie, and I doubt that many of us will be able to see it again. I've seen it more than I've counted, and I still feel relieved every time, with feelings of feeling. One for ages.
