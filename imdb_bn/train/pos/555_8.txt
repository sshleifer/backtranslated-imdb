My comment has been added to RELEASE DATE, but I could not find a place for it. In February 1955, the film was released in America, I was really surprised. It was seen in a "first run" theater in DC in March 1958 in Washington. Is it republished, or some problems? In my opinion, this movie is very light entertainment, but there are some classic characters. John McIntyre works as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan originally played the same role before the red river years ago. And, in my opinion, James Stewart did a good job as he did. I saw this movie half a dozen times or more, and I did not see any part of it again. Photography and scenery are fantastic, and it offers an extraordinary amount of entertainment within an hour and thirty-six minutes.
