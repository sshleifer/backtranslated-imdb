Although the show has closed air since 1973, after watching the DVD set, I lented it in our library, I feel felt to say a little about it. <br /> <br /> I remember when it was only a colorful show in the 1960s and sometimes in some color television, it would be a "Sunday Night Party" with friends to see it in NBC. <br /> <br /> I never really enjoy the name and the date, but how it affects us today and can be so deep based on the most unscrupulous steps of the time. In the case of point: Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world due to silver, found its name from a character called "Old Verginie", who was destroyed from a salon in the city early <br/> <br /> Old Vargin did not want to waste this event, because the precious fluid moves around the dirt, he decides to name the "Virginia Town" city Was. This area became known as Comstock Load because the other character Henry Comstock tried to jump on everyone's demand, and this area became known as Lowcastle Load. <br /> <br /> I just saw an elementary stage with these 2 topics. Other episodes deal with the literary emergence of Mark Twain, when the region's enterprise reporter ... <br /> <br /> This was a healthy (and often educational) family entertainment. Someone else commented that each episode really would be considered as a movie on its own right-rich script and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that blurred the truth was that it was near Virginia City and Pandoraosa. In fact, to move from Pondosa (all north Lake Tahora), the horse will have to run 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) below the Spooner Summit for the Upper Desert (3,000-4,000 feet) of the Corse Valley. 30-40 miles away from the city of Virginia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But every writer must be astray with the truth. <br /> <br /> How do I miss the show today?
