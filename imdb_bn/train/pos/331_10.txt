The 370-minute film was broadcasted on Italian public television in the early seventeenth century. It tells of the legend given to Homer by the Odysseus Journey Home after the Trojan War. It is an epic story of ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilization, which was called about 500 years later in about 1100 BC. <br /> <br /> This is a 1969 film, so if you bought the DVD version, the word is not just a language other than the Mono and Italian languages, even the caption is in Italian language. Mercy Many people will enjoy this great essay if English subtitles are in the list. But if this is not a problem for you, I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
