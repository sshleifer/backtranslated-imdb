I really enjoyed this debut by Rigger Director, Redo Knockout. If you have seen the ring before, you will be aware of this flick style and concept. It has gained fine subtlety, which works better than constant (and expected) stinger, which affects most of the mainstream films of this genre. If you like movies that give you cold, you probably like it. The Redo Knockout is a good, wonderful newcomer. 8/10
