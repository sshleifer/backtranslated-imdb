My girlfriend and I have a thing for the robot. So I try to find out the movie there are robots. And this movie has a robot. Big ones They bang out each other, with the fate of the nation hanging in the shack and balance. It's really nice. You must forgive the film's many losses and try to understand what was able to keep the director and his crew technician on the screen while working with tight budgets only. This movie is very difficult to dislike. Because those big robots. They looked like a transformer and they fought like pro wrestlers! This made my girlfriend smile. And that's good enough for me. And the character of the world should be made from actor Paul Kocaelo: Like the Russian villain, like a roaring Russian villain, he mercilessly surrenders to his helpless opponents or complains that his closest closeness to his barrage is "his blood taste" (a line he is a delicious Campi Sub-Bella Lughosi provided the pronunciation) He definitely got a ball at Whenever Bang Bang is on-screen, he enjoys a lot of benefits. It's a little flush with a nifty that deserves its civilized reputation.
