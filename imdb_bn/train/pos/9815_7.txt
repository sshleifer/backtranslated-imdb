The first feature film with Robert De Niro (although not released after a year), it is worth the watch. De Niro's role is not huge, but as a friend of friendship, for the first time to befriend him to follow him, first two friends seem to be interested in trying to follow him. No Season Hard De Niro fan arguably the best actors today to get a kick out of an initial performance.
