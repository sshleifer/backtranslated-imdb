I have seen 'New York: I love you' today and love it! I was waiting to see it after watching Paris J. Tiime and overall I think I liked it better ... I would definitely see 'Paris J T'Ime'. I do not know. I read some reviews about New York here: Ailey and yes, the film is not as a result. When you are paying homage to a city like New York - it can be overwhelming and does not seem quite suitable for the city's fair trial ... So what I will write without giving details of any errors in the film. <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> Contrary to Paris Jesse'iim, each director's small image was properly summarized and titled, NY: Not an II and many issues here The thriller story and the limitlessness found here is annoying and even confusing. I thought otherwise I fell in love with one stream after each other and I especially loved the characters overlapping - it could be jealous because it is often in film now. But I still like it because I did not force it. And the idea that we are finally connected with has an intense, even radioactive quality - which may look a little bit, but I can see beautiful. <br /> <br /> I like all the pictures but touching Robin Wright Pane and Chris Cooper with my most Ian Atal It was so good work and script that was finally published - again not unused in the past - brought me to the tears and I started crying in all the sections I followed. I always like Right Pen and now I'm a fan of Chris Cooper. Just before standing out of the restaurant, in that precious few seconds, just before the call - tell the volume about the ability to express a character that Copper does not say. Most of this story of <br /> <br /> includes the characters that meet with everyone for the first time or have recently met each other except 4-5 stories so that the letters are known to each other for a long time. It seemed to me (and I could be wrong) stories were different but they tried to make everyone realistic, looking back and looking at the new light and seeing what we know in our lives for a long time; People and people around you look at someone newborn and express gratitude with them as you met them and saw them for the first time. <br /> <br /> The other films I liked were Orlando Blum and Christina Rixi with Julzi Christie, Shiite La Bauuf, along with Natalie Portman, Anton Eelchin and Olivia Tharbeli, along with Shulzi Iai, Carlos Aquista and Taylor Gear. And John learns with Hart Kapoor and again when Ian Ethan Huq and Emily O'Hanna get together Is aphete. I would see more work by Yvan Attal as I really liked him a lot! <br /> <br /> Overall, watch this movie with an open mind. Do not read the reviews before watching it! It can not meet your expectations about a movie and love in New York, and I suspect that any film will actually be in that concept. Just like some good music, beautiful landscape artists, life comfort of some parts and a story or two that can only be inspired by your heartfelt.
