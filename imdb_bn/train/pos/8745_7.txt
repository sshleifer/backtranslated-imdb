After high school graduation, the best friend Alice and Darlin decided to go to Thailand. They have there, they met a charming Australian guy named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asked them if he would like to take a weekend trip to Hong Kong with them. They agreed. Although at the airport, they became brutal for smuggling narcotics and they were convicted for 33 years in Thai Thai jails for doing so. The American lawyer living in Thailand did not know what they could not do until the end of contact with Yankee Hank. If you have the word you can help it. Things start well, but they still can not find out. <br /> <br /> The movie is really good because it is not what is going to happen and it is always interesting. I can not believe though the end. It was in an end where you did not know 100% of the truth, but still you know what was happening with Nick and drug smuggling 'owned' etc. Because of this, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Danes and Kate Beckinsale both give quite good performance here. Beckinsales performance was a little weak though. Both Dances and Bacincelle are friendly, but it may seem strong. Paul Walker also has a small stranger role here. However, I thought the Brocadon Palace was a good movie and I gave it 7/10.
