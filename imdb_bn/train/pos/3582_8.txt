Here is another 80 movie that most people do not know. This slow, beautiful (Montana landscapes love scenes are exciting and reminds of Castner's recent "Open Range", which plays Robert Dual), and emotionally rewarding film is the perfect night of movie to watch the only night you can sleep or strangle on Sunday afternoon No People in the right mood will be treated with a fine detail and intimate look on the affair of a family and how they will be returned after the little boy shoots casually and kills the eldest son. All of the performance is top notch and quietly nuanced. Glenn Close, Robert Dual and Wilfried Brythley are the creators in their background, as all supporters and young actors. I especially like Director Cain (unfortunately, without the first "Young Guns", it does not give any direction to the notes), it gives little hug in each of us's personal sorrow. We do not simply see how younger brothers or parents influence death, but the confused middle sister, the wrong uncle, his crazy wife and the girlfriend of the dead teenage girl. What we mainly get here is the rural middle-western answer "normal people". There are shadows of David Lynch's "The Strait Story" in the worst middle-class morality shown on the people pictured here and the loving hunting shots of their resident farm. This is a better and more realistic "Tier-Joker's" era, and it's a nice little look for the great movie hunters for you.
