Thelma Ritter pictures were stolen I just finished watching it again. I could not help to become emotional in his final scene. She did not get an Oscar. That's why you do not have to trust more in the Oscars. Richard was not a good part of Wydmark, and the 3-D, perfect man was cast as a defective man. Gene Peterson was beside the road, as a tough girl in her best role. And Richard Kinney certainly could have been very good; Why did I hate him so much? Yes, there was heavy transfer of patriotism; But, without this you have no pictures. Look at their faces! The top three stars did not really need much scripts. I would have seen these films without their dialogue. You've sometimes seen Raymond and Rita Gam in "The Chief", probably you know what I mean. When I was my child on the first trip to New York in 1956, my uncle Uncle took us to the 66th Street at the foot of South Street. I knew that Hollywood can not be trusted. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I do not exclude most stories because I know when I look at it for myself, I hate what happened. If you have seen it, no precision is needed. Just maybe, some people reading this comment did not see "south road pickup." You'll like it; Do not go to search for 66 South Street in New York City
