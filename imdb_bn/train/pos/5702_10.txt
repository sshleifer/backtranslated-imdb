I did not expect the Wall Killer to be trusted John Holmes, but I forgot myself that it was not pornographic. In fact, the whole cast has turned into a great performance on this extremely low-rated movie. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, look for two disc sets and first see the "Wade" documentary; This will give you many backgrounds in the story which will be helpful in praising the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people feel dissatisfied with the LAPD crime scenes video in DVD. There are several reasons to include it, one of which was the first US trial in the murder of John Holmes where such footage was used by the prosecution. If you do not want to see it, it is easy to avoid. This is clearly marked as "LAPD Crime Sina Footage" in the menu!
