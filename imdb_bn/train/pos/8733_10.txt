When I bought my Toy Story Tape while coming to the video after the release of the theater, I saw a trailer for it from the toilet studio makers. As soon as I saw that I knew it would be a good feature! I was right! A bug's life like Toy Story is great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are the voice of late Pixar Stormman Joe Runcht by Dam the Galloot Beatle Brad Garrett and Hemlich Catpillar. In my favorite scene when Slim Walking Stick (David Heide Pierce) is trying to confuse Hemlich like birds and Hemlicht, you're Mr. Huley did the early bird. I'm going to snap like how nice a stick on a stick and slime! I'm going to snap! I just smiled in that scene. As a big fan of insects, I think this Bugs Life is my favorite pixar, though I know it's considered to be the worst picture of Pixar! I can not hate Pixar picture! I think they are all beautiful pictures! PIXAR GOOD WORK!
