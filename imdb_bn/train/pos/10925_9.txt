I really liked this movie. I can see it regularly and do not tire it. I think this is one of my criteria for a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. It introduces us to 6 characters; Each has a unique Kung Fu style that is very secret and very fatal. Each of these characters is trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other. Sixth poison of dead mother language, trying to make some of her students suspect her student to make a wrong mistake. <br /> <br /> How can the last student find another gene? How would he know their bad? The answer to this question is how it makes the movie awesome. <br /> <br /> We also see that genes fight each other in each combination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not better than this.
