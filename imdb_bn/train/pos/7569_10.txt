At the time of our culture, the fact that the story emerges as a story reveals the small and big screen, "Apprets from the movie" is a film that reveals a movie that is more honest, fresh and innovative in real life. I've never seen before Normal lime confectiones are not present in this movie, sit in the audience of a content and leave these real-life moments to the tune of one after the other. While filming and even thinking about the post, it is difficult to believe that this amazing performance is really where, performance. The actors felt the truth to reveal each moment with their big cast in their daily normal life. Even "from him" it does not look like a documentary or reality television, but rather its unique paintings and in turn are transformed into its own category. I look forward to seeing this new series, with the directors of Jennifer Schoenin and Randy Walker, the other film directors. <br /> <br /> This movie must be seen.
