Rob Roy and emotion and action epic epic! In some million speakers. Liam Nixon has given a great performance like Rob Roy McGregor in his career. Jessica Lange is the letter perfect as her wife Mary. I saw the most passion and chemistry in their screen couple. John Hart is his best graduate aristocrat performance. Team chariot illustrates one of the great screen villains. Mary is unpleasant and harrowing her rapes. She really is a magnificent bastard in this movie The ultimate dualism between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best ever swordcrafts. The script answers north, and the direction of Michael Caton-Jones is flawless. 10 out of 10
