Being myself from a small city in Illinois, I can relate to this movie immediately. It was made in the era of the times, the people of the city have seen helplessly that I grew up. Yes the plot is so much. And yes, acting will never be nominated for the Oscars. But that's not the point. The point is to suspend the reality and just have fun. And there are lots of fun in this movie. From the greedy, the deputy deputy is not able to understand the banker well, this film was created to make fun of the Saifi fan and the small town residing in its best. Enforcer Drone or Verne Droid Eye Who Can not Laugh? And I love FarmZoid. When I was growing up, I had one. Overall, considering the technology they enjoyed at that time, it's a delightful romp in a childhood, when you can sit back in the afternoon on a poppill, and laugh at the living room of a small town. This is a movie that I want to show frequently and frequently, frequently and frequently.
