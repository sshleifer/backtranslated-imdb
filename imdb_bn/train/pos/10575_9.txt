Speedy, funny, sexy, and spectacular. Cagney is always awesome Blondel charms you with her intelligence and strength. It is clear that it is a pre-censorship film by scripting, dressing, and innuendo in the way they touch each other. Bikini was before the bikini! Hanging for this is no holds for any fun. Although I do not understand John Garfield issue though. Is it in this picture or does not matter? If he is, he is a screen so small that he is essentially a prop. You need to see it frames by frame even if he's there. I have a big Cagney fan, but have never seen this one before. I found it in the classic Turner. I found it by a wonderful accident. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
