The second film of acting Debol, written by Imtiaz Ali, is the first directorial effort of Shibam Nayar. Soha has probably played the role of meat in her first (?), The girl who escaped from the house and is waiting for her marriage to Delhi's marriage registrar's office to meet her boyfriend Shyan Munshi. He waits and waits and finally sees Ankesh (Abhay Deol) as a daughter in distress. He spent many days eliminating him from a sad situation in one day and eventually fell in love with her. Then the boyfriend returned! Hey Pardi Dikhi! Sound familiar? It is still another adaptation of White Nights in Dostevsky, which is a small point of borrowing from Noti Bianchi (although very small - Ankush lover is addressing her boyfriend as dead!). But it is a full and more realistic (duh) adaptation over and overlawn Saawariya. I wonder why someone did not bring this little gem, when we were discussing Savaria like mad a few months ago. <br /> <br /> Delhi setting is excellent - compulsory run through old Delhi, shot from Jame Mosque, on the street with rooftops, conte circus, rickshaw (what? how?). The colorful lighting fixtures in the hotel are enough to tell you the hours that are connected to the room! <br /> <br /> The more I look at, the more I like this young man. In this second film he is beautiful enough for a tenant witness, who has maintained the purpose of life by a beautiful woman. Soha looks beautiful, and when she laughs, she fits the role, but I think she feels incredible at a more serious moment. I'm not sure if he can be a great actress, or maybe he'll be late as a brother. The music is not great at Himesh Rashmiyya, and in reality, the songs fail in this movie, they block the kind of story and do not sit well with the character to sing their songs. Support is nice to throw and I give this thumbs up to a White Night adaptation. I love the pictures of BTW - Abhiyay Deol, which I have nothing to do with my ratings.
