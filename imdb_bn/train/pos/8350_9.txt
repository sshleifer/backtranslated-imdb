With that film we always follow the incredible if we are involved in the courage of the 2 lead character. But when C + J drives sex for the trip to go back to childhood, this pair can look at their sexual behavior even in exploring homeostoroticism. Most of them get acquainted with sexual harassment or reluctant partners, and despite their deeply non-PC behavior, everyone laughs. Like C + G, through it they are innocent in the heart, rebels against rebels, bourgeoisie, rebels against restrictions. Someone else commented, I do not want to know this 2, and it is a small miracle that most of their travels are comedy and very little tragedy (and none of them can be kept at their door) and because of it, it fools me but sweet With taste Courage I can say that only French can go away with such a film. And that's part of their talent.
