Personally, I absolutely love this movie and novel (I read the first book and decided to watch the movie). First of all the plot is really original and one of a kind. The acting is also great and I love Cast. Jude Crandal (playing Fred Guin) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. There are also some authentic lines (if Edek can be pure), but they really light up the mood and make a good smile. The main atmosphere is really a perfect spot for the movie and it attracts you throughout the whole movie. Just do not love it but if you want to see it again and again, I'll recommend this awesome fan 100% !!
