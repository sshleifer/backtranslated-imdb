Nour Films of 1940 - Many of you are a great fan of the real thing - but the Red Rock West was the real act of our interest for the past. In the last ten years, the term 'neo-noor' has often been used as a suitable creator, which has lost its meaning and its effect. On the other hand, John Dahl's film is truly worth mentioning. Welding is all-around perfect and felt right at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so tight that you are locked in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would appreciate it. Many contemporary films make me wonder why they do not use them, and I'm not even old. Movies like Red Rock West give us hope for our future when we pay tributes to the past.
