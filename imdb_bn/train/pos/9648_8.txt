I liked this film too. The story jumps behind a bit and it is not easy to follow. There is no resolution to the story, and you have left to wonder what really happened. As I like this kind of picture, I've enjoyed it. I especially like the "dating" scene among boys and I was dragged into their lives. And certainly get a few extra points of a movie with a nude staufen Rideau. ;-)
