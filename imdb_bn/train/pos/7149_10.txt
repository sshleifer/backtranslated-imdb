A wonderful film to see the hole. There are good messages in it, such as: Be a good friend, never get frustrated. I highly recommend it to anyone. I'm still saying the movie is better than the movie, but the movie gives the book a run for its money. Also, Khleo plays Thomas Zero. That really adds it to !!!! Ha ha ha !!!
