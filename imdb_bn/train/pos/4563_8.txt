This picture is based on a difficult story to imagine, and how Christie could accomplish this miracle, so the heart stirred. Daniel Day-Lewis is an incognito, it's hard to imagine how much he has tried to make this capable character. A sudden and exciting experience to see him on the screen. <br /> <br /> As I was thinking earlier, the movie is not so neutral, the story is bright and playful. Christie's ideals are not trivial, her life is also colorful and colorful, although we may be aware of loneliness and painful friction through her loneliness. <br /> <br /> An important element of Christ's success is that his mother's support seems to be more sensitive, and unknown actress Brenda Fricker also qualifies her Oscar for this role, this lean middle-aged woman is all about to make the dream of Christ true. Using Lucky for Christie! And Hugh O'Connell is as nice as a young Christian, no performance for a child! The love story of Christ is very good, trustworthy. Christie loves love and can not enjoy the right to love, beautiful Dr. His crush in Aileen Cole (amazingly played by Fiono Shaw, I was deeply influenced by Harry Potter's role in Syria, of course Anne Patonia, so its appearance is really out of my mind, but any woman has her own youth. .) Crazy and obnoxious, I have sympathy for her, love is a two sharp sword, happiness and trouble next to each other <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> BTU, Jim Sheridan's work is trying to get better without all the good (America, boxer etc), God knows why he chose to manage that frog! Really carrier stain, what a sadness for him!
