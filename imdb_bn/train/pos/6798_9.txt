(No spoilers, just plot details) I do not understand such hate for this episode. Do you want to see a bad episode of Chawlivi? See subtrain - Now there is a sack of crap. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I do not say too often), and Michael Rosenbaum is awesome, but he is mostly on time. The scenario of the alternative universe seems eerily realistic. Martin Manhner, who appeared before "static", told Clark that the doctor in the insanity shelter was actually a fan from the zone, and if Clarke wanted to return to the universe, he must kill him. Good acting and with a decent pace, overall great episode.
