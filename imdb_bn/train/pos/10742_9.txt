Commented on solid film, how do you say it bad? Well it's not, but it's hard to say it equally well because it's good. What is it, to see it interesting, it will be destroyed as close to it, the more it will be closed. The pictures of tsunami coming to the coast of Thailand have brought life, you know that if you want to go back you will see. <br /> <br /> <br /> Nawad's brothers handle the commentary very well, even the most tragic situation is sad, do not see what is happening in other countries, not insulting. The events are in cellulose and little is needed to understand or understand what the audience is seeing. <br /> <br /> You can not change history and you will not want, this film has stood as an agreement for its darkest hours Humanity.
