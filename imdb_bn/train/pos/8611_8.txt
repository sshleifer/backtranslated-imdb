I enjoyed watching this film too. I tap it while viewing it so that I can review it later. I actually enjoyed watching the second, because I was able to absorb the clever dialog between the two main characters Natalie and Adam. I thought how this story was created was very exciting. Natalie was going to communicate with her girls friends, I was very impressive with her, first of all, she seemed to be spreading a lot of discrimination, but once she started discussing happily, I had to see how to express this vision. I was not frustrated. Slowly Sarah began publishing a girl in her secret mystery, who was not so perfect, we had a defective man, who wanted his independence from a dominated mother, who thought he knew his daughter, but unfortunately, he had to learn very painfully That sometimes you really will give them someone their freedom. Ultimately, viewers stuck with this movie have seen very sensitive performance from Dean Keaton (who always wonders, even some of his less well-received films - city and country). It was good to wait for Diane Keaton to see the driving scene of the house, that anyone who loves other people should know that we must save our own lives, we love others, but we do not own them and we must go to the end. It's a tough lesson but it's better to think now and then. Thank you CBS for this broadcast, it was a long wait.
