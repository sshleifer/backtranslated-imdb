Fantastic romantic comedy that fits nicely and closes the actors with specific comic timings, an achievement that is beautiful to look at. When the cheerless drunk of the Chair tells her to help keep her at peace with her malicious, Moody younger brother, then no one can dream of the consequences of his followings. Operating symbol, confession of Catholic church, love of biting and falling snow ... "Moonstruck" timeless and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes to cover the picture (the grandfather and his dogs are very rough in the graveyard, and the following scene with the Kosmo and the old man hiding in the gate), but the patchwork of the plot is shiny efficient, and the movie's melodious voice and curiosity Both infectious. **** to ****
