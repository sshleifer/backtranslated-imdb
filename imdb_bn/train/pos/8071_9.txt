This image related to the Irish rebellion in the 1920's and especially after granting a donation to a person's life and giving it to a friend for subsequent consequences. Seeing the film, I felt that you can accept the script and can do it again with just a few minor updates, sadly, contemporary events will still fit. But T-rim will not be nearly as good. Victor McLaggeller (for which he got an appropriate Oscar) played a great role and, in most cases, cast a great pair, if at that time the actor does not have all actors with the bros, but most of them are recognized actors or established at the time. Good value of watching a very good film Highly recommended.
