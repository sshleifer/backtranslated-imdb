Hello, This little film is especially attractive to an artist, filmmaker or musician or visual artist: <br /> <br /> Someone can see David's touch / style directly in a small part of a relative simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the lithic spacing of shots, pan and sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even as a general movie, this creation has many levels. For example, some words that are drone along with others, (though delicate) are present, some specific shots support certain shots. <br /> <br /> Someone can see more than one pan: Some go up and down, a gentle way behind. There is a diagonal pan. Zooms sometimes go out and out. <br /> <br /> The lightning and structure / nature of the elements in space is normal and obviously, the work of a painter / artist. This may even be felt in this crappy room. This is to say: By the simple art of visualization / visual composition, someone can already create fine art. Then comes the visual fossiline: Degonels, Parallel, etc. Mild Degree and Color, Even though not doing much research for textures like big productions, very good. This is an artist's sketch ... <br /> <br /> These are not counted but are done with internal feelings and this feeling gives David's touch / feel as true artists.
