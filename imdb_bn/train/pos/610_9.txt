Although Stardust seems to be an imaginative movie with predictive end and average performance, it certainly does not. When I watched the movie, I knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> <br /> StarDest is a lot more than an adventure movie. From the beginning, till the end of the film, this witch is 'Aara'. The storyline is well written and puts it on the edge of your seat. Like every story, it is a brief summary of morality. Therefore, we know in our hearts that the evil brothers will not take the throne, but the innocent son who manages to deal with obstacles and difficulties during his journey. We also know that real love is not Yeween and Victoria, brilliant girl and shallow. <br /> <br /> I have to pay extra credit to Claire Dons. He literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this glossy fit that its character fully fits. Moreover, he and Cox have chemistry that make romance more prominent in movies. The rest cast is a famous actor and actress, who certainly makes Stardust an attractive and "highly classified" film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is fantastic, the location is magical and the plot is interesting. The film was very disappointed with not being nominated for more rewards. I would give at least 9/10 stars for this.
