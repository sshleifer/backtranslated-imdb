As far as I can remember, the changes to Balachine's changes in the scores of Tilakovski are as follows: <br /> 1) The last part of Grosswaterstein's (a traditional tune game at the end of the party) is repeated repeatedly, before children end up with their last dance <br /> <br /> Written for Tikovsky's scores for Soling Beauty, but a written volume is lonely, the end of the party scene and the split transformation scene. Blanchine has chosen this music because of its honeybee relationship with the music for the growing Christmas tree. <br /> <br /> 3) Sugar Plum is the only one for Fair Cavier. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that how Balacchin has done a miscarriage so badly that Kakovsky's great score is wrong.
