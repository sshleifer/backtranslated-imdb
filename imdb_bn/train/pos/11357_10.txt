"Citizen X" is a genuinely true story in search of one of the most deadly serial killers in history. This story makes it even more compelling where it takes place; Soviet Union in the 1980s <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is looking for the apparent existence of the past and the same person. The killers have become frustrated because no one has ever found any problem to investigate the evidence. He is driven to find and stop the killer. His only tool is his dedication, efficiency and honesty. His obstacles are the corruption of the Soviet system and the political ideology that frustrates the quest for truth. His atheistic failure was not for his boss, Col. Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy. However, he wants Burakov to bring the killers to justice, even the official party line "There is no serial killer in the Soviet Union!" <br /> <br /> <br /> Cast is outstanding Location and set are the perfect recreations of Soviet life the next day. Randy Edelman's score is particularly good. More important, this movie shows a dark and annoying criminal phenomenon with intensity and brutality. It is a movie made for HBO Films films and they have become a great asset for movies that would not otherwise be created.
