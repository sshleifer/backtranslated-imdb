With the musical numbers, the mystery of this murder is limited over the atmosphere and character but also about the senses and amplitude. Based on the Broadway Shawman Earl Carroll and others a stage, it integrates a hoodunate plot with a backstage ambiance (a dramatic investigation takes place in an open place on the theater where a musical revival is being held). <br /> <br /> Cast is impressive and varied: the hard-cocked Victor McLaughlin is investigating as a police officer and some shows fail to fail stupidly in showing the sight; Jack Oki (former Jack Lemo ?? or Jack Lemon's poster Jack was Amy?) As frustrating director, who has to coordinate the visible performance and chaos behind the scene; Homie Jessie Ralph forever as a clothing accessories with deep, dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who got a stunning close friendship in the end, as the dummy maid ridden with the love of a man. Carl Bryson, Danish star, very male-like, classic "cocktail for two" once but not twice once; Kitty Carlisle, "Watch Do Hey Koa Kwa and Koth Do and Do Go" and other Johnston-Caslon songs; The glorious Gertrude Michael, who is very soon partner from us, is a medium cheerful showgirl whose love for Brisson is spurned; Generally ridiculous Toby Wing, who is at least a laughing-moving mobile center here. <br /> <br /> When the plot complexity goes out of hand, it always plays an interesting role and confuses the fun and safe musical number to the viewer. The most popular sequence of the film is "Maruhana", which is led by Michaels, but far from his controversial history, it is actually one of the few musical offerings. Here all the songs have been guided in such a way that they can actually fit into the standard quality theater of theoretical theater in opposition to the Barclay Style cinematic fantasy setup.
