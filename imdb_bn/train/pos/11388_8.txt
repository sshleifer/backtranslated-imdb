If it seems, Yar Gershwin, George's songwriter and brother, suggested the Garcin catalog for this photo, and it was hijacked by the creators. In many cases it was a standard 50 movie musical by Fried Unite in MGM and Vincent Minley was directed with a lot of help from Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Gershwin was the greatest all Broadway musical group but, in my opinion, George himself was among the greatest of all American musicians, duration !!! Jean Kelly, of course, is the second best male ballerina of the movie musical (guess like another?) And I do not imagine that her cast was ever skeptical. But, I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation: Oscar Levant was a famous figure in his time, and as the real friend of George Garshwin, he had to stay in this movie. He was a talented pianist and even a moderate talented composer, as well as a well-known neurotics and hypocondrictor, and he always played himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie was unknown at this time and she was French "Gamin" type. A talented dancer, he was not a real beauty. George Guetti who took part of Maurice Chavalier, oh, I want to say Henry Bourell, Greek and not French, but he must be more than just like French Boulevardier. Even though the young is too young for it <br /> <br /> The hipher voice of the gene is serviceable here but there are many good vocal tools in Guetari. Clearly, in the "lion" rain where the jin went better elsewhere, where his character was counted even more, he even showed himself as a very heel (he was not there, nothing was done in the Broadway musical instrument, Joey's original Hill Joey). I was not so excited about the "I Got Latham" scene that my children are not spontaneously seen. <br /> <br /> The character of Nina Foke is found to be rather annoying to Milo. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film is the long ballot at the end of the film, which is based on style music with style music and styles, by the great French influential artists. I think it's hard to believe Jen and Oscar as a struggling artist and I do not think that the number of musical instruments they have set up as well, Balance, Garshin music is very well served in this film. <br /> <br /> DVDs are well-done with beautiful clean graphics (when they seem to be ed) and mono sound is good but a trimmer is shallow.
