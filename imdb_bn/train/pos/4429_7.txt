I personally had a good picture, coming from a very good actor, the killer reputation of the actor. I can not say much about the story, but there were some parts that made me a little more confused, and overall I thought the movie was too long. However, on the other hand, the great acting of this film was a great war and many locations were nicely shot, there were great effects and many sword games. My opinion is another hard effort by Tadanobu Asano. Well, I can not say anything else about the movie, but if you just draw attention to Asian movies, Crowking Tiger Hide Dragon (Housing of Flying Daggers), I'm trying to rent it to you, but if you die - I'm a solid Asian movie fan. The collection says that there will be very good Japanese film in the collection.
