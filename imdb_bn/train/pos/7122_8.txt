Immediately after World War II, the intelligent minds of Hollywood tried to distance itself from an unmarked flag which was a natural element in the war effort. America looks at itself after the "Best Years of Non Live" and even 'Gentlemen's Agreement' war, but Delemer Deves's "Marine of the Marines" defeats them. <br /> <br /> This image is about Philadelphia's Smart Alex Jan Garfield, who goes to war in a marine battle and a night after a night on Foxhole, and the Japanese soldiers will kill him and his friends "Marines, tonight!" Hand grenade, and after returning home, instead of returning to his girlfriend, he put his girlfriend behind. <br /> <br /> Delmar Davis is inconsistent with his paintings on these brave people, as they were almost coincidentally in there, foxholes, and when they shot, they reacted. Many for heroism, but they accomplish the task and then come to the senses of self-pity, darkness, frustration. Garfield refuses to deny her blindness and makes no excuse on the film, "There is no free candy for anyone in this world", her friend told him. A Jewish man working with Dan Clarke reminds him, "Nobody gets it in the fight, and you are it, everybody has a problem! When I go back, some people do not rent me, because my name is Diamond". <br /> <br /> Great movies like this movie are made, and the first episode 'Marine of Pride' fails to fully propose this event, then it becomes the real work of art. You cry, and you think, you suffer and you expect against hope. All right, only: art <br /> <br /> <br />
