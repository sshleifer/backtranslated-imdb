This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I saw one night's fate on TV. In the first 5 minutes I thought it was a B movie, but later I realized that this is a great product. <br /> <br /> I suggested some friends to watch the movie, just said that it was bad B movie. How wrong Seraphic criticism <br /> <br /> I think the movie is a gifted product! The well-known director has done an excellent job here and he is embarrassing that this time this game was out.
