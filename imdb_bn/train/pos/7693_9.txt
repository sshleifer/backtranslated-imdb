"Good times," in my opinion, hit the CBS to see a course! Despite the fact that I have not seen any episode, I still enjoy it. It's hard to tell which is my favorite. Also, I really love theme songs. If you ask me, even though I like it all, it would have been good if everyone was watching the entire show. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen on TV land now, I strongly recommend that it will be caught if the air is properly closed.
