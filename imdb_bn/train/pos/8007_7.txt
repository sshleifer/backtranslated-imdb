This game is very addictive, I play it for hours straight from the night, but when you are in the place you can not save a game, while at the same time I can not just play any game information loose. <br /> <br /> Yes, the "Freelancer" addiction but quite flawed. For example, something that bothers me is that you can not take out any cut scenes, and as a result, you had to watch for a few minutes in the cut scene. My great opportunity to multitask to check my e-mail or chat with my friends and more such things, when I had to wait for the cut scene <br /> <br /> The story begins to be committed but the more you get it all get ridiculous. The game also ended very casual, at least it did so for me. It is quite clear that they are hinting at an upcoming seagull. At the moment I do not know if there is a signal in the work, but I am sure that in most cases I will choose one after release. <br /> <br /> Gameplay is very simple! Even for those who are familiar with the flight games. Brave it, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are quite difficult and require plenty of effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks to finish this game, which could be a bit more. But thank God for multi-player alternatives! This allows you to continue with little missions just like the one player game, the way you completed it once. <br /> <br /> Although many missions are the same, it only keeps quiet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> / 7/10
