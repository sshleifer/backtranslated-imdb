I did not really agree with the guy-York-race (he saw the whole movie) saw some wonderful Scottish scenes (one of the best shots in Sky) and found a movie with a solid study. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> I can not say how many 'standard' films carry me - pushing the same doll stuff repeatedly. Seachd does not seem to like that at all. It seems that it is trying to offer something more real and of course more geographical than a recent Scottish movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the acting style is not a blockbuster. That's because the actors are seemingly real people I really thought that the main role of the son and his grandfather was really believable - and sometimes amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> that does not really feed in the end. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Seachd has been quite distinctive in a combination of stunning visual, plus and acting and non-normal structure of the music (sometimes) and memorable film. Please do this more!
