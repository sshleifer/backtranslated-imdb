OK. Bring cheese I love it It became an event during this period. Anorexic Twin became popular. Bob Saget starts to check a check (instead of his real funny stand-up). And people knew Dave Coulier. This was when life was good and easy. This is one of the great American classic. It was ridiculous and always brought a good lesson to the house. And this is where I differ from the norm: I like the past several seasons. As the house progresses, when the kids grow up, you can do more with the script. That's why I say brave ... it's gone long ago. But anyway I gave it a delicious, funny story line, and Bob Saget gave 8/10!
