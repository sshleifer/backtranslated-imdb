Spielberg's first dramatic movie is not disappointing. This is a well-crafted film without any flaws about African-American woman's life. This proves that African-American ethnic films that are in the center of the story will not be run by African-American directors. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie was that it was based on a book based on Spielberg, though it is very realistic. In addition, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. and generally, he has added himself to most of his films. But this, he is completely out of the branch and once for someone else. However, Huley Goldberg comes in the role of the whole film's performance. She is as nice as Celie. Once you see this movie do not forget these characters. Now, I have heard that its musical version is going to be a movie, and what I can say is: I hope it is almost as well as it is one, because this one is a film which should not be missed .
