Those of us who came to this view too late to understand the James Dean brick. Al Martyn Shane showed us the way to this great feature. The compound is simple enough: the cold hood will appear in the small town Sheriff and All-Hell, but the film's nuts and bolts awaken. All our car nuts <br /> <br /> No, it's not Casablanca, it's great literature, but it's a serious movie about Martin Shane's car, revolt, and talent. <br /> <br /> This is appreciated for what it is and what it is, and what will be done for Martin. In the 70's, I like to grow this movie as a young man, and you too will do it.
