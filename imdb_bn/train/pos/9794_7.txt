I thought the picture could be a little more complicated, perhaps in a psychological sense, but the action and voice acting were the top notch. Animation was heavy CG in many scenes, but that is also very good ones. This is Batman Returns / one of the ever-typed movies, which includes romance and Wayne's conflict and dating objectives. 007 fans love it, so women, great theme song! Owen was portrayed very well in this movie, and Penquin came back in his true form, at this moment, he had a mutant gene! I did not use Robin much, Team Drake was a very good computer, a little bit of Indigo children or future minds. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Kelly Ripa was a laughing stock in this movie. <br /> <br /> I rate it under the fantasy, the return of the joker, and the Batman vs Dracula, but prefer the better script than to enjoy Suzzero. 7/10
