The DVD for "Danza Macbra" (Blood Castle) is very weird. Because the part of the film is in French with subtitles and the rest is dubbed in French from English. Sometimes, switch between two characters in the middle of a scene! It does not make any difference when I try to subtitle or just subtitle the movie! Weird, but still watch <br /> <br /> The story relies on a full story, although I can not remember anything. Actually, the character of Po is displayed at the beginning and end of the film - although it does not look particularly like him. <br /> <br /> A rich man can bet with a man on his fate, he can not stay home the whole night at night. It seems like a simple firework to win - even if the house is very awesome. However, it can not be easy, the rich man says that those who have already betrayed they died - yet this fool still wants to digest! At home when he met Beautiful Barbara Steel inside and went crazy for him. Later, he learned that he had died a decade ago! How could this be?! I could tell you more about the plot but no doubt would like to do the mystery. Find out the rest of the story for yourself. <br /> <br /> This movie has received a lot of marks for creating a vague environment. To create a scary looking film with houses, black and white movies and music together. For the plot, it's interesting - especially because there are many twists and turns - you are so surprised that who is not unwanted from the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> The only negative is that I was sadly sorry for the wretched snake killed. As I was able to hear the word like crazy, I was sorry and it was rarely seen. <br /> <br /> Also, parents can know that there is nudity in the end. A weird beautiful woman appears incomplete, but for the plot it is rarely needed.
