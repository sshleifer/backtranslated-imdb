I like this movie. Succeeded by Vietnam Vietnam, and a scene in this film-san war scene and exciting bombs and gunfights is rare - it did. There was no idea I could not be so impressed by it. How an alien Vets thinks is an amazing look. It was quite difficult to watch, watch was difficult. We all understand the kind of war and apocalypse drama now, but this is so different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They can not It makes me very aware of a big group of four lost Americans. Not related, can not sleep, love can not be, "normal society" can not cope. They feel completely different. This is a huge tragedy, and one that is not stated enough. Yes, we've changed our attitude about Vietnam vets, now we like them, but what is it? It does not seem to have any difference to them. Too late So it's a great film, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticism.
