It's been 16 years of original invention, I hope now some "Marketing Wizards" have promoted this classic live actor version or tried to reproduce at least 65 episodes. Why can not I fathom why I have not snapped up this in Sci-Fi or Cartoon Network Galaxy Ranger actually thought of plots and even better scripts. Animation for its time was above average quality and is much better than today's Japanese animation compared to the conversation slideshow. It also predicted heavy ton toy tights in the market, it could seal its destruction. If I realized GRD would be willing to spend cash on a DVD.
