For this movie I have only one word: 'wow'. This is probably one of the best movies that touched me, for its performance from the story, so Sophia Lorraine and Marcelo Mastriani played well. I was very impressed with this last one, because he really came with the depth of character, because it was a very difficult role. Yet, a couple of them were created, which made me wonder, from the beginning to the beginning, showing the way, friendship with love, which developed throughout the day, settled in the movie. It takes some time to roll the story, because the introduction of letters is long, but finally we got compensation with a wonderful story about love and humanity. If you have a chance, check it out because it's a movie that will keep your mind for a long time. Just amazing - 9/10
