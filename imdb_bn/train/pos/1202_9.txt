I really enjoyed this documentary about Keny and Spencer's attempts to "don" pitch It is very nice to see how outsiders try to internally try to make it big. <br /> <br /> The story was well circulated and attractively directed, which made the film flow well. Of course a clock value. My only complaint is that they come from a closure. Possibly that point part. We hope this is not what has happened (or usually happens) in reality. <br /> <br /> The film is a great way to see Kenny and Spencer's personality outside their Canadian television show. You can still see a bit of what comes up. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for an opportunity to see poplies.
