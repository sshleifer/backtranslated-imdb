Yes it was a little budget, but this movie shows love! The only bad thing about this was that you can say budget in this movie that "WaterWord" will not be compared and although the plot was good, the film did not fully tap into its full potential! Strong performance and suspense from everyone makes it suitable for viewing on a rainy night.
