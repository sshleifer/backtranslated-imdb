This is a great case in which a movie and novel which is based on it, both are great. Perhaps this is why Garris accepts Nabokov's primary ideas and gives them a different explanation. The final outcome is Luzin's outlook that honors him more than Nabokov. <br /> <br /> The movie I do not like is Valentinov's influence on the fate of Luizin. I can not imagine Navokov that a person like Valentinov, and the reasoning of the novel has such a big impact on him.
