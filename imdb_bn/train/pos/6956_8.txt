I said Uma Thurman is the world's most beautiful woman. This movie was uber cute and I mean uber cute. It was all "sex" content that was mostly Ivan Retan's comedy but with a little extra, with cameras. Both Ummah and Luke seem to think that this is a passive but believable chemistry which crosses each scene beyond. Both of these strong and sexual relationships seem to make this wicked, twisted and interesting relationship that you smile until you can feel the other side. Anna Faris and the rest of the supporters completely stop each other's role, and even the small role of Bhandara Sykes will keep you laughing. Although this sort of joke is not for everyone, I must say that I went with a person who does not usually enjoy these movies and laughs like a madman. This movie is certainly not for everyone. Some moments, especially young people, rarely say ... adults for good viewers. I was surprised to see everyone in this movie, until finally I see that the rest of the picture was a little weaker than that. (5 * out * 3 1/2 *)
