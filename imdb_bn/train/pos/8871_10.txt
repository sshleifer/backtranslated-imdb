It was a great movie that was a lot under false accusations. It works on issues of rascism and class. However, it was also a message of self-accounting and self-responsibility. This movie was very deep, it provided your message and only you can control your destiny. It shows you that you are intelligent and comfortable with you, the only way you can fit in society. Do not think others are important to you. I believe this movie is an excellent job showing it. Acting actor I was able to carry each character wonderfully. I was just amazing how amazing this movie really is. At a glance, you can not see the depth of the movie, but if you see more you will see the lower meaning of the movie.
