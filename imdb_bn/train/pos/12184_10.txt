In most of his films (Citizen, Confidential Report, Touch of the Temple), Orson Wells gave him the role of a brilliant men. "The lady of Shanghai" is the only one I saw him playing for. The criminal's role, he gave to Rita Hermes, I think because he loved her. Therefore, this is a funny picture. But I find out very nice stories. The diversity of the direction, naturally with Wales: the two scenes are particularly bright: one of the aquarium and the final one with mirrors. This photo is bright. (10/10)
