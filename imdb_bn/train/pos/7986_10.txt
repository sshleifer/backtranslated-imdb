This is a nice, heartfelt movie. As far as I can see the present reality in Latin America, I am grateful for the kidnappings, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officers and innocent victims. According to Denzel Washinton, his career gives the most ongoing performance. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning has been written and illustrated wonderfully, I believe every minute. Cast is wonderful, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rober is always cool. Walken screen lights up for me like any other actor. I would love to see them both more. The authentic location is amazing. The camera work is interesting and different. This makes it even more interesting for people familiar with Latin American films, many of Cast Cast's legendary Latin actors. I highly recommend this movie.
