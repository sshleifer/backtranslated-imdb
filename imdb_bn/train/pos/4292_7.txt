Before watching I did not know about the movie and I think it was the "expectation" factor which first helped me to endure and later I liked it more than that. <br /> <br /> setting was interesting, weird but interesting The storyline was the gap / jerk that I think the viewers closed a bit. No great soundtrack playing background, creating "romantic" ambiance. But they do not matter at all. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Emma and Luis was just great. There was some weird odd chemistry that I could not resist; I fell in love with it and here I write this review. Fine love painter was fantastic by two actors, and I believe, the main part of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is not everyday romantic comedy; Actually, we all would not appreciate it. I was sitting for a while and gradually I could not understand something that I did not think first. I can not guarantee that everyone will like it, but I hope you do.
