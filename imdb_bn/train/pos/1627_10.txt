Almost every scene has blonde and blender Pamela Anderson and Dennis Richards and if you want more from a movie then you are totally unreasonable. It looks like a carat on late year, when the series was not shining, but was more fun than Beyond or England and you would not be too close to the mark. Pamela and Dennis are bubbly, impressive and obviously aware that this is not an excellent work, although you can give me a lot of things that I like to like. Helpful cast is energetic, even if some of them are not particularly good; I can not see a few duff movies in a movie that has already forgotten that it is making a difference, so just smile. I really think blonde and bloen ace are and i hope you hate it for me
