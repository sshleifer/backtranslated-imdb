Yes, a true classic! It's about the British drama, the lowest use of reality and special effects (and above the growth budget). In the end it was shown in the British televised TV in 1994 when I saw this play. It should really be seen by a viewer who does not like the scary plot, not the big name, but the less unusual acting. Actually, copyright is now unknown to somebody and this kind of drama is unlikely to be publicized at any time. I recently achieved Black the Woman in Black at VHS, so now again I will be able to enjoy this truly great British drama. You should try and enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
