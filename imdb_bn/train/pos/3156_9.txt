Like this showcase, I was a teenager in the 70's. Producers really become a colonial teenager in the 70's, full zeitgeist nail. 70's fashion, cars, home furniture, food, and fads, all of these shows are very authentic. <br /> <br /> This show cast a very talented ensemble, all of which are very good mesh on camera. I really like the unique, psychedelic-style film sequence. There are no other shows such as camera tricks. The sequence of this cutting-edge film really helps release Campi Hipes, which illustrates the era of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a very funny sitcom. One thing that annoys me about this show is that it relies on cruel humor to create frustration. In this way, I think this show tries much more to marry the children. Although married children have a great sitikom in their own right, it is firmly convinced that the manufacturers of the 70s will try to imitate it. <br /> <br /> I recommend the 70's show, mainly because of its nostalgia factor. Although it might be a better show, if the writers were more dependent on malicious dialogue instead of Buddhist, tasteless jokes and jokes.
