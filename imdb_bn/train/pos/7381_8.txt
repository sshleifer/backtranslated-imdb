Iwan (Marco Ricca) and Gilberto (Alexander Burgess) are partners in an organization, including Istehvo (George Fryer), but the first person is a professional killer, ANISIO, to kill ESTEVAO (plot, at least at the beginning, or not 'why not explain very well). The person did this and after getting his money, he started blackmailing two partners, attended their company and says he wants a job there (supervisor or something ??). At the same time, she started dating Eisteauo girl Marina (Mariana Jimenez), and with her! <br /> <br /> In this story, where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail are hand in hand, no one can be innocent or predatory, except for Marina, who is not the only person who knows what is happening and does not betray anyone? ? <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is illustrated with Sir Paulo, where crime is present in the great metropolis like every day's present, sad and cruel reality. We can also feel authentic in characters like ANOIRO's characters like AIOO (brightly played by Paulo Mickels), who blackmail people who donate money without a script and even flirt with the girl they killed! He must be a monster to do something really, but of course I know people like him are in Brazil or elsewhere? <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie, cruel but true, sad about reality ?? Great acting and soundtrack too.
