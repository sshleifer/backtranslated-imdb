Even in the 21st Century child births are dangerous: women get pregnant, and give birth prematurely. Fifty years ago, it was not unusual for women to die during childbirth. This is the theme of "Life Begins": A look at the "hard case" ward of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young leads, a woman has brought from prison (she committed the crime is not a plot in Germany); He has contradicted the fact that he must give his child after birth. She is in a ward with many other women, who share their joy and pain with each other. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young is in the lead, the extraordinary performance is naturally placed in Glena Ferrell.

"Life Begins", due to being a primary talkie, confirmed the matter with a beautiful doll of Melendram, but it is quite a charming little film. Turner classic show it, though repeatedly; I've only seen Loretta Young show a few days honored. But it is highly recommended when it is seen.
