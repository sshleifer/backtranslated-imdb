I admit that I have weaknesses for alternative history stories, from a wonderful life to 12:00 till the day of Grandhun. This little jewel in those great. It's quite difficult to get through the MR. Best wishes to not be thankful to every custom member, from James Balushi to the murderer Courtney Cox. This film lacks gravity and scale to create a great movie, but it is a great joy in the rainy afternoon. It's a great rental for a cheap date.
