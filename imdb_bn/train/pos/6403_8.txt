Honor Man of Cuba Gooding Jr., probably the best performance of the date. He plays Karl Brashear, a man of high courage and heroism. He is a poor farmer of the South who wants to sink as the navy - but there are problems in his competition. The head of the diving school, run by Robert DeNiro, is a racist red-stoogeer who still continues to respect Brasier. This picture is about how to combine Brasieri with almost no two, almost helpless disagreements. What is the specialty of this film in performance Gooding up, and the best actor in the history of the movie, De√±orro, gave a fantastic performance - his dramatic work of the year. Charles Theron gives another solid performance as Deaniro's much younger wife. This film has made patriot a bit stronger (though it is not near a Patriot level), and some characters are just a slight bad (that is, Hallbruck's Mr. Poppy is very bad), but the movie is a rareness in the movie today. It's offensive and unusual. A wonderful film.
