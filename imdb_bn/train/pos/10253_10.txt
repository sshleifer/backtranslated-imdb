There are no stories in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hanging in the net and keeping it like a bird, whenever he walks, he walks around him in the chair, loudly loudly loudly loudly, on him Pour warm oil, put the installment on her rashes, cut her hand and finally <br /> <br /> This movie is so realistic that if I did not know it was fake but I thought it was a snap-movie . Although I was detested by this movie, I really liked it. It scared me. I guess it met some kind of. I pay it a 10/10.
