A lot has been said as Shinjuku Triad Society's first true "Mike" film, and I thought that such a description might have been a cliche. However, like all clich√©s, it is based on the truth. All the mime trademarks are difficult to choose here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, banned examinations and central character. Shinjuku is one of Mike's most complete films. He said in an interview that if he made it again, it would be different but not necessary. I think what it means is that the film has a really enchanting power and raw edges that seem so fresh that although he was able to capture a more visible or technically complex film, he could not improve the film's accuracy or screenplay. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Only a michaic film lets you go away with such a sentence.) The film has a great speed, which is opposite to the dead or Alive which starts and ends firmly and drowns in the middle. Whether dead or living is also related to similar problems, Miike is clearly concerned about the subsequent relationship between Japan and the Chinese, and these emotional issues are handled well, when the central character is really coming in when you begin to understand its past. <br /> <br /> I can not sing Shinjuku's praise enough. I do not want to give too much. Before using the CIG before reminding Mimi of her films and reminiscing something like Kitano's Sonnetine, The central characters are nicely realized and the final turn ensures that as soon as the movie ends, you will get it back to work again.
