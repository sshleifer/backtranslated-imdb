Doctor Finster is a dentist. She has a beautiful wife and a huge room with a pool. Suddenly, he discovered that his wife was coming out with the Pool attendant - she realized that everything was clean, there was corrosion. She started torturing her patients. ... Corbin Bernsen is as brilliant as a deranged dentist-he is totally trustworthy. There are surprisingly little ghors but the torture of the teeth is quite nasty and extraordinary. Highly recommended. "Dentist 2" is also worth checking out!
