This movie is cold, bare truth. Often we think "Oh no, that would not be mine." But it can do it. Drug smuggling is big money and often people are unaware (or cheated) things for thieves. The story of these two girls is a story of many young people who like them, want only a foreign holiday - which becomes a nightmare. People need to know that such incidents are not impossible or too much - this is a big problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie to the old audience because the movie due to the necessary understanding is necessary. It's very emotional and raw. Looking at the good value and certainly in your memory.
