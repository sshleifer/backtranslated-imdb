Following the example of Marab Momairdvilli, Gart the Grayf's film was enticed to describe the 'event of thought'. The nominal tale is the torture of Bart Claver for the transitory substance that constitutes the essence of personality. His new film script captures his computer and his imagination simultaneously. This film-singularity was released as Falini's `8 Â½ 'response and as a response to the Gift Day Graph of 13 years of work. Excitingly playing with real and imagined characters with the audience, it reveals two remarkable interconnections of real and imagined, opposite contrast to two different galaxies: Gutenberg and Mclueen. For some time we are well suited to script writers, who believe that the reason for the misfortune is the hostility of the mass mentality (`man ',' Catholic ',' window washers'). And when a writer-producer finally faces an inconsistent conflict, we fall into a trap: how to delete a person from a future film. Burt Claver? Thank you, just five minutes before the creator's wife is mad, who is deeply submerged in the work, we realize that we have been rebuilt together with the main character. How much is the value of the industry to be accepted and it is not logical to give up his own name? <br /> <br /> Then who is that burt? Klever? Is he a brilliant prophet or a masterpiece masterpiece like Fredenhofer (just as the script writer has finally deleted everything from computer memory)? Gert de Grafough suggests that we answer these questions. <br /> <br />
