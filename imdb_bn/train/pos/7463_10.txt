This image looks like our polarizing. Either you love it or hate it. I like it <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment that you just "feel" it. Also, at the beginning of the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend an image done by a painter Munnet - an influential artist. The style of the monet is painted in small spots so the painting looks like a mess, but from the distance, you can talk about it. Cruz points out that the painting has "Vanilla Sky". I believe a moviegoer is an indication. This movie is like that printing painter. It is an impressionist film! And it's not a majority that the title of the movie refers to that painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your ideal linear plot. It needs more thinking. There are symbols and the scenes are almost hiding and not going to make sure you're running. But in the end, all is explained. <br /> <br /> You have to pay attention to this movie but I think people are wrong to focus on this. You should think about it when it's over. If you try to figure it out as it is revealed, you will overwhelm yourself. Just let it happen ... with "go" ... keep an open mind. Remember that you see and save the analysis later. <br /> <br /> I found the top notch of all the performance and it seems very unusual, intelligent, creative and spelling. <br /> <br /> But do not criticize the intelligence of those who do not enjoy it. This is a certain taste appeal. If you like the existence, psychedelic, philosophical, thought provoking, challenging, spiritual movies, see If you like something lightly, avoid it. <br /> <br /> But if you like what you described, you will definitely enjoy it.
