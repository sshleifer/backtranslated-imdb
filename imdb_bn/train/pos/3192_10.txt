Yes, this gets ten big stars. Plain it as these days that it is filling. The universe sent Trent Harris to a young man, astonishing strange people, and Harris held him in tape, which is a true sweet glory that you are not just fake. Too bad it ended up in the tragedy for the young man, if only one option is written for the companion story. The other two steps of the triangle, respectively, restored the story of Shaun Pane and Crespen Glover in the role of young men. The world is expanding and curiosity is relevant by rebuilding, which is becoming weird in our vanilla America. Recommended for anyone and everyone!
