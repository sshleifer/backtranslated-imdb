The movie "comedy" is nowadays usually the sun shining of the toilet, criminal language, and shivering 100 minutes Modern comedy appeals to the lowest common words, brain ignorance and slow. Of course, sometimes good comedy will come, but they are becoming rare all the time. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blindings Buildings His Dream House" shows what Hollywood was able to do in 1940, and it's just fun fun. Jim and Murray Blondings (Kerry Grant and Mirna Loy) decided to build a house in Connecticut suburbs. This film follows the story of house hunting trips, riots from the house, starting from all corners of the house beginning - its "Juice-Juices Water Softener". <br /> <br /> Grants and fines are definitely their role (the grant is especially interesting because he zooms out of control of the house) However, this film has stolen the Brandiensis scientist attorney, played the fullness of Melvin Douglas. Douglas is narrowly laughable to manage the scene he stole, and he saw the revolution from crisis to crisis. Harold Architect of Rellandandr Denny Bladdings and Harry Shannon are also wonderful as Crusty Old Water Well Drillers. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie countless times and it always laughs at me. I think this is a good movie that needs your elevator, whether you're building a house or not.
