This film is essential for all those people who enjoy football as an industry. The first of these films about a Football World Cup was reduced. In addition to playing a TV-like game, there are liberal footage to follow different players in games. As these efforts to reach this greatness go through these men's emotions and the circumstances bring forward. Today's TV broadcast style, which is less than 1986, is still less than the quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> Players are not the only star. The audience, referee, journalists, journalists and journalists covering the environment play a key role in history's history. In this film you can see how all these elements play together in a clear way. In this regard, today's TV broadcast style still has not reached the level of quality, although it is much closer than ever. There are many highlighted players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkzer and Laddup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Linear (England), Rumenzig (Germany), Butrug # and ( Spain), Societas (Brazil), and SÃ¡nchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> Mexico is not a collection of 1986's best football campaign, although most of them are well covered. Throughout all the movies, there is a pressure to exclude relevant plays from the games itself to present different aspects of the game and compete on the basis of these players and their team's progress. This makes the image so attractive and unique. <br /> <br /> What happened because of the referees during Mexico 1986, most of the views about the film and the World Cup are extremely Maradona-favoritism. Most of these comments are not considered that there is a referee and two linemen, who are human as a player, and all the mistakes above do one mistake or another. Football rules do not allow the use of TV-based replacements to decide referees, so most of the referees have to decide what they mean. As a result, the referees play an active part in the development of a game. Their effects can be seen in different parts of this movie. <br /> <br /> The 1990 film series is a frustrating source of the World Cup. It has been associated with it in most cases, though this film tells things from a more remote, stupid perspective.
