Well, as Jackie Chan's best film I'll consider the police store. The plot, battle scenes and stunt work are excellent. In this film, Jackie has himself acted as a police officer, known as Chan Ko Kui (Kevin Chan, in some editions) who successfully arrested the perpetrator. After the release of Lord due to lack of evidence, he formed a channel for killing the police officer. That is why he asked the police. Later, Salina (Brigetin Lin), the lord of the crime, went to a shopping mall and stole the crime evidence from her computer and prepared to go to Chan. However, the perpetrator knew that Salina has downloaded her brutal information and rented her pregnant to capture her. Later, Chan appeared in the scene and began to beat all the puppets, defeating one by one. In the last scene, Chan Crow saw criminals. Finally, it is the best action and comedy film. Everyone will see it. Highly recommended.
