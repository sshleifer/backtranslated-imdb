I love this movie like no other. Another time I will try to explain his qualities to the unwanted, but for the moment I want to quote some extraordinary conversation pieces, which is to remember, all the cheeks cheeks. All Australian and Pomas understand, are you? <br /> <br /> (song song song) "He can sink a beer, he can take a quote in his last double breasted bunny gear." <Br /> <br /> (Another song song) "All Pamies are violent, busy, or bad, and England is the eighth planet in the universe." <br /> <br /> (An "Arty Program" in Television interview): Mr. McCabe, have you influenced most of the artists since you were in England? (Barry's reaction) Flamen's' Bull-Artist! <br /> <br /> (A gorgeous young pomber chicks up): Mr. McKenzie, do you think that you have dominance among Australian indigenous people? (Barry's reaction) Abos? I have not seen an abo in my life. Mother makes us most of the hard Yakka (ie hard work). <br /> <br /> The only taste of this delightful fuss in Australia's Ficker is this bosar. If you can get a copy of it, look and enjoy.
