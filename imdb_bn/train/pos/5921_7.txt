I was the producer of this movie, and I also had to work some voice work on it, so I'm not completely neutral, but if it was terrible, I would have said. I thought it was a fun film, one of the critics praised the best composition, in no way, but there was lots of smiles along the way. The Bible says that the smile is good as a medicine, so this movie can be good for your health. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture of many actors of this film has not reached us at the top. Susan Sarandon, of course, after that many big fame has gone. As a photographer in the "Thirty-Things" TV series, Melanie Mayran is seen on TV on a weekly basis. Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, still haunting people's dreams. This show was my personal favorite actor Dob Taylor, who played Sheriff. She is an excellent comedy actor, and really nice, sincere person. We all had fun working on this show, and I think that comes through fun.
