I thought it was good to make movie movies, and there was a lot of action and humor in it. I found out the value of the value of the entertainment price, and would see again or similar shows again. I am disappointed that the SHD on IMDB has not been submitted here. <br /> <br /> I can see a signal with a probability or visible shane for an action series based on this concept, and again for the higher "cash" parties, because his life will be on the line again. <br /> <br /> I think Shan played a very good role and reminded me of an actor named Matthew Ashford, who played Jack Devover on our days - swap opera.
