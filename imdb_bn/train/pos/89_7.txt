To be honest, when I started, I had no idea about this movie. Whenever possible I watch movies. No preconception I'm going to be a movie about these woods or some stoners I was wrong, kinda <br /> <br /> loading is annoying at first but once it started to turn it really hooked me up. I know the feelings sucked in some unhappiness where I feel helpless but do something you do not want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented on how this movie is stupid and impossible but I want to be different. Such things do not happen. I'm sorry but not everyone lives in the dream world where nothing bad can happen and in the crazy situation "impossible" Really sad but the world reality is that they happen. This film did a great job of portraying how the creators and actors can do something bad and how people might really like it. Sometimes things get better, sometimes they get worse and that's life. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
