Nick Nolt gives a wonderful performance in the dark story of Kurt Vongut. During the Second World War, Nottel played Double Agent Howard W Campbell, who worked in the campaign. After the war, he remains anonymously until the rival parties want to dig its past. As a lot of Vonnegut's work, a meditation that uses this battle illogicalism and the promotion for those who are their own goals. Nolt is fantastic - broken and spectacular as an old man who is less confident and confident as young Campbell, and then forced to persecute for his past sins. (7 out of 10)
