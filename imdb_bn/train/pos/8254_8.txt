In the 1950s, in the fictional town of Wilde, in the middle of the middle class, this bold comedy, such as the light-touch toy, with gun mentality and violence, materialism and bondage, fear of others, enslavement, golf, and dead settlement. Yes, it seems all too heavy, but believe me about this, it's almost as light as feather. <br /> <br /> The characters in the characters specially featured. Emergency questions are raised, such as: a zombie (Willard's 90% choose this final route, only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Like the robots, how many logos are there for their bidding (they have become a mark of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships between living and resurrected dead? <br /> <br /> Somehow, director Andrew Curry, who was co-authored with the animated screenplay (with Robert Chomac and Dennis Heaton), blurred this uncomfortable element for a one and a half hour to gather. Good smile Supports a super-cast: Kerry-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Becker, Henry Karnary, Team Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett Principals, a young K'Sun Roy teammaker, a good heartless innocent child. Acting as a fair witness about all hunger problems in adolescence. (Only when I met him in "Memento" and "Matrix", I did not understand that Mrs. Moss is such a beautiful comedian Chops.) <br /> <br /> Production design and music exclusively 50 percent, one. Perhaps this is not for everyone. This must be a tough film to beat for my annual Bijorro prize. But intelligent comedies, which are fun from the beginning, are among the most difficult achievements for filmmaking. Anyway for me, "Fido" is a hoot! My grade: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (01/30/07 to see)
