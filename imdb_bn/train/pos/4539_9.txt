The acting is very fatty, but for the people of this area in the 80's and now Detroit area automotive engineer, this is a great movie. I also work with Japanese suppliers to make this movie more fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> She is looking pretty here ... 17 years ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm sure the opening scene had its own car. <br /> <br /> # 80 general movies. See it and enjoy it. No computer produced punk!
