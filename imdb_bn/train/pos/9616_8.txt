Due to the rapid change in several strong stories, the ability to be twice observers due to change, the "bug" emerges as a completely satisfying work of the industry, which ever gives hopeful love against numerous examples of frustrating reality. <br /> <br /> My favorite is Carroll Wallace (John Carroll Lyncht) whose life is a life-threatening concern - for people who are partially responsible for car tickets from Carcor - frame the film; Olive (Christina Krk), who was impossible but spent time preparing delicious meals for her impossible Arnie (Chris Bauer); And Mitchell, a cable TV technician with incredible faith in luck cookie messages: "You'll show your dream girl." <br /> <br /> Interesting realities against such optimism, the character created by all actions: parking tickets, Chinese food / donut shop, TV barrier, a drilled automatic fender, a abandoned dinner reservation, which eventually resulted in a Hawaiian vacation canceled. . [<br /> <br /> Funny: Olive is getting drunk with the performance of Chipendend, Johnston (Michael Hitcock) is working as a customer service agent, who is trying to deal with a mood customer, a restaurant inspector diait (Jamie Kennedy) The microbes-uninterrupted Sears (Brian Cox) reacted to her girlfriend. Rejecting children by fate of the opponent's Chinese cookie: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and a guy who is asleep while operating in Jackhammer because he's looking for a lost cat at night. <br /> <br /> A minor actor with public cable e-access host (Darryl Tares) and "The Boy in the Bubble" reads the main theme of a local actor, who teaches: The love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Bug" gives entertainment on the same level as "trains, planes and automobiles" but with a low budget and a new eye.
