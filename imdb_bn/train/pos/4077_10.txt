I first saw it on UK TV in the early 90's, I liked it but I missed the opportunity to tap it, many years have passed but the film has always stuck with me and I have lost the hope of watching the TV again, the main thing with me The stuck was stuck, the castle fortress really touched me, it is easy to see, a great story, great music, the list is running and I'm right about how good it is, but everyone will stay there once they see it once they are a bit better with them, yes animation is top notch and nice to look at, it shows its age in very small part but now it becomes part of beauty, I am very happy that it It comes out as a DVD, it's always one of my top 10 movies. Buy it or rent it, only to watch drinks and drink with water alone at night, so you do not have to stop the film. Enjoy <br /> <br />
