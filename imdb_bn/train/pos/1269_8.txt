Even though sometimes wrongly convicted, friendly black people can be a real nasty disorder. Sean Connery is great, more like a heroier than heroes. Meaning of larynis fisborne, arrogant, but the good guy is apparently amazing as the police. Underwood and Harris are invigorating as the leading and rogue psychology. Kapeshaw is okay. Ruby Dee is great as a strong grandmother. Cast the rest is excellent as well.
