"Dangerous criminal" is a seemingly anti-social girl, and how he came in the way. It was based on a real story, and although I was concerned by a note screenplay, such as title character, the title of the title and the dedication of her lawyer's strong faith, I acknowledge that imitating life art. <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture has been successful for me, because even though the slightest softness till the end of the title of the title is ultimately ending, even then its prolapse Is sympathetic person. As the film shows how he went to his current state - which proved to be anti-destructive rather than anti-social. <br /> <br /> Really a moving movie that enters your neck, when you are thinking about it - which will often happen. Despite the many errors of <br /> <br /> (it is hard to see, sometimes due to physical activity and suicide attempts) it is another production that I am proud of the Canadian call.
