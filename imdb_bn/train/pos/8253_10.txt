In the last year, this first film must be seen! It's a fun, unbelievably original, incredibly beautiful look (they look fantastic for the look of this cool cool wide screen technicolor) and it's really deep in character and what they say about society. From homeland security to nesting issues, it is really cute satirical with nails, while simultaneously you are smiling and realizing how many lives around the world. Kerry Ann Moss played a comedic role that I would never come from him! She is sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is just as great as Fido who can funt and moan! And Dylan Baker as the father is priceless. In fact the whole throw is perfect. Henry Czerny As Bad Guy, Team Blake Nelson is sexy as a neighbor with hot sexy junky girlfriend (getting the idea now?), Though-stimulating and just amazing all round! Go and watch this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen before.
