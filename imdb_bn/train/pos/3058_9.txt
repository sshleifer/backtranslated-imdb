I bought it for $ 2 (yep, $ 2) a year or so ago, it has kept the shelf for ages, now I'm watching the DVD when it's cold. <br /> <br /> This is a hunting movie. All engaging, all impressive performance involving 6yo boys (with only a smile on this movie). <br /> <br /> The plot reminds me of my favorite movie, Grosses Pine Blank, but it is obviously lightheaded. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is scary thing! All round work. <br /> <br /> Pitt
