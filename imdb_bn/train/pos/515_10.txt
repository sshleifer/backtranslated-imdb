For the first time I saw this movie - I was working at the weekend and the TV was in the background of the background. But I gradually found myself or not even more involved in this movie until I was completely absorbed. An issue of life and death (British title - the staircase of heaven in the United States) is a fantastic, well-played, fully-managed package, delightful, engaging, unprecedented, and ongoing. It's a classic that really keeps rank with Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, with wind, Citizen Cain, and Fire Rath. Why has it ever gained public notice and video store properties? Fortunately, some intelligent critics have listed their "Top 100 All-Time Listings" list. There is hope - the Fantasia of the 1940s was not the 60th hit that hit the hit, and it was ugly in the Wizard of Oz Box Office, but it hit the TV. Buy It - Rent It - Watch It - Claim It! You will not be disappointed!
