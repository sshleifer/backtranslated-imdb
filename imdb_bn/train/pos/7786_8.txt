This movie was directed by Victor Nunze, who wrote Screenplay (Yule Gold). Excellent and straightforward writing, which was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Ruby's day in today's day. What we see is a thorn in the life of young Ruby. Ashley Judd (sister) won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby started living on his own and started establishing his identity. He explores the work, friendship, boy friend, gender, an ideal young adult search. The movie won the movie Grand Jury Award at the Syndication Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I choose Sundance due to the movie. I appreciate this kind of movie, because it does not carry Hollywood accessories. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are completely different, it does not remind me to fool Paul Nunman and ignore anyone. The next movie is a part of everyday life of a common man. I like that. The story was told very nicely, and we had to sit down and enjoy the story. I'm not sure only the title of the thing. I'm sure there are not many bugs and fly to heaven like Florida. As for allergies for mosquitoes, no heaven for me in Florida, I thought about Florida thought. I turned into a completely red foot. I recommend this movie! Favorite Scenes: Ruby and his friend Rochelle Bridges, Alison Dean's Panda City, Florida are walking on the beach. In fact the sand is very white. I was there. Dear Quote: "Need is always a good excuse." "The problems that a person is finding are not different now, who is going to be and when and why." <br /> <br />
