American vehicles of Director Paul Werhoven are of various quality, but most of the films made in their native country are controversial Masterworks. It is the story of alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writers that comes with a beautiful, rich and extremely strange woman. But the lady does not know that she is only interested in showing warm male lover. Already, the authors are attacked by strange views - first they look like hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but soon began to realize that they were actually experiencing some types of previews. Interesting Hitachchian Thriller, very original and provocative. I like some movies that you think they are about, but then you realize that they are completely different about something. This is one of that movie; A thriller in the first half, and during the second half a pure-religious spiritual saga. Very romantic, original and anti-religious, not every church is going to church every Sunday for children or people. Great cinematography by future director John de Bont Very reommended!
