Clarke Gabell has played a man who has jumped into the life of a hard-dame gene Harlow. She tries to sucker when she brushes her off with her harsh-throat attitude. They fell in love despite their close and doubtfulness. When Gabelle accidentally assaulted a man, she found out her pregnant woman and left the faithful Harla in prison. Anita Luos and Howard Emmett Rogers's writing is a beautiful and wonderful character. (Mostly with a trace of stereotype, including a Jewish socialist woman prisoner and a black female classmate and her preacher father). Gable and Harlow act as their performers display their metal nuances and quirks from their characters which transmit beyond their ordinary Gable and Harlow role. And you're a lot better than expected from Sam Wood. A beautiful shot is included in the prison in Harley, after which the camera then brings a surprisingly snowy courtyard after tracking it. It is the best of both "love criminals" and "women prison" generals and some of the best hard-spoken conversations it's ever written.
