He heres a fun incident, I was among a pile of baby in the movie. :) I'm 19 years old now. My parents tried to take part in me, we were in Texas at that time. I think I was prepared for it like 80 rupees, but I was not too much in it. My parents said when I was happy I would cry and I would have been happy to cry. I was all mixed. I think weird and funny .. And I'm not a child actress. I live in San Antonio, workin '. I graduated here in Texas but I had most of my life in Maryland. This movie is a great movie, though, good idea. I have seen it several times in my 19 year small.
