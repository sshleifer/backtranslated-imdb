A suspenseful thriller that carries some similar for giving as scenes and settings. There are some very innovative shot scenes and good music, though the magnitude of one of the characters and sometimes seemingly indifferent attitude is inappropriate for the situation, although it is not a mayor problem. It also raises interesting questions about revenge and friendship limits. <br /> <br />
