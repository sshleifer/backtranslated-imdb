Romeo and Juliet have a delightful unpretentious passage. Perspectives with no hope other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one. A talented group of comic actors go to a riot in this light-hearted actor's car and go. Bad reviews were due to a snobbishness of Shakespeare's treatment. Some people think that all movies should be "important" - if you share those opinions, do not bother. Credits "are being presented" Angelina Jolie, who is not even close to the truth, she is surprisingly beautiful like Juliet's character, and always, her performance is astonishing --- and, considering her age at that point, even her dialect is quite good. With the opposition to Italian food in New York, this classic story has many interesting results. See it in the correct frame of mind and you will smile loudly.
