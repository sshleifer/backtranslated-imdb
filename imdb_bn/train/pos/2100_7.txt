Before going to politics or government service, Glenda Jackson was Britain's best film actress. This film demonstrates its talents despite having a supporting role in a stella custor, among which the Royal Captain's wife Julie Christie, who has lost her memories for the last 20 years, and Jenny Christiano's unexpected role as an unbeaten sister of American Anne Margaret. During the First World War, Alan Betts captained the memory loss caused by shell shock. Sir Yan Holm's doctor's role is very little. Seen familiar faces such as Shila Keith, Passi Bairn and Frank Finley. You can not help but Glenda plays a horror housewife and Captain's first true love but they come from different classes. It's not the best movie, but it's good to see Glenderers as extraordinary talent. She is still a superb actress, comedy or drama. She has portrayed Margaret Gray as a favorite character and why you see a Resident Captain falls in love with her.
