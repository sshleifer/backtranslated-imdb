Armman does it again. Next to Pixar, Armanan Animation proves how animation can be done correctly. <br /> <br /> I have a great time watching the first episode of the vibrant Comfort. I translate it well for the American audience. My only concern is that most of the audience is not going to get the humor at this show. <br /> <br /> After the BBC version and the fame of the small film, I knew what I was when I sat down to see this. Animators did a great job matching the pre-recorded voice to a perfect match animal. Look at the first episode with the goat, who threw stones, and the dogs dogged each other on the street. <br /> <br /> Is this for everyone? Not by a long shot. Actually, I'll be happy to see the last show for the whole season. But as I said before, viewers are not going to get it.
