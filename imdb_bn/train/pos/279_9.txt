I love this game that you can literally get out of your seat during the game. When you get hurt, the screen is a jump and a flash, it's very real and at the same time you have to remember that this is just a game and you do not have to. Sound effects and audio are amazing. Many weapons and different spellings are thrown and you can choose spells which make them even stronger or not. You will find this stone that will push enemies behind while retrieving Mana to bomb your enemies even more magic. The best part is that when you are playing it full time you are really vague and you can hide the key around the next corner and be afraid of what might be blurred behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try playing it with the main phones.
