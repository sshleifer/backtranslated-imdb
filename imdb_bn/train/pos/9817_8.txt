I think this movie. Quite intense for a 11 year old. Well edited, I felt terrible for St. Bernard. I would like to see it again, if it is reintroduced, but if I write, the signal is crossing the Pluto. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I am very happy that I did not live in that neighborhood. Oh 70's. What a decade If they rebuild it, then I bet it would be very violent and bloody. So what are they waiting for? An excellent movie for pre-pubescent sub urban boys. It was very intense. I think it was imprinted in Los Angeles. Of course the Lodi NJ is not created. The shot with St. Bernard was the best and clearly terrible figure from the movie ... and then they left the body in a stupa. Bad kids
