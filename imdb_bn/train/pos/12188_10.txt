Pure Essence Wells Talent makes one of these great movies. Wales is a murderous conspiracy which may have been established as the only fallen man, in which he relates to the "Dummy big Dummy" that is ridiculous. Plot is so complex that I still did not know that his life was about to be lost. Shootout scene in the Carnival Hall of Mirrors is one of the most amazing paintings ever shown. Price that is worth the price of admission alone. This is the only time Rita Hairdresser sometimes played a complicated but credible character. None in Wales can cut their hair and draw brassy blood. Nobody should miss this picture.
