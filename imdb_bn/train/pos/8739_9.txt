This is a fancy movie. It has all the usual Disney elements (great range of songs, character, story, appeal), excellent animation and less well-known actors' excellent voice talent such as "Antza" and "Egyptian Price". /> <br /> The character works really well, and has a strong appeal, and beyond the barriers of generations which are aimed at a wider level of humor. The movie is also presented in the extraordinary cinemusic format, which adds to the film's experience. <br /> <br /> Tell me crazy, but I've seen this picture three times, and I wish to take more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics recommend this film to me and are not disappointed. I work in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that without the satisfaction of the film, no one has left this movie. See it and it will not be closed because it is animated. You are sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for sure credits! Blopers and ultimately the most fun part of the movie, which laughs all their life
