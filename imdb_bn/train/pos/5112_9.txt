This movie is all about, action, war, dance, riding bull, music, beautiful girls. This movie is a strangely look in Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. Large amount of oil money, many women, and lots of Hong Kong tons. Very bad they have all gone now. The movie basically meets another boy girl, boy loses boy, boy gets back to the girl, but it is freed by actor and music. This film is not a complete movie with any good music and includes American graffiti. This is a movie that I see repeatedly and never tired. Every time I see it, I'm young again, and now hello time to go out of time. The only reason I gave it a 9 just because you can not rate a movie, I do not think you should rate 10.
