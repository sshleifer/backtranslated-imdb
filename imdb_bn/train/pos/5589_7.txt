Filled with symbolism and wonderful cinematography, much more than symbolic boyfriend drama, which we have come to expect. It is almost a silent film, dialogue in Germany and it is very simplified in Germany. Perhaps the filmmakers wanted to reach this film with the biggest viewer of European philosophy, since even someone with subordinate level Germany could easily offer subtitles. However, the story relies on the level of the movie, not with any story, whatever the slightest importance. The symbol of horror and nature power destroys human character - there are scenes where flowers make the face of Hoody Lammer obscure - and here are some moments that will remind the viewers of Dryer, Vertov and Rifenstall. If there is a message to promote the film, I think it is a political issue: the people of the bourgeoisie are horrific and cruel; People of the working class are happy, productive animals; And the Creator of the woman, he determined to be unfulfilled until a child was born. The combination of Soviet Socialist Reality and National Socialist Contradiction does not mock the movie - it's a beauty to start from the beginning - but it keeps it in a very distinct artistic era. And, oh yes, Hudy closes her kit.
