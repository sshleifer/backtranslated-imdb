When I was released in England in the year 1980, I saw the first "breaking glass". I like it then and it was caught in a Canadian station in August 2006, it's still cool. The only thing that I'm sorry is that I can not find the store's sound track or DVD? ... Some people want to run some light, or I have to order from a more valuable Internet company than this. But while returning to the film, the music stood for the test, Had to say something about the Hejel / Kate Britain's 80 ... In fact, I went to Canada for the same decade because one of those reasons was "Thatcher" and what she is doing in the country at the time. Sorry if you get the chance to watch this movie!
