This movie is awesome. Now, I like to make my films heavy in the story and dialogue, but now and then, something like Munwalkar comes, and it can be seen despite many errors. <BR> <br /> This movie is not much more than the entertaining Michael Jackson advertisement. The sick video starts from 'Man in the Mirror', a mood of its achievement, and its carrier's bits and bobs, it goes through all the height of his life, then it crashes into a truly, truly entertaining segment, which is a 'bad' and 'speed' Funny music video for demo, he runs from fans of manic stop-motion and finally dancing against rabbit dresses Live. Stop speed will not be as bad as you believe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, very ridiculous. We saw Michael walking outside of a building, then thousands of soldiers were shot. Then we hit flashback, showing MJ and three children stumbling over an underground layer. 'Mr. Big' (Joe Pacey) is a wolf who has a plan to get every child in the world across the 'medicines' (no specific reference) at a young age. MJ and younger daughter she is caught, then on the back ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really important. We got two very cool sequences where the MJ is a car, then a robot-spatial thing, and of course, amazing 'smooth criminal' clause. <br /> <br /> This is such a movie, but it's fantastic for anyone who likes MJ. It's its biggest hit and some great little bits and some very good special effects (especially robots / spaceship sequences) are valuable, especially that you can ask a question about eBay. It will keep the kids quiet for a few hours, as well as 20 children who were first released.
