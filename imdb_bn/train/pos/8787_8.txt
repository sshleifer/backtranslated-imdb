This photo has improved my opinion about Ir√®le Flein. Although Flin must be known for his companion-fire and sprat (although high-falutin 'to throw both of the European posts!), This film gives him the opportunity to limit himself as an actor (although he is only a little) to match with a huge ego and a nervous Unabashed social climber Support Cast is excellent; Everyone seems to be well chosen for their role. <br /> <br /> The story continues intensely and is not particularly deep, (probably, deliberately missed the opportunity to provide social commentary about the extremely unbalanced distribution of income at the time), it must be entertaining and content. From the story I know about Jim Carbert, the story is logically loyal to the history. I really liked the great illustration of San Francisco 1880 After all, the film does not have much choice ... it's very good to watch.
