My kids have recently started to see the repetitions of this show - the first episode of N and the next in ABC family - and they like it. (I was not aware that the show continued in the first or second season) I am curious that all the cast changes inspire - I've described them as "very publicized" and still searching for half an hour, the web efforts were so good that the early episodes were so good compared to the next episode. Nothing has been published without infinite comment about it. (Personally, I can not see the full difference - the script and theme are mostly the same - but they lose some great ones) My daughter's DVD puts her wish list on it, so perhaps the land's special features and commentary will all be lightened. I also want to make some self-referential humor about the changes - such as "Boy Moyce World" where they release the little sister for the whole season, or when a different actor shows him playing after, they ask him where he was and he said , "Upward," or when the Initial Series Token Giac "Minkus" shows for high school graduation, they ask him where he is à¦¼ and he said, "there" does not refer to a part of the classroom by the camera, saying, "Hey, Mr. Turner, please wait!" And running on screen (other turners of Mr. Turner left) Oh well - maybe there will be a real Hollywood story about this or something? I was very happy to see Annie Hilda in the final - she was always my darling - it was too bad that it could not be a more extensive cast reconciliation. (Gilda candle does not cut it for me)
