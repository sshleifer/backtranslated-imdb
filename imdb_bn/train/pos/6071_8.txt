As I try, I do not claim anything, "Othello" will not get any good movie version. If you like Kenneth Bruno's superb masterpieces, I'm sure you'll see Oliver Parker's "Othello" irrelevant, as much as I do "Much Ado Around Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996). Lawrence Fishburne has had several fantastic roles during his career. He was quite awesome at "Boys N the Hood" (1991) - I always considered the impressive role of his angry styles as his greatest achievement. <br /> <br /> She played part of Othello and probably played the most challenging role of her career, but she did a fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob's Critical Story of Despicable Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh, Manipult villain Yago is just simply extraordinary, a most impressive role. Excellent "Othello" is part of the noble elite among Shakespeare's impressive works. It relates to his favorite topics: superstitions, jealousy, deception and jealousy. Based on William Shakespeare's plays, this film adaptation must be one of the best films.
