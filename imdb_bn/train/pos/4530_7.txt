D.W. Griffith made a film that he wanted to make after the huge economic success of 'the birth of the nation'; He chose the most technically ambitious film on that date, 'intolerance.' She has taken risks with such innovation as film montage and form, and as a result of well-known financial train debris. Buster Keaton 'Three Ages', 'Intolerance' does not take a risk with a parody. This is Kitton's first feature-length movie (he only played 'The Sapphaed'). The film had a fallback plan for three separate shorts sharing three different episodes, which Griffith did 'with intolerance'. Do not have to do Keaton. Chaplin had already been successful with feature comedy, so if Keaton was taking a risk here, it was fully calculated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Keaton seems to adude that film, as well as adude. The ancient Rome episode wrestling scene refers to Triflefight, which became a wrestling match in Chaplin's film. The greatest distance from both scenes is the same, the same. In addition, Chaplin's image imitates Damele's Carmen's shiny style and Chaplin's film honors the movie. Keaton did not try the nature of his parody, or the nature of the narrative structure or narrative, but it seems 'intolerance' tender. At least, the stories are not completely straightforward like other post-inteolance films, such as Drew's Chavez's Book of Lives (Blade F. Sawants Bug, 1921) and Fritz Lang's Destiny (Dar Mood Tod, 1921). ). There are some light jumping in the episode. <br /> <br /> where Keton was at risk, but his physical, brave comedy. That Keaton unintentionally failed to jump across modern-day buildings. In the report, he was convinced to change the scene instead of trying to jump again. And, it was not just Keaton who risked; For example, the anachronistic baseball gag, was rather dangerous. So, although differently, Keithton, like Griffith, risked his big movie. And, I think they both succeed.
