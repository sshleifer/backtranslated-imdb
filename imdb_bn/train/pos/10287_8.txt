This is a movie that they have promoted too much. You t.v. See, you can not watch movies. Almost all the funny scenes have been lost in previews, only Jennifer Aniston will have to be funny. It's usually Jim Currie's humor and it's really fun. Do not just go to see the hope of being surprised. Above all, if you like Jim Carey or Comedy, of course it must be seen, otherwise just look at the previews and you'll be happy.
