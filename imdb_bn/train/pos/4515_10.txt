That film is absolutely fantastic !! If you look at it with your friends, it can be a very nice day ... you must clearly tell that this picture is stupid and very poorly directed and played (Tamba / Suspicious couple), and perhaps it is worse movie, But you can enjoy it a lot. We saw it in 19 and it was a very nice evening. The best scenes are the first, when the perpetrator killed Alex's friend, and he tried to act frustrating, and consequently a comic scene in the first division ... and then when he showed Leva (antivable, what a name) "Palashi de Giasastasia" and Then the lava accident, which was going out of the car once, and secondly, the car is completely empty! What a magic!
