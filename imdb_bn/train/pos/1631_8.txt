This movie has it all in it. Sight, fine joke, words and verse play. This is about a rage tag group of different ethnic and social class boys coming together to defeat a common enemy. If you have seen it once, you can see it in the House House (and yes I love the Animal House). I kept the top 15 fun movies. The son's temperament of a son's academy is that he wants to make every child bad and trouble (he is right in this movie). He is sad, uncaring, cruel and taken down. A group of boys who do not match together with the first boys, can get rid of Major to survive and write Major Magazines, only to get rid of the mood. One will see - you will love it!
