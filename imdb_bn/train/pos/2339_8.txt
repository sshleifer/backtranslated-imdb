I love this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if I keep it in sync with them, then I did not notice it. I like cinematography story books. I also love the story of love, even though I enjoy it, although I am surprised by my mind that the part of the story participating can actually be developed such as Ned chalk or touching ... well, you know. I like chalk, I do not think it boring, and I usually hate sweet, beautiful, perfect characters. I even like the voices of the narrator, even it disturbs one of my family members and maintains something similar in some walgreens. I can condemn other things about the accident and other writers about how to deal with it in the future but I would rather wait and wait and see what the author's wild story is.
