First of all I want to say that the Edison Chain is very hot and Sam Lee looks much better than the XD! This is probably one of the most original movies I have seen; A Cambodian shows a poverty lifestyle background. Cambodian (Edison Ur Pang) killed people to save their lives; It has been done throughout his life. Sam Lee's (Y) responsibility is to catch Cambodian well. There are lots of violent actions but it has a good story. The film shows the struggle between those two characters; They both beat each other like angry dogs. Go and see the PPL ... strongly recommended !!! (Go to HH Films)
