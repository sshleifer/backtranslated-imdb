A winter day, 28 December 1986, a two-year-old movie rental of two bored. "Hmmm, police story, looks interesting", "Who is this Jackie Chan?", "Never heard of him" After watching the movie two hours later, in a glow, we wanted to know more. After 16 years (JC got out of pocket since the collection of the film!) This picture still feels different to me. All right, maybe I have a soft spot for it because it's my "first" (not counting cannonball runs !!) Jessie Cinema, but it's a great movie. It's all classic Jessie stuff, action, humorous, action, heart and action! Some comments date has been made, it was created in 1985, of course it's date! But then Gius, Casablanca, Singin's rain and The Godfather !!!!!! Where will the Hollywood work without police story like? PS set standards, many movies have been stolen for use in other movies. To really appreciate it, you must watch it on the widescreen, otherwise you will miss the movie so much (yes, she was actually going around the corner!). If you have not already, watch this movie now !!!! <br /> <br />
