The entertainment movie is very good and Jimmy Stewart co-starred with Chip Hardsty, along with Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But this film, directed by legendary director Marvin Leray, is consistently inspired and along with the authorization of the script, every aspect of the film is taken under clothing, which is J. Edgar Hoover was closely monitored and controlled. J. Edgar Hoover has nothing to boast of. His execution on 1940, his Board of Directors relied on the best investigative services in the world. But by 1959 Hughor was already concerned about being forced and started collecting DOS on powerful people to ensure and strengthen its little empire. And he is convinced that the single bird will not show the image of any motion picture. These films show steady success and shine on the failures, and in the early 1950s, the cats bitten the cats. Enjoy the story, but firmly with the tongue in the cheek.
