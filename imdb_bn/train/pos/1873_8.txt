Fierce and rebel Fifty-year-old sailor Antoine Fisher (Derek Luk) naval psychologist said. Three sessions were sent for evaluation with Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Reluctant to start treatment, she gained confidence in Davenport and expressed her childhood, publishing painful traumas produced in her home-care home. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smallie (Joy Brian), and they love each other. To solve his personal problem, Antwone became a new man. This real family drama is a sensitive and positive story of a person who finds a friend and returns to regular life. Denzel Washington's excellent, sensitive, interesting and good taste in the direction, made a story about child abuse. In the hands of other directors, it could be a very heavy story. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Voltage a Weaver' ('Live to Returning')
