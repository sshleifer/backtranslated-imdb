Inspirational story of Carl Brasier (Cuba Gooding, Junior) grew up in poverty in the Kenni region and then joined the US Navy to become interested in the first Black Master Diver in the Navy. In order to prove our childhood to be true, the continuation of our struggle has been shown to overcome the brassier (and then keep him alive) from childhood. Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert Deanaro) was not the main coach. Diving School Navy sends Brasier, not particularly sympathetic to Brasír's goal, but eventually becomes unbelievable friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; Quickly paced and with a lot of actions, even though a "action" picture in the normal sense of the word. Here is a very human story, and an interesting study of racism and struggle to overcome it; There is also a sense of clash between the older and small navy officers ("Old Navy" v. "New Navy") in the 1960s. The performance is quite good - especially the 'Goodings'. I think Deñero probably had some of the top of his screenplay on Sunday (though, who knows, this was probably the worst kind of robbery on Sunday) and the script of the Sunday Gennen (by Charles Theron) questioned me whether these parts were used to pay for entertainment. Was "jazz up". <br /> <br /> is a good movie, though. <br /> <br/> <br/> <br />
