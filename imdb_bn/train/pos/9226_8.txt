I used to read the Horoscope of Flavir for many years, but at the beginning of last year I saw it when I went to buy an insane film, and whatever it was, I thought it was, though I did it a few months after seeing it. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie, set in Italy somewhere near the 15th century. Of course the medieval era (although I think no specific year is ever given). During this Christian domination, the age is a time of insane frenzy, and the film is very well captured. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She seems to be a warm and playful fellow, and she is immediately taken with her. Her father, standing alongside a soldier of the family stood up, almost immediately, and murdered people injured right before his eyes. But he will see him in his dream. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Flavia Nutiia comes under the influence of salt. But in the mad world, only the sari is really crazy, and this pious sister clearly recognizes the madness around her. The times that he lives in, hit a pair with Flavia, who started to question the young and apparently the sanctuary, everything around the world that he trapped himself. <br /> <br /> The movie disagreed that its screenplay, display a lot of unpleasant in the world. We see a horse gelded, a rape of women in her land in a heaven rape, religious persecution of a young nun Through it, Flavia monitors and questions, refuses, finally, a Christian faith that creates a horrifying parade that criticizes the film as being anarchist for several years. I disagree with that criticism. Flavia's view, though, sometimes vaguely expresses the mirror, for example, the contemporary feminist commentary (the film was made in 1974), which is really moving around quite obvious questions. Probably, it is hard to believe that he is getting so much fish out of the water at his own time, but this is the smallest point that can not belittle it. Flavia is written in this way to allow us to negotiate with our affair, or of any era, its plight. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Islamists still visit their dreams. Almost immediately after being tragic with her, she instructed him to properly organize the army, become a warrior in the entire war-gear and to overthrow the attackers' Christian society and allow evil revenge for retaliation against those who saw it. <Br> <br /> Is he the new and better pastor of the world? He may think, but the Muslims of that era were not big on feminism, as he soon learned hard work. They say, meet the new boss ... <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is quite tragic, and very frustrating, With All in a mass audience movie, be sure. Although it is quite good, and it does not remain on the "nunsploitation" pill that it is often discouraged thrown out. I think there is a lot of value in the final film, and I'm glad I saw it.
