Before watching the show I saw a few segments and I was too young to see it as part of the Jersey Devil, but I particularly remember to see this episode 11 years old and apparently coming out. Where they get to die by bus and then hypnotize scenes with younger girl. I say you can not sleep for weeks! For this reason, this episode is now a special landscape about my moaning factor, which I enjoyed. The soul of her previous life really had to wait 9 years before she began to revenge her, as it was enough to show some of the apparent error of the plot. Or he was sitting randomly on a bus in the middle of the night. You would think his father would be worried. And perhaps they just did not see the part of that story. And with telecommunications? There was no good explanation for this, in relation to the fact that in relation to really adding a really awesome Keri factor. But even with its small flaws, this is a classic episode in my mind and there is no reason why I do not like it. 10 out of 10
