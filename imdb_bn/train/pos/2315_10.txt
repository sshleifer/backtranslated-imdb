This movie is so valuable that it is difficult to know what to start with praise. Let me start by expressing my appreciation for a perfect script for Reese Witherspoon. That's really excellent to stand out in its excellent cast performance. Robert Mulgin has rarely disappointed us who praised his work. Every man in The Man in the Moon is the best proof of film making.
