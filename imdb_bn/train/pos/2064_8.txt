ScareCrow was the most fun killers I've ever played! Plus he was really bouncy most of the time he jumped around, which was extraordinary! Also he was a great voice I mean it was perfect for him. The story line was very nice. I was like how the kids' soul is transferred into ScareCrow! Please cause the killing of all of them, that means what people have done with him ... I'm angry too! The look of scarecrows was really good! His face was "OMG!" Gives feedback when they see him! What was funny was funny! Those people were stupid, who would wait for that long! They should draw their attention and should run for their life ... though it will not make a difference!
