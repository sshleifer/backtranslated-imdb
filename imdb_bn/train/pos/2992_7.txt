The director does not even like this movie, but for me it seems to be a bit rude on himself. <br /> <br /> Sure it's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Film for me, so anyone who comes along with us deserve our attention, and this one is not as bad as you can think of
