This is a really well made movie. Sumitra Bhav has always made an intelligent movie and it is his favorite movie. This film has won the National Award and I like to represent India in the Oscars. This year, I'm going to Oscars from India, at least thousands of times better than Shaos. <br /> <br /> It is so sad that information about this (and all other Indian films) is the lack of IMDb and sometimes wrong. Sadassive Amrutkar played a very important character in this film and he did not give credit to these pages too. The rest of the cast and the crew are not much mentioned. Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film, even for the film, the award and nomination was not given. There was not even a single vote for 'Dogi'. <br /> <br /> 'Dogi' is not a Hindi movie. It is not tangled in Marathi, and thanks to escapes songs and dance sequences, glitzy glamor and half-witted designer warehouses. It is a real life, animated story which is created with a rare intellect and respect. <br /> <br /> 'Dughi' which can be translated as roughly two women, two sisters, Gauri and Krishna stories. This is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Vav does not participate in many sub-plots and it makes a very difficult movie to manage. The whole film is set up in a non-specific remote village in Maharashtra and the screen is rarely kept away from the houses of two female heroes. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image opens and is familiar to our entire house, preparing for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Krishna's hard-working farmers, this room is full and happy; There is nothing missing in their simple life. However, on the day before the marriage, Gauri's husband and wife-husband suffered a fatal accident. Gauri's parents could not tolerate sad news and could enjoy a big stroke. Without a strong, active member, the room could have been separated but Gauri's mother took charge. And when he can work, he can but can not finish. But his life is still easier than Gauri. Tragedy, those who try to forget half-heartedly, wish Gauri to be unhappy. He was expelled from society. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother wrote to her brother. Frustrated for help he took his advice. He took Gauri to Mumbai, where he was working for prostitution. Gauri sends money home and improves their condition. Gauri gives her life for her family. <br /> <br /> But when Gauri returns home for Krishna's wedding, his mother does not come to meet him. He does not allow Krishna to approach him and does not allow Gauri in front of guests. He loves Gauri but fears for Krishna's life. This Gauri broke completely and he decided to return to his unfortunate life. But Krishna runs out and gauri. She begs back her favorite sister Krishna promised to stand up to him. The promise that they will face the world ?? Together <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that is not needed. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes to Mumbai but what does he say? Have fine dialogue to know us. This is just a bare story, which is deep in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> Movie 'Dogi' is responsible. It governs the subject by conducting it. Is it respectful to his audience? I do not think they have a mental capacity of four years old. <br /> <br /> The first rate of acting. Aspects incredible ?? The silence story may proceed further, there may be no words. The scripts are well researched. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates movies like 'Dogi' likes it.
