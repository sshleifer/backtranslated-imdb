This was the best war documentary ever made ever since. From the beginning of the first episode, Sir Lawrence Olivier described the horrific incident that occurred in 'Horrible Days' in Ordaur-sur-Glane. In the final days of the war, when mushroom clouds occur throughout Japan, I did not miss the second in this classical series, and I remember it even after returning to 1974. Each aspect of this tragedy was enclosed in detail. This whole series must be viewed as compulsory for the children as much as possible in the world so that the tragedy of World War II is not repeated and that hatred, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious enterprise.
