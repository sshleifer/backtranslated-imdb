Each second of the film is fantastic. And that's why it earns a 7, because the plot is not particularly confusing and for the last 90 minutes I have never felt any excitement or investment in the letter. If anything, luxurious graphics and framing specific scenes (for example, car charges) will become more pedestrians - they are not so beautiful and some very original designs and occasionally do not create novel camera angles - but they do not have any natural action / thriller Partner movement and close shots are missing. Please wait the first hour, and the dialog is very editable and looks a bit stable - people wait for each other to finish and do not react at normal speed, which can cause problems for each individual's individual recording. Voice programs do not match perfectly on rare occasions; Something that should really be avoided. The future architecture is very interesting (lots of glass walls / ceilings / screens, lovely smoke / mirage / special effects) and beautiful looks, but again - it's more graphic design exercises which do not have any effect on the story. I have argued that the complete points of use of the drawn animation (instead of the actor / CGII) really push the imagination and design limit; Which is very difficult / unreal in other mediums Even though the animations in the Renaissance are absolutely amazing and incredible, I never felt that I was seeing something that was not done before. <br /> <br /> Another French CGI photo of Amartel is also unbalanced. Beauty's on the story and the pace To be perfect, there is a gradual momentum between some fantastic and compelling French movies, and raindrops can make a lot of emotion in the linking links or Parisian roles - but the animations should understand that the unique strength comes in animation, it also has weaknesses compared to real life strategies. . Perhaps it might refrain from 'Nir' rules that want to stop the film, but I think that filmmakers have missed an amazing opportunity to analyze some of their future society - social level, fascist stability of the corporations etc. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have no problem recommending Renaissance to enjoy stylistic designs and / or animations (especially 'manga' fans), but I do not have any other film-loving friends I do not want to sit through. Take away the glorious visual and it is a barely average film.
