Very good west This first writer Richard Wilson directed a film, it was the first for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. A pleasure to see a very young and beautiful Angel Dickinson as a salon girl. Robert Mitchell came to the city and was appointed as the city's tomorrhoids, but people are worried that he will go too far, even about the damage to the city business. The story has a similarity with the "Warlock" created in 1952. This movie keeps a very fast and exciting moment, it keeps you on the edge.
