AG was an excellent presentation of drama, mystery and thriller which is very rare in American TV. Sheriff Lucas Williams gave many viewers. To prevent the tendency of Sheriff Lucas, we routinely Caleb. We became engrossed and terrifying on learning incredible connections between these two characters. The week's manipulation was really amazing to hide what Luqas wants to do the next day. This event was held in "Gothic" Moniker, which has rarely been tried for American entertainment, much less efficient. The suit definitely made a big mistake not supporting this show. This show shines the shiny current of "reality" shows - much less than the satisfaction of seeing. Well-based call for a DVD box set For watching this quality of the show, look for quality for a discerning market hungry for viewing. Taking this prosperity fare mentally silly reality will welcome this jewel to tell a real real story. Get DVD Box Set !!
