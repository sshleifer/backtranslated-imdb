Ron Cleier is a wonderful elementary musical film, funny and malicious as his silent "Italian Straw Hat". Using the term for the conversation and effect, not only for dialogue and impact, but also to clarify the first musical instruments of clarity in America (for example, the opera scene from the opera in a non-night opera strongly influenced by Lee Millions). All the cinephilos (but not the ones) should be seen, and the DVD from the benchmark is just as good as you want. There is no extra ton, but I have never seen most DVD extras in vain fluffs and disc clerk interviews. Get it when it's still near.
