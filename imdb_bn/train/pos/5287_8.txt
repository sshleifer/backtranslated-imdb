It is also one of the few cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian - and a place dog named K-9. This Looney Tunes episode is very funny, then there are good cartoon animations (Marvin's animation is very well done) and the plot is well done. The end is rather weird, so be prepared for it, it's a little annoying. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin Martian has been sent to Earth to send the world and brought back to Mars. With his trusted dog K-9, Marvin came out and soon found the track of any other rabbit but bugs! He thinks trick or treaters in their dresses, greets them with treatment. <br /> <br /> I do not understand that I'm preparing myself to take this episode to Mars. <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode to someone who likes Bagasse Bonnie, Marvin the Martian and Lonnie Tunes in general. As the start and middle of the episode is concerned, so you can choose it. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
