I like this movie. Its another Yash Raj movie that you know will look good on screen, all the characters are always beautiful or very beautiful, which you know will eventually become beautiful ... Another rule is that hero heroine; S only have one or any guardian. MP K. Suman has no mother, HMAP does not have Salman's father, and the last rule is 90% probability of Alanknath's tears ... <br /> <br /> The film is very good. It's a bit slow at first but keeps you entertaining. There is almost no comedy but it makes you smile often enough. The little baby (Hero's nephew) is well placed and is very well provided one liners. Actress is not very nice but shy you will find that in real life. This picture does not have a huge happy family living in big houses, which I have given you a good idea to separate from the movie. There will be many women crying at the end of the film! There is not a strong message from this film but it's a good watch. If you marry (married marriage) the movie will remind you what you wrote. And if you are not, it can tell you and fear you ... <br /> <br /> Overall, a very good looking movie. No big plots or twists but a very gentle film, much like Bollywood classic.
