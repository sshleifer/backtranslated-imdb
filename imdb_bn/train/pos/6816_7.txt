Even though I was not a child, this family movie was fun and enjoyable. It is based on the concept of Susanna (Elisa Cuthbert), a high school girl who discovered that the elevator in her high-rise apartment building becomes a time machine when an elevator of a key chain that was obtained from a blind scientist becomes a lock. Learn how to control the machine (with some uncertainties about the time of day). <br /> <br /> This picture is not a serious science fiction work. To change past with the past unrest, you must ignore the temporary instability, that is, the change in the past 1881 will prevent the family from being poor, but the change means that the family will not be financially troubled, so Victoria will not have Susan told about the financial problems of her mother, whose Money does not have to cause Susan to change in the past! But apart from that, there are some nice touches in the story, such as the old elevator panel, in the apartment of the woman who secretly discovers and installs the time machine, there is no space for lockers that enable the feature of the machine. . Like many stories for children, we also need to remember that the child will not share amazing information about time-consuming devices with parents or other adults, but rather hide the traveler. <br /> <br /> It also needs to ignore some unhealthy performance in some weaker stage scenes and adult actors. (Child actors (Elisa Cuthbert, Gabriel Bonnie and Matthew Harber) all believed strongly in their part.) In the 1300s, Americans monitored and photographed Susan. But they do not surprise this blonde, white skin girl look amazing appearance in amazing dresses. Their response is to stop just what they are doing and Susan has to walk quietly. In the same scenario, an Indian mother carries what the baby is supposed to be, but it is a doll (her white skin and her head flows around). <br /> <br /> <br /> In the TV's old "thirty climbing" fame earned some unintentional, sometimes lazy, performance. Another extremist Michel Peron has done hamming as the Italian Building Superintendent (Generator), as Richard Schuster plays his role as a helpless neighbor. (The neighbor's name is Edward Oremandroid, which is based on the author's name.) I suspect that this problem may be a potential error of the director or the low budget. <br /> <br /> Despite these flaws, I recommend movies for kids. In addition to the interesting stories, it has some educational standards, indicating how much technology and social values ​​have changed in less than 100 years.
