Are we making 'Video atheist' again? The 8mm Remac in the big budget of the digital widescreen, this is a journey. Unfortunately there are some stories and sometimes it becomes like a travel because our heroine searches for sled spots in Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. I'm rather silent with everything for 'unused' scenes, hot wax, stiff whip and rough sex drowning, titles and anything. These scenes are stupid and it is a sad Bruno and its budget could not be easily expanded to create more sophisticated animals than the characters.
