I have seen this movie a long time ago, but it has been fantastic and this day has never stopped me surprisingly. <br /> <br /> A nice movie that describes the account of a group of Australian commanders, who tried to sink, while the height of WW2, Japanese ships in Singapore's harbor. <br /> <br /> These commands are caught in clothing and they are considered as spy by Japanese prisoners. But something happened that I found that there was not much research done in any Hollywood WW2 movie. <br /> <br /> Close and friendly relations between the prisoners and captives have been developed. They began to pay homage to each other, when Captain Australian army captain became the best friend with a senior Japanese prison guard. This is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really makes your heart toggling. Soon, as two days, two friends are communicating, the Australian captain learns that some other detainees are being tried and executed for ship sinking in Singapore's harbor. <br /> <br /> He mentions that it was his party and not anyone else who sank his Japanese friend and the Japanese defenders said that he should be silent because the execution of his whole party could be effective. But the captain continued this confession to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities give the most honorable execution according to their rules. This is the highest honor for prisoners in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the most horrifying part of this movie where Australian soldiers are waiting for their imminent death and annoying the friendly Japanese forces is still not ready to believe why their Australian friend was found guilty. <br /> <br /> I will not end it here. But it can be more harmful than imagination and easily move one into tears. Finally, an extraordinary underlying film that could not possibly be recognized internationally. Get a copy of today and be mesmerized.
