Each scene is fully assembled. This movie was a wonderful cast and crew. I mean, you could have a bad movie with Robert Donnie Jr., so nobody will be there. He has the power to shine a film with his extraordinary talent. This movie was perfect! I saw this movie alone in the movie "Blockbuster" in the shelf of the movie and called it to me, I could not resist it and prevented me from bringing home with me. You can call me a sad romantic call, but this movie has touched my heart, not to mention that at the same time I can make a smile. Although it made me cry, I acknowledge that the whole film has made my view even more brighter after her life. I advised to spoil my scary, action, and a brother's humorous comedy, who enjoyed this movie completely. This is a film with a movie feeling. It can make you laugh loudly, touch your heart, fall in love and enjoy your life. Every time you keep this movie going past, just be aware that this inspirational film likes to live and feel. Who knows? If it really can happen to you, and keep open to the mysterious surprise of your mind's life.
