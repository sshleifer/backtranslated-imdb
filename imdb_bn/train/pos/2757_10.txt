If you want to watch a variety of movies, if you feel love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this movie will make you think. Although Georgie is mentally obnoxious, you can finally see the final intelligence, when love does not direct you to the brain. I'm not emotional, but this picture makes you think of people. The film is as good as Forrest Gump in my belief. Foreign movies are sometimes more interesting, but there are not enough ads to make them popular. Majeed Mazidi's "Rang-e Ishwara" (The Color of the God) is one of the examples of such foreign films, almost the same taste.
