I do not believe in any opinion about a movie. That goes for critics as well. Of course, if it gets a positive review that's right and plus but most movies that get critical rave, I hate it. I enjoyed it for a photo, an entertaining film. It carries from you a few hours of life and a fictional character ... that's the Catherine Troll. Sharon Stone is extraordinary in this role, just as he is the first one. Anyone who thinks horror in this movie must have the same feeling of similarity with the same feeling. He played the same way in the Basic Institute. 1. Catherine is playing her and she is in full swing. Its one liners great, many like the first one. When he tells the police, who can forget in the first movie, "If you want to arrest me ... otherwise remove f ** from here!" Great view, and believe me, he does this again. I was captivated by her. Her dress, she believes, the way to smoke her cigarette, just to see the performance of Stone is worth it. I can not wait for the movie to be released from DVDs, because I can imagine how good it will be. And yes, there are a lot of twists, like the end!
