Me and my sister hired this movie because we were somewhat shocked and funny for the mood. But the film has exceeded my expectations. <br /> <br /> This is much more than a century's representation. It contains very real imagery of characters and most actors do a great job. Various stories are baked together with real footage from the time that it gives a very unique touch. When I was seeing this, I really felt that I took care of what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Julia Styles in Katie's painting, she was so cool that I would recommend this picture to anyone.
