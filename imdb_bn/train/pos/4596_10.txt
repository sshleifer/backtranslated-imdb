This is Jackie Chan's best film, and my personal favorite. After creating a frustrating US operated by James Gullenhaus, Jackie accepted the idea and pushed the shank in Hong Kong. This is probably Jackie's most violent movie, breaking the bones of the audience, cringing on the string. <br /> <br /> This action was quick and angry, Jackie and his crew really tried the best in the design of the war. The process of creating this image has broken the bones and the blood is spread as you can see in the credits. <br /> <br /> The script is a simple police and robbery thing, nothing special, everything was written after it. Action I want to say that the English version has a little bit of dubbing, but it does not have to stop you a lot. <br /> <br /> So, get the rounds of the rounds, open the beer and enjoy. However, the film was called the 'Glass Story' nickname by the Stunt crew. Why? I'll let you find out for yourself !!
