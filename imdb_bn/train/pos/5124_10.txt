This is a great movie, I do not think John Travolta gets enough credits as Saturday night feathers or Greece. She loves a girl who loves a girl but she is very dry to accept her own feelings. Instead, he wants to be involved in mechanical Baul ride because he thinks it will show his manhood. Although it was created in the 1980s, it is still timely. Great country music soundtrack is awesome 10/10
