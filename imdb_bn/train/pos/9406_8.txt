Other commentators have described the plot and social instances and comments (and well) that I could, but I would like to join my praise for this little jewel. After 50 years in every section - screenplay, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... it's really good quality. This was my first exposure to "young" Alex Guinness, and from the first frames it is clear that this makes him particularly special for getting knighthood. <br /> <br /> I just rated it a "8" because it is basically a lightweight example which tests human nature but it does not really empty; And the plot finally finds the easy way, instead of solving the conflict between inventors and mill workers and artists who follow him in the town. Also, a few minute thoughts reveal a fundamental flaw in the script's argument - wear and tears are rarely the reason behind buying new clothes (especially dresses). Children grow, man changes, gains and loses weight, and always goes with the latest fashion and as long as there are loin cloths. And if nothing else, the manufacturer will make a fortune by supplying an integral component for the military uniform (especially BDU). <br /> <br /> Still, it's a great movie. If you get a chance to watch it on a classic movie channel, you should.
