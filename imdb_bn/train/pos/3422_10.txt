I need it on a tape, not a DVD, and soon! <br /> <br /> I have a nephew who is in the infant but still not engaged, even though he is going to Iraq after December 2008. I lost my favorite step son of Ramadi Iraq to 09-15-05 from a human chain of green zones. I have another nephew who is joining the army as soon as he graduates in high school, because he has some ideal and romantic ideas about what he is doing in the army like his elder brother. My stepson died only after 10 days in the country and he did not go to any mission, so there is no way to make any referencing from this documentary personal experience of my nephew that can be expressed by my dead son. <br /> <br /> I can not do anything, or I have left now, but there is one left in my hand that has not taken the hand and still swears. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Never seen. I have to see what he has got before I can delay my small nephew. But: (laughter) I need my mother to see this first. He must definitely see and hear this man and woman, not just their idea, but how truthfully they will drown forever, is the truth. Then my brother will have his emotional determination to show this film and then he will see his son, my little nephew, and also see him. Then, my nephew might start to take this importance. <br /> <br /> ((Any other time to be shown on TV? If so, tell me?)) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The DVD player is not the owner, he still uses the video (is he correct? Tape?) So, to find out the film, he has a way to find out. Can I buy this from anyone in that form? If not, then there is no other way to get it in the form of tapes from me? From a legitimate link I can download it to my computer and then move it to a tape. If so, then who will I contact? I would gladly pay it for the privilege to provide a valid link. <br /> <br /> If you have any ideas, then consider what you can say. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I've lost a very valuable person and have already liked it, I already know that my old nephew will never return and he will also release her. I can not embrace the three people and the mental toll for those who are returning it is not too expensive to pay the price for every male of my family. Help me I'll gladly call you, if I am the best way to get the required information, please email me a number. Thank you so much for any help you have. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Laurie Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
