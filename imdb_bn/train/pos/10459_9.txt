I was not expecting this picture to portray a family that you are hoping to be at the next door. They are not like ordinary meat and blood people, usually Hollywood rentals. They face a very common problem - illness illness But the storyline greets the heart through a powerful lesson. Casting, script, direction, and acting stream flows together with the attractiveness of the audience. Give your full attention to this film and its message will really be inspired.
