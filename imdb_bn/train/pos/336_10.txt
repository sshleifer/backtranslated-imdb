It has already been, the best version of Homer's epic. Completely shot in the natural natural location. Sea and sky are suddenly blue, the island is green and untouched. Linens, wool and fur fabrics, everything is a bit annoying and primitive, some of which you find in Cocoais or Passolini, and this makes it even more authentic. Although the story is based on mythology and is widely suprised, it gives us a good idea about what life may be like in the 10th century BC. <br /> <br /> The lithium is somewhat slowly and unstable, but the whole you get so fast that you get it. In fact, it is uncommonly close to Homer's original plot, if the text itself does not exist. Ulysses does not appear until the first hour, his son begins to look after him. Then he suddenly lost in the storm, land on the Fiasian island where the royal family took good care of him. His events have been described as a description of his host of flashbacks: the terrible cyclops, the SAARC, the magic world, the secrets of magic and the earth. Finally, after 20 years, he finally returned to his hometown Ithaca, and it ended dramatically with the killings. Her faithful husband Penelope protesters <br /> <br /> As a story, the ODC is a unique metaphor for people's struggle for life. Cast is bright and international here. Irene Papas gives us the ability to perform Greek tragedy style like Penelope, but Alexander is most amazing like actor Beckham Falah Ulysses.

I saw this short series in 8 parts of French Television until 1974. I was then a child and although it was all black and white, it had a very clear effect. For the rest of my life, I was surprised that if I had an opportunity to watch it again, because it was never seen on French TV later. <br /> <br /> I recently found a copy in the DVD (all in nice colors) via the Internet. Unfortunately there is no subtitle in Italy only, though French and German versions were then available. I have never been able to hear the English version of this photo because it is widely known in the Anglo-Saxon world, and it is shameful. If you ever get to see it, you will never forget it. There was not much version of Odyssey before or after <br /> <br />. In 1955, Cameroni played a classic sword-sandal like "10 Commandments", but it is very impressive and not too small for such a complex story. A special guest in Kochlovski's 1997 film, special effects, sometimes quite playful, has played badly and is away from Homer's story and environment.
