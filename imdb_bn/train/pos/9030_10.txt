This film caught me by surprise. My friend told me that this movie was "Chick Flick". Boy, he was wrong! This movie has a great family appeal with sex scenes like _Other_ movies. Jack Gyllenhaal Homer Hickam makes an excellent job of shoes. Supporting Cast is fantastic, as well. <br /> <br /> science, arrivals, family quarrels, a great train scene ... this movie has everything. The soundtrack is good, though the score is presented in quite choppy ways. The 50-second music highlights the movie on the edge of the greatness. <br /> <br /> DVD must be extremely intense in the coal. Replay quality is great - I've already seen it several times already.
