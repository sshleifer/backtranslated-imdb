I see them all. <br /> <br /> This is not surprising ones (_Striyy Ballroom_, _What can we dance? _ (Japanese version), but it is totally respectable and joyfully in different parts. <br /> <br /> I am an English teacher And I find some ignorance about language, but rather overwhelming, for example: "The name should not be screamed." How does it go? "Since film titles can ignore grammar" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So I only realized myself that I would have difficulty understanding it. It was not all that difficult and it was so different from the other stage movie that I saw. <br /> <br /> I set this movie in Toronto and, in fact, it I wanted to set more clearly that the heroine throw so curiously. I enjoyed the stepping routine. I operated Mum Chori Ra choice. I think most of the things in the film more than dance movies exclusively characteristic features have been highlighted. <br /> <br /> summary, if you like dancing, but it's a decent film. If you have a higher issue with the English standard grammar, then you are talking big, your narrow mind can find it difficult to enjoy this movie.
