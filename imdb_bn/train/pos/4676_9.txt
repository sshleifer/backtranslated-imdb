I made this movie exciting, and its obscurity refreshes a world of fast-fix movies where we are fascinating to love "good people" and to hate "bad guy". Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, has done a great job of depicting the family of the black sheep / lost child who has met his father's love and respect as well as his widowed gentleman with whom he is visually visible. History Jude Hirish plays against the image of his normal good man who is left with a father who made his son triangle and now he has refused. <br /> <br /> When I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was abusive that the lovely way was used to illustrate a family tradition, as the director explained. <br /> <br /> It is the heir to the classic "ordinary people" I just realized that it was Jude Hirosh!
