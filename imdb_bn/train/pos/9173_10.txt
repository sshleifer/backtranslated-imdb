I think this is a great version, I've come here, to find out which version I should use, and I read a comment on user comments by Jane Aire in 1983 and then helped me get this version. I do not regret this sort of sorting and you will not. I have tried to see all other versions and can not match it, there is nothing like a book and if you read the book you are reading a book that matches it. When you've read the book, looking for something real and running it is hard because you want something that matches it. I personally say this version of God led me. It refers to the true love for a man. I would say God's love is bigger. If something is good, I want to see it. But there is no one so far!
