Okay, here's my personal list of Nichtson's here: <br /> <br /> 1. All Ground Up / SpongeBob Squarepants <br /> <br /> 2. My life as a teenager robot <br /> <br /> 3. Attacker Jim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Notice a word with only capital letters? That's going to talk about this Nick Show. <br /> <br /> "Kitty" is a simple but great animated comedy about three rich cats - Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffles - who can get it. In a strange and truly realistic situation, trying to join the sleeping party of Human Campbell, save a planet slogan from evil spaceship for bread beer. It's one nic show that you will simply tickled your funny bone sooner or later! Theme songs are interesting and memorable. Voice Actors - Including Wayne Night from the "Seinfield" franchisee - Characters with very quirky personality brings fresh life. The stories are enjoyable (fans episodes "All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Clo"). And humorous earth is done in some style of land. So in conclusion, one of the "CatSearch" Nicotos series, such as "Attacker Jim" and "MLLTRR", has become very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less.
