Although the series was too short to show first (there was only one child) I repeated it again on television in the late 80's, only when I was interested in war and all its aspects were there. This was my grandfather, who showed me the series and gave my first interest in stories about the Royal Navy in Malta and later the Pacific Time. Since then, I have consumed many books and mixed reviews have seen many television series during the World War II era. British television stations are generally very good at their production, because global war can easily be verified, many gems made both by the BBC and independent companies I firmly recommend this title as a BBC series about "Nazis - an alert from history", "Blitz" and Dunkirk. "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are very high quality, in associate series "Britain at War in Color". The World War so far is the best and, despite his age, never fail to deliver. There will always be a new revelation about the war, which will certainly keep growing, which is certainly not included in the series, and of course, World War II happened in two large canvas, which would spend time and money to create a series with each detail. Then any other, even if such a commitment was even possible. I must say that what I think is that it has not been decided to include everything that can not be physically a series in world war, but hack can encourage you to do more research - and it can be enjoyable. It certainly worked for me: I now have a comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and tape and CDs. Even recommend someone with a passing interest. This series was so good that they could not believe that it is standard programming and highly informative.
