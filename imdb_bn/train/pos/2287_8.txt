This movie pleasantly surprised me. This is a sensitive, little off-center method that does not lose your attention. This is a movie I've never heard of, but if you want a "sleeping", it's about it. Great writing, production, and acting. I recommend it for visitors to want something highly thoughtful. Nick Nolt, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin wondering. Why did this movie be made more?
