After the brutal assassination of their daughter, Julie and Allen escaped from the city to find comfort and sorrow in the remote cabin of the mountain. Allen's motives are good, he wants his wife to restart her photography and leave her depression. Julie sees the perfect vague, damaged setting for the ancient prisons and for its photography. But when the pictures get better they are full of dead people and Allen quickly discovers the tragic history of suicide on their new mountain. "Dark Remains" is a pretty decent Indie. Awful flick. It offers some real scares and lots of tension. Acting is fairly good and cinematography out of 10 great 7.
