I got the first bill and Ted movie for Christmas and I would get it second when I saw it in a shop. This one was (I think) as funny as the first but interesting story. It was their funny matter how they were funny and how they were playing in death. The funny thing is that they acted in them stupid little games like fists. The only thing left in the station and death band was but bigger than this.
