A real classic, ten out of ten! Each actor is perfect, a hunting legacy of screenplay suspenseful scenes. Car and scene views on the mountain are exciting, If this movie is already on DVD, it will be astonishing because it will be seen in the version of Washington. I've seen this image three or four times in the last fifty years, and I still forgot it. I remember it was the first of the features of movies like Warner, which is a process called Warnerus, which gives very nice cinematography. Shell Winters and Jack Pollen deserve an Oscar for their performance. The only thing that I can criticize is like Nicholas Roy, nobody can be guided by him, to increase his rhythm and tension.
