If you are not a Michael Jackson fan, probably not to watch the movie movie. I enjoyed most of the big fans and movies, the finishing touches were not great, but the first 50 or so minutes - if you're a fan. <br /> <br /> I believe in the first 50 minutes are re-watched many times. Dance is exciting in every video, music is great for listening and conversations are entertaining. <br /> <br /> This is bad from its previous videos and she has many cool videos from snippets. It has some live concert footage. <br /> <br /> If you are a great fan of Michael Jackson, it is a must, if you are not a fan / Michael Jackson does not like it but clearly clear it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
