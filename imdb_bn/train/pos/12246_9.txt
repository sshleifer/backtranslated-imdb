I started watching this moment I realized that I was seeing a good quality production, so I was surprised that it was written by Andrew Davis script, and it was made by Su Birtviastel, both of these are our 1995 prairie pride and excellent production! So my exclusive thing here is that Emma could not play six episodes like 3 or 4 or Pride and Prizudis. Acting was fantastic, I think prunnela is nice like Miss Bates, but I like Kate Beckinsell and Mark Strong. Are you happy to hear the language, can you imagine on this day, and have some right to someone other than a curious word? Samantha Morton, like Miss Smith, was nice, really like casting prides and prijoodis casting was clear. I loved it so much that I saw it twice in two days! So thanks again to BBC for another quality piece of television. I saw the Paltro version and it's okay, but the BBC version is much better. A nice production that I'm very happy with the DVD !!!
