Although the soundtrack is a little date, this story is more relevant than ever in the US Not only the blue collar work, but the US corporations outsource work and the government benefits and the Americans suffer. <br /> <br /> Peter Straus Emory, who is a steel worker, has done the same for his father for 35 years. His wife expressed love for Pamela Reid, who is very realistic, Emery is trying to support her family after losing her job. The pen closes in the context of corruption, but there is boredom and cheap wages, where they can pay a steelworker within one month (outsourcing) which they will have to give a day / strauss / emery. Remember that these men are all good faith workers who are valuable and try their best for their families. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mr. Goodman, Gary Cole (as Strauss's brother) and some colleagues also influence . It's very annoying and realistic. Some scenes in Emery and her father are moving. Emri hopes that her local union will reopen the mill, as they promise. <br /> <br /> Emery's brother Lee Lee already saw the wall text. There is no job left in Jung-belt (Ohio) and they must continue. But where will they go to the United States? Where would it be better for a blue-collar steel worker? <br /> <br /> Here's a winning scene where Emery and her crew fill the loading dock of steel products. The Guard allows it to be done as their final gesture, a man has committed suicide and has sympathy. <br /> <br /> Overall, here is a good message movie for tough times in America. Face to care a few until personally affected. 8/10.
