I first saw a track from this DVD in a hippy show on November 2006 in London (I'm not even on the crest!). It was through a high-end ARC system, it was cool with DTS. I had to get this DVD. And I'll tell you that this is the most exciting music DVD I've ever seen. The cream performance in their age was only on the mind's brightness and sound quality I heard on the music DVD. It does not matter what kind of music you like, it will definitely increase on you. It's the brightest talent of their performance that will let you see it again and again. Even new musicians are not cutting this mustard like these old rockers.
