I was also in this movie, but they do not really keep this scene, I do not know. On the way back from school scripts (in 2005) we stopped at a service station at the same time, as they are doing the movie, and we are asked (our whole) to run and scream! Free birds! We were about 10 years old, anyone who saw this movie can tell me that it really is actually kept in the film, it would be very good to know! I think I think the film never came out, because it was about one and half years before liberation. All of your comments seem to be good, so I guess a successful movie, I can buy it, but first I want to know if I am in it! Thank you
