This work is a dark look in man's mentality that finds himself in a wheelchair. The film will never try to downplay it, cotton candy-ize, or soft soap, with what the boys live with pain, confusion and pain. It's its strength, I think. <br /> <br /> But more, performance is fantastic, good ideas and delivered conversations that attract you and feel a part of the experience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
