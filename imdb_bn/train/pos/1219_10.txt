The second Care Bear movie is very good than its predecessor. It is a deep plot, good character development, and tune (especially close songs) both interesting and warm heart. Of course, the film is tireless towards hard work, but it is a care-beer movie. This film is a great picture for showing kids because it emphasizes friendship, love and care again. Note that care rears are not only very adorable!
