What is this musical section created? Humor, talent, romance, and action rolled into one all. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. There is no need to say anything else. Marlon Brando, though not a singer, did a great job by winning the hearts of many, including Sky Masterson's screenplay. That he could not sing singing his character. The women of the film were right, but the men of the film clearly stole this show. <br /> <br /> This is a real classic which can be admired in any age. It connects to all visitors and makes you smile and smile. <br /> <br /> Take a look and enjoy a movie!
