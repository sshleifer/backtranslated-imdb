After reading some of the other comments here I really had some awful hopes but was pleasantly surprised. Check the reality: The original series was not that good. I think some people remember it with more affection but without car movement and Daisy Duke's foot script plays weak and poorly. Duke boys were very intelligent and had fur for back-up hicks, the shrunken Bosch Hog was very bad, and Rosco was just hyper in every screen moments. It is astonishing that the series continues as it has gone beyond the story line of the first series. <br /> <br /> Return to the movies. If you look at this movie with your own rights, do not remember the series of live TV but it is not bad. Genuine Lee must be the true star. Caring and stunts are excellent and that's really what D.O.H. All in all Junky Noxville, with his usual brilliant spirit and the cousin William Scott along with Cachato Bow, makes this movie really fun to get a ridiculous dame-and-dubbed TV series. A knit as a lovely Jessica Simpson Miss Daisy, Bart Reynolds has developed an advanced developed hog and M.C. Singing is a credibly miserable p. He made the quota, how he should always be. <br /> <br /> If you do not like slopstick humor and crazy car stunts, you will not see this movie because you should expect. Otherwise if you want an entertaining car-action movie with some nice laughs, but see this enjoyable romance with open mind without having to pay too much tax on the brain.
