I have achieved it, as one of my favorite movies in DVD recently and as usual, when watching, the whole thing threw me away. <br /> <br /> I am a huge fan of Hejel O'Connor and the soundtrack of this movie is only in my tears, especially the "Will you" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me to return to my youth. This is the second best quadrophenia rate (which played Phil Daniel in the second). Southtrak is a great soundtrack and I grew up in the age of 80 years. The last day is so sad that after the last few hours of the movie I was like a bluebering child. <br /> <br /> I hope to wear this DVD again and again, I can see it again and again and be annoyed only for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> May God bless you all. xx
