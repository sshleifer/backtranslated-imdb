Yes top of these films. Cant recommend it more. A great doco straight for those who like gay or film. Very funny, sad and interesting. Not dull Great access. A topic created with passion and interest. Some performances and just amazing. If you find this movie in VHS, it is still very valuable. Great. 10 years ago 10 years ago I saw part of this doco years and I did not understand what I saw. Interviews are highly revealing about the egos of actors who are trying to get out of their heavy-weight boxers. The filmmaker apparently had a feat in the first timer so a first timer. Cool. Track it down.
