The Spirits House is a secret story about family conspiracies, politics of South America and ultra natural forces. The novel of Marily Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irene Isabel Allend brings life to all her emotions and mysteries. This, in my view, is one of the best films of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba's age are very confident and very confident with the fair, when Merle Strip maintains her gentle, loving warmth throughout her relatively short life in the role of Clar. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas are struggling to take a handsome couple to take family in racist culture. Closing the glen as Esteban's sister, gives a very running performance. A tropical Latin American country has a reasonable option in the countryside of Portugal. Cleor's home settings and Esthen's ranch settings are effective and the United States cars nicely add to the war atmosphere.
