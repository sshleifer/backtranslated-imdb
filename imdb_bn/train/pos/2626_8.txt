"Leon King 1 1/2" is the most aesthetic non-theatrical release from Disney. I've seen this movie again after seeing it for many years recently. I think for the first time I have seen that I had no expectations and was amazed at this visible and very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Is it better than Simba's pride? In many ways, yes. Although "Symbol Pride" was not okay, it suffered some problems: a good script and a lack of bad character, which otherwise would have influenced the effect of a good movie. However, it looks beautiful to see Timon and Pubba's personality; in this film we love them (or of course me); They were completely annoying at "Symbol Pride" and I did not like the "Timon and Pumbaa" series. <br /> <br /> This picture was easily stupid, but thankfully filmmakers did not turn it wrong and instead of highly focused on making this film this sunny. Adults have some jokes that can enjoy their own. Score is quite good. There are two new songs, which are interesting and two new characters, Timon's mother, (Recognized by Julie Cavner's Recognized Merge Simpson) and Uncle Mac, which is enjoyable. The friendship between Timon and Pabba is illustrated sensitively. Psychological scenes are well-integrated in the curiosity story and do not feel the place, which it can easily accomplish (especially in comedy). <br /> <br /> But there is something that distorted this image from 10 pictures. Vote from me? Yes here Although fortunately they do not have much effect, I will mention them: 1. Most of the first film scenes are used in it. Personally, it was weird in an old scene combined with newcomers. <br /> <br /> 2. During climax, some joke is hair. <br /> <br /> 3 From storytelling, it is a story of Timon and although filmmaker Simba is trying to integrate her story, it seems to have been a screenplay for some time. <br /> <br /> However, these details do not affect other interesting movies. This is the only true Disney Sigel, which should be in the collection of each movie.
