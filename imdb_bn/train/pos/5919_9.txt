Street Fight is a brighter piece of brutal. It's not just a fun that you look for fun. This is not a comfortable experience, though it is a smile-out-loud moment. Watch this movie when you need food for thought. <br /> <br /> The only way to cancel this film as a racist is to miss the point. This is not just ironic of the southern song, it is a quoted commentary on the ancestors of Americans still being a society. Each ethnic group depicted in the film shows them as a classic characteristic of their stereootype, which is an outstanding characteristic of the real people. With this wild hug, filmmakers have shown how stiffly convinced the beliefs are! <br /> <br /> If you are a person who is willing to accept the lapse of common ancestors, American culture is still there, and if you are not afraid of your own bias in your own eyes, then this film may be for you.
