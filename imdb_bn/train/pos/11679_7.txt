The beauty of the clara bow and the wonderful appeal is the main reason to watch this movie. "Hula" is not compatible with Clara's best films, but it's still enjoyable. He dances, he sits on his horse, and he follows people he loves. This image was directed by the winner of just one hour length and future Oscar winner (with the wind gone). The film has a lot of screen time to move quickly and Clara bow. If you like Clara, I'll reccomend "hula".
