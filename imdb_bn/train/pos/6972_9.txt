Caprica Episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Indeed, this episode is the same content as the DVD pilot release. It is said that the 2012 edition of the very popular "Battler Galactica" series (original and 2007 both remixes) gives a very basic background. This is most applicable to the 2007 series. As a late science trend plot, this series searches for "virtual" life or the environment. On top of this, we have provided many backgrounds of their relationship with Adam's family line as well as the Silks Manufacturers (Blessore Galactica series). In most part, this first episode revolves around the popular issues of "virtual" life and popularity of the colonization's early life and the birth of silons. <br /> <br /> I finally enjoyed this episode. Although, this is not a new element for me or anyone else who has already seen the release of the mapic pilot's DVD, the series seems very committed. As for many pilots, Episode 01 leaves us with the hill hander so that the audience can follow (Science-Community). I'm definitely not going to keep watching the solution as well as for development. <br /> <br /> I gave 8 stars in this series.
