These two talents, both of which are released, can show a movie of "Cinderea". <br /> <br /> Another major element of the success of the film is reality - there is no fake or "Hollywood" here. About this set-in-California film. It really is a slice of life. Sandra resident in the beginning of the film, the general dresses decorated by the character, the scene where Sandra woke up in the morning, Ushchi Diagurt jumped to the front door and Sandra was sitting on the stairs without any stairs. Up, when DiGarts tried to sell some of their cosmetics, she was just as awkward (but still beautiful), as well as weird Sandra Sandra loves to love her when she dresses in bra, one-room apartment, which Sandra transports - the movie These elements seem to be completely real and in this way, from the start of the audience, Sandra is attracted to a little world and immediately Interested in and want to be successful. Sandra sues her for love and love for her love and she comes with many classes. <br /> <br /> This image can easily fail in a less efficient hand, normal sexual intercourse, but the Gerva / Team goes to see that "Sandra" is not just a woman, but a nice film.
