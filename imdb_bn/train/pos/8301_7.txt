Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" Macbayne, your standard-eyed lazy Maverick police who earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he receives (38 and counting), he never stopped going after bad guys. <Br /> <br /> When a US tank called "Thunderblast" WW "Thunderblast" is operated across the border in Mexico, it is repressed by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogodo (Ren Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Cartiff (Henry Silva) Who has himself integrated with the Russian villain The army officers involved were kept as prisoners, among them Chief Devon Sheppard (Darlan Flugal), who became Macbayne's former girlfriend. Macben then appointed army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Bush's physical appearance might not be like the Schwarzenegger, who could have been another suitable leader for such a film, but he was an explosion as a confident dude who quickly with wisecracks. Fluegel is a great female lead; She does not look incredibly sexy but makes a fine butt-assault action babe for babe. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fern√°ndez, and always welcome William Smith (as a Russian head) is a scandalous scam of classic action movie tradition. Supporters are well-known and full of reliable character actor: L.Q. Jones, R. Yes. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulal, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Elku, Danny Trejo, and Curie-Heroiecki Taga. <br /> <br /> The script is provided based on a story by Lindford and BJ Goldman Linkford and senior director Fred O'Neill Roy. This is a script where you only know that the authors have their language in their cheeks: They know that their content is irrational and sticky, and the fun of throwing credibility into the window. Veterinary Action Director Steve Carver has continued this and provided a respectable amount of gunfight, explosion, and general all-out maheem. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is good fun for the action fan, which does not stop switching their brains now and then and only enjoy a liberal store of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
