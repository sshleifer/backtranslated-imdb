Do not get confused with the British black comedy of the same name in 1994. However, this is an appropriate addition to Shelley Grave 80's back slash. <br /> <br /> Convent is planning a spring break in Florida's lifetime, but they are planned when one of them is local Kill a man and testify to a man, and when he realizes that he has seen, right, just say it has become catastrophic, when the cat and mouse play and become a local local sheriff, things get worse. <br /> <br /> According to me, Shelco grave is one of the more enjoyable slashing late in the 80's. Slashar was going towards mid-80s, there were few, and this film should have been better known, it is not unfortunate. This is a film that actually confuses stereotype (try to guess that only the final girl is going to be - I have done it completely wrong).
