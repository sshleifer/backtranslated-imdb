This movie was an impressive one. My first experience with foreign movies, it was not too long, it was not very complicated. I enjoyed the subtitles myself; And the plot was surprisingly fresh. An elderly boy was seen by his elderly father and disturbed his brother after a long separation, but it was very sensitive and realistic. There were some delicate humor so that viewers are not depressed or annoyed by the audience.
