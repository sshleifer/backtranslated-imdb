I was expecting it to be too stupid when I rented Domino. I really enjoyed the flashy film and cinematography that the film hated and got too bad reviews of the domino. The only reason I saw this is because I like Keitra Knightley, Mickey Roberts, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott on other occasions. I just enjoy the true adventure based on the story. Yes editing and cinematography were terrible, the story was weak, and the acting was moderate, but I still like this picture for some strange reason. Domino was very, very entertaining and often very fun. It seems to be very frank when it was released, because I thought everyone wanted a passionate journey like Scott's last film Man on Fire, and instead it only got amazing entertainment. I actually understand why everyone hates domino, although I like it and recommend it.
