Who you know about Group Dus, know the lead singer Tom Barren He has given some directive to this movie as he made music, it is a mixture of everything. It's a comedy, though most illogical and weird, a drama, there is no happier life to say than among any major characters, and it's not actually a goal. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Antwerp in Belgium on Friday morning, with some scenes of some people, but some of them will be interacting with each other on day and night. There are several main characters: A teacher who does not read any of the books, a young researcher died and his sister, a gallery owner, two young men regularly contact the law, a movie works in the movie theater and two young women. There are people who walk around the film to do something in the air. All the characters have their troubles with their family, friends or just their own life. <br /> <br /> The movie is set on Antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and the harbor. The events of the day are not easily explained, I only recommend watching the movie, just a lot more to say. But I can say that Barren's camera has excellent use and most of the songs (most dance songs, or not really rock) are used to set a mood, especially the party is filled with excellent music. <br /> <br /> This movie itself is an experience, it will not leave you wise in life, perhaps it will lead you to life and do not waste it, or there is no false moral truth. <br /> <br /> Small, see it, it's definitely worth it!
