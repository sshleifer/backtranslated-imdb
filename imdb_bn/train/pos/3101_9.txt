Last Christmas, I was lucky enough to get one of the 1200 ultimate bourne boxed sets from my Better Half, but till yesterday I did not see the final part of the trilogy. Considering the number of recent trilogies being frustrating rather than the winning line through the winning line, I was somewhat aware of reaching "Bourne Ultimatum" but I'm not really worried. The sequence of electric action sequences and anger-fighting scenes merge with intelligent storylines as well as intelligent storylines, so that I found out that this is one of the very best action thrillers and it is a great ending of a great series. <br /> <br /> Guardian journalist Simon Ross (P. addy Considine) - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) - A new lecture about operation program BlackBerry - based on the old Treadstone project, comes back later. Bourne has again raised the trill, but in the CIA, other captains, including deputy director Noah Bhogan (David Strathreen), believe that Bourne himself began to follow the rogue agent with leak and new power. What has Bourne finally found, or can his old employers mute him well? <br /> <br /> Personally, I was a little disappointed with "Bourne Harness" because it confused the trademark reality of its action scene and was considered as the perfect spy film. Not saying that it is completely lost, but it looks more like a slower novel than an action-thriller than the "Bourne Identity". There is no concern here - every car is heard by crashes, punching, stick and gun shots and feeling happy with joy, but grateful, it still maintains a wonderful, intelligent and secretive story in his heart to build the foundation of action around it. It is completely related to two previous films, which gives the perfect bracket to the triangle, since the whole picture is exposed and expanded until it is uncovered. Life is almost neutral - even Julia Styles also started to offer more than the book-worm eye candy. Actually, it's not like the other Bourne movies, there is little to do with the original novel, but if you are not a distressed fan then it is not the real reason to dislike a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Does not give Even the final relay, whether you are not completely sure that a happy ending is confirmed, whether or not you are a fan of the series (and if you do not want to, what more do you want?), This is a movie that you must definitely track. Can make it possible. Not surprisingly, the bond films forced the producer to expand the 40-year-old film history to start the series again. Bourne looks more like Austin Power than a modern detective hero and recently compared with the need to reboot the bond series until bond movies "Casino Royale". Jason Bourne is eligible for a criminal report missing from movies - go and get a copy of the DVD yourself. Although not collected in Ultimate Bourne - Limited Edition, I'm scared!
