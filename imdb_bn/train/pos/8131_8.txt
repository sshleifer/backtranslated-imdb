<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, then watch this movie, but if you can not get a direct result then it is a fun thing. <br /> <br /> Most popular CB4, but what I saw was not like this little storm-like heart. <br /> <br /> As you have not heard from the people involved, which is astonishing. The film is very similar to the Spinal Tap, which is not a bad thing, and I think there are many conversations, though invaluable in Tap is interesting here, probably because I'm more rap than Rock Thes day, so my own verdict gives me the point of the cloud. <br /> <br /> Rap song is fun as hell, and it is basically the reference spot for most films, not all of them are facing, which means the physical comedy and one liners take priority over take-offs. <br /> <br /> Great fun, if there was a movie, watch twice.
