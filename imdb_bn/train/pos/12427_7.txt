There is a lot of potential in this film. The script is sharp, conversational (usually) extraordinary (though it can lose the changey voice-over), direction and painting is surprisingly good, although some experiments do not just work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geek-boy, always a geek-boy; And sad, the common fact is that he is unable to play something without Fox Mulder. He pledges, he tries to be slick, he poses, he tries to be macho. Finally he tried very hard. He has highlighted his character, he has watched on his line, and he is playing in all manner of ways by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who is in a class on the subject of acting skills. Timothy Hutton (as always) was really good. He was a role or two moment where he was over-dramatized in his role, but you could say it was fun with it. He looked at the part, and he became both physical and atmospheric character. Angelina Jolie was really good. She did not have a lot of role; In fact, although he could use a more powerful one ... his character was not nearly as well, though he had anything that he had been extraordinarily good. And chemistry between him and Hutan was clear (Gee, maybe Umar left him ...;) Above all, it was roughly around the edge, but a strong effort by strong cast and great supporting roles. * If that was not ripped his role in David Duchovny piece, * that * has been much better. 7/10
