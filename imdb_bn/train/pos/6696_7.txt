When I first started to see it, it became one of my favorite shows. Melissa Joan Heart was very funny and talented so she was very funny because of the ant and other characters and star of the cat star. In my opinion, the first few seasons were the best where Sabrina was used to living at a young age as a teenager. They are the most fun, most entertaining and most um ... well. I'm not a fan to launch Brad and Dreamer because I like Valerie, but they were right that they were only in one season. If you new people will keep them at least I did not like Josh, he was a tw * t, I liked Harvey, but then he disappeared. And they get rid of Libby! If you were disturbed by the thesis for seven years, it was great. And in addition to Mr. Sahib, if Jeddah married, then gold! Then Sabrina went to her house from Ants House and to Roxy / Mile / Morgan's house. I did not like the thesis of people, they do not think they liked Sabrina. Sabrina lost her charm and possessions and the ants seem to have gone out of her life, and they are on the lines of their stupid stories. I stopped watching it for a while and I came back to the old re-run and I was like Hu! Hah hah I must say that the last few seasons were absolutely terrible. They were released from the sticky kid that was a big part of the show. Then suddenly he lets two freeloaders enter the house when they like dirt. And now she's working in some magazines stores, so they are putting guests in the audience at the show, if they destroy it like every episode. The program just really went downhill and lost its luster. I saw the last episode. He had a cousin (Jelda was reduced from a candle) and she is going to marry but eventually went to Harvey. I'd like to know what happened later. Well that my review and what I can say is the only thing that has been apple in seven years.
