Along with Westfire 1918, this movie is my favorite Ports-directed film and I've enjoyed more than many of her famous movies, which have been performed as Luis Brooks (such as the Pandora Box). Probably both of them are similar to Neo-Realistic films which Italianians have perfected in the 1940's and 50's. This style film is intensely involved and calls for non-actors (simply ordinary people) to use in daily settings to create realistic movies. <br /> <br /> In this case, this movie is about French and German coal mining, so it is not like the Creator, the role seems like a mining of the people. The central conflict at the beginning of the film is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. In spite of the greater unemployment in Germany, it is divided into borders instead of a large mine and French workers are not welcome. This, the language difference (a dance that is nicely illustrated in the scene) and the plot to create a huge intensity among the WWI parties - which is why we create a vm versus mentality. Later, an explosion caused a huge collapse in French and the Germans refused to sit back and do nothing. Risks of their lives, they prove that there is real friendship between mining and ordinary people. <br /> <br /> This movie has been trying hard to see Geneofobia's strong criticism and, undoubtedly, the German audience's futility. War and hatred It was a fantastic moving film with some of the most scariest and claustrophobic images I've ever seen. In terms of history, the impact of the movie was minimal. It's really embarrassing, as the Westfruit 1918, Jackcus (Gance) and Western Front (milestone) all had a great message of peace and harmony, but eventually failed to influence the public's opinion. So, from the historical point of view, it is a wonderful and tragic resort that is good to see.
