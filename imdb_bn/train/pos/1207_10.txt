I still love it for 17 years or the first time I have seen, actually I discovered that I lost my copy and were very annoyed. Despite the non-cooperation with the original (which I have never targeted as a child and I do not have any difference as an adult), it should be like cartoons *. Enough dark enough to be lightweight and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone. My parents are delighted to raise me with such things than the cartoons that my parents are seeing today. Music is great, and stuck forever in your head ... I downloaded the whole soundtrack on one or the other.
