I read this review before you, in a way by a statement against the Iranian people, if you really want to read something in it, but you are hoping that I am generally against the politicians. ... but if you want to be offended ... I can not help you! <br /> <br /> This movie is not banned in Iran (see IMDB TV for this movie). Which is a shame, because the movie is great. This will not be for "Grubivica", which won the Berlin International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> properly (it was runner up, or if you want the second place). Why? Because it is a movie about torture. It is not even a complete woman problem. It is trying to keep the government down. An analogy is so clear that the government has felt the feeling of banning movies. But it does not solve anything, and / or they can make this movie invisible! <br /> <br /> There was a brief summary line of another critics: "Comedy about a tragedy", which it does very well!
