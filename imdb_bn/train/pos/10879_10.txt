I want to see a cut from the day I heard it, which was last year. However, I have seen today, and when the movie starts, I think it started in the week, but it got better after 10 minutes or so. I thought the movie was good. But the thing that I liked was how the killer was created, I thought that before I rented it was probably the same as urban legend: The final cut, I almost died. UL final cut mostly needs to be improved in everything. Cut is 100 times more than UL: Final Cut CUT Best Part Killer and Death Scene Killer MO *** ING Ass <br /> <br /> I cut 10 by 8
