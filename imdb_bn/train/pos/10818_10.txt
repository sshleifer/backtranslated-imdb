Why are so few ratings? I'm not really getting it ... because it's bad acting? Bad dialogue Well, who is careful about these things in the horror movies of the low-budget sugar? Seriously, acting and dialogue are not important in those movies. Due to poor performance and poor conversation, people who hate movies should not be allowed to rate low-budget movies of sugar. Those movies should not be taken seriously. Time. <br /> <br /> However, while talking about movies, is not it? Well, I like it! I bought it because I was expecting a garage, but it is not a beef and the beef is very bad (most of the time it only keeps animals on the body and it is taller), but I really do not care because the movie is ridiculous! Characters funny, funny acting (bad acting Chess low budget horror movie is a good thing), Delightful dialogue (bad dialogue is a good thing in the movie low budget horror movie), zombie rapist a huge dick with sunny, flying monsters joyful baby and I go and But I do not want to say too much ... but I have to mention that there is a view in a scene where a girl masturbating sex Utulera survival, such as Lao! Oh and zombie rapist falls in love with sex doll lol! <br /> <br /> Best line in the movie: <br /> <br /> Detective discipline: * Snif coc * Detective Sloane: What * beep * What are you doing, human society?
