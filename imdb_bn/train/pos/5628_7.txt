Here are some other comments, I have a major complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> Two primary characters are attractive in their own way - beautiful "hunting," and handsome, of course, extremely close centers, blue-collar heroes (if only "completely annoying") - beating hell from each other. Just like a Caucasian Cuban scene. <br /> <br /> It's OK, and of course it's a "curved table" story. However, the complaint I mentioned is that I believe the director Farah It is believed to showcase the well-known and obvious physical features of her, beginning with a thin dress, and starting with many scenes required for a dramatic effect - when the eyes are very happy, the mood of the play is confused with the level. <Br / > <br />> I give performance in my roommates as written and directed - however, it does The related suspects and heteronious fuckings and sabbing are not true - based evidence of Farhara's earlier experience of the man, obvious proof of his coming to him <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> I said, the director's work.
