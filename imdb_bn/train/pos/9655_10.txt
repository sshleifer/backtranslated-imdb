Maybe "Prycek Reyen" is not the best movie ever made ... but it's better than many of you. I still have not seen such a homo-themed movie. <br /> <br /> You are used to seeing very much narratives, developments and results in American movies. But European movies are less narrative, but you feel a lot and think. <br /> <br /> Many of you do not understand the meaning of the movie. Its purpose is to show us a simple "summer is not a romantic movie", commercial characters who "fall in love and live happily for ever". Summer holidays and beach are just a background, and this movie points to every young boy who can recognize them with the boys. <br /> <br /> Some of you probably do not understand this movie well, because 3 parts, shown as a flashback. These 3 moments are: - Fertility in Pornichet, when they meet and love. - After living together in one year and half of Nantes, Matthew himself did not go to the psychiatrist. She is trying to commit suicide, and Cedric brought her to the hospital. Later, he spoke to a psychiatrist to find out what he had done. - The last part, when Matthew returns to Pornichet in the winter only, how his life changes, how his life goes and tries to find himself. <br /> <br /> It is possible that some people did not understand all this well, because all the scenes were mixed in them. But anyway, I said earlier ... this is not a funny movie. If anyone wants to see, but meat, we have a silent film for him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not sure what to do about her feelings and in life. Matthew just wants to move out of the house, and trying to lead a life that he thinks can bring happiness ... but at the beginning it seemed perfect. Then he thought that he does not feel as good as he feels depressed, and thinks He has lost his way of life. He lost and did not know what he really wants, or what makes him happy. Eventually, he was frustrated and tried to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, funny? Not a funny movie. Very hot scene? Only a few .. but it's not a movie for entertainment. All about feeling ... Friendship, love, happiness, sorrow, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like others, are marked with Matthew's life and problems, and what the director wanted to do. Those of us who are cruel to a boy The reality shows. <br /> <br /> For me, the best home-themed movie of all time.
