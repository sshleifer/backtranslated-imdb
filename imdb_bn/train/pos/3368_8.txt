Hitler's philosophy of Rome is a picture of this flexible story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Lorraine plays housewife and mother of six children during the military campaign in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. He has to stay at home because the maid can not afford the family. She liked to go wherever she lived, along with her entire housing complex, she was a prominent leader of Il Duce. <br /> <br /> There is an exception. Marcelo Maastriani is thinking of his suicide throughout the whole. Because? He has lost his job as a radio preacher recently for gay and for that reason. The film really takes a while when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni desperate and needs a friend badly Lorraine, her own cheating husband, was frustrated by the fact that he shot Matheriani and a nicely shot, visible on the roof of the building complex, and his body was rejected only. The primary chalk is instead hungry for this person, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, is willing to give this other world what she wants for her. <br /> <br /> This is a beautifully made. Sometimes movies with the most talented actors. Lorraine guided well when he proved to be an actress in the caliber here. It is a simple but yet powerful film about fascism, love, the common man, and most importantly the human condition. Despite its tragic end, there is a glimpse of the hope of denial, things will change, no one understands.
