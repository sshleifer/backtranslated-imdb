I remember this show a little, a little, but I think it was great! My older brother reminded me of the show recently and I saw an advertisement to find out the DVD set. The network, again screwed up pulling this from the air, so that they could keep another place in its place? It should have gone at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? I think sometimes network executives think they are the 'gods' in the entertainment world. But they incorrectly speculate at times and timely dismisses well on time to flatten out the display. Let's say that there is more flop than their 'hit'. This was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line up. However, I got this for my collection.
