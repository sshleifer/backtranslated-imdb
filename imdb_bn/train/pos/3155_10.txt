I want "70's exhibition" to be back on television. It was the greatest show !!! They should create episodes in other episodes but of course it will be confusing. But I wish to return it and make more episodes. Come back ... The show was absolutely sunny. You can not laugh without watching an episode. There was a really fun part in every episode, and Plus Haid and Jackie were so good at going out with each other. Those were the best episodes. "That's the best of '70's ​​show" .... it will be and will always be the best show. When the show ended, it was really sad. They should create new episodes.
