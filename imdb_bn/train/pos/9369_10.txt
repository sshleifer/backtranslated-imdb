This film proves that film Nair is a chronic style and is worth living. For me, the best example of a movie dancer from Chinatown. <br /> <br /> This will not be unfortunately acknowledged. It was not well-publicized during the War of Liberation, and fans had to make their cadres through the words of the Vanguard cinema and mouth referrals. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that people renting this movie entertaining something more than mind and delved into its highly convoluted plot.
