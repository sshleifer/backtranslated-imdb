One word can describe this movie and that is strange. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting. Well, the film is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a corpse body so that he can take revenge. On the way he met very colorful characters and finally decided that he would like the body or not. Very curious, if you are a fan of animation / science-fiction, you might want to test it.
