I watched by voice and physical acting, entered and mesmerized. The role of each character acting is done with excellence. Songs, words, every gesture, sunrise, all say it. The movie talks to me. It illuminates the idea of ​​a person who believes in mankind. Those who believe in peace and gentle behavior. I was held in disbelief, was sacrificed and portrayed by human dignity. Without power, without feeling impaired and feeling. Mankind wants to spend power, so incredible. This movie has made me so scared that there is no more in this world. And, sadly I remember them. I loved this movie for the conversation and all the expressions for it. This movie may be happy.
