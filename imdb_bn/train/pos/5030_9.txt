Something surprised me about this movie - it was really original. It was not the same old reusable shit coming every month from the hulywood. <br /> <br /> I saw this video on video because I did not even know about it before seeing it in the local video store. If you watch this movie available - rent it - you will not be sorry about it. The whole of the mystery covers the end and the twist is excellent. <br /> <br />
