It was a good movie. This was a flash flood of your ideal war but it was not quite different. This movie employs training before our war, and does not actually fight with war. This film is one of the more realistic scenes of warfare and army compared to other such films. Colin Farrell recruited the army and Clifton Collins Jr. and Matthew Davis contributed significantly. Colin Farrell has been moving from grade B to a grade for several years, you never thought of it. I will add more that Tigreland's producers did a great job in filming a film in 2000 and it's a good touch to look like in the 1970s. It is good to see the talent wisely and I hope to see the same talent in the near future.
