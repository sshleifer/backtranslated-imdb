I was funny in this movie LOL. It's a fun matter, not taken seriously, life, love, and ... well, from the women's "low bus station scank, high-class debutante ... bus station scanks." Tim Medov was raised by a man (Leon Phelps) who was raised in a playboy-style palace by Hugh Hefner-Esquiera, who was constantly surrounded by beautiful porn models and actresses. When his "father" drives him out on the street, he must learn to learn his life from the logical perspective of his life that his young man is teaching him ... and this is an irrational, almost mysterious and foolish fate. And so the hedges begin! If you do not see this movie and you enjoy a light heart, semi-intelligent, comedy / love story, then I highly recommend renting "Ladies Man".
