I did not know about this picture if I did not have an Oscar for the outstanding picture. Thankfully, it passed that I was able to see this animated little treasure. <br /> <br /> The story was about the child Brendan who was in the city of Kells and overprotective Abbot's nephew. The main pre-profession of Abbott is to build a wall to protect Kells from invading Vikings. One day, IDEN famous artists Iden wanted their shelter. Aiden Illustration opens the eyes of Brendan's industry and the greed industry in the outer world. Along the way, Brendan made friends with White Forest Spit Aleling, because he tried to recover an ancient crystal invaluable in the book's fine paintings. <br /> <br /> These days, unlike most of the published "Kells of Secrets", these days. This type of trap is because the imagery is done in geometric lines and designs as long as there is no realism without real consciousness. The movement of this line is memorable for the simple but fluid animation style used at the beginning of "Kung Fu Pandya". However, it is the great use of color that is the main source of surprise for the audience. Uncredited Hunting in the series of Viking attacks used red. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this silent gem of a film. It's a welcome vacation from all the cute bombs in "Monster vs Aliens" and similar current animated fares. Spelse Celtic musical score is effective in stimulating the feeling of imagination that portrays the film. Okay, the story may be a little shallow and may end up missing a bit. I would like to know more about the book Brendan and Eden were working on. But the clear star of this movie is clearly based on his amazingly stylized artwork, the original artwork of Kells.
