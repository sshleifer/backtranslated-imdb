I just saw it in Tender's classic movie last night, I saw it for the first time and I like it. I like most old movies, especially due to the absence of all dirty language, and most of today's films have excessive violence, nudity, and sexuality. I think they did a lot (but not all) in the case so much better. Jimmy Stewart is my favorite one. I was just too much fun to watch this movie, and I enjoyed it perfectly. If you feel about old movies in the same way, I do not think you can make it wrong. I believe "Youtube Mail Mail" is a remake of this photo (though a little different and very enjoyable.). In a relaxing evening with a movie, your kids or someone will not be ashamed to walk during your visit, or one of the classic movie channels will not be caught.
