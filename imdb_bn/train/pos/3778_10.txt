The first film was a little ambition, so the screen does not take anything. There was a bad version of 'Back to the Future' with zero charm. Once Bill and Ted took the knightwave, it can mix itself only before the audience gets annoyed. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is your only dangerous warning ... <br /> <br /> This is more fun by today's standard. This obstruction continued during the War of Liberation, considering that more talent was involved for the first time. We are a 'Face / Off' photographer, 'Fabulous' editor, producer designer from Burton's primary work, and 'Matrix' sound designer. <br /> <br /> The authors first outing with something deeper made for their shallow. As this was shunned by fanbase and public, the director probably decided that the style was extremely extreme. It does not, it fits the element. Like 'Death Basis Haes' and 'Catch-22', it dares to be smart, but we like our films "Easy" so we can not afford it. Perhaps it was brave because it was able to drag 12 producers to it. What is so good <br /> <br /> - Unselfish references to Keuu; From the heavens to the Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger <br /> <br /> - Josh hates his creed as much as he hates his opponent, he hates himself. Evil B & T and "Good Robot USS" have the same vocabulary as the main words: less copies of languages ​​and hate. <br /> <br /> - "Dual" Motif. Photography style somewhere else, this is more clear than a lot of high and low angles. They even gave importance to Roy Brocus Myth from 'Token Recall'. <br /> <br /> - "Preferences" Motif. I do not know where this section started (probably 'Ghostbusters'), but it has been used quite well here. It also blows up 7 games against death - the battlefield and the club. <br /> <br /> - FILM self-referencing, even in the game against death. It's smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. At the end of the premiere magazine cover look: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." How Death and Nomols were famous for the success of Die Hard and 'Lethal Weapon'. <br /> <br /> I still have some minor knights, but there is nothing compared to the original. Music and movies are different, so it does not give any idea why many scripts are rolling around the former - especially in the tin market. Curlin is a great comedian, but he's lost in these movies. Also, for all the brave efforts, even cracking gay humor, can not they kill a cat? <br /> <br /> So, despite being like Nickelodeodan's production, it's incredibly interesting. From this movie we got Bévis and Butt Head. "We are in heaven, and we've just gathered three." <br /> <br /> final analysis = = middle element
