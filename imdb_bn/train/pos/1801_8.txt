I saw this film when I originally released in 1989. I then enjoyed it, and I'm still now But now I realize that it's quite a "adult" for a film with a G rating, especially the idea of ​​death and going to heaven. Bart Reynolds and Dom Dalvis work nicely together, and Rennald's singing is perfect for a junkyard dog. Upbeat ("Let's Music Together Music") contains some good songs until emotional ("Home from My Heart") I found the plot well, though it was closed once or twice a tonant. I have seen the film's final scene with Charlie and Anne-Marie in the animation. Experience a film
