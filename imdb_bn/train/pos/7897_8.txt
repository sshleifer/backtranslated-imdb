The movie does not look like a special great look at the first look. With only 166 votes in IMDB, after the release of Bate Davies and 6,5 rating ratings should be bad. But the movie has become a delightful and original wonder. <br /> <br /> You would expect it to be a normal average ideal film of '30's a formulaic love story, but the movie is surprisingly well-built and this is an extraordinary and original story, which helps to create a beautiful look for this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is managed by two major characters of Bate Davis and George Brent. Most of them have been helped by a cast of funny characters, but the film is mainly involved in almost two of them. Their character is involved in an extraordinary and tricky written love story that works ridiculously. It creates a delightful little comedy to watch this movie, it's completely entertaining, it's completely entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is too short (just over an hour), which does not waste the meaningless story anytime. Plot lines, development and characters. It makes the movie paced more quickly, which makes this movie absolutely worth seeing today's standards. It probably makes occasional films a bit easier, but it never goes to its entertainment or fun spending. <br /> <br /> A fun beautiful romantic-comedy which can be seen more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
