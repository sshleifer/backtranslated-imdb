There is no rating for less than 5 years for a movie with Dennis Hopper, Gary Bus, Irika Elinich, Tom Beerner, Dean Stockwell, and Marilo Henner. It's a poor man's version of movies like 16 golf or midnight runners. Apart from sending the prisoner here, the eye is very easy. Tom Brenger another grapher, the Mercurial military type plays well and William McNamara plays his ruku - often to open the foil. The plot in his mouth was unreasonable because I could not have lost Eliin's time and could not escape from it, but it was an entertaining emotional film, and movies have good cayos from all the actors on rolling. This is not actually a family movie, because there are some vows with Eliinac and a rare nude scene, but it is much better than other goats nearing this time.
