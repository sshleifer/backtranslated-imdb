At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Stormel (Ian McKenzie), he remembers his colleagues and friends how cruel he was when he was looking for a scope. Meanwhile, the dead Jae expressed the identity of the serial killings in London's torrent card. He betrayed Ripper and was in the middle of the magical show of Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, journalist Sondra Pranski (Scarlett Johansson) came to the American student and told him that murderer Aristarch Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid in his investigation, Peter Murder sought to prove that. However, if he falls in love with her and Joe Stormel is right in her scope, then the question is. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another wonderful Woody Allen comedy outside of Manhattan, actually in London again. His satirical and malicious lines are fantastic, and I am very disappointed with the fate of heroes in a country where people run "wrong way". Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is a nice shape as Comedian. However, his current music scarlett Johansson, in which I am a big fan, has played most of his plays and is boring at times, instead of changing his access to a heretrian accent. Her character was completely stupid and diverse, and I was quite frustrated with her performance (probably for the first time in her film). But this supernatural comedy is still a ridiculous and appropriate entertainment. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop? o Grande Furo" ("scoop ?? Big scoop")
