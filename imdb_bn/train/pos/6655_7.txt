Instead of frustrating songs, dance or slogan movies, I recently saw one of the better Indian films. All actors showed the right emotions with the right right at the right time. This is a good movie hallmark, which takes the viewer behind and researches the subject, which I just verified on Harilal. I always enjoyed the perfect style of Akshay Khanna to play and interestingly there was a complex relationship with his own father, Vinod Khanna, although Gandhi was not as dramatic as he wondered how he helped to create this character. For the development of such an enthusiastic film, I have influenced two organs on the direction of Anil Kapoor.
