Meg where the mechanic inspects and says - "Piston is shooting a little?" (Implying poor sexual power in her fianc√©e part) was ridiculous. I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as this wonderful movie. Very loving and very cute too. Her innocuous angry expression was your wish that she was. Hero transforms physics into a good garage mechanic. Einstein was a romantic side to his soul? The front of the press and the front of the audience has been well done round the puzzle. It is widely implicit and deserves accolades and efforts in a resurgence. It lost a vote with very unlikely carrying theory bought by the US government. I do not see why it is not pictured in the top 20 romantic comedy of the century. Great movie, it has the presidential seal of approval!
