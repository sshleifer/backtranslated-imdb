Along with Patrick McGowan and Robert Coolpack, Jacques Cassidy Colombo was a prominent icon. Colombo's first "correct" episode, following two independent pilots, is not too far from the classic status "murder by book". <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy played Franklin, half part of the story of the killings. His companion Jim is a talented, on the other hand, there is no skill except the gift of Gabe and the ability to book the book. As soon as Jim decides that he and Kane do not have the skills of marketing, Kem made the plot to kill Jim. If this is not a new plot, it is actually a real implementation of the implementation of the real life implementation of a killer. Unfortunately, another murder has happened (Cayman romance and then killing an important witness). Colombo has enough evidence to ensure strong conviction. <br /> <br /> There is no mistake with "book killing", but it's not quite a top notch. I just "publish or cherish" this end: Both episodes combine Jack Cassidy and the details of the publication, but a fraction of "publication or destruction" is more intense and unpredictable. But this is still a great episode.
