Edmund Loay (who reminds me of Warren William a bit), a nice little master's nice cast head, which moves quickly and lasts for more than an hour. <br /> <br /> <br /> Walter Walton plays the unfortunate jockey who views his own death (hypnosis, someone?) and a good number of suspects supporting castings - everyone included Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Indecourt, Jean Lockheart, Jesse Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan, and HB Warner. As an extra bonus, as a slow detective of NAT Pendleton - and more, get art deco set decorations that are equipped for the fancy interior of a rich house. There will be a set used in many movies later. <br /> Plus plus the mystery is not so complicated that no one can follow the plot because the reasonable assurance is not very annoying. It has suddenly become clear to the detective Filho Vans - and then he has created a final clash with the murderer, which provides five minutes of unintentional secret to this movie. <br /> <br /> works nicely and passes on time leisurely.
