When I was a young person in high school, I first saw this movie, and the film has been stuck with me for years. It is not about soundtracks, or cinematography, even dialogue and some bad acting, it's about educational objectives and the message behind it is most important. If you are a teenager and still there is no sin for being a high school child and this is not a bad thing, but it is a problem. I knew that girls have tons of children now, and I guess they never saw this great movie, and if they do, they obviously did not get the message. It's not about the possibilities when you take a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant for the first time. This is not a legend. You will not lose your dream, but you should go back in the future because you have to think about your first child. <br /> <br /> There is a clear message behind this movie: Just say no!
