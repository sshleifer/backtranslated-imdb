I love this picture. Nour imagery combined with Spielane's noisy character Mike Hammer works wonders to create a mood and is rarely available in less than half a dozen budget intelligence films. It may not be 'Multicolx Falcon', but the film has its own solid contribution in the style. Spieles are often criticized for the alleged misogyny, but their 'dames' are the ways of knowing the intelligence and their male opponents in the field of intelligence. The poor old man, Michael Hammer, who effectively played with Biff Eliot, was blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychologist when he met the investigation of the death of an army member. A picture when Penny finally drops her face. It was not good to see 50-second censorship, but the filmmakers were not forced to drop the famous last line. A low fide low budget classic.
