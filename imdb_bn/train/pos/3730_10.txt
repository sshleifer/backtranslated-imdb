If you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it, then Tigreland is your movie. I love this movie below from the top. This movie's pictures-perfect scenes look so real; It's like a document with plays that have happened in real life. Boy, I tell you ... the real drama they actually "waged" in one of the scenes (the DVD is not clear that the comment sounds). I have seen this movie as a bunch of unfortunate young people who are trying to escape from the unfortunate fate, after saving personal secrets, I realized what an "unfortunate fate" and know how the men of these movies feel. . I see this movie as a crossbreed between "stand by me" and "savings personal private". When people take on such situations that "hard pressures" in real life? Some people become crazy, some people cry, some people fight, others are intoxicants, some people are sleeping on the hook, trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their lives, some try to get hurt, some from the house or the bridge Jumps, some feel guilty and others feel so much pain that it makes them so sick that they collapse - physically. All the frustrating emotions rolled into one ball in this movie. But do not make me wrong to make the movie depressing, it is realistic, it is a very interesting movie, Kakima and funny bows (Colin's character) it enlightens everyone and on this movie there are about 5 female actresses; Let me figure out what you have there for them! Conversation, fight / sequence of action, picture perfect scene along with appropriate music; This movie has everything, as I said: from top to bottom. I'm not grateful under why Tigerland is heavy. The best thing to own the film is that it is said to be the cover of the title of the year's best movie "The Year Best Movie" and it's not quite anything. The rare gems coming to Hollywood, 10/10
