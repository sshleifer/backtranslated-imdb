This extraordinary series, as described by Lawrence Oliviera, should be brilliantly said, the charts started at the end of the First World War. Originally not fully verified from the fall of Germany, which was given to the Versailles treaty which affected Hitler's monstrous rise. , But one critic said that it must be difficult, that there should be a lot with Chrome in 26 series. <br /> <br /> Except for the expected combat photography / action, a lot of personal, psychological and human tragedy has asked the viewer to give an amazing insight, especially if you are not necessarily a World War 2 buff / fan. The episodes show how life was like 'testimonies' and the main friends / opponents, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States home front. Show the extreme brutality of the war in the front row and of course, showing the plight of civilians, the camp of death etc. were very well managed and open. I would recommend it to a group of completely young generation (which can be said that I am 47 years old!). <br /> <br /> Some things have come out of curiosity, as well as the first expedition of Frank Vietel's experimental Glaster Jets and Glaster Meter, along with German Messerschit Mi 262, the new Jat era began - especially V-1 saw its debut scene and V. There was surprisingly short mention of 2. This is probably a small surveillance, which does not refer to the more exciting concealed and fantastic weapons, which the WW2 has come forward from the more barbarous old science. But there has been a great series that made his mark and repeatedly since repeatedly. <br /> <br /> A history series in the history of the box can be a series owned by a military fan, especially a military fan. Jeremy Isaac and Themes TV should be very proud.
