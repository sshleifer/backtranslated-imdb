This is a most handsome film. Color photography is beautiful, because it displays the bright colors of the Metropolitan Opera House. In other temples, other indoor scenes, etc. are equally bright. For music, Lancer's voice was at its peak, what can be said more than that, because he sang the world's most famous and beloved Aris. Exquisite Dorothy Kirsten is also happy, because her voice is in harmony with Milananza. Of course, Hollywood has taken their customs independence with stories of life in Carraso. The story lines that relate to the actual events are little valuable. For example, the events related to his death were completely fabricated and not related to the relationship with the truth. There are some very good web sites that describe the true story of Karus and contain a number of pictures of them. This web site can be located using a good search engine. There are various books related to the history of his life. However, this beautiful film of fabulous story lines is nothing to mash. The real star of this movie is Lanza, Kirsten and Corus's voice. Enjoy, I'm sure that I know.
