Teresa Pavlacak was a custom member of the second city of Toronto. He has done guest stains and commercial work here in Canada. Finally someone has ideas for creating a show for him. Supporting case seems very good. I've seen the pilot many times now and I still find it refreshing. However, I'm not sure why I've listed this event as Jane Jane Show 2004. (I can be wrong) but as far as I am aware, this event was conceived in 2005 and appeared in Canada's Global TV at the beginning of 2006. Have a fresh idea and hope it's good. Very bad this can not be associated with corners. Now I know that the corner gas is on CTV, but two shows are big partners.
