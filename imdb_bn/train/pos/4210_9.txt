I really enjoyed this film. All aspects of the film were the most important, for me, with the screenplay and acting, the top was pure. This is definitely one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He is fully convinced of his performance. Just curious, imagine how Hamff Bogart or Robert Mitchell have played this role. Jean-Peter's work is my first exposure which I can remember. He has been so impressed here that I must be hiding for his other work. Thamma Ritter, a helpless role, she deserves the Oscar nomination to play Oscar. This film works on each level. Black and white photography are perfectly suited and hooks the audience directly from the beginning of the story. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their solid romance. Strongly recommend, 9/10.
