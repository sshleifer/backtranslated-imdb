The story of the untouchables, who acted like a great soldier, saved hundreds of thousands of lives but not in the 1939 film "Ganges Dinna". Depending on Rudyard Kipling Poetry, this film is brilliantly directed by George Stevens and starring Curry Grant, Douglas Fairbank Junior and Victor McLegen. The title role is directed by Sam Jafir, who was well-known in my era, Ben Kassi's head, Jubba, a name that grew out of control hair. Anyone of my generation, say "Dr. Gerba Hair", and they know what you are talking about. <br /> <br /> Three soldiers set in India while British occupation - two romantic, dashing statistical grants and fair banks, and McLagon as a big lug - cut-up - in fact, three overgrown boys The Ganges Dina water carriers, treated in some sense - are verbally oral, however - MacConnell (MacLugena), but Cooter (Grant) likes him. When he takes his solder while walking and saluting while he does not keep the word (pronounced deen), he fits the unit during his cleverness, giving him some pointer. <br /> <br /> Balantine (Fairbanks) has announced that he will marry a lovely young girl (Joan Fontaine) And leave it. However, when Gunda runs across the throats and thieves, a murderer, led by a guru (Eduardo Sienelli), escapes to warn the Gunna Dinna unit, and Balantine again stresses to help cutter. It's a friendly movie after all. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Dina" is an interesting and surprising, with a wide comedy, especially with Ary Grant, which is very interesting, starts. He and Fairbank are both handsome, it is difficult to decide what to look first. Most movies are made up of huge action sequences which are very exciting. In the last part, the story became very dramatic and ended in an exciting, thrilling battle. <br /> <br /> Grant has the most decorative role, as the Fairbank's romantic romantic, and MacLuggan MacConnie, most of her treatment is the Ganges Dina, the most extraordinary character, although someone identifies her soft heart in her love for her elephant. At the end of the movie, especially the very sensitive, tear-jarking final scene, its softness comes. <br /> <br /> Always a gentle and favorite actor, Sam Zaffe gave a beautiful performance as Ganga Day. , A big smile, brave people with strong imagination and brilliant dreams. Without many conversations, jafri expresses the spirits of the Ganges dastardly. <br /> <br /> This is truly the ultimate adventure film, which plays great, plays fine, has a nice musical score and some beautiful scenic images. Another year since that amazing year of 1939. Highly recommended.
