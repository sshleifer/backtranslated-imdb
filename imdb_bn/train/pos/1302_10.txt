So often a band will not only get it together to get together once a union will combine for the concert. Not so here. This is just the sheer cinnamon since the beginning of the concert. These three musicians apparently met together and planned and made sure that it was not just nostalgic bash to satisfy anyone's arrogance. It's even clear from the beginning, they step in even stage. These guys were first performed when the crowd was not even born too many faces. From the first song they captured the old magic cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no quarrels. Clapton said in his admission that he had to expand himself for this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers, so we could see him as the best. Gada Becker shows why so many drummers today, talking as a drumming guru. Jack Bruce is just great. They will really stand to test during the many years which managed to combine a piece of magic. This one is a 10 for me.
