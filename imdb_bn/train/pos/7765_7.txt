Douglas Sirak handles this extra-acting play about the unhappy rich. Kyle Headley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Owen (Rock Hudson) are friends of childhood in different aspects of life. Kyle is the femising son of an oil tycoon; Mitch Hadle works for oil company. Both of the same woman, fall in love with Lucy Moore; But there is a way to get married to Kyle's leg by stopping her ties. Sister Mary (Dorothy Malone) seems to be carrying a torch for the sapphire and mitch of the city, who always thinks to clean Huddle's mess.
