This is a rip-roaring British comedy film and one that I could get up again if I got tired. Peter Ustinov has not played a bad role and this is especially no exception with his dry wit but very clever master plan. He played 'San Francisco Street', Karl Malden was always a fan of me. I believe that Maggie Smith is the true star of this movie, though she seems to be so perfect that she tries to do so, but it is really being switched on, especially when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money when she discovered laundering of her clothes. Has been there. One thing worries me, but can someone tell me why I can not buy DVDs in UK or VHS format, can anyone help please?
