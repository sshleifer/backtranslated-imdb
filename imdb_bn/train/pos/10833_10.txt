This movie is crying me to the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I saw loads of great movies, even more shit - more. But when the scene is over - at the root of the cathartic - I'm afraid! And if you do - you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original. But this is real - because these things really happened and people actually existed. Glam is not like my song, but I really appreciate all that they did in the early 70's ... It sometime led me to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas really do not work very well. But this movie really believes us that it all believes ... because they do not try to create it as a way of glorious concerts, because the current musicians are superheroes, group girls who are stupid and emotionally silent, they do not glorify drugs and Alcohol, they are rehabilitated and released that even 20 years have passed ... again great movies. Since "Leaving Las Vegas" I have never been so motivated in the movie.
