Compared to Crazy Spinal Tap is still compared to both comedy because of both wash-ups and R & R groups. Indeed, the duplication here ends because Crazy has been very well written and played, but the Spinal Tap script gets spoiled by the first 10 minutes of fun, which makes Bevis and Buthead relatively sophisticated. Still crazy formulas but the choice of characters and some musical numbers for me managed to offset predictive predictions of high quality movies. Those who try fantastic behavior such as spinal tapes will be frustrated by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I will succeed in successful crazy crepe on a क्रेपस but the Spaniel Tap, which failed in the mockery.
