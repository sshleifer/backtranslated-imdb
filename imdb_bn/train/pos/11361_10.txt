Although I have seen this movie many years ago, its effects never left me. The illustration of an invetigator Stephen Ray is deep and moving. His pain is obvious, unable to stop the death. The cast is amazing from all of Sutherland, who tries to reconcile him and coordinates their effort x to give the annoying citizen to the police. Every day when we bomb a story about mass murderers, I think about this movie and people trying to find the killers who do tired work.
