Originally, Doodle Moore was thought to be a lonely car, 'Not only ... but his first' Bound the Fringe 'partner Peter Cook showed guests at the first show, and the BBC2 controller got it so well. That's since then every week he be on. They were a classic comedy team - the cook was tall, handsome and wretched, when Doodle was gifted small, gorgeous and musically. The sketch that brought them was in a pub, wearing flat caps and mufflers, fantasizing about movie stars like Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. It remains one of the most ridiculous skits of all time, and Cook still holds it together when the body is dead. <br /> <br /> Those characters - stupid stomach and even big ass asses - found their way into each episode, shows such as a zoo or an art gallery such a different setting. Later, while discussing artwork, they ran the sandwiches. "That Leonardo DaVinci cartoon ... I do not see jokes!", Dud says. PT pointed out that when it was first unveiled it was probably the people in the fits. Dude almost chokes on his repost. "You're really enjoying those sandwiches!" Laughing at each other laughs to each other The pictures set new standards for comedy, which will not fit until Monty Python arrives. <br /> <br /> Increasing the popularity of the show has increased the quality of guest stars. For example, Peter Vendors and John Lennon present a pictorial item based on his poems 'Def Ted, Danuta, and Mr.'. 'One Leg to Fu' - Dubey was known as 'George Spigat' (a name later re-used in the film 'Bedjazd'), a generation of people who played the role of film producer Kuk and played the role of 'Tarzan'. Cook tries to give him down as soon as possible. "I have nothing on your right foot!", He said. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A restaurant called 'The Frog and the Pitch'. Another classic was 'The Leping Na Un' (reused on 'Bedjazal'). But my all-time favorite needs to be 'superthandartier', a mischievous (and correct) parody of Gary and Silvia Anderson's Thunderbirds. Pete and Dudh played all the roles, later created the modern Lady Penelope. 'Ludwig' was Ludwig van Beethoven as the star of various shows of this 'Tom Jones' style. 'The Amartale Bargo' is a vague documentary on the movie star 'Emma Bargo' together. In an unforgettable moment, through London, he traveled through Laudhailer: "I want to be alone!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All of them had to correct the lines of a poem, and whoever failed to spread it, it was scathing on the nasty things. <br /> <br /> Made in three seasons, created by Jack MacGrath (at different times), Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Sadly, fewer versions survive. To make things even worse, the scripts have also been destroyed. These beggars believe that this situation has been allowed to happen. <br /> <br /> The show ended in 1970. Comics then hit Broadway, making infamous 'Derek and Clive' tapes, but Cook's growing alcoholics separated them. . Eight years later, Cook announced that a new series were closed, but it became deliberate in its part. His ex-partner was filming in America and there was no desire to work with Cook again. (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As expected, some items were not kept as well as others. , And by a respect, the BBC combines a program collected from various Parkinson's interviews and shows 'not only ... but' but it ends up appropriately with the stomach and Dud in heaven. "Bloody hell!", The next exclaimed. Passed in.
