This good idea and carefully researched documentary shows that between 1969 and 1971, the horrific case of the Chagos Islands was forcibly exiled from their respective countries by a conflict of British and American government. Anglo-American policymakers chose to do this work according to their belief that the islands would become strategically essential backgrounds for the control of the Indian Ocean through projections of naval and naval forces. During the cold war, when most of the new independent colonial states were moving away from the West, it seems that British and American officials thought that the islands would not be allowed to determine the fate of the islands. Instead they chose to influence the forced removal of the wholesale of local populations. The film shows that there was no arrangement for the islanders to take their measures, and the Chogosian community transferred from Maurice dockside where they were left, had gone into despair for three decades and went around the house in this new situation. <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Someone suspected something was wrong and these papers were public Rakasa were not), as a result of the legal community in exile cagosiyana islanders appeal on behalf of the British Government and the British state finds it consistently. In this way, the surprising and stimulating decisions of the film can be seen as proved. Nevertheless, the governments of Great Britain and the United States did not promise to return the islands to complete the islands so far. This is a very good movie to watch it, but it is an important thing to watch for Britain and Americans. To be silent in the face of these incidents, being involved in a totally ugly crime.
