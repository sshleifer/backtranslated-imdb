"If I want to drible, I'll call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "Did not you have enough?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> My head I do not want to think that way. "<br /> <br /> Some of the wonderful ridiculous and often insightful movies from this charming and often insightful movie.Dudley Moore is charming, lovable and prosperous ... Sir John Gilgood is elite, charming and loving ... and poor. Define the relationship between father / son and son, which means Arthur. Will he follow his / her heart, or just his wealth?
