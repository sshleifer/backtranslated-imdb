As part of the 1950s decade of vocabulary, we knew Pandora, Little Joe, Jos, Ben Cartite, etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> It was a real show of family worth images. There can be a weekend crisis, but it is a strong family environment that brings together all. <br /> <br /> Loren Green was influential in the family. His words painted knowledge. We were often surprised that a Ben Cartite, a widow who died, was the best among the husbands to her poor wife. She raised the wonderful boys. <br /> <br /> Naturally, we all wonder why Parnell Roberts has left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts passed away when he surrendered the quantity of load. His career was not stopped because of being a cartridge boy. He was supposed to try to get back to the series. He certainly drops out a bonanza.
