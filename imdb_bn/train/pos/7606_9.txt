The first series of losing kicks off with a bang ... literally and slows down at slow speed. It can close some viewers and those who started to transit will both be disturbed or just confused. <br /> <br /> I will start rediscovering people all over the world so that they can only watch from the beginning and do not shut the PT through a slow episode. The whole acting is excellent but why the 5 series' plans are ... why ??? All this means that there is no answer for at least 4 years, oh well, if I keep up the tension and the dialogue flows, then I will see.
