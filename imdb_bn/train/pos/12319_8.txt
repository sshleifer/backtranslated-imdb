The first thing to do first, miss the female lead is very gorgeous. Now actress Wang Zhu Jian, who played Ziao Qian in the movie, she is 42 years old and older. It is always good to review these glorious bars by watching the ancient school Hong Kong productions. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the most influential titles created in the 1980s. Industrial set decoration and other aesthetic aspects are all mesmerizing. More fancifully the movie was a total black humorous exercise. It seems like a horror movie but in the end it is not frustrating, only fun. <br /> <br /> There was an experience of translating the second script of "One Chinese Ghoststory Story", and I think the script was a decent text. However, when I saw the movie, for the first time, I was disappointed to see the movie from the script, as well as smaller size and more comic roles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Climax Miranda Otro is like a mirror to fight with Ring Witch. It's definitely a smile-out loud Say!
