The white fire was recommended to me by two separate DVD releases and a person owned by VHS. He claimed it was one of the most fun and final low budget employees ever made. I do not usually see the cute movie that they are going to be bad, but I make an exception for this ... and I'm so glad that I did. <br /> <br /> It is filling in the action (mostly, surprisingly, graphical gorry), sled (isolated from nudity with a female female character, but it is a lot of fun in one scene) and unreasonably strange conversation, which laughs - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jeans, Exmittinetor's unusual explorer star (and countless other low-budget action torses) lead impressive. Williamson is better than usual, hamming it clearly with unexpected riddles (and does not come until middle). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, especially Villen, one of which is a toxic prostitute who speaks Spanish and Italian as a mosquito nets. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said again, tell me? It is so annoying that it is not annoying, but it is unusually violent in the run-out parts of some fleshy squib shootouts, and it is a deadly torture that no person will soon forget. Also, when the ginger is pushed by bad guys, she easily holds a chain and the follow-up splatter moms scream any and all action fans and extend their beer. <br /> <br /> Do not miss Don White Fire. It's a rolling-mind-numbingly stupid-action classic.
