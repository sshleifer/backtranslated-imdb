Ever read Jim Thompson? He sometimes boils hard with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy facing Noor. His work rarely includes personal intelligence - only sufferers, psychologists and artists of short time. This image nipped Thompson - "If God makes any real mistake in this world, we had a desire to live if we had an excuse for us." Each character of the film depends heavily on the razor edge between the obscure reality. Uncle Bude has played the role of Brazilian Darne and Spokuli Goodbye Dock Goldman, directed by Jorge Dickerson. Jason Patrick gives surprise, often heart-rendering performance like Kid Collins, who is not too bright, shy former warrior who is more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel ward feathers, sexy girl fatty, we can not think completely ... this is not your ideal film, nor can it be. After Dark Mixe, along with The Grieffters, my favorite writer Jim Thompson has two excellent adaptations of the novels.
