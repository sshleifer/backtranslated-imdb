My name is Heather and I was the girl, whose story was based on this movie. I want to thank all of you who watched and enjoyed this movie. It is also not appropriate to describe some of the worst things actually mentioned as something that is depicted in this film, as irrational and rigid. My mother and younger sister did not have to mention all that was. Thanks again for all the great comments, I really appreciate them <br /> <br /> Hi everyone! <br /> <br /> This is the mother of Heather. It is difficult to believe that this film has been many years since its creation. Even hard to believe that people were still watching it a year ago. If any of you has gone through the same situation or similar situation, please know that people are here in cyberspace that you fully understand. Each of our thoughts and prayers is with you.
