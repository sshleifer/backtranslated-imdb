There is a theory that exists in the past and the moments that exist, it really exists. It's too much to wrap around your head, but perhaps there is some comfort for those who want to go back to simple time and space. For Barbara Gene Trenton (Ida Lupino), that time twenty-five years ago, in the mid-1930s, her youngest and glamor got the greatest promise. For me, if I could spend time, then I would be back in the 1950s. Maybe a place like Willbach, but that's another episode. <br /> <br /> One thing that was not so special about 1959 is simply "The Twilight Zone". Find out how much you think about taking the entire catalog catalog and then you wanted to see a specific story? I consider you off-trade, easy-to-be versatile, it is considered right now or the story starts where spool up it has to be considered. <br /> <br /> I'm a little surprised, Rod Sterling will call a story that will be closely related to the Sunset Boulevard. To examine the idea of ​​a real concept of Aida Lupino's character, Norman Desmond was very closely portrayed. Martin Bersham illustrates similar character as Irich von Straigh, the husband has become a husband, who is loyalty. Danny (Balsam) and Sal (Ted De Corsia) challenge the barbara genes with reality and challenge the pigeons that are lightening to diminish its existence. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there was no such reservation for our viewers, Ed Lupino was not big 'but there was a wonderful showcase'. It is a real treatment to see a episode of "The Twilight Zone" and is seeing who pops up from the days. Sometimes you get a two fer, as you have with the here loopino and balsam, celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began, and sometimes afterwards. The concert combined with the stories created, it is still not surprising that they still manage to love so much for today.
