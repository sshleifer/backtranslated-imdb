It's one of the best movies I've seen. The film is related to real life and how drugs can play a large part. Although this movie seems to be produced from low budget, I would be happy to see it. <br /> <br /> Someone might not like the story and say that the script lacks direction. However, when a person gets deep into the drug as this character, there is no direction in life. I think this film is the perfect presentation of what can happen to a person when it comes to extreme temptation. <br /> <br /> Most artists are new trends for the industry. However, they all very well pulled it off. Everyone feels good about their work and get them right in character. <br /> <br /> I think that this film can be a good tool for dealing with a person or a person involved in drugs, and spiral seems to be out of control. This movie may be afraid enough to change their way.
