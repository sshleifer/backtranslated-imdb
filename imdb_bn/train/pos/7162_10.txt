It's always one of my favorite movies. I've read and liked the book, but this movie is full of famous books. Acting superb, especially from John Voight, who played a very bad character in Sir. This movie is a definite way of storytelling that keeps you away from everywhere, where finally everything is combined to end together. I liked the path shown by the backdrop of the modern day and the story of Stanley's ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story was made for the film, and Andrew Davies did a great job to handle it. I definitely recommend this to those who enjoy good movies.
