The first death that was afraid of me. My older brother (RIP) saw it when I grabbed it. It was a black and white TV and was not really a good picture, but it did interest me. Soon after, my people bought a color set and fate as it was, millions of dollars in the movie showing it on Sunday. <br /> <br /> I mostly forgot plots, but it did not take a long time ... and I was so scared that I had to sleep that night! I'm sure it was just a movie, but it involved a creature that just did not come from the place, but you did not hear it, or did not see it ... and once it was caught up to you it was too late. Even now, after all this time it still sends a vibration up to my spine. A real classic and a classic one that I saw a new generation of pants scared! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
