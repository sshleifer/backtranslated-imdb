I saw "Brothers Shadow" at the Tribeca Film Festival and after two days I thought of myself. A story of some sons (Scott Cohen) returning to his family's custom furniture business after a stage in prison, it offers all the necessary attributes of a difficult drama - memorable characters; Sharp, observer dialogue; <br /> <br /> But more than that, it represents something that is very rare in multiplexes today: an incompatible view of a mature sensitivity. Director-Screenwriter Todd S Eulin's looks appear to be full, but we understand that he (his hero) has repaid his debt. He knows how much people struggle in this world, and he knows how we are interested to see - or at least, to gain a great experience. Yet Yellin blamed happy smoke until the end of our rear, very respected his audience. In the end, we see that Jake does not have respect for commissions or even her family, but she can not quit if she tries to "work". <br /> <br /> This is one of the essential themes in the world (and especially the film industry) that "bottom line" can not rise above. This film deserves a broad audience.
