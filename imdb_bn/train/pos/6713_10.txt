I liked this TV show because it was a matter of fact that her daughter said on her seventeenth birthday that she is a witch and she lives with her cousin and they both have documents. Well this took me about a few weeks to use. When he used his power for the first time, he was funny because he made his enemy pineapple. He was back in time and had a day to repeat. This series is really cool and it's a normal teenage series, but when he went to an apartment with his colleague colleague friends and his colleagues wear thin and then it became annoying and I stopped showing up. I liked her drunk that they were very funny and the other one was really ditzy. I liked Valerie and I hated Sabrina's enemy Libby. She was ugly.
