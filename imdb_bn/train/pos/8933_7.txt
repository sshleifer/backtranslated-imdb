Claire Dennis has repeatedly shown that the film does not need to tell a story, it is enough to create an experience that allows viewers to accept the elements and what they need to do. The visual concept is the oldest man living on the French-Swiss border in the framework of the most non-linear film, a person dedicated to his dog, who is still lover, whose cardiac status threatens his life in a gradual way. He has a son with a little family who never met him, but when he discovered that he needed a heart transplant, he was going to Tahiti via Japan to get a heart transplant in the black market and to revive the long lost relationship. <br /> <br /> Danis uses this framework to describe the loneliness of soul, the vastness of nature, the camera to communicate with humans. Versus animals, etc. Most of the time, 'film' does not make sense, but because of the beautiful pictures, we try very hard to connect all the points in front of us. These kinds of lives are: we see, see, observe, consolidate, process and create what we do. <br /> <br /> Claire Dennis has developed a signature technique for making such films (as he had curious 'Beau Travail'). Visitors are not sure whether the finished product has a lot to do with our own methods of processing visible and conceptual information near the awardee. It's an interesting and visually impressive movie, however many visitors find an extremely long lecture about it very little. Probably seen again that will change. Grady Harp
