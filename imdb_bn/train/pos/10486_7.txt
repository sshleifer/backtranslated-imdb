"Savar Grace" is never rudely funny, but it provides several good smiles and I enjoyed it in a significant degree. Brenda Blethyn has done a good job in portraying a fine actress and widow, Grace, who resorts to growing marijuana for repaying her massive debt. Supporting cast also does a fine job. French actor Tekki Kireo has a fun little role Is to apply alone. The idea of ​​growing up and smoking pot is the idea of ​​a high mountain woman. And this movie now and then plays around with the promise of wisdom. Of course, there are flat moments, as two elderly women have misplaced Grace's marijuana pages for tea leaves and they begin to drag antics of the children they work on. That was a psychological joke that did not quite take up. The sound of the film is frustrating and sometimes vague, but I got enough laugh to provide this recommendation in English. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
