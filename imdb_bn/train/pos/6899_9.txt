Gerard Phillip's superb star quality, who died at a very young age, has jumped from the screen with a lot of humorous, funny, funny, slash fencing and Nokabout Antics. Loopy in his' story, ultimately impossible to resist. A sweet romantic comedy with very young Gina Lolobrigrider with love interest. A movie will be remembered with great affection.
