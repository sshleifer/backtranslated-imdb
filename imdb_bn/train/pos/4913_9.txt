The title crosses the subject of this movie a bit, which may be some unrealistic expectations. To be honest, it can be seen here "extremely dangerous in the street". In fact, very few people across the film actually know that there is a murderer who can spread the disease and anyone who can face it. It has been said that what we have here is an amazing story which starts at a higher level (because, like "people on the streets", what the visitors know what they know) and the director Elia Kazan very deliberately build. The plug is called as the infected killer, I got a more interesting sidebar Dr. There was a developing relationship between Reid (Richard Widmark) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At the beginning, they do not like each other, although they have to work together. In the end, they created real bonds of respect for each other. Kazan did a good job with that. <br /> <br /> Most of the performance here was excellent. Wyomdark and Douglas were fantastic, and I played most of the "heavy" role with the very early description of Jack Palance. I did not find very little criticism here. Probably Barbara Bell became slightly flat like Jesse Reed's wife Nancy, but her role was not really the center of the story. All in all, a nice piece of work. 9/10
