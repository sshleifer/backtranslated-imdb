... there will be no summary of a plot because the plot may seem small, brain-dead, and pointless in words. The movie is nice, both Denzel and Dakota (they will go up in the sky, believe in me) are just imaginary, and the conspiracy mind is swelling. Indeed "fabulous" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is based only on real events and some characters are not imaginary, it is an incident that I added to the film and then shock. If you are a lover of actors and a bit overwhelming movie, you still have not seen your favorite one ... Believe me, you will eventually have a strange and uncomfortable feeling. The movie is awesome, watch it, hire it, buy it or whatever ... do not miss it
