Great little thriller. I was expecting some kind of stupid movie, but what I got was a tight little thriller that does not waste our time. Most of these films will be read in the stories behind us, so when people start to die we feel sympathy or hate. Foolish there! Yes you see few letters but they really only interact with principals. For example, from the house-to-house, the wife, husband We saw them so well how proficient we were to Lisa's character and how much the new hotel Clark was capable of. We can easily see the little girl because after that the film has a small but important role in the breakdown of the hectare. This is due to flight attendants, especially our plots will be removed. Especially bad guy needs her to start the flight. It was also important for the strange people in the airport. Without using any of the planes, there were only 5 lines, only two letters were of two young men. It was tricky because I thought there was something to do with their plot. From the first scene to the end of the female character Lisa is a young hotel executive in charge. Even when Jackson shows his true colors, he is not panic. He thinks he can suspend the time what he thinks. Any other movie will work like a smart executive female idiot. But this is not one. It was a very small movie and I was waiting to enter the usual plastic devices because the film seems to be fast approaching. Thankfully none of them are used. Clarke is not normally called in the new hotel and he has been told what to do, which gives Panick phone and if he does not say anything, comes out of the hotel, or asks your boss to tell him that he will have to drink a lot more and he will be sacked. . . Craven will do more to do this type of movie. Also a last comment. Brian Cox is in this movie but I have no source. I came here to see Lisa's father. He is completely unknowable.
