It is not surprising that this film has won 4 prizes, it is a movie that talks to a soul, it is no wonder that at the end, Paul Riezer was given 20 years and Peter Connie had to talk about his idea. I understand every part of it, this is a movie that will make you only a tear or thousands of crying. Story: 10/10 When Sam Kleinman received a letter about his wife leaving her, she came out on the road to find her son and to find him, and when they lost something Find friendship, family, and affection for each other. At the beginning you know what's going to happen, but since the story is not easy to get from beginning to end, it's a journey between a father and his son and a husband and a wife. Paul Reiser took 20 years to write this beautiful romance / comedy. Actors: 10/10 Can not say well that what I want to say is that in Peter Folk, everything he does in movies is all magic, when you think of Peter Folk using romance / comedy ? A perfect result, this movie is perfect that no wonder and won that much price. Son Paul Reiar did a great job, though he is not always a great actor, but that does not mean that it does not really work. Actually Peter Fawck and Paul Reiser have played the perfect father and son, the rest are good enough but you do not see them so much so just tell them what they will do to get more light. <br /> <br /> 10. Sometimes it does not work while using music, it just does not fit, but there is no thing in this movie, the music is perfect in the sun, making the movie even more forceful. This part of the movie will be lit as well as other parts, sure to have a great soundtrack for romance / comedy. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Overall: It will not happen every day that you can create such a story, it takes a few years, and in fact it is really a great piece of money to buy it and to put it into a human soul. When you get older and see it with your father as old age, then I think this movie will never be created again.
