Interesting, romantic, innovative, and fun. The look of this extraordinary film is almost as far as the more familiar "romance of death" like Ghost. Although we know immediately that Peter and June will get ultimate happiness after the long stairs, joy is the ride. The moral of the story, of course, timeless: love is all win. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a sky-high region and in the Gringing Grandeur. In the CGI era, six decades later, the views of the director of Heaven with additional images of more than 500 features, including images of different ages and cultures were memorable. <br /> <br /> For all the cosmic scale, Powell and Presbyver knew an essential fact: The best story is called at the lowest level. The surprising, firmly romantic aspect of "Sierway" is captured with the ultimate simplicity: June's TierDrop, stored on a rose petal. <br /> <br /> Like this story, story and set, in this era of age.
