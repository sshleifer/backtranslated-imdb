Dream Streker Freddy Kr√ºger from Eld Street Return, great character actor Robert Nangland returned to the dream of this nightmare, dream children. I hope I got the correct number. That's all, and it's the best, especially for the cayos; Rose Arnold (then Arnold) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp, Alice Cooper (who made the first nightmare in 84) Alice Cooper (singer) You can see Fredie as a painful child, a teen who likes pain and a family man (surprisingly) Very funny and creative, including Lisa Zen (Billy sister) Brein Girl (street) Yappet Coatto (Alien, Live and Le Mer) and mango I do not know Donahu (Dad knows better) I was 3 people who watched it 3d better, I love 3D movie.I missed the first 3D wave in 1953 (I was not born yet) The second wave was in 1983. I Freddy was like a movie, this was the first to be the first to count as the best one, Freddie became the new giant of the 80s and 90s, as well as Jason Bhaurish, Chaki, Mikhail Myers and Cham Do you imagine a picture with them? I recommend all Freddie fans and awesome fans alike.
