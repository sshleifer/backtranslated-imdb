Over the years we have seen the scary movie we saw, such as 2 silent Hollywood remedies, I saw 2 horror Indi releases which are totally unexpected ... we hope to find green films "dark" through bad pictures <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We saw a screening of this film in 2005 at The Shikingfest. Viewers like it and I believe it won the award for the best movie. <br /> <br /> While studio films do not have the budget or star, it suddenly packs a serious punch in the atmosphere and the awesome class. Acting and cinematography is the top notch, but it is the aspect that makes this movie visible. The stories and the characters develop at just speed to provide some fantastic scares. <br /> <br /> Edit and visual FX are also top notch. And when many horror movies do not manage to use music in their favor, then the score of "Dark Rainnes" simply adds to its verb. <br /> <br /> I know that this movie was shown in a bunch of festivals, but someone was near me, so I can not listen to hear when the DVD is finally coming out. If you are not sick from the current state of a horror film, believe me, try it ... you will not be sorry!
