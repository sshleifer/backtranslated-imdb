This is one of the most fun movies I have seen. I saw it in DVD, and there is no special feature of the disc, even a menu, but it is not important to me. <br /> <br /> I tend to judge films based on judgment, depending on whether or not the big studio produces or depends on small films. This is a small film and I wish to forgive minor things. I said, I believe that this is one of my most imaginative and original title sequences. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed playing all the major players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin is the most fun line. The character portrayed by Claire Farlani can be unrealistic to some people, but I personally have met the mental problems that make life decisions like her character very easily. That helped me to choose the diversity that might come out of her laughing disorder. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for children, of course, but it is not related to irrational sexuality and nudity. Although there are several adult languages, it can sometimes be very fun. (In particular, the character of Allan Armin, who can not properly swear) <br /> <br /> See also known characters for cameras of actors.
