This movie is reviewed by all the people and probably many professional movie critics, it's not right. This film was created with great sequences like matched sequences and art tricks such as the works of excellent Czech filmmaker Karl Jamon. If you want to know what I am saying, I want you to get to Zeman's movies, such as The Fabulous World of Zeus Verne, Baron Munchson, Journey to the Beginning of Time, or Comet. If you are unable to detect a movie, read reviews at AMG. They will explain the processes used. If someone looks at Gabon's work and trying to compare with other scientists / fi fantasies of that time, the audience probably could not have achieved it. Comparing the style of filmmakers in day-to-day standards is not wrong, because both James and Hines "do not count". They have a unique style that is unique to them and should only be judged for their creativity. If you see this movie from this point of view, where you know that he has deliberately tried to create a matte matte collage mixed with live action, then you can easily come to the conclusion that he did an efficient job. It is not easy to make a bunch of computer cutouts flow. I thought that the animals were also good, and how they were made. Hines has taken a great gambling, and I think her film will not be deemed fairly for years. Anyone who pretends this movie should stop showing what the audience sees rather than allowing the viewers to go to the theater in the hopes of work. About the actor, I think Hines also took a page from James's book, as most of the Gimmene actors were initially somewhat vague, but became more compelling during film and activity. This is completely refreshing me in this movie on my library. I think it will come for years, it's three great hours.
