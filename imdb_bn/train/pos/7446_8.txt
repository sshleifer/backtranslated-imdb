I can not agree with the comment. For the first time I saw the movie on a UK TV channel, it was presented as an indie film and if you put the film under this corner, it seems like it is a different matter. I could not believe what I saw and immediately got hooked. The plot may be as bad as a JS show (i.e. no plot), but the act is wicked, it's ridiculous and it's like all the incredible trash movies. <br /> <br /> It is more about a story than America, rather than a bull or why park but it focuses on America's society and gives more leisure time to the TV seller in America (and I believe there is plenty of them!) . After all, we are talking about our neighbors, are we? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
