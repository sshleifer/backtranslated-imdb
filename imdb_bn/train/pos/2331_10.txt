At first, I was surprised that the original character of a TV show can bring the dead back to life, but then I thought I would give it a shot. Guess what I love "Davis push" and look at Wednesday night, then next week I see it in my DVR a few more times. Colorful characters, malicious banners, accelerated dialogue, and the new unique situation started to me and attracted to the beginning. Ned and Chuck are interested in seeing Charles's relationship because they work in their romance that they can not communicate physically. Even detective Emerson Cod's character continues to increase complexity. And olive graduate! Jimmy Crispies! He cracks me up! Interesting and cinematography gives me an impression that I'm watching a movie instead of a TV show. I recommend introducing my family and friends to "Daisy Chab" and they are very bitter !!! The show is awaiting week for a new episode and if you "P.D." I do not see it but I recommend watching it!
