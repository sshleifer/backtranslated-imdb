The movie is absolutely stupid. <br /> <br /> But are you expecting a high intellectual movie based on a comic called Sam Damak? Really? Joy Chu's acting is not the most moving thing I've ever seen, but of course I enjoyed the movie. Can anyone like Jack Lee or Stephen Chow get such a surprise? Not really. Was it thoroughly entertaining if you took it towards the price of the surface? Absolutely It is a movie about some Chinese eyes candy statues and musicians who can skillfully play basketball at unrealistic level. There's an evil Triad-style dude and a cruel scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all this. A love interest It is formulas but really, suspends unbelief for some time. Come on. It is called Kung Fu Dunk. Do you really feel signed for you? If you see this, please do a favor on your behalf - I have found a copy of myself with some of the uncompromising subtitles that made the film in conjunction with obsolete conversations, but we became very laughable through it. They will be highly corrected in Jerusalem and number 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I laughed. I want to see it again. <br /> <br /> Bar scene in particular for that fight. Good dancers and good shots I especially enjoy the Plexiglash Lit Pool table - I want to play one of them. <br /> <br /> enough for me to slink, but I dig the trash movie.
