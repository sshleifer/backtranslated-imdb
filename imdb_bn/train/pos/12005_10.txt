This film is the best movie I have ever seen. Due to LDS, I highly recommend this movie because you were able to feel more about Joseph Smith's life. Although the movie was not created with highly acclaimed actors, it is an extraordinary and life-changing film that everyone can enjoy and appreciate. I saw this picture with my family and I can testify that our heart has changed. This film really helps people to understand how hard the Prophet's life was and how much hardship he endured. After I saw this movie, there was not a dry eyes in the whole room. Everyone saw what it touched and I saw that I was not the same. I highly recommend this movie for everyone.
