This is just one of the best presentations of Dicken's classic tale. The script correctly follows the story written by Dickens and holds a perfect balance between the film atmosphere and the game environment. The viewer's favorite image of a format will find enough stories in their preferred presentation style. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott brings a delightful realistic approach to the character of Scrooge and is very convinced of the character development. Instigated by visiting the ghost. I have seen that he was able to conquer me at that point where I am sympathetic to old sadness, rarely happens in any other version. The fantastic work done by supporting actors is widely added to this product, which I found most enjoyable among all Christmas carol versions.
