I do not know why people always want deep meaning in movies or others think they are worthless. <br /> <br /> <br /> What is just entertainment? Something that is Morgan Freeman excel. He gets a chance to close a bit. His co-star Paz Wagga received professional support and Brad received a name for Silbering to attract people to watch his movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some crazy, some bitspiteration but nothing at the top. I got a special kick out from Jim Persons as a construction company's receptionist. He freeman shows adoringly and says, "You want me to be a woman." She is just sunny The fight scenes between his ex-husband and his girlfriend Mrs Wage are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Small, it's a cute, charming movie that laughs at you. You can make many, much worse
