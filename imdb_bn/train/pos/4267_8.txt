During the celebration of Brooklyn's Kurt Well, where do we go from here? Finally invented for a screening. It is surprising that a motion picture of an era, in which the Will-Garswin coaches are probably missing from the screen. The scores are tall and a CD of the component with the Gershwin and Ville only reduces its capabilities, which are notable. Yes, the film has a problem, but the score is not one of them. Rataph is not his material as the director of this musical imagination, and Fred McMurray could not understand several elements. Then, too, the 'modern' segment is poorly written. But this image of fantasy material carries a high mark, such as the work of two delightful leading women - Joan Leslie and June Havar. Both of them need to work such a work strongly. Salute in the history of our country as World War II - Although 'never in' structure, the film has a history of music in Hollywood and it should be available to everyone to see and see its significant capabilities.
