OK. Yes, it was a very tight budget movie with consistency flaws (such as visually sunglasses films and then shading together and then mixing together), and as much as I love Nick Mancuso, he was parting out very well, and throwing some small supporters was really bad (Plus at least one actor is used for two different but distinct roles). But come on. Richard Greco was violent (his hair alone trip price). Steven Ford was very liked. There were some great lines in Mancos, when Nansy Allen was malicious, completely flexible and selfish. Classic? Not the bad part? Yes Entertaining? Big yes I decided to have what kind of hairstyle Grieco had set to have been set day. "Are you quick?" ... "That's not fast."
