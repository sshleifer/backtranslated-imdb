"Mute film" is an excessive used expression when describing the film. Every crime drama seems to be a "noir". But "where Sidewalk is finished" is really a good example of this, which is a continuation of everything. <br /> <br /> In a very short time, an excessive intelligence detective (Andrews) accidentally kills a no-goodie, who works for mobsters. The assassination blames the father of a woman Andreas (Tom Tuli) and reads for her (Tienne). To save the father from Old Sparky, Andreas captured the rest of the population and made himself. <br /> <br /> Morally criminal police dealt with the past. His father was a thief, who tried to get out of prison. But he did not excuse his actions after he closed the no-goodness suicide. He went to the phone immediately to tell the incident, but hesitated. He is already in hot water with the department and it can end his career. Then, at the right moment, phone rings. It is Andrew's partner and Andrews suspects that they are back in the house they are not home. He hid the body and then settled it by sloganeering a guard and dumping the body in the river. <br /> <br /> What motivates a person to do something stupid? OK. His work was at risk. But now he is committed to multiple felonies. At least I think they will be multiple. I carry false testimony against the barrier of justice, without the permission, without a body exchange, muddle, first degree muffery, and its neighbors. <br /> <br /> Finally, we do not know root for Andrews or not. The suspect was not worthy of death, but it was after an accident because Andrews did not know that he was the hero of a war and there was a silver plate on his head. It is probably the kind of obscurity that Noua created, which was among other things as characteristic light. If there is nothing more than silent black and white photography, murders, criminals, mysteries and suspicious women, then we want to include all Charlie Chan films under that rubber. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was bitter to Mark McPherson (from "Laura"). While sitting beside a restaurant table from Gene Tearnie, he never laughs and rarely laughs, in such situations, smiles can most likely. He has no sense of humor. Her few wiseracks are down-down. When he said a stoolie shoves and stoolie in a cab, "carefully. I hit my head almost," Andrew Riposte is, "OK." CAB Insurance. " Andrews may occasionally feel like wood, but it is a role that calls for a sudden and ridiculous determination and it handles it well. Perfect for its underplaying part. Little twitches or blinks project has its thoughts and mental state. And I guess, Director Auto Premiere, prevented him from publishing "bul-let" and bullet as "POE-lice" to the police. Jean Tierney could not make up my mind. He's the daughter of Tom Tuli, the role of a model, but he is just like Marilyn Monroe that you can not separate the methods adopted from the characteristics of real personality. Is Tienne really innocent, almost honest person? When he answered the phone at home, his voice was in the same song as well as on the screen? Before the poor Tierney had any effective meds for Bipolar disorder, some went through bad psychic stuff. And Andrews is a very good man, though it seems that he finally got into alcoholism before recovering and making public service announcements. <br /> <br /> The DVD commentary of Peter Mueller is neutral, informed and sometimes fun. <Br> <br /> However, this is a good example of a good movie and movie hero. Good guys are not good at all, though bad guys are all bad. Perhaps that obscurity makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie. For kiddies, only one shot fired on the screen and someone is exploding head. Sorry
