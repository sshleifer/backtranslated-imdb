The US Navy Fleet, a mentally anxious young man in Antônne fishing. His problem leads him to psychologist Jerome Davenport, who helps him understand that he is raising his childhood during his problems. <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie could thaw the cold heart. I liked the stories, which happened to someone in a positive ending so active from something so terrible. Antwone fishing is a powerful movie, most important about apology. Other important factors that you consider are child abuse, acceptance, and care of animals. <br /> <br /> Oscar winning, Denzel Washington has done a great job of its director debut. I've seen a lot that I've enjoyed watching. They start at the beginning (dream of a little boy? Check out the monster-sized pancakes!) And the last (the dream has been implemented), which together tune the story beautifully. Another wondrous scenario occurred when the doctor encouraged Antônio to find his family and encouraged his family to find out the answers to his abandonment questions. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene took place when the young man finally showed his mother and his reaction to him. <br /> <br /> <br /> All actors presented their portions well. <br /> <br /> As well as Directorial responsibility, Mr. Washington has also shown why he won the Oscar and succeeded in all his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this film. <br /> <br /> The actor, Derek Luke showed why Fischer was so appropriate for Antovone. He illustrated the work of real and heart-tinging. <br /> <br /> The part of John Bryant Chanel is similar to screen rays on the screen of Anne's love interest in Chennai. Chemistry is well-circulated among romantic characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> A few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother had a great performance <br /> <br /> Everyone has to catch the antibonan fish.
