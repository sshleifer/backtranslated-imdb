Enterprise Pilot is something that has become essential to the original Star Trek: realistic, defective personality levels. The next generation of colonial characters have become tedious, they were so great to be incredible. I like the sub-plot that people are bitter to Volcano. See them as her funny sunny snobs. It makes me look forward to seeing that when people become dominant among two people, I do not think it will work in the time frame of the ceremony. The only negative reason for jumping on me was the feeling "closing at the end of 2 hours at the last minute", which is common among track shows. The second stupid sexy scene was a shameless dig for ratings by a couple. It was far from the place, displaying a good science fiction should be able to stand on its own without having to try some skin pre-teen audience pad. But it's not my job to make shoe profitable, so oh well. <br /> <br /> How to see the next episode?
