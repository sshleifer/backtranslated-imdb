My god One of the best films of budget light I've ever seen is one of the best movies. Near Peter Greenway and Jean-Luc Gouard's movies, it's really annoying but not as awesome as Neckomantics. Despite the lack of money, all the short stories have deep philosophical interests and instructions are completely innovative, (see the "bridge" sketch). Very highly recommended!
