Roman Polanski has ordered wildly sorting the theme to be deformed. I can not imagine that an honest film director can not accept the subtle director of Le Locator, but both parts of the diapital may not be satisfactory satisfactorily to most people. <br /> <br /> It is very good to feel the inner torture of its characters. (Deforming himself and in Law Lockete in Denwee), with the lack of confidence, soon slowly, psychological problems start to turn into a turmoil and eventually become an unchanging physical affair. False chat for characters and audiences is actually different from the horror and excitement of horror films, because there is no real miracle element here. Although horror movies allow for some types of catharsis (whether it is cheap or more broadly), Polanski is sadly torting us and if the dark humor remains in his next program, we are mostly against our nerves in the front of our seats. <br /> <br /> Playing with suspense, horror, expectations of all these viewers (optionally fooling and complementing them), not literally with the nerves of the human being. My book Rosemary's Baby has been achieved much more because merely paranoia and simple rationalism are in constant struggle: The story continues in a strange flat, although it is forced to get acquainted with our only character. If fantasy elements are in the mind of the hero, it is a lot more uncomfortable because we, the viewers were forced to judge him, when he was nurtured efficiently ("paint nn lore").
