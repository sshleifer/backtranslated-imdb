If you like Deep Cover, you can also like this movie. Fishbrouch wrote that there have been a number of poetic additions to Fishburn on the cover of a screen adaptation "Onanan The Life" from the script of the lyric poem. If you love me as much as Larry, you love this film which all the Larry, all the warm, and all will swell. Certainly gun games and illegal substances are used, it's a gangster movie, after all, but after that the script is beautiful and touching the story, even the chick flick side of the side. <br /> <br /> Amazing film ... dark, scared, sexy, and exciting If you ever sleep at night or hang out in the closet, you will get the exact effect of the set of cramps (ultimately to trap them in life). The film is full of cute forshading and complex relationships, this movie is solid. Set sensing and camera shots reflect every sensitivity. Good work!
