Japan 1918. 16 year old Reyu's story begins with her father's death. It will be published later, both of his parents have died due to skin diseases. In this frustrating situation, Royce Macie arranges marriage with a Japanese man in Hawaii, whom they know only from his picture. Through the arrival of Hawaii Rayu, her new husband has become as old as the photograph and she lives in a very modest condition beside sugar seed plants. Rai does not work hard on old labor and thinks about escaping depression in her new home. She soon discovered that somewhere to go anywhere. She has a female colleague, her new hope and strength. This image was based on real events from 1907 to 1920, when thousands of American women were married in married America, whom they knew only from their pictures. This very well-known picture is not well written and played. The location is breathtaking. This movie also features Minuon Toshiro as a Bensi (narrator of silent movies) on his last screen. This image gives some insight into Japanese culture around here and the sea. A must see!
