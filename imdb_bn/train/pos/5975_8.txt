Every movie critic and metal head hate this movie but I enjoy it. I saw somewhere on TV as a child and was surprised to see the scene where the cm came on stage and played trick or treat on fastway. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was like 80, pushing the man around and starting supernatural help to kill the strong, but goes away and gets destroyed. <br /> <br /> <br /> From Matroos Place to Matt Scott's family bonding, Tony Field's record from Gep Simmons comforted him, and broke all the hell, Tony's song Lip (Lip-sync) ) And the highlight of a metallic song dance before the Shete hit the fan. <br /> <br /> There were many errors and elements but music and overall imagery were enough to keep my fist out of 10 out of 8 pumps
