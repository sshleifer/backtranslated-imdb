As I mentioned earlier, John Carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two films I can remember and can be influenced by it (the other is the classic Canaan Barberian). It was really scary to me that the only monster under my bed was Michael Girl, whom I finally (fantastic friend) made to friendship in my sleep. Now the terrorists for 10 years old. <br /> <br /> This is a terrific classic and I am sure that my modest review will not be properly judged. The most surprising thing about all is that the film still works, probably not Gitral reaction, but cognitive possibilities or immediate subconscious. All this can happen. It is not located in unpopular areas or abroad (most modern horror, such as hostels, tourism, sports wolf, cho, etc.). The rest is resistant to our graphics and our imaginations. I believe it is an element that is afraid of people or is very careful to go out of the night. It still works because we can replace the direct or grassroots murder with something more horrible that can create our mind. So we are contributing to our own fears and anxiety. <br /> <br /> Carvents wrote simple stories about an everyday, middle-class, suburban and relatively modest child, who knocked on Halloween and killed her sister. After that he returned to an institution (which we do not feel gratefully) in the next 15 years, to escape and return to his own city, notorious Hansfild. On his way he killed and killed. The child's name is Michael Girl, though she is not a person. John Carpenter used Michael Mayers as a metaphor for the underlying protection of the middle-class subcontinent. At the base of American security and security, chaos can still strike. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is not a serial killer, man or psychology. As he is the unstable power. Generic overlays, bleached-white saturn masks, and a lack of any other dialogue after some breathing, inhibits Michael's generalization and helps to complete it. This is all her energy source. He is stupid, stupid and unknowable in some other way than the source of foolish confusion. It is supported by cinematography (post card effect), lack of information / motivation / explanation and experienced musical experience of Donald Pleasence (Dr. Loomis). Selling her "size" on her top performance and lawlessness. Jamie Lee Curtis's debut film, Laurie Strode, is the innocent girl who encounters chaos (for at least a short time) facing an overwhelming conflict. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the first movie of the new scenes of these horror films (Black Christmas came 4 years ago), it is most successful and does not diminish for review. If you are not scared by horror movies in the long run (like me), it probably will make hair behind your head tin in the first charge of the signature soundtrack. I must definitely see a horror movie of this movie and make a recommendation as John Carpenter's career pinball.
