Various story lines are interwoven around various women characters here. They wear shoes to serve as an indication of their disturbed life. All movies are transformed at the end. Adela (San Juan) leads to a prostitution; Her daughter Anita (Monica Sarvera) has become disabled and she has a limited life. Leader (Najah Nimri) loses shoes designer and her lover with problems; Marikarmen (Wiki Pen) has lost her husband and now she has raised children from her dead children. Isabella (Angela Molina) is an annoying rich woman. <br /> <br /> Other letters are used to attach five major female characters. Not everything starts at the beginning of the story: Some connections are incredibly late in the film and it is associated with the experience. Shoe-theme is driven ultimately: For example, when the shoes work in a leather and shoe store as a shoe designer, where he steals his shoes, he breaks one of his heels. <br /> <br /> Made in the scene to edit small connections. A telephone ring, a cigarette burn, a song, etc. is used to connect and quickly cut. The story keeps the series from changing to annoying or TV-level. It's music-driven to set the melody and atmosphere. Madrid and Lisbon towns work as a retreat for the story, and the shots in those cities are used to extend the story beyond the character. One of the more moving shots is when Anita walks on the same path every day, widens her walk, and limits the life of the busy street to the relative quiet of the road: The extent to which the space restriction is rendered visually is done well. Like many Spanish films, many story stories are visualized using easy-to-use soap-like stories. A poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and emotional but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> Ramon Salazar is very much in love with her own stuff. Some scenes on kites and soap level, along with acting (Adela Love's life, Isabel's doctor) Shoe-theme is exaggerated and weaker metaphor. <br /> <br /> This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is technically capable, but somewhat mechanical. This aspect has more power to translate emotions and atmosphere. After watching this, you are eager to move to the new movie city immediately: Madrid.
