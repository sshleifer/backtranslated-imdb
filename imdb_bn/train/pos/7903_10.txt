I'm the first second voice of this movie. More. Let me take a ride - I like the big gloved thumbs at the beginning, but weird humor and both of them look sissy actors gordious - I did not know who played his young - but he was great and so was uma !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a test for two people, who went out of the film after half an hour, I was with a friend - and always watch a movie that looks good to a friend. - And, we both enjoyed it the most - ridiculous smile - grief about "realistic police-generalism" Both of us The fans of the book of Robinson ... I have seen it well - I thought Robinson would also accept, even though he did not have any idea, but he did not like the idea ... <br /> <br /> I love watching the things I cut - I have heard that Gus Vs Bali was the first time the audience (or producer ???) had a lot of scenes to figure out, but it is still an artistic film. Although very small ... this is one of my best choices of all time - and I am aware that most people can not stand for such a movie and think that those who enjoy the movie are ... ... what is a Sad Hopefully there will come a DVD that comes with the whole element - hopefully you can see more of the Crespenan, Keiu - see his child and all <br /> <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see it, Think twice, and if you like to see it, enjoy it ... m
