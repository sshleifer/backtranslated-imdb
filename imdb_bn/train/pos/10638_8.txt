When I think about this movie, the adjectives that come to mind in the mind, are related to the real physical realization of the world. Textures, smells, colors, the way I think should be judged in terms of this film. Watch the rich golden tones surrounding the sleeping mistress of a fireplace, or see the snow-covered Turkish bath and make your senses wild with spices, thick cloth, smooth skin, fragrant oil, burning fire, satin street impression. Just watch and do not listen, absorb, let the tale of storytelling mesmerize you.
