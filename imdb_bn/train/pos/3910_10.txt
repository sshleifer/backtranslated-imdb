So I'm at home, flipping channels one night, and I'm here with heels and makeup, standing in front of HBO's colorful background. Naturally, I took a double and decided I'd watch for a little time. Lastly I did not change the channel, it was incredible. The next time it was, I could see it repeatedly to make sure it tape, and it has kept an eye on one of my favorite things. In the first few minutes, you can say that the audience is not sure what to think, but he immediately wins them with their incredible humor and intelligence. Eddie Ezard stands as the best one, with many stand-up comedians trapped in my brain. Its style is incredibly refreshing, and while most comedians are in current events, it's beautiful to hear things about history and young things. Stay with me after her show. I went to Italy in the summer, and when I was there, I could have thought, "Italians are always going to CiO's scooter ..." 10 out of 10 see this. You do not regret it.
