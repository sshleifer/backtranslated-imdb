This is one of the best episodes of MOH's second episode, I think Mick Garris has the problem of women ... she killed everybody, they are often victims (Screwfill Solutions, Pro-Life, Valerie Stairs, I Season 1, Feeling Argentina's Episode etc. Do not keep an eye on it, clearly). I think he is burning women, tortured, distorted and I do not know. At least "direct right" is not good, with good counter and graphic scenery and mystery (especially pictures from the cell scene are wonderful). Like the whole series of acting, regularly I can be worse than "pro-life" or "screaming for ice cream". Also I can be made for a movie and it can not be done for only one episode. The ideology of the series is terrible, the killing of women and the cancellation of animals, and the separation of animals ... The first season was better than the second episode with "episode of cigarette" (the highest), "Homemaking" episode. Most fun), "impression" (really threatened).
