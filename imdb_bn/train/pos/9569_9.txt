I understand, after China, Hong Kong has taken off the infamous cat. 3 Invisible types of Hong Kong movies. At least so far, and this one is an amazing movie. I knew it was going to play a rough crime, but being the first cat. 3 I bought it recently, I was not sure what I could expect. <br /> <br /> A Cambodian Hit-Man goes to Hong Kong to kill a judge's wife, who is also a lawyer. Changed, the judge arranged Hit Man, because he divorced the judge and threatened all his money. It's all known in the first ten minutes, so nothing is being given. After the strike, the police found Hit Manan very fast, but several police officers and civilians died after trying to arrest him. He eludes the police and is now caught catching people, before he escaped back to Cambodia. This is a movie that will never stop, and does not allow viewers to breathe them. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many policemen die because Hit-Man is very difficult to track, and when they recognize him they come down. On the way, Hit-Man tries to hide a dump, raped by a woman and finds abuse by some people. He helps him, and protects him from the person, and he persuades Hit Man to take him away with him. I like this movie, it's like a roller-coaster that only runs on and running high, because one incident leads to another and sometimes bad or bad as the police hit-man. Acting is extremely good, and location is breathtaking during filming and photography. There is no objection to this movie, even with the incredible finale. The finishing is quite incredible, and all actions and violence have a perfect ending. Yes, violence is sometimes brutal, but it's a very secret crime drama that will stop your socks. "Dog alloy dog" definitely needs more comprehensive releases, including an R1 release. Great movie, highly recommended.
