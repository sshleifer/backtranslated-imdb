The first film director Ryan Jafri, I was delighted to see the small movie "The Chuir". I think the effect of the camera work and music. <br /> <br /> I think many young filmmakers (like I myself am one of them) would enjoy hard times with cinematography. We do not see the output exactly what we portrayed our ambition or down. But this movie, a young director directing from the director, is very well managed on screen. Camera motion, color, lighting, compositing contributes to the story and emotion of all movies. <br /> <br /> And music also helps a lot as the main element of the movie. <br /> <br> It is difficult to portray a woman's heart, her longing, her fear, especially a short figure. But still, I acknowledge that I am not interested in V / O (video), especially when the film is enhanced with the description instead of shot and cut. Some of my personal feelings were part of the narrative, my guess was that statements made a very difficult attempt. So the power returns the audience to the emotions of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a small film done nicely, I could see the input from a director. Ryan go! Greetings from China, look forward to your next. <br /> <br /> Time
