I saw this photo with my friend and we could not laugh! I mean there was nothing scary about this movie! Frandy was all shy funny, sunny! I think they have even created new nightmares and only Freddie von has gone. Jason Although some parts were obese (like flying head). And no Elm Street film sucked from 1- 5. It was the best addition to number 1. If you want a good rapport then I will not expect this movie again. But if you do not have anything to rent it and you laugh together I want to see the Cansso genocide of Texas, it seems to be horrific. Freddie Dead Final Nightmare Overall Grade: B-
