A family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, Father-Jack Weber, son-Eric P. Sullivan) goes out to gather in some remote homes in the middle of winter. Accidentally hit a deer when they were driving. Some people in this locality - especially otis (John Spradakos) and slowly (slowly and slowly) go wrong. <br /> <br /> I had the worst expectations when I started seeing it. Review bulk for this site is very negative. Well ... I do not agree. First off it is not a horror film. The horror does not start even until the end of 30 minutes. It played more of a family drama in which the horror elements were dropped. That's very nice at that level. <br /> <br /> First - bad thing: speed is very slow; Jack Weber is an awesome actor; The way scares the sequence of many false dreams; Wendigo is just ridiculous in the figures in the film and the clear view we get at the wendigo at the end. Good thing: beautiful good dramatic script; Clarkson is excellent as a mother; Some great aspects with the effect of eerie sound which is a little horrible; A beautiful clear hot sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is essential for the integrity of the plot!); Performing well by Sullivan (only at 10 o'clock!) And Speedacacks and completely unexpected tragic endings perform well. <br /> <br /> I think many people are annoyed with this movie because it is being shocked as a horror movie - which is not it. So, if you can ignore it, you may like it. I'm giving it a 7th.
