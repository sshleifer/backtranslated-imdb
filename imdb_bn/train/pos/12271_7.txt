Talk about the opening of an explosion, "Trumpa Infernal" sometimes has great opening credits! Perhaps the "Friday 13th" theme (tish-tash-tash-tash-ha-ha-ha), directed by a slightly inspired musical voice, the names of the main characters are displayed in the split screen between the giant words.

According to a newspaper article, there is a barbarian in the nearby forest and it has already tried to kill more than one victim. The challenge included that anyone who killed the bear will be declared the protagonist of the final stage with the maximum force.

Chemist Freddy Kruger and Michael were a fan of Myers, because he used a self-made glove with a sharp knife attached to it and covered his face using a white scarf.

Wildlife setting and especially the disguised fool trap are delightfully spectacular. "Trumpa Internal" is a Mexican slash / survival sleeper hit that warmly recommends to fans of the song.
