I saw tons of science fiction in the 70's; Some are horribly bad, and others are provocative and really frightening thoughts. Soylent fits in the next category of green. Yes, sometimes it's a little campie, and yes, the furniture is good for a tiger, but the film seems quite a bit scary. 9 years ago, we got a movie here, which dared to imagine the future, such as dark, scary and foolish things. Charlton Haston and Edward G. Robinson has hired much better than both the Ten Commandments, and Robinson's helpers-suicidal scenes, such as Kevarakiya and Crystal Presents like him Some date of attitude (Can you imagine a filmmaker, that is, in our so-politically-correct-90s decade "furniture as a woman"?), But it is very rare to find a movie of my decade. This is what I would like to see on the big screen, even because of a widescreen presentation, I do not think the overall opportunity of this film will get its due. See it
