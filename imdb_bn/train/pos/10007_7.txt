Night Listener (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Tony Colette, Bobby Kannaval, Rory Kullkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Kollum, Lisa Emeri, Beckie Anne Baker (DR: Patrick Statorner) <br /> <br /> <br /> Hitcchian Susanzer gives Williams a stand out of the key-performance. <br /> <br /> What about celebrities and fans? Is the closest parania an associate with others and why is it almost ideal? <br /> <br /> In the recent Derang fan scene, based on the real facts, Williams has acted as a talk-radio personality not Gabriel No, who read stories written on the airways and collected an interesting fan Pete Logand (Kalkin) In the form of a little boy who submitted a manuscript about Travels Travels Travel Nobody gives the editor Ashray (Morton) to read for himself. <br /> <br /> Some people were naturally annoyed but eventually Peat surprised the unexpected existence of kidnappings and sexual abuse, finally he was rescued by a nurse named Donna, but his letters with him reveal that Pete Eds Are dying Naturally nobody wants to meet the fans, but their sudden intelligent intelligentsia is suddenly suspected when planting is planted by his boyfriend Jess (Kanaval), who has suddenly departed from the New York City apartment, Donna and some investigations into Pitt's background Decided when he discovered some truth Not what he did not expect. <br /> <br /> Some of the Hitachian moments that are based on Arcted Mupin's former lover Terry Anderson and the film's new director, Stalin) and a real story about a fan hack that jumped completely like an old fashioned pot-boiler. It believes Williams gives a stand-out, low-key effect like a convincing heartwarming personality, which in fact believes his number one fan is really real and loves him (this is one thing that has escaped from his own reality). And there is a bit of uncertain horror moments with strange kalelets, which I would leave unknowingly, but reflect the frustration of the character that can push you to the root. <br /> <br /> The film goes out of gas and finally, despite the tightly defined pieces of Statenor's Hoodwich and mystery, it becomes somewhat repetitive and predictable, it carries your own inner voice to listen: Be careful for what you expect.
