Finally - I finally got it round and Pakeezah managed to see a "clean" copy! Till now, I stopped Dubai TV in just 90 minutes, the frustrating English subtitles, the Dijing Weekscreen coverage, and the Zarqi version of a magical scratcher of liquid with my own mind. Seeing the world of so poor (and small) copies of the world, I thought that the honest person was more valuable than the wait and more than 140 minutes of joy. <br /> <br /> This beautiful Meena Kumari movie starts to end and I believe that her plan was since 1958, finally it was realized in 1971. Eventually longtime alcoholic Madina killed him later and in fact he was very ill, something in the scene in Pakeezah, needed a body double. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The world is represented by the one which was once common in India. This is a striking and colorful film that is an easy uninterrupted epic message, an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow felt together. But to me it is wonderful Lata Mangeshkar - especially Thaare Rahio - and this part is part of the story that makes this film extraordinary, in which Golam Mohammad's musicless gold song I've rarely heard such serious, beautiful, poetic, amazing songs and singed a movie soundtrack. Singin 'rain may be my favorite musical film, but Pakeezah has my favorite music - yet Lata said that the song itself meant nothing special to her. The only regret is that Mohammad Rafi was the only unique song, although there was a classic duet with a lottery. For all these reasons, but as a result of this, Pikajah is my favorite Indian film, when the western part of India was involved in dynamism and when Western values ​​were seen to be sponsored and it was seen and seen now. De rigueur Before dropping everyone for dropping machines, Bollywood bits and breakers, look at Pikazeah at least for any taste of Indian "pop" music.
