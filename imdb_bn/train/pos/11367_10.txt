Warning: There may be spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie 3 times and I always liked it. If it is seen again, I always remind how good it is. An HBO TV movie - it's done very well like most of the movies - it has received Oscar, for its show, it has been released for its general distribution instead of TV. <br /> <br /> I'm sure someone knows how to read another review here, this serial killer, the story of Andr√© Chicatillo. In the former Soviet Union he killed 56 people for 8 years. (3 were buried and could not be found, so he convicted 52 of his 53 murders.) The story gave more attention to the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played the fullness of Stephen Rey. Despite excessive obstacles by party hacks, it is essential for a person to be persecuted and terrified in search of this murderer, to ensure his part. There is a very sensitive view at the end of the film, how it is mentioned in America, due to the constant stress and frustration of investigators, serial killer cases are closed after 18 months. According to this act, Burakov worked for 5 years before getting his first break. He followed the case of his conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, Donald Switterland, directed by his superior, General Fetisov, actually praised him for his dedication and apologized for the fact that he should give him a break as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Ray's performance is so good, he is not obnoxious, does not chew visibility or performs any work that portrays a person who is cruel to the killer. He is emotional person, but in the same way it is not shown in the same way which is usually portrayed in detective films. There may be occasional boring things that may occur after being silently quiet, may have stood in such situation. Rea works a lot with her face, her eyes, she does not have to overact. He only * - * became frustrated after his character, so long, at one stage, driven by disappointment, he actually said that he wanted 3 more than once in a year. Of course it means that he does not want to kill more people, he just wants some sources to catch this guy. Rea makes us think for these people. He understood us, but a glimpse of how to live with such horror and futility. <br /> <br /> A mutant wants to be sure, that Chikitelay's childhood creates a "monster". The character of Chiktilo is very well done by Jeffrey Demon. He somehow (it may seem impossible) sympathy for himself elicits some modicum. Perhaps he became the worst among us? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He seems to be a naughty spiritual official, which does not appear to be more interested in investigations than anyone blocking the Booker. But eventually he became more than just a helper, he actually actively participated in helping Burakov. The psychologists have been brought to the profile for help as they are very good for Maxsoon Sido, and the kind of idiocy they are looking for is coming out. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is a mortal, diverse and violent story, it is more about what it takes to catch the murderer than the murderer. A pretty well done movie with fine performance and a great play around. The player plays the plumbing to do the best job of this type of movie: Give real events and keep them meaningful in a dramatic framework that you think * people * know the information. <br /> <br /> 9 10 they out
