This film is one of my favorite foreign movies, as some other amelities and dogs of my life. Similar to these movies with such a big foreign movie, it takes a huge part of life and it transforms into a deep heartfelt lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man who is indifferent to his old life and his married life animal, he saw a beautiful Japanese woman showing a dance studio window. To pass her train early, she is enthralled by her. But only by its beauty, by its vision, or a connection that they both will discover? <br /> <br /> Do we have to deal with the painful realities by removing the extraordinary character of dance that crosses the world of dance. The traditional mold and stereo type of Japanese society are risky for happiness and it is not too far away. It is a movie that is very magical and meaningful and crosses the hypocrite, revealing the true magic and fascinating life itself.
