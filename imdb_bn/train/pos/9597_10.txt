This is definitely a documentary movie for anyone who is afraid that modern youth has lost the taste of real life courage and morality. Darius Ghost West is an extraordinary roller-coaster in a story. When we started our journey to life, we lived in Darius and the crew. Darius's Dissheni Massacular Dystrophy, a disease that affects all the muscles in her body. She is limited to a wheelchair, and needs attention to watch the clock. So, can this crew of young friends perhaps take a round-trip of 6,000 miles back to the West Coast? Watch the movie and enjoy the ups and downs of this great courage - laughing the crew and crying with curiosity as they face unexpected challenges on the road and when they arrive in their home town three weeks later, they enjoy happy receptions. And some great surprises!
