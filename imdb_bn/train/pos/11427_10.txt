I like this picture because in my mind it seemed that I lived a fabulous life of 50 in French colonial Africa (any way of my "generation") anyway. But I was really enraptured by her quiet pacing and by the glorious end. In the last 5 minutes of this movie, you have to focus on what's happening. I have never been more impressed with the "wrap-up" of a film. I'm shouting "Wow!" When I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the sofa !!
