"Baron Monkeys" got all the elements from Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a continuous rhythm, cute sometimes shocking dialogue. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. This was the first movie of "Baron Monkeys" where Bruce Willis turned back from the character he used in his earlier films. Here, a satirical and hopeless character that you can call a prisoner as a nickname, was taken from a fearless and unknown hero (this was the case of "hard mice"). No matter how he tries, he is a prisoner at the time. The movie also has an exciting ending. It has a real dramatic power. But this horror film is a reflection of humans, fears danger (notably, which can be the end of the world and here, these are the viruses that can cause illness). It does not matter how long it will take, the "twelve monkeys" will be estimated in its true value: one of the greatest works in the nineties.
