While feeling the emotional youth during the first time in a gundam wing series, I reconsider my belief to show again that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, bulldog design, character design, and depth of character are skillfully accomplished. Though for the first time the boys appear like a band, the stylistic attraction of letters can only be submitted to great art, personal personality creates clear and respectable differences between the characters. As a result, it is very easy to drag in a particular character. Personally, I liked the heroes due to its stoic personality. Although my childhood may be biased with a emotional attachment to this show, I would say that while giving the operational battles in the Gangetic Wing Large Robot Case, deep questions about war and life (how can we achieve peace?), Which at least say, is excellent.
