It's not like other movies about dancing. Some ordinary people did not find themselves from dancing. Unlike Hollywood movies, the film's character is not handsome or hot. Anyone that they can see in your office every day. They are depressed about some of their life and eventually find themselves and their dreams from dance. This is very touching to me.
