Enjoyable Movies Although I think it was more likely to be deeper, it was even deeper. To find out why Eli is such a ridicule, it is about half a mystery through the film Then, finally when we gave an explanation back to her childhood there are still not many details. Perhaps they showed flashbacks or something. However, it is still a good movie which I would like to see again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
