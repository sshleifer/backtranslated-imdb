My assessment: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I like this movie a lot. Compare to today's stupid film (just new to step and special effects and ideas), "Soilant Green" asks something that does not exist anymore: Think. <br /> <br /> It will not be big, people are created with the human body, a day of "cookie" is a surprise surprise. This kind of future is possible, with what is happening on this planet and how people are so indifferent to it. <br /> <br /> Of course this movie takes some years but the idea behind the film is real again. Rich in Paradise, the other of hell Today, they want good luck like "reality show", like TV and movie. <br /> <br /> The TV is a good wash-out brain. It is tragic to see humanity not progressing like intelligence technology. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like the reality, this movie is not for you. If you believe all politicians are the same. If you do not want to ask questions about yourself now and future, do not watch this movie well.
