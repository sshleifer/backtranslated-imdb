This always hands down the greatest stand up show. I've seen many stand up shows, many stand-up shows and see Bates Comic view, but I've never seen anyone on the show with the debilitating skills on this show. The impression is excellent, the skits are great, and the perfect time. You can even say that even the crowd gets really caught After a few years, he made Raw Raw when it was really good, but it was in my book # 1. Also at one time, especially from the middle of the middle-eight, that Murphy was fun. My favorite part of the show is when he is family barbecue and "ice cream !!! !!! Mummma .. ice cream people are coming !!!!" Another great part of his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
