This movie hit me as a project that had many correct elements, but they did not come together anywhere. I do not know who made it, but it's a little Disney-eski. Although its parts are unlikely (such as being performed for a pre-teen public office) and avoid taking the story seriously, there is a healthy dose of normality to keep things balanced and perspective. Acting is okay. Curiously, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is believable, but the relationship between Hejel and Frankie is a little ... off. Ballot and baseball: It is interesting to see how to work hard to keep balance between his best friend, grandmother and his two feelings. Seeing himself as a baseball player, Frankie was very painful to try to hold a group of boys, but it is a good thing to show that the struggle she faced. I read somewhere that he is not actually balerina, but editing this photo makes his dance face natural but beautiful. Overall, it was a good film about integrity and ambition, but its star Miss Cha Burton did not achieve the reality that we saw in the "Lawn Dogs", "Lost Dealerius", and its small but disappointing performance performance.
