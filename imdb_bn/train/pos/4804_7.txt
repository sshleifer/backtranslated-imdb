I have seen this movie several times on the DVD, for the first time, I saw the second half after the hour and then went back in the first hour. A great entertainment movie, it's a nighttime thank you to God, refreshing it, and it gives us a truly insight into the difficult life of Queen Victoria and her difficult choices. There is nothing bad about filming, bad bad language or something of a sexual nature that is objectionable to the family. Probably the kids can do a little research on Queen Victoria and possibly study less familiar characters such as Chemo and Lord Melbourne
