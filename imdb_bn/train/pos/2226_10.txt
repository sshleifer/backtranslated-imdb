I am surprised at the low rating of this photo IMDB. With all due respect, its low rating represents the IQ level, which is so poor. They would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, a big budget, and more gore. <br /> <br /> The first misconception by humans is that it is a horror film. It is not, or the film confuses you by believing it is one. This is a mental thriller. For those who really want an intellectual experience while watching a movie it is. The perfect example of how Reel.com reviews me about this movie. All other negative reviews do not have much knowledge It's almost trying to make a real movie for change - these days are very rare - it's a bit bad and it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not understand. Martha was joking herself in the brain and was experimenting herself on being a caring mother, even though she was actually a bad Nazi who killed without warning. Evidence is all about pudding and it really is seen that we are sympathetic to this cold blooded giant for the duration of the film, it is a rule of instruction and writing of the film. <br /> <br /> I must feel that this film must be rated at least in the sixth grade of originality. I recommend this movie to people on the other side of the IQ scale - the smart people - because this movie is clearly seen by the nightmares of Scrum or Freddie who are puppies. <br /> <br /> To act as a cudo, For so little budget movies, you've been surprised that this movie did not hit your local movie with great direction, writing and acting. Please do not fool by rating by IMDb. This movie is valuable to it. I really recommend buying this movie since watching the first scene for rent, this will not do justice.
