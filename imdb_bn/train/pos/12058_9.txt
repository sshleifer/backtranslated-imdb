Speakcular movie that will cool you down after sitting with you. The atmosphere is very awesome and stylish, the score is cool, but its performance is about the best about the movie. Due to performance, fear is very rare and the strong performance of this film plays an important role due to horrific reasons. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minute. Although the black black girl does not have much screen time, she creates the necessary appearances for cooling the audience in some spectacular scenes. The dialogues are very descriptive and work your imagination and when it becomes really scary. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, then watch it in the theater. This is a completely different experience but scary as this movie. <br /> <br /> It is one of the best Ghost movies and it is directed that people want to get scared.
