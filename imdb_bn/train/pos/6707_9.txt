I know it's really really corny ... but the acting is amazing and as tricky as a button in the heart of Melissa Juan. I love this show a lot, and I'm almost embarrassed that I have a representative of the BO / C show. Being really corny, but it makes me feel better. My only problem is that sometimes it can be a very low budget - sometimes the actors change and you just have to deal with it ... like Sabrina's father's movie course, two different boys ... I mean, they can Or just say he was an uncle or something? Yet, I love this show but can not help. Harvey and Sabrina really make a beautiful couple and Salim is absolutely sunny. I definitely recommend to look a bit lighter and fun ... my favorite episode "Pancake Madness" ... is a great episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I really do not have some fan in seventh season twists ... Once you get to college, join Morgan Group and its dialogue is painful and very bad ... plus he is ugly, so how can he survive outside of his good looks The joke about me is lost on me ... but I think it was really good in eight seasons and I was really canceling one of my favorite shows.!
