"Dar Tudcasting" is not exactly the kind of film that makes you happy? Zurger is the second-largest religion in a row, which is actually much better than the infamous "nicotine", exists in seven small episodes ?? For every day of the week ?? The unrelenting human suicide is rolling. In this already very annoying episode, Butgereit inserted a really serious decomposing male corpses really horrible images. Episodes are not all equally strong, but, as a great, "der Todesink" is a very high place in the list of the most depressed art-house movies of all time. Especially in Wednesday's episodes, a person explains his sexual disappointment to the total strangers in Park and is extremely intense and devastating to involve in Sunday's involvement with a person focusing on sexual intercourse with a deceased person. The value added to this movie or any other sequel is controversial and I am not sure whether there is any kind of message to communicate here in the budget. An ugly chain letter is vaguely mentioned which encourages readers to commit suicide, but in most cases we are not aware of these people's motivation to end this life dramatically. Unlike perfectly I expected, "Der Todesking" is not arousing or repulsively graphic! In fact, in fact, I could never have expected that the borridge would be so fine and thoughtful about the painting of pure human suffering. Thursday's episode is a perfect example of this, because it shows a stylish look at various aspects of a famous German bridge, although names, ages, and occupations of people are displayed on the screen. Production prices are poor and poorly educated often lacks professionalism, but it does not actually count in such movies. Force the matter and force us to feel less joyful ?? But essential ?? Direction of life Very mock music, great use!
