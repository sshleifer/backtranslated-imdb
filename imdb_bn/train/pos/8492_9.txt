Gong Ho is a movie which I have never been tired of. Michael Keaton was always my favorite, and he is absolutely ridiculous in this movie. Step-by-step walkthrough in the step-by-step! Both of them work nicely together. Although this movie is a comedy, I like how Hunt (Keaton) and Kajihiro (Watanabe) show their struggle for their role as leaders of their respective teams. They both try hard for peace, and then finally they get a fight (which watch to look obnoxious). First, they both floors Then Hunt jumps on a chair. Jump on Kazihiro's desk. Hunt jumps on the desk with her. Then came out of the factory from the office. I love that when they are separated from the workers, you can say that they feel sad to get out of both things. Also, there is a scene where you can see Hunt's influence in Kantihiro. He is in his house and his boss of Japan has arrived and says he wants to go to the factory tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Do ​​not have a good day tomorrow. Sakamoto: Why not? Qaziriro: The factory is closed and we can not find it. <br /> <br /> Tell me, do not tell Michael Keaton anything! <br /> <br /> I think I really like this movie because it is really fun, and it also shows how different people can learn from each other, but rather a good friend.
