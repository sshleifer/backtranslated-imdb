This is one of the 80 best movies! It's a "turd in the punchbowl" stick like !! I can not believe in Mad Magazine condemning it or whatever. And yet, they proudly named their names on a show with "Stuart", "I-Spie-a-No-Hils Chinese Girl" and "UPS Guy at Speed". What's that with? And, I love Ron Libman - he's Fox! Why was his name removed from credit? I had that his funny role. Of course, he was not as foxy as Norma Rae was about. But, in my opinion, this film is well with the National Lampoon vacation. If you like movie like Cocktail, Fast Times, Last American Virgin, or any other Adolescence 80 movie, you would love it !! Rent it and what you mean I will see !!
