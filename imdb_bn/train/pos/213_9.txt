Walter Matthews and George Burns are a famous Bowie act, Ludwig and Clark, who have not spoken for more than 10 years. Bern retired and Matthau personally took it and since there has been an annoyance. This delightful Neil Simon game premiere made in such a movie. Of course, it makes so much better that it is between Matthew and Burns in their Prime Minister, and more fun than today's material. Richard Benjamin Matthur shines as the nephew and agent. Even the old clips of the genre of the golden era, you get to the cinema, and character actor Fritz Fald starts with a "pop". Rosetta LaNoire, who at the age of 30 started with Theater in Ososon Wells and later was a grandmother in "Family Affairs", she was great in small roles. <br /> <br /> <br /> The only problem was with me (and perhaps I'm very fond of and / or serious) for the first time when Matthu behaved with Barnes. Imagine, he has expressed great annoyance in all these years, but regardless of what he or she does, it will be considered as oppressed or simply bad behavior. Also, I see Matthew playing in other movies, but not with George Burns. And, Matsusho's boring is going to be a bit old. <br /> <br /> If everyone needs a series of funny movies to forget and forget your problem, enter "The Sunshine Boys". They will lift your spirits and think of you a simple time and way of living. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to slide it." <br /> <br /> <br /> "Wait, wait, you think you have to slide it."
