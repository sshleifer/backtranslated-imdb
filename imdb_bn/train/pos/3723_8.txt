There is an inexperienced appetite for "basic training" movies, so it is not surprising that the first one got very little notice after it was released. Looks like there might be a better-qualified second life in the DVD / VHS. <br /> <br /> Tygerland is not uncommon in any way, with some horribly described characters (especially the NCO's illustration, makes you long for the return of 'flower metal jacket' Ermey's back) but Colin Farrell's main performance is the instant stardom's Element. Karisma burns and will be killed in an role to get any actor.
