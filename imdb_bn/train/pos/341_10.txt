I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again as it was again. Cast was excellent, the plot was suspenseful and entertaining, and it was an overall enjoyable movie! This rate will be one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! It was really cute among the girls, especially Dennis Richards. He was serving too throughout the movie and gave some OOMPH to his character!
