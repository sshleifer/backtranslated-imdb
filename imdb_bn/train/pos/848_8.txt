The twist of "Matador" comes almost halfway through the movie when Deny is an unwanted person sitting in the verandah of Danny Mexico City Hotel and enjoying the quiet moments. Some hit him on the door, and Jallian was informed that he was a murderer, he refused to answer. But what is he really? <br /> <br /> "The Matador" director Richard Shepherd has presented us with a character, Julian Noble, who does not see any valuable quality. Actually, we've already seen him act, he's doing what is good. Camilo Ci√±o of Real Madrid, when she meets Julian Danny in the porch of Real Real, spreads the beans and tells her new acquaintance what she really is doing for the living. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A Mexican company, but seems to be competing against the local team in front of the agreement. Danny is a clever man who is hunted by charisma and elegance by skilled Julian. A few days later, on the cold winter night, the murderer asked his friend to return to his friend at Danny's door and take him to Tuscany's visit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the correct impression about the boot and its character with its boots in the Hotel Speedo Hotel. Gives. On the other hand, Greg Kinna plays a direct part of this strange couple. Hope Davis will send both of us away, because he was no longer alive? Philippe Becker shows the look of Julian and his appointment. <br /> <br /> Richard Shepherd works with his own material and gives instructions through style. Musical score roll covers and everything from David Tattersall's shiny cinematography increases.
