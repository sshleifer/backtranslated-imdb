I must say that the cinematography was amazing, the frames near to maturity, and the way it made an excitement in anything, more horrible than the bore. <br /> <br /> Two narrators about this image, one appeared, one invisible. They are trying to explain a significant reference to both of the paintings which have created a scandal for a long time. The film is all about explanation of theories and opinions, but I must say the conclusion is very disappointing. Certainly this is a movie more than a 171 vote. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Excellent direction! I want to say a lot better than the poem's blood, it reminds me of some strange reason. <br /> <br /> I think you can call it through the word "arts". It was a lot of professional talk about many theories and stunning visual effects but the crew and Rouse had to pull it off. At least for me An amazing film.
