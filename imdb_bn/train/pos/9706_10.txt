The League of Gentleman is one of the most fun, weird, dark and most unforgettable comedy of our time. So many, it has made way for more jokes, many of which have copied styles, but never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Like all other sketch shows, the characters of the League of Gentlemen are all loosely connected. First of all, they live in the fictional town of Reynolds Vassi, outside of North England. <br /> <br /> The first characters to greet the newcomers are Tibbas and Edvard, the owner of the dry mouth of a local local store, probably most of the residents probably do not know about its existence. Other curiosities include: Denton family, hygiene, disorder and disguise with the vessel; Hilary Briss sells a special but grateful unknown brand of meat; Polin, a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharp pen; Mr. Sugary, hearty vet and danger for all things around! Geoff tips, plastic salesmen, including humorous ideas, often involving guns, electric tubes and so on. . . . . . . Plum !!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, there are many horrific references like the disappearance of the hiccups, the silent pair pairs, the owner of an inefficient circus and the sudden outbreak of the nakabalades. The series gets even more colorful and extra characters such as polyline and geofe are more sympathetic, and more interesting are the ones shown in weak light. Film adaptation is its best show, but some fans may decide that they are local <br /> <br /> Instead of paying attention to each letter in each episode, the underlying third series also takes a different route. Leading tale of a conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theater company van. While most fans can not enjoy the first version of the film or the third series, they must be aware of how innovative League of Gentlemen can be and how surprised they are to explore new areas are definitely remarkable. <br /> <br /> In short, Gentlemen's League is clearly considered to be an appearance, as welcomed: you will never leave!
