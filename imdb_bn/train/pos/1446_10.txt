Has Al Pasino ever been a bad movie? Its name seems an imprimatur for the top notch movie. It is a good performance as he is ever given. Passino is an American Olivier. And it's a political thriller as they get as well. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But its running people think that the system has inexperienced effects on it. Passino's acting is not only compelling --- the dead child's funeral has a lot of miraculous power - this film is a quick, radioactive reality that increases the performance of the hostess without being hostage. This outstanding portrait of big city politics shows a lot of hottie movies for two hours without unnecessary violence, warm sex or vocal language. There are murders. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A movie like this restores my awake belief in Hollywood. I do not have many ten rewards. This one wants it rich!
