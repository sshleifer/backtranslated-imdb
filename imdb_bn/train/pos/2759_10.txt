There were tears in my eyes while watching a movie. And when I really shouted it was the only time and when I saw this movie. There are some specs in this movie but I do not really care about it. I had to write this even I had some time to cry and I saw it. It has been played perfectly and all the production values ​​are good, but what is really important is that simple and wonderful message. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing in life that really is love in all its forms. Whenever we love we are really alive. How do I feel the sound I know sound and I promise I usually do that like that. I'm pretty curious. This film has brought me both sad feelings of sadness and happiness compared to any other film, and probably it will always be the first movie I recommend to others.
