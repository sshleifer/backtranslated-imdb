I thought it was extremely shiny film. I was very satisfied with it and could not really ask for more '. I'm actually the owner of this movie because I did not give it back to anyone ... which I have to do, but I really want to enjoy it. Also, I'm not the owner of many foreign films and this is the first. Now, I personally love Finnish stuff, what I've been enjoying has been clearly added. But overall, watching its value However, if you do not fully understand Finnish or try to read subtitles, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 Definitely.
