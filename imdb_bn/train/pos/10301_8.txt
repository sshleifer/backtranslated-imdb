Bruce Almighty, one of the best pictures of the carrier ... well ... many days. It's been one of the funny scenes I've seen for a long time ... Morgan Freeman is surprisingly funny that some Jockeys are good and even playing chips. It's one or two romantic moments which are a bit annoying but there's a great movie with some fun scenery. The best scene, where Jim Anchor is embracing the voice of the person. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
