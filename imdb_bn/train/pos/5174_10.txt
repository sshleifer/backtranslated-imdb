I swear I can see this movie every weekend and I will never be sick! Every aspect of the human emotion is caught by acting, script, direction, and the general feeling of this film. It has been a long time since I saw a movie that actually mocked me with smiles, reflected from sadness, and felt every feeling that comes from this favorable job! We need more movies like this !!! Mike Binder: Are you listening ???
