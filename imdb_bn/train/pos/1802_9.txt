All right, I saw this movie as a child and really like it. My parents never bought a movie for me, but I think I'll buy it now. I'm a sucker for pre-2000 animated films. However, onto the actual review. <br /> <br /> I like what I have seen in animated movies: the real screenplay of heaven and hell. Character development exist! It is easy to categorize the characters of this film (i.e. Charlie selfish meats, itchy is shameful but Charlie believes that Corfaces are clearly shameless, etc.). I like King Gator's music. I've always liked loud, annoying, flamboyant guys. This song may be random, but it was so funny. Finally, the animation details were beautiful. You can tell Charlie that all the chic and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful. <br /> <br /> What I did not like: The real screenplay of Heaven: Charlie responds like this, "There is no surprise" It seems to be very annoying. He denied a place in heaven and finally got to get it back. I think a few lines of some songs like "... you can not put a good dog down", "... let's make music forever", and "... welcome to be dead" but I can not think most of them feel majority Keep in mind The songs were not that interesting, to be honest. Hippet Angel: He's annoying and that NECK! AUGH! <br /> <br /> What parents can not like: Some scary pictures (depending on the audience) are shown during movie time. Carface is quite a threat. Beer are also implied, but do not actually dive beer. Gambling is the main element of a movie. Good people die <br /> <br /> Overall: I love this movie, even if it sometimes forgets a bit. Scarier children's animations are always my favorite ones. It was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to worry a little longer for the kids. Nowadays, this is probably rated PG. It should not be seen in children aged 8 years (or easily disturbed children). Even more, I give it 9/10. <br /> <br /> Good luck!
