"Bourne Ultimatum" vaguely starts Mid-Pace and Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely fantastic), CIA as a perfect killer by tracking the mastermind behind the black-ops. To know his real identity. Adding a devastating ice stove to David Strathrean as "screen saver" for regular regular cast with Joan Allen (extraordinary) and Julia Styles (existential). <br /> <br /> In the second entree series, I wish Paul Greengrass' shaky hand held camera will go at least static for the desired few minutes. However, it is said, it is a perfect way of catching fictional, clustrophobic feelings of frequent hand-twisted scenes and works well in Chase Scenes, which often accompanies bigger cars and legs on the roof. Up The interesting part of the Bourne series is the constant of technology and communication and hippolation that denies the laws of physics and current power. Bourne films are somewhat thrifty hyper-realities which are full of technical-based magic. Everyone does not seem right at the right time, but these are not intelligent, but if there is no explosion to see it there, I will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In the absence of emotic and Franka Patent, the writer tries to create some emotional relationships between the Damon and Styles, but he lets such an actress face so much that it never leads in any direction. Nevertheless, it can be forgiven for "identity" and "proletariat", this "ultimatum" expresses all, and we finally learn the truth about the past in Bourne. It's a delightful and satisfying conclusion for the series, and if they have any good ideas, and Damon gets his desire, it will be the end result.
