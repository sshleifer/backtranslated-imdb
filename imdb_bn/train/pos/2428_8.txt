As an old white housewife I can still appreciate that Lawrence Fishburne is one of our best actors. Anyone who appreciates his work like a deep cover can enjoy watching the actor's incredible acting range. Since I think it is its director, it can prove to be even more interesting. All acting is pretty good. If you can not take the reality of Manhattan's junky world or criminal life (achievement-level shooting-up-ups), then it's not a movie that you enjoy. This is the natural contribution of Mr. Fishburn to an incredibly fine relationship. I love seeing Larry and Anthony Hopkins going to each other in a movie.
