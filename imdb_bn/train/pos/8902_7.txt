I'd imagine that Steve McQueen would know that he would become an icon and start the "Watts: Dead of Aew" in the same year, the film came out, or he would have been in the great Seven two years later, but he could not. But he did, and we are rich for it. <br /> <br /> It is definitely a camp classic. Losing the understanding of the theater's drive It's funny and nostalgic <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was interesting that the last line of the film was: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped it. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic remains cold. <br /> <br /> They never imagined that Arctic would be neat 52 years ago. Blob will be back soon.
