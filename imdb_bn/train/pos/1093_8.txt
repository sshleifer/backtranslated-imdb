I always enjoy this movie while on TV. <br /> <br /> A scene that is always standing, for me it is a mirror freshener and a painter with a decree, where he gives him very clear instructions and as soon as he goes away, his sons turn around and say, "You What has it got, yellow, blue, green and white "
