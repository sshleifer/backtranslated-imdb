All these negative comments related to star flick were difficult to believe me. I smiled through the whole picture, as my whole family did. The film defines itself as gangster comedy in the past - the players were violent - I had the old time when I said this. Surely Goldbull and Dreyfas were great - and that's all the sisters, two of Falco, and the world's divine music. Rob Reyner has created a great smiling limo driver, and Gabriel Baron is a ridiculous neurotic. Not to mention the names of Gregory Hines, Bart Reynolds, Sleep Joe Character and the entire Death and Grave Digger. Paul Unka was his usual entertaining voice, Baron was associated with the attraction associated with running his fear of making a couple of "My Way" welcome home for his performance. <br /> <br /> I had a ridiculous respect for this opinion Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfus imitated him well. I also say this opinion that at no age will anyone think of imitation of the work done in this film - this is a joke - not a terrible "Gangsta" movie. Cars and clothing were impressive, "Vix Place" <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would recommend an evening video to family entertainment.
