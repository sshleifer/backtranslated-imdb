Lars von Tears's Europa II Third Man's reflections, America is coming after a second American war and feels himself involved in a dangerous mystery. <br /> <br /> Jean-Mark repeatedly refused to join the American army during the German-American War in the Battle of the German-American War, as soon as the war, as the sleeping car conductor on the Jantrava Railway, the war broke out and reached Frankfurt. Did not he know that the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group, called Warriors, who targeted American allies. Leopold is firm against firmly taking any side, but it is pulled and seduced by Katharina Hartman (Barbara Sukowa), owner of railway company, femme fatale girl. Her father was a Nazi sympathizer, but American Colonel Harris (Eddie Concident) apologized to her because she can help the German transport system to re-start and move back. Soon, Colonel Lloydd seems to be spying (without giving him any choice or opportunity) to see if Vermuvolv can attack the train. <br /> <br /> Soon, Leopold is stuck in an adventure by engaging in both mysterious and film-silent way, where everyone and everything does not seem to be. It finally takes warm and ridiculous and fierce before its amazing control to see the stupid Leopold deal with everything (its lover, the terrorist, the colonel, the annoying passenger, his disgruntled uncle, or even rail company officials who come to check the policy of his work). The picture is not always unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The film shoots gently, it always decreases in the winter in winter. His shot of black and white with randomly displayed color shots throughout. Also, background screens display images that work with photos in front. Add a hypnotic description of Max Von Sydow, and the euro has also become a dream place outside of this world. <br /> <br /> This is my private personal favorite movie now.
