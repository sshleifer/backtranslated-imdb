William Methrosimon's play is based on the reviving drama, his stage, in which Farah Fossette starred Marzorie, rapist Joe (James Russo) attacked his car. She managed to get away but the police told him that they could do nothing. He understands, however, Joe got his belt and he knows where he lives. When her housemaid Pat (Alfred Wuddard) and Terry (Diana Scurvy) stopped working, Joe gave her a visit to finish what she started. Joe insulted him and reduced him in different ways, got a chance to return to him and arrest him. He knew about the situation in his situation "and his technically against any other rape", he had no intention of accepting it easily until his pat and tari accepted his intentions. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> As it is, Marguerite demonstrates such cruelty that if someone does not become dishonored by her generosity, then she should be surprised. Fousset works a credible enough, when Russo is really cool as a unused crop, who does his best to use the situation. For most running periods, with only two characters on the screen, the film has a close nature that suggests it will work better on the stage. Director Robert M. Young humiliated and not ashamed away from the more drying elements of the situation; The clock at the film became uncomfortable. And by holding the upper hand of Margie, things change quite so that it is not so easy to encourage them to go to blood, and one hopes that Pat will point them out. <br /> <br /> "Extremities", I felt, is an excellent good movie that maintains at least interest and a fairly high level intensity. Suffering both for both Wood and Scorpio (Scarwid is a great moment in which Terry describes himself as a victim of rape), and motion consistency. Approved, the conversation is not always very intense, but the element is compelling each step. <br /> <br /> 8/10
