20 out of 10 This is a really wonderful surprise story about Tom Woollie, a wrestling dispatch and a masterpiece. The boy (William Beck) drowned with Tom and it is immediately obvious that he had serious problems when he blew his bed the first night. William is illiterate and frightened but somehow solace out of each other's loneliness. He has a talent as an artist of William and we have seen this as a choirmaster, as a genius of Tom in an entertaining presentation in Jerusalem. William's friendship with a young Jewish son, Jakaria Wrench, in London, as well as both Tom and Zechariah, he has finally learned to read and write and to feel part of this small bracketed society. Just as he is living permanently, William is brought back to his mother in London, and here we see why he has become so bad. His mother is clearly mentally ill and when he does not hear from Tom William, he travels to London to look for him. Eventually, he held the sister of the dead where he was sitting in a house. After a period of time in the hospital, Tom realized that he had to be kidnapped and had to take him with him. William was told that he would be taken by Tom, as well as his best friend, Zakaria, in the air strikes in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes was when talking to an officer from Tom Home Office. <br /> <br /> I love 'I,' to love it, I think he loves me too. <br /> <br /> Is not it good that it does?
