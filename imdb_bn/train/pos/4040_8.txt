An inventive, suspenseful exercise in clustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that sets a solid challenge sets it completely in two rooms. Not completely successful, but tension, wonderful and well-played. Someone might find the memorable image of SaW ?? Two men are trapped in the cell and are pushing against one another? But in contrast to that movie, it bravely kept her firmly and hacks her cell across the whole film. It's like watching an exam test. Some might find the underlying underlying tedious, but this reviewer found it enthralling. The words and imagery of the film are well-understood. It is definitely a good film to show good home video system. A late night is right for the movie festival, right panoid mood. It must definitely keep me awake at night.
