A few years ago Sundance Channel saw this several times and got a nice cinematic jolt for the system. A semi-spiritual yet tough edge focuses primarily on modern-day media culture (or its lack of attention) to the residents of the Hello-Freijs. It was a fun early action from Mark Raffalo and some memorable cinematography from the DP who ran Polish Brothers films. A savage umcompromising humor and it was a strange original feeling that definitely sets it apart. This movie was classic classic written in it and I am surprised that it is not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> Hopefully soon
