Swap Strengler was made by a low budget studio PRC and of course I am one of their best movies. <br /> <br /> A man was hanged for murder, he did not return as a ghost who accused him of retaliation. He used a rope to disturb his victims, and after several deaths, the old man who manages ferries across the swim, disappeared. The grandchildren of the old man themselves took the boat and fell in love with the local people and they decided to get married. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of foggy atmosphere, which makes it very scary. <br /> <br /> Includes Rosemary La Plans, Black Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Strangler in Cast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: Half of the stars in 5.
