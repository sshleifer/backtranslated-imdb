I read many comments about criticizing the blog for chit and camping on this blog. Amateur played and blamed the movie for the weak special effects. The locals produced (Valley Force PA) produced less budget than the Christian Shorts, whose only experience was, what folks would expect from a group of people. Tell me the critics of the critics that this film has never taken it seriously. This fact should be clear from the theme music combined with stupid songs played with unfavorable credits. For what it is meant to be, this film is excellent. In the recent little budget effort, I saw a few, Blair Witch Project was one of them, there was no entertainment value or intelligent thinking behind their plot. BWP was pure emission. On the other hand, Blob was good thoughts, good scripts, and thoroughly entertaining. The scene where the old man comes across a tattoo and puts the sticks in the sticks, is a nice and truly unclear. When the doctor's office scene with Blab slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney it was a cinematic horror masterpiece of old people. Bottom line, I love this movie. I challenge anyone to take $ 120,000.00, today's dollar value, and make a movie as successful as Blob or as successful. It just can not be done. Duration! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
