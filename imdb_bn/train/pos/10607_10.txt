Henry Thomas was "great". His character held my attention. I was in a story that I forgot that it was not real. I wanted to hold her child and saw that she was a special person. Other people in the story were essential for the makeup of his character. The way they were tied together to help each other was really awesome. I love movies that show the real emotion of the person without hurting the head, so that you are not smart enough to find things for yourself.
