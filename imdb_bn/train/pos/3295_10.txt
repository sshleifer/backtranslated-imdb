A picture of beauty which is difficult to describe. Perhaps it is absurd to be absurd, or it is a straightforward soundtrack, or it is only the foot of Mina Mumar, but it is also the joy of seeing this movie again. I have never seen an Indian film that comes to him, and the competitor of any country is competing with his perfection.
