Well, the first one I hate to comment on, but I think I was standing for this movie. Many people got annoyed with it and I feel like people who want to see they get second opinion. <br /> <br /> First off, Bend It Like Backham is not considered as the deepest movie. Centuries If you go looking somewhere else that you are looking for. It does not mean it is an independent film because it will be the artist. It is supposed to make you feel better and you are supposed to be fun to see it and those two things are easily done. <br /> <br /> While acting, "Hal Bere in the monster ball" is still good. The film does not need to play it honestly so do not look for it. This is a family movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I think it's good and it seems entertaining to visit. This is also true for most parts of the culture, so if you want to sit down and see a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about it when it's over. If you are looking for deep thought plot lines and big dramatic scenery but this is not for you. <br /> <br /> - In the lind
