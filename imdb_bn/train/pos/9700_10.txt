Somehow, this movie is managed to be impressive, bittersweet, and palpable together. Stars like Tony Salahb (from Providence) bring stories to life. The story itself is inspirational. We see a great, up and down life through the most innocent eyes fantastic: a bird. <br /> <br /> Polly begins her life as a baby girl who gave her a parody (played by Halley Yenenberg, also known as Pepsi's daughter) with a speech impediment. Even though he learns to speak properly, so there is also a poly. However, like most birds, he can understand everything he understands and understands. The military father does not like birds, so he is sent to a fifteen shop and is bought by an old adult artist, Ivy. He teaches them modest education while traveling around the country to find a policeman. The film continues with a number of fates, until finally culminating in a polio laboratory, which is eventually housed in the basement and is found by a Russian custodian, which is touched by the bird's story. The plot is simple, with a theme of fairytale that is a gift of language and a curse. I want to say that the soundtrack is wonderful. A beautiful mix of flute, digital base, and horns enhances the film to pure exquisite. S sweeping camera angle and exciting scenery even more beautiful in the story. And, as a final comment, the doll is completely trustworthy. (Unlike Star Wars, where Yoda is a Mupp pet) This photo is one of my favorite movies, It has been added that my wonderful parakeet of four years has recently died. Overall, I have four stars of this movie ****, two thumbs up, and a big hug.
