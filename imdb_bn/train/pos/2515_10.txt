Moon Child, played Japanese Rock Hyde and Gact, then I was a good movie I expected. Actually, I was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Setup in Malaysia, the story looted street orphanage, show, Shore brother Shinji, and Toshhi group. Make a living One robbery, who is in front of the sun at sunshine, who is facing the vampires in the fire. The facts of Kei's true nature are shown, but no one will take them away. <br /> <br /> The time has passed and it implies that immortal, ever-changing people have not raised shock, and both are very close ties. Shaw and whoever comes to the son in a dirty shootout, and they quickly become friends. Both Kai and Hayd are in love with the boy, EE-Che. <br /> <br /> Once again the time has elapsed and it shows the inefficient shawl of Kai. It explains that the son and son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through tragedy after the tragedy, this movie focuses on the reality of life and friendship and love, its truths fall into it. This is a really sensitive movie which is sad but sad at the same time. <br /> <br /> For the performance, I think Gacch did a great job. Hyde did an amazing job for a first timer. <br /> <br /> The shots were beautiful, but the movie was it rare and small awesome shot. <br /> <br /> All of these, I must say this movie is amazing, moving, and I highly recommend it.
