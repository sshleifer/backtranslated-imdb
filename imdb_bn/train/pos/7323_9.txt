In 1963, at the age of sixteen in Halloween, her sister died, cruel, passionate Michael Mayer! On October 30, 1978, he escaped from the new administration of terrorism from an emotional organization and organization in the town of Hunfillde, Illinois. It is followed by his psychological (Donald Pleasence) whole time, how much he thinks of this psychological person. <br /> <br /> It opens with a bang, and set up a truly suspenseful and atmospheric cooler which actually helps motivate it to much higher slasher images. After that several films were subtle compared to the nasty bloodshed. Delicate, and scary. It has the power to jump me even after seeing it again. There are so many movies there, really, can anyone even be seen before them even afraid? Not too much. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the joy of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis became acting queen after being cast as "Halloween" in her motion picture film and in the next few slasher films, she became a queen, and was a victim of free hunting for her. <br /> <br /> Co-writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this movie, using shadows and dark skies excellent; See how most of the movie is set after the notebook. With this photo he and his ex-partner Debra Hill have created a franchisee that has created seven series, many reminder and an upcoming "re-imagination". <br /> <br /> This is very quotable - it can never be forgotten. Lumis' (Pleasence) lecture which he describes to Michael Mayer Sheriff (Charles Cipher, some reliable players in Carpenter's previous work)? <br /> <br /> This is superb and worth finding. This is my favorite John Carpenter film. <br /> <br /> This is not completely incompatible - there are script holes, after all - but overall it has a hard effect. <br /> <br /> 9/10
