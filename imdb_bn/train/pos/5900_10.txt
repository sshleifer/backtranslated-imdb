I am very sorry that this charming and lively movie (which I first saw in the first half of the first half) was welcomed more badly. In my opinion, it has been heavily embedded - but perhaps it is more appealing to American humor than Americans (for example): maybe we can understand and appreciate some of the underlying circumstances and circumstances in Europe because we have them in some real life! Special mention should be limited but good music - especially interesting and memorable songs "It's the Fine, Fine Night", which was issued separately in HMV 78Rpm records (10-inch Plam label, I think!) In half. If you get the opportunity I would request someone to be interested in trying it: You might be a beautiful surprise.
