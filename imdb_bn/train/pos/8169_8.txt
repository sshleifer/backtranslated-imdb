It is a gory mess and pretty convincecing. Corbin Burnson is a very handy illustration of the Loto Control Freak Appraisal Practiceser in this movie command. Linda Hoffman plays her cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately, for her, a little "effort" with the pool is punished with a good doctor as well as knowing - shame on that beautiful smile! The last half hour of the film is encouraged to completely defeat Barneson's character and has a spotlight for a young actress named Virginia Kehen. A highly talented actor, he hogs quickly from the moment to the closure of the brass. Nice legs, too!
