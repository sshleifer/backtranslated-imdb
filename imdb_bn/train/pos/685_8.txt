Ghost Stories, (The New House) is a horrific horror story. This is the start of the first seventeenth century in the series of Fear and the Ghost Story. The beginning and the end of each story is described by Cabot Cabot. Remember him from the Family Affair's Early Family Series in the 1960s? This special story is like the main actor Barbara Parkinson and David Barry and the main characters of the story. I recently saw it, and I was very scared! If you are alone, then I will not recommend seeing it. This story is awesome, no roar or a curse, but very scary. Barbara Perkins played young bride David Birn played her husband. Both actors were very good in their part. If you like the scary, funny, awesome ghost stories, you will love this little jewel. I gave this a high rating. I highly recommend this story
