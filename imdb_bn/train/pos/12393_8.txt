For those interested in learning how much humanity has been perfected in the big red birds, there are both "The Renaissance" shorts. I'm not sure why they are divided into two parts, especially since they are submitted as one on DVD (and these shorts look in any other format but the DVD?) But they are informative, but there are some gaps in the information they have. <br /> <br /> In addition to the second part and the rest of the animation, how this first part is actually parallel parallel between robot rebellion and civil rights. Graffiti tribute to slaves, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with the Millennium March and God-complexity of humanity with oral references. In fact, "God" is not actually referred to by these shorts, but instead replaced by "man's own image". <br /> <br /> As far as shorts goes into collection, "Second Renaissance: Part I" brought out the emotions by the most effective. This is a sad and annoying scene of humanity being "the creator of his own destruction". Some minor ideas can be conceived directly from the previously established science fiction literature, but still it is largely what made the majority of the Matrix series and it is a driving force behind success. <Br /> <br /> - POLARIS DIB
