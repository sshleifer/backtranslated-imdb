I saw this series when it was the world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival I like the concept behind the movie, where two meet together and 911 is about to tell a director of each country to manage a film. This project was never met before the completion of the project and they saw how it would be viewed together. Warning: spinner avatar !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very strong, and some were controversial. If you are an American, you may not like it because some fragments may be found anti-American. However, I know a few Americans who have enjoyed this series. The piece that I got the best is from India. There were two sons in a Muslim family living in the state's residents and one of them was missing. Americans have given their cold shoulders and have automatically assumed that they were involved in terrorist bomb attacks. It is so well written by the mother's disappointment and the insult of these allegations that it has brought tears in my eyes. In the end we saw that his son died while trying to save many people from the tower disaster. It was a true story, and that it was made so real. There were many mental and strong pieces, and African pieces were one of the best. It was as strong as the other but still wretched. One must definitely look for everyone, and hope America will stop it and play it in their country.
