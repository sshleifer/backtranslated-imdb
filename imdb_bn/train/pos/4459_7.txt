For these films like 'Anchor Away', some have been honored with warm relieving academic awards for a Happy Hour. It was a great year for good movies in 1945, or they were still enjoying early shock by Billy Wilder's 'The Last Weekend' that they still write a picture of the film, starting with the ballot for the best photo. Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this action instead of his role in 'Singin' of Rainfall, then there was some mistake behind the visible approach in MGM. Of course, these studios are great studios and it's easy for Hollywood to stick to the other side of the world, while in their best practice during this acclaimed tour itself. <br /> <br /> Yet, the genre of a sailor's genes Jean and Frank Sinatra must be an enjoyable feature, despite the need to emphasize the previews for musical instruments, today's visitors will not get screwed with unnecessary runtime. There are many long pieces before and after, but in this case all the charming Catherine Grayson scenes can be omitted. Until it sees 'Kiss Me Kate' it can see a movie with remote control in the hands of non-opera enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> If 1949's 'On Town' needs to be selected for women, perhaps lucky sailors probably did not promise to give an undertaking to the audience and to reduce the piano. Whole heart 'Susie' transform. Some lucky to be screened at MGM's golden studio Then some are even lucky to attend. There is no sadness about Susan Abbott or Catherine Grayson's successful screen test, but it constantly hopes to transfer both non-opera enthusiasts to the pink slip. <br /> <br /> For everything, the stars are good figures and a mean average score is scored with little meanings, but the funny narrative story makes the young ambitious navy better for last explosion of wartime morale. At least the wrong mgm film is not questioned. Caste holds the story carrying the story in colorful cinematography. Whenever someone bursts in music or song, the film makes a fun ceremony. <br /> <br /> The natural lightness of the film is fantastic for the genie Kelly's cartoon, which is full of a brilliant dance with Jerry Jeri. It seems to be a good-luck masterpiece number in Kelly's career, and before she starts dancing on the wall and ceiling of Fred Ashshire. <br /> <br /> It does not sit well with triple smell, sunflower fungus, chocolate wafer, cream and cherries and art split sundae, but it is a square solid neck of sugar that melts in your mouth in any way and despite the crime, it is still a pleasant Feeling. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 7/10
