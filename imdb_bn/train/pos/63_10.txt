This movie is not so funny that it is not funny either. If you think of one for these shootings ... stay clear. Deals with the impact and injury that one of these must survive. Even the detectives we all answer ... why? Acting from two leading women we see that the ones we ignore are affected by the same things that we are affected. Yes language is sometimes rigid, but it suits the characters well. Some loose ends are left or north, but all the movies have this. The main problems are tackled and this movie gives a big statement about how the adult feels after big events. Extremely recommended for teens and adults.
