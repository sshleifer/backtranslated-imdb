Many movies have not been made about the Biman Lighter-Thane-Air (LTA) approach, but it is one of them and it is very good. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most movies take place in Navy Navigation Operations (played by NAS Tustin) in Nass Lichhurst. Wallace Berry plays a favorite but senior Chief Ned Trumpet, like Munchusen, is a listed pilot, whose long story has become so frequent that no one believes in him. Half of the fun at the end of the movie, when the facts prove that most of his miracles are really true. <br /> <br /> The main plot was set in WWII, central trumpet around the bachelor, only the native widow finally had a father-son relationship with the widowed widowed son Jess. Doctors will never walk without crutches, the chief trumpet helps the Navy's Flight Surgeon to draw some strings and drag. Jess has been flying flight to Leicher to face the full challenge and to become a flight officer in the Navy. <br /> <br /> A very good movie completed, though technological advisors past without any soft Hollywood dialogue, and Beery's explicit incompetence step in March. Otherwise this film gets good quality for technical accuracy and gives a rare look in naval LTA activities. Cash exchange scene, trumpet and Jesse's love interest in the future is a exchange between Cathie, a complete hoot.
