It is difficult for Indian directors to compete with "Laggan" films, where 11 henpad, castrated men defend their village and half their certified idiots. "Devdas", a proud, federation-drinkers in exchange for drinking foreign drinks, running characters in the worthless characters in the feelings or feelings of a person-they live in red ornamental sculpture of a red pantheed pantanti. But to create a better movie, you are in the midst of a great deal of familiarity with the Spanish screens and Disham-Dismum fights, who are going to take a tight turn to appeal to the front bunkers, who prefer them to "Bollywood" leading actors who are elegant handsome. So you can join a director who wants to tell the story of the head of Lionain Village, who is "protecting his village" in his village, it is very common for a violent film or male audience. There are some actors who can express anger and deviation like Nan Patkar (Narasimhan). Nana Pattekar sees you entering his finger and scoffs at the politician, when his loyal fans laugh at every sound of ridicule on him, then his daughter is bathing his grandson. This is a visual view that you can get in the country of India. Nana Patakar is the acting actor, who is an invisible species in Hindi film. The film is a complex part of the story of singing songs and dance for Goukar without selling the picture, which is a sad but true state subject. Quickly change for this "Bollywood" well. All said and done this is a good movie.
