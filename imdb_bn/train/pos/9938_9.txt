We bought DVD sets for our bilingual kids "S. War Inam Das Leben" (German) / "Once in a while ... life" (English) because everyone is "Shaw Emanmar Dare Mench" (German) / "Once Upon A Time ... Man "(English) series (our parents watched it) and it even exceeded high expectations! The series is very well-formed, does not show its age, and our kids really like to see it at different ages. At the same time, they can learn something that our parents never knew until the path. This series makes many parts of the body animate, all the senses, blood, infections, antibodies, and 20-25 minute animations. Some people may find "intelligent", such as birds and reproduction are covered in a delicious, intelligent and child-friendly approach (the reproductive part of the affected area, where the baby begins to grow), though still (as usually) informative and interesting. <br /> <br /> Children are generally fascinated by how their bodies work and it can be understood in the context of their environment through episodes. The format of the episodes switches to the outside world (a family with 2 children) and inside the body. For example, in the case of infection infections, the child accidentally hit the accident and the wound is infected and the episode covers how the body responds. Similarly, these episodes of senses, such as. Listen, see, link what is happening in the context of the outside world, and the white life is full of aggression and oxygen circulation with blood (briefly) where the oxygen comes from (plant). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best child programs - I would say it must be seen for every family with kids!
