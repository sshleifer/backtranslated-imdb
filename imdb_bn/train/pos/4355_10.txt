I also saw this photo at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent film about adult family relations. Paul Ryder wrote this picture and included some similarities to his family. It was fun, warm, stupid, and moving, as well as recreational. A film like this would work very well with facial reviews. I must tell my friends and family to see this picture. Let's hope they get the opportunity. I will rate this film as one of the best films shown within a year. There is no violence, action scenes, murders, sex, so obviously the distributor asks whether it is sorted out. Believe me, there are people who would like to watch such movies which are worth the ransom, instead of the big box office blockbusters we have instead.
