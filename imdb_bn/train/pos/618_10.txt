This movie is amazing. <br /> <br /> I was 'enchanted', why should I say, and wondered why it is done. Throwing, sequencing, impact ... everything! Great! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what was outstanding from the rest is that it was said in an entertaining, superb way. <br /> <br /> This is my presentation of the modern fairy tale. It's like the modern Peter Pan ... simply amazing ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ... !!!! 10 stars!
