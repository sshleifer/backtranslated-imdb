In the American movie, the contribution of Ernest LÃ¼bitz is huge. His legacy is an outstanding group of films which will live forever, such as "corner shop". This film has been revived in other lesser-known films and in a musical game, without the handyness of Mr. Libitosh's own and specific version. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullivan and James Stewart worked together in a number of films. In this film, their characters often stand as an example of what remains in the film, rather than being visible to act. Both were delighted as they do not know each other as pens pals, but those who had luck in the same shop in Budapest were fate. <br /> <br /> This classic film carries a studio so keep the photos together together because of amazing support pictures. Here, the owner of our shop has Frank Morgan. Also, we have seen Joseph Shieldcat, Felix Bracher, William Tracy and Charles Smith with others, believing that they are in Yes Budapest. <br /> <br /> These pictures will live forever. !
