In the role of Mary Pickford, the elite film was set on a fictional island on the coast of Pride of Scotland. In fact, extrinsic shots were portrayed in Marblehead Massachusetts of Marblehead Neighbors, with a number of rocky oceanographic geographical areas, including most rock and Castle Rock. My primary interest in the film was the reason for two reasons: 1) The position of Marblehead in my city and 2) My grandmother Lizette M. Woodfin was appointed as stand-in for Mary Pickford while filming various scenes. "Steep scene". Both women were small (5 ') and both my parents and grandmother returned to the camera as soon as they returned to the camp as part of the Chiffon set. I just wanted to relate this story to future film historians and buffs. The film itself (my DVD copy is a little poorer), with a number of scenes, Miss Pickford shows a strong female character, has done very well with lots of steps and evolutionary acting. I enjoyed it and wanted to get a good copy of it, even though I'm not sure that I was present on any film sites, as copies of the copies are dark because of the existing copies. A very silent style with a lot of action!
