This is a really great movie! I think this was the first time I was really young and I used to see it all the time once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. The Homeward Dam really is fun and it's really cool how they trained the animals to do all things. Although the parts of the movie are sad (like when the Sassie, Cats, Falls falls and fall into the hole at the end of the shadow). I saw the second homeward barrage but I would not say it like the first. Shadow is the smart one, Sassy, ​​well, Sassie, and the potentially funny ass. I recommend this movie that likes comedies, or talking animals. This is one of my top ten favorite movies!
