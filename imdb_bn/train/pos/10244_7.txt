I'll call "The Story of a Dinosaur Come Back!" Is a Kiddie version of "Jurassic Park". I find it more interesting than that. Like the previous one, it asks the security of bringing an age of people to us. But when I opened my eyes, I saw who gave the voice: John Goodman, Ria Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Crankight, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yewardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. One illustrated actor, "Cheers" woman, "Night tonight" host, news most credible name, a famous chef, "Young Frankenstein", chief of police, Lisa Simpson, one of the three Amigos and CNN people <br /> <br /> I guess I just should not focus on cast. I thought the film was something both for children (totally funny) and adults (natural history). True, it escapism, but is kind of realistic. I want to tell the truth that John Goodman is doing the voice of Rex. Here's the kind of progress of "Voice Actors" voice work. Worth watching.
