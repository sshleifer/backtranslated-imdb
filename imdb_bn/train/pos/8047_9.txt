I happened on this film by accident, and really enjoyed it. Timothy Bushfield's character is without quality, and at one point, when the busflild and star melloni women pass by ... Perod's Meloni is different from the Basafield. Jhelle Malnie is horrific ... she sees a lot like Tea Leone, but the big difference here is that Genel can actually act. This is some very nice thing in the film and it is well worth your attention when it cables.
