"The first thriller I ever made, Gingerbread Man!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> Charles Laughton South Gothic, in 1955, is a wonderful tune, which denotes "The Night of Hunter", in which Robert Mitchell plays a scary serial killer. One of the more famous sequels in the film, Rochboat has two children escaping from Michiel, the kids fiercely pedalize when Mickle wades like a monster after them. <br /> <br /> After seven years, Mechum played an equally stupid slayer in American South, another film set "Cape Fear". The film showed a local attorney who tried to protect the local family and likewise ended Mitcheum with the terrorists in the boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese tried to tackle some mainstream branches, and tried to redirect "Cape Fear", boat scene and everyone. <br /> Now our Robert Oatman's "The Zinger Bread Man", another part of the small city is South Gothic. Altonman says he advised the mainstream film "The Night of the Hunter" to inspire and cope because he "wants to spread his fan and try a popcorn picture", but secretly what he is trying to do here is the Connical Canceling films South Gothic style <br /> <br /> <br /> In place of a shooting in a small boat, we have a giant ship To get to a showdown. Instead of kidnapping two kids, we came back to the two children safely in the police. Instead of hiding money, we are being paid through the last wish and rule. Instead of a respected attorney of the 1961 film and the disproportionate attorney of the 1991 rebuilding, we received a three-dimensional lawyer in Kenneth Branagh. Instead of following the monster family we get heroes chasing poor guys. Instead of breaking the monster in the family's home boat, our hero is hunting the giant on the "house ship" of the monster. Similarly, a killer serial killer instead we played by an innocent curious Robert Duvall. . Etc. etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, its touch is quite clear in the first half hour of the film, the film, the casual description, the cameras strengthened in the love of Alton's love for the uncomfortable space and overlapping conversation in the story of the conventional plot-driven movie story, and the letters are not so much <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> Most wounds "To the thriller format" of the Convention altamyana very confident, his style is very hard to create tension and a series of other movies in the film to reflect the fundamentals are not enough. "Gingerbread Man" thus works as a more purely original Olman film in mainstream and too much Altman to act as a mainstream thriller. <br /> <br /> The film is not completely waste, though. Robert Danny Jr., Kenneth Branagh and the generally intolerant Daryl Hannah, all turned into raspy performances. The film has a nice atmosphere, which sets against a decreasing hurricane and the final law has some interesting twists and turns. Although Scory's "Cape Fear" is not a complete disaster, the film still does not have any specific amount. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 90's, Alatman made three series in South America: "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie Fortune". Like "Gingerbread Man", Altman, both "Kansas City" and "Cookie Fortune", faced the trend of the most comfortable, larger, more harmful canvas. <br /> <br /> Among these two movies, "Kansas City" is more important, its classification of class, politics and crime, and the desire to break from common gangster general frameworks, all serious 21st proven effective century film crime writers (for example , "The Wire"). Note: Altman claimed that this was his first thriller, but he operated "Picture", an "Art of Art House Thriller", that said, "Cookie's Fortune", a very slowly story. , In 1972 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One philosophy worth.
