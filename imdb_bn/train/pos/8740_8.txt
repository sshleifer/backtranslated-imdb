There is a great story of a bug's life. Everything is covered. The film looks great and animations are sometimes jaw-dropping. This movie is not very awesome, it's basically a modern adoption of Seven Samurai in Kursoowah, only with the bug. And although these guys have enjoyed the interaction of character and bad guys in this film actually feel bad. It seems Disney usually cut-out the carbon copy of their bad guys. Pallet menacing and hopper, lead bad guy, was a great creation. Check out this one out.
