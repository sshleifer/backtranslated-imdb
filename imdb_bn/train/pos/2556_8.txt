And made for a TV movie, this movie was good. It was just great acting and intriguing. This is the only movie that I saw that I was feeling bad because after seeing it I was afraid that my computer came to the screen to kill me with the screen. Some minor things with this movie were wrong, but it is very easy to see. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> TV movies can be so powerful. After watching this, I read novels based on this movie (four times) and it was very kicked, it was very cool. If you see this movie on TV then I would like to see it. The effects of this movie are quite well done, I really do not know how a live calling person would look like, but I was impressed with how the FX team did this and it shows that it is bad for all TV movies to be made worse. With less budget there will not be too bad. See it. <br /> <br /> It's really good, not really, it's!
