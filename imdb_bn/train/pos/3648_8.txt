"Pandora's Clock" is a secret mystery / thriller that crosses a virus movie and a disaster film. In 1996, this two-part film, released in NBC, is a plane flight that transits a passenger, when one of the passengers carries the disease. The US government disputes the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and the virus expert (Deffen Zunega) trying to find something to avoid the disaster. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I like the "Pandora's Clock". This is a thrill ride hack. Zenne Lives (TV's "Fraser"), Robert Logzia and Edward Herman (as President) and star. <br /> <br /> *** (in fours)
