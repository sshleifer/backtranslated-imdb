This viewer recently voted as a favorite audience at the Palm Springs International Film Festival of 2005, it is inspirational and ongoing. A famous conductor, forced to end illness, returned to the village of his birth to become the leader of the church church, and finally found the fulfillment of his music. By grasping voluntary features of himself and some small Swedish village's vague character of the film, this film well develops each of its characters. Well organized, played and singing, it brings tears to many eyes, and all smiles. I hope it gets distributed in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, see!
