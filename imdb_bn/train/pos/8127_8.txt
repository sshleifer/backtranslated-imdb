While propagating some of the progress of mankind as a gift of preservation, it is still a stunning film that represents the special effects of blockbuster science-fiction, which takes another 40 years to reach the silver screen. It predicts WWII's chaos around the world, but for the past 30 years it has spread over the premises by this conflict and then tells the story of the epic of human struggle under the rubble and the undergarments of the wild. Actor seems to be wood and surprisingly sterile, but it is perhaps the reason for its contrast with the scene which was absolutely exciting during the release of the movie, and which still remains to be affected today. This is a movie that does not miss the interest of the SF.
