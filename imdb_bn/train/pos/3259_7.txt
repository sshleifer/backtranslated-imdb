This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it must be quite beautiful and viewable. It is guided in an old fashioned way and it works fine. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne did not get her role bad as a woman who could not get over her husband's death. She has a sexy maturity. But I can not say much as Ryan O'Neal Philip, because he, best, nondescript. He may be adequate in the role, but it is not good enough. However, I feel that some letters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not written with enough depth. We do not know anything about them because the story becomes thick after a few minutes of publication, and the author will not say anything more than what happens to us. But the problem was retrieved because of the brilliance of Mary Stewart Masters, there is fresh-one-daisy sweetness, and Robert Donny Jr is so impressive that he melts on the screen. Even her smile is contagious. And it's so great that his big dream eyes are suitable for Dju V and flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is light and easy and if you like them then why not try it. <br /> <br />
