In the continuation of the popular Cinderella story, I reminded myself with some of the beauty and best movies. It originally rolled into three short stories. <br /> <br /> All right, mouse adorable (I love gass! She is so beautiful!), and Lucifer's extraordinary (normal). I liked some of the new characters, (palm pom was adorable and i love prudence.). Yet, the story was somewhat limited, but still very clever. So, I voted 7/10.
