Some of the acting was a bit suspect. I remember that Aswip Alexander Walker (standard critics in the evening, yes, he is dead) expressed laziness about the film and said that it was a disrespect to depict NI Protestant as a murderer. Now with the honor of all NI protesters, this film was based on very franklin (who was faithful) and wandered in Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they were not called to slaughter for nothing. My main regret about this movie is that it does not show any light or light, it is all destruction and sadness, this means I will eventually die for a little girl. Perhaps this sounds sounds, but it can take strategies that all the productions and tigers are not bad or completely good.
