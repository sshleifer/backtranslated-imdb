All dogs go to heaven equally underneath the waterships for the terrible Kiddies movie. Both were bold and quite sinister, but at the same time a child can have the most tragic experience. This was my favorite movie as a kid. I was in love with Charlie and I was five or six years old, I would admit ... I had a pressure on a cartoon dog. All dogs tell criminals Cad Charlie dark story and criminal Itchy his partner. This story escapes from Charlie's death row and goes to the closest club for some gambling. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this film. I like songs and animations, but my age is increasing, so I start wondering why this film does not bother me as a young person. This is quite an adult themes - in a world of gambling, murder, inferno and prisons but in a world of strong Disney movies, it should be seen once every child. Yes, some crazy transvestite crocodile scenes and these scenes scare me now that when I was young, it provides a deadly message that parents should not ignore!
