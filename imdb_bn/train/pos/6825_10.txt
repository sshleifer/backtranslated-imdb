I was completely blown away by the inaugural night of John Cassettes. This is his first film which I have seen on a large scale, and thus it feels more mainstream, but still does not seem to be that he has done more than his earlier films. Perhaps it makes it so intense. Undoubtedly there are some catharsics about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This is actually the most important subject of Casavets, it's a standard that he has released as a director behind his career across the camera and reveals it in front of it. Roland's character, medieval stage actress, Martle Gordon, can not bring himself to take part in the role of the upcoming generation, so she unknowingly follows the emotions after inspiration, causing a chaos on the stage, until she finds it right. This is a bravely abstract generation. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that fails to attain that solitary steering during a mental cleanliness. Murtle does not do much of the work that she does not understand, and it can be a good thing even if it is portrayed as a destructive and even illustrated. It can be a breakdown instead of a cleansing. A recall, a cocoon, a rebellion, it all culminates in a tragic. Cassavetes is arguing that at first, he firmly has nothing in common with his character, which gives his character a cruel real touch, but the opposite is the fact that he reacts to the calm but emotionally opposed fear. <br /> <br /> The last scene, the clayatic performance shared by Marlault in his role of a boring character from the performer, which I have ever seen, is one of the most striking, ridiculous, hard hit, enlightened and enjoyable moments.
