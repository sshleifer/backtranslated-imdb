Peter Sollet created a local image about real people living in poverty in Lower East Side of Louisiana or New York, known by locals. <br /> <br /> Sohelt's heart is in the right place when he examines this inauspicious family, which is the ideal of various internal cities. Mr. Sollet accentuates the positive story he presented. These are basically good kids, parents have left them and their grandmother has taken them under their wings. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting her characters as damaged, Mr. Sollet shows them all a positive side. These children are not into drugs or stolen because they are poor. If we did this story of Hollywood, we would see a sanctuary instead of children's struggle, but deep inside, they were not defeated. <br /> <br /> Victor Vargas, Victor Vargas was the revelation. She is a natural. So is Marte in July. His character shows us a stupid girl that will not fool or drive things that he does not want to do. Altagrasia Guzman, Grandma, nice He will not be able to guide his parents in his beliefs, and for him it is so important that he expressed his frustration. <br /> <br /> Thank you everyone, Peter Sultan's wonderful image.
