I am 25 years old and I saw it four times at different times and I always think I do not cry and I always, almost 2 or 3 times ...;) Merrill. It was absolutely brilliant, Jeremy Orons ... brilliant ... I received more rewards in the movie ... I did not really see it that it looked and liked it ... Also, Glenn was off pretty cool. The story was very nice and sad ... I really love that Clara and Estal love each other despite everything, and how much Blank was to her parents!
