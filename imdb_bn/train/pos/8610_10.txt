Diane Keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young and secret in their deep dark. Deane Keaton, (Natali), "The Family Stone", '05, whose only daughter was, and more words could describe him. He always called him, "Sirmond Dorothy", which was an expression used in the 1942 Wizard of Oz. Suddenly the car accidents happen and Natalie deeply associates herself with her daughter's friends and lovers. She investigated Natalie, found her true truth about her true relationship and her actual relationship with her daughter. Nice movie to watch and enjoy, especially good acting from all the supporting actors.
