Alain Chabat is a good actor, writer and director, but perhaps a trafail may have been confused with a 'ideas' credit for such a story, which probably goes astray when Aristophanes still came to know that it was 'I' before 'E'. But, as I said, Chabat is a good actor and he can joke when he needs it. I slowly activated a accomplished performance of those who exceeded a disaster in Charlotte Gainsbourg. If you absolutely know that the 'plot' is better than the person in his placebo and more than the content of the person. It can not sit well with his mother and five sisters, and throwing behind them, he makes an arrangement with a colleague's sister - for fifteen thousand euros - as his new girlfriend, let romance come with a wedding and then jilt him, thus Getting him off the hook. Naturally they fly together but some sub-Benedict and Betrots are dualing and all have been considered that it is not very difficult minutes and minutes at the French box office are doing so well that no successor can be out of the question.
