Along with darkwing postings this is abolished unfairly. Disney Tarzan has deteriorated and we need a show like this for the Disney track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummins were perfect for the voice of Louis and Balu (known words?) Theme theme tunes are also interesting. Among all villains, which are great on their own talents, Tony J. Shery Kane has stood as Louis and Balu are just as good as the voice over the jungle book, which is not a bad thing. Actually this is very inspirational! Animation was in the spot, and there was a lot of scripts in the scriptures that had serious lack in animation for years. Please show this back! 9/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
