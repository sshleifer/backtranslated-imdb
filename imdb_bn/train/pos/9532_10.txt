I love a lot about this movie ... Character development, detail attention, excellent acting, stunning lighting and cinematography, while developing wonderful soundtracks ... <br /> <br /> This is a joint intensity and touching light that is fast fast- The muscle will not work for anyone who wants the action flick. If we live in Elizabeth's days, I would say that this film is just as little as Shakespeare's tragedy. But since we do not say it, it's more like a drama-suspense movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The way the movie is relating to relationships and topics are intelligent. Most stories are shown instead of telling, which makes me more subtle and moving - and which works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). Occasionally I felt I was part of this story in the 1930s - it was such a realistic but dream-like quality in the style of his story. <br /> <br /> I often did not like movies based on the book they were, but in this case I do. (Even though I enjoyed the book.) I bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary. <br /> <br /> I have also taken my younger cousin, who is younger than a little boy in a movie, seen for the first time because he has problems in his home and I wanted to use it as a way to start discussions with his father. - And discuss.)
