I have seen this movie in advance screenings and it looks nice. <br /> <br /> You are a real spin of romance that looks cute, funny, and sometimes frustrating around mankind's most powerful emotion. <br /> <br /> <br /> Cast is huge, with a true Ocean 11th Andy Garcia, Ethan Huq, Shia Labov, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Brett Rotner, Shaka Kapoor, Natalie Portman I understand, wow! Although this movie is both romantic and funny, there is not a straight-forward romance or romantic comedy. It has serious stories and notes. But that's my opinion is good. Check it out for yourself and answer my review, I want to hear what others will say.
