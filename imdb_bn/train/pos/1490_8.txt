Everyone has the first love, and even though you are young, this feeling is difficult to define, but it is burning in you. Malaysian filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad proves his most complex experiences, his fourth characteristic, a movie where a fraudulent, easy, straightforward fashion is perceived. <br /> <br /> Especially convenient for such a method, the story of love in the film's story involves twelve years of age, and therefore any effort should be made to "deep" analysis, festive and persuasive. They are not the proof of the wonderful performance of leading non-actors, Sharifah Aryana and Mohammad Saifi Nasheed. Former drama orcade (formerly Ahmed's earlier picture is seen as an adult character of Gabra), a living, almost rebel girl, probably influenced by his "British" growth (his mother studying in England), hated playing with dolls, boys liked Play violent sports with. Then one day he met Mukhsin (Nasheed), who came to spend time in his aunt's house, and suddenly he changed his habits: Goodbye cat, hello cycling and tree-mountain. But what does that mean? Do they understand only friends, or more, none of them is ready to understand, should we be alone? <br /> <br /> The heroes give a young age, answering the question to impossible boundaries, and so, like "small" movies (feel lost in translation), there is no real bond, a choice that is a kitten Leaves, but eventually abandones satisfying: Naturally, unfamiliar acting (especially Aryana) around the heart, and a strong supporter cast (Orchid Family maximum maximum) Helps easily keep the funny fun and seducing described. The world below is not always effective (too much humorous theorem about an adulterous neighbor goes very quickly), and at the beginning of the feature, it is difficult to justify the bogious Fiction Reference, but psychic energy is enough to make this interesting Asian movie of teenage romance an interesting piece.
