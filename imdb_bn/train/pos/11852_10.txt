Spirit is a unique and original look of Western life from a wild horse, and the perspective of Native Americans. The film focuses on friendships and dangers that face a wild horse, soul, time of its life. <br /> <br /> has done very well in the presentation, the incredible visuals available with today's technology that are exciting and realistic in their depth. <br /> <br /> The song is superb, the song of Brian Adams, and the music of Hans Geimmer, who was also responsible for the most popular music from the 1994 Disney Hits, The Lion King. <br /> <br /> The story is not very deep, but true that it is not quite deep, some pictures like my opinion are not completely cut off from the movie. <br /> <br /> Extraordinary movie that I've enjoyed so much, and it is suitable for all families. One will not miss. (10/10)
