I have seen this event first in Japan for last six months last year. When I was looking for sub-titles to help me with my Japanese, I found it on the Internet. My host mother warned me to refrain from it because she thought it was weird, but I found it appealing! Koyuki showed the character of such conflict character and Matsujun's spirit made me tuned each day of my day! I first saw him "Hana yori dango", but I like him better! <br /> <br /> Although the character is attractive and better, I was frustrated that they did not change much. A lot from the show. Their relationship has increased, but they are not really. Still, there was a fun time all (even for Fukushima!).
