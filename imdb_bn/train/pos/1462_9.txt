In this documentary we meet with Roger, a factory manager in China, who produces and sells the mari and other pieces sold at New Orleans's Mardi Gras. Roger claims that the girls in the factory love their work and are grateful for the opportunities available, but in another four interviews they are told another story. The painful life of women is shown in contrast to the bizarre dissatisfaction of Mardi Gras. In order to get a nice and rare footage of daily life in a Chinese factory compound, filmmaker David Redman should be praised and for the release of a camera interview with America's company chief who sells and sells wax. The film is mandatory and it clearly serves its purpose as a window in what is behind the label "Made in China".
