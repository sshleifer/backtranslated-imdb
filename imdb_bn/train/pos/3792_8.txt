I have seen this picture today, and I am amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters. It does not look like a movie - it's more like a documentary (which I liked well). The leading ladies of this movie really thought that I know any fifteen year old girls. <br /> <br /> A very enjoyable movie for everyone who enjoys independent films.
