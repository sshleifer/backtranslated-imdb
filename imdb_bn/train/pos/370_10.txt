I've seen this movie at least fifty times and I still feel it after seeing it in the first week of the long week. <br /> <br /> The story was incredible, but Spielberg's expertise was alive and imagined cast with Hype Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Everie. Aksuya Bassia is eligible for Oscar nomination for her younger but powerful painter Neti. <br /> <br /> You will feel the emotion of every person seeing this movie. I smiled and cried. Like most of the great movies, it was seen by the Academy that most of the nomination papers were not won. But this movie is without doubt, always one of the best movies.
