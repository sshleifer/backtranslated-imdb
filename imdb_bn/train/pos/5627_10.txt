This step was actually coming out of my chair with what the actors were going to do! Acting was the best, Farrah should have earned an Oscar for he was extraordinary. James Russo was so good I hate him and he played it surprisingly. There are not many movies that riveted me as this one. Large alfalfa, seeing the big eyes, said that Farah was looking at a victim and she took a terrible refuge as she went through it. Farrah If you feel you felt wanted to have had him there and feeling the same anger you feel, you still knew it was wrong work. The film took you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene.
