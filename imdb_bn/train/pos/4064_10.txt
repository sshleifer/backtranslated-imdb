I have never met the single person who hates this movie (outside hundreds). Anyone voted to vote it down a small saboteur, or one of the victims. This film has everything. Ask yourself, "Are you a fan?." Then see "Laputa". <br /> <br /> This is not my favorite movie, but my preferred IS operated by the same dear person (Haibo Miyazaki). In any case, this one is the place in my top five. And I saw many movies.
