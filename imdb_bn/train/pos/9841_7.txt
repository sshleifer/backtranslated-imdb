I love cartoons. They show something that movies can not do with 'real' actors and scenes - even though the effects of the computer are changing much more. They can impose the limits of adultery ('Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), spectacular ('Alladin'), or reality ('toy story'). There are some good examples of 'Ice Age', for example, when we are now seeing mammal mammal mammals throughout the whole, chatting like old friends. These scenes are satisfying for seeing, because we got both the familiar and weird feeling at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. Ice age is not as good as the best animated movies of all time, it's a really fun movie. Sit back, deliberate anachronisms, lovely backgrounds and belly-laughs. <br /> <br /> Manfred follows the tragic mammoth of the story, Sid, a stupid sloth, and a sabretooth tiger, dago, as they accept the human child returned to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, naturally, they have many problems. Also during the trip, the popping up is Scrat, the invincible roadant in history, who is trying to suppress a root winter: glacier, on dead trees, ice cave. His opening scene is a classic. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story with a simple story and a middle which is a series of fun facts thrown in some character-building moments, but some scenes, such as nappy-changing or dodos, sunny, are good and it looks good . Mammoth's cave painting comes in front of Manfred's eyes when there is one touch moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
