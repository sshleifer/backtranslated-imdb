This silly movie is really fun for the young audience. Heroes are two intelligence detective agencies, whose impressive attitudes lead to their very brazen roads. You go to each of these detectives to solve the culprits behind the big murder case. No nudity, but a lot of sexual relationships, slapstick silliness ... all go for teenage. Low budget, but very entertaining. Confirmed culture is the classic potential.
