This is a very entertaining movie. I wrote some reviews in this forum that wrote, who apparently thought that this film was an attempt at serious drama. It has not been made in such a way .... It is a very enjoyable movie, performed in a tongue in the language of cheeks. The actor is definitely having fun while our entertaining. The war sequence is animated, intense and above all, gratuitous. The so-called "Green Death" is not used on some occasions, as I read in a review, "serious". At the end of the film, there was a few critics of the martial arts fight between Doc and Saias. Hey, light up ... Again, I remind one and it's a fun film. This "war" is captioned at each stage, which adds fun aspect. Actors Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan are not trying to imitate. This is not one of the martial arts films. Ron Eli looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another excellent touch is the unique way to deal with the final destiny of "bad guy" (sea). I promise you that if you do not want to take this film very seriously and it only looks for entertainment pricing, you will spend 100 minutes in the most enjoyable way.
