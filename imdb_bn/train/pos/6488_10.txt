The war is hell-like. But this documentary of WWII is heaven. <br /> <br /> This series is not only fully monitored in World War II, it is explicitly and nicely stated by Lawrence Olivier, the best poetry of a poem. <BR> <br /> This documentary series defines the series. It is suspiciously long, no doubt, but you would enjoy them all and want to come back for more and more. (I have a series in DVD and I probably look at the series thrice a year). <br /> <br /> Actually, this is a vague bit of filmmaking. Among the Olivier, veterans are telling their stories in the best part of the series; Whether it is a real battle or a hug for Bashar, so they can keep something tasty in the evening. <br /> <br /> I'm going to see it now (again, my ... 11 times).
