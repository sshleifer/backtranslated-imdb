Unfortunately, due to the tendency of closing subtitles for US viewers, this film does not deliver distinction or attention. His only "real" man knows how relatives, identity, ethnic relations and especially colonialism affect all the groups, its dramatic tensions, progestistic childhood nostalgic memories, and the externality of his relationship with his parents 'son of the house'. We will not even look at his mother's relationship with these elegant people. There! I hope I've given you enough money to accept it, you want to speak French or do not like subtitles. I'm challenging you to be brave, strong and aware of La Pitt.
