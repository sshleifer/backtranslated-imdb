I love this movie after thinking about it. And after reading all the other poster comments here and after thinking about it more, I decided that I liked it very much. I love American films - perhaps because they are so fiction They usually have a defined start, middle, and end. "Presque Rien," on the other hand, does not make any such effort. I disagree with other posters that it is very 'Arts'. In every way, this image is meant to evoke your sensory memories. So often you feel like a lifetime that you are there ... you feel like summer sun, breeze, heat, winter coolness, friendship, loneliness etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> In all aspects, the director drages you towards the life of characters - so many people feel so strong that the movie has made them frustrated. After I watched it, I felt the same. But on some reflections, I recognize that the movie was like: 'Story' is not a story, it seems your passion (visitors). <br /> <br /> The lights, views, and cameras inspect you in the corner views - they are alive with rich, delicate, and detailed and inferior. Although I usually can not face movies without completely distorted plots (lastly, a story telling movie is not 'supposed'), this film is certainly one of my new favorites.
