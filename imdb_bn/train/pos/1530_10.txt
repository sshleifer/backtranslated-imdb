Show older people ???? I'm 15 years old and see from the show that the 12-year-old, Hallmark, and it's being recorded every day in Sky Sky on the BBC. I really wish they did not cancel it, they did not even get the right answer. But these are some adventures, those episodes, I think I have seen them all, and nobody thinks that I do not like and do not enjoy. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that BBC murder and 'Marder She wrote' - never saw it and there is no desire to do it. However, he is so deeply in the characters of Murder Diagnoses, and chemistry in the actors surprisingly. It's really a sad day when they canceled this show ........
