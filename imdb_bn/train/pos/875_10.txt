Well, what can I say by seeing this amazing movie, when my nerves are still blurred! Director Jack Oddard must certainly make a name for himself in France, and exactly so. Vince Castle is not a Tom Cruise and Emanuel Deos is not a Penelope Cruz, but these two great actors, and this is a sharp and compulsive thriller that starts slowly with some cute character building and then makes excitement exciting. In the final stage. Others have written about this plot, so I play a direct role to perfection, director, actor, camera, more than everyone else in this movie, and everything is true, no fooled gun, it happened so during the war, it is so trustworthy, expression, passion, it is almost as you are a visitor As there are. Benefit yourself, get a DVD, a bottle of wine, reduce lights, shut the phone off and immerse yourself in this Hitachchian Thriller :)
