For Jimmy Fallon, I was the only reason for this movie, I crashed from 9th grade, which was the first year of SNL. I'm a mortal hard yankee fan, and I was not painful for the last 15 minutes when I saw the clips of Alice games. I would like to cover my ears and create a short cry, so that would not be heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable. <br /> <br /> I played Jimmy's role very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky, and he was a nervous and quirky guy. I know that this may not be the Academy Award winner, but the film is simply a light, funny, romantic comedy which is really suitable for both men and women. <br /> <br /> The hostage and the droo worked well together, and they were a lot better chemistry than the other actors in the past. (Ed Barnes and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie?) I think Jimmy has a positive career in front of him, and thanks for the love, because the taxi can kill it. I think the fever pitch will help him a lot. Everyone must stop his acting ability so critical because he only started in movies. I imagine it is difficult, and if you see one of the greatest actors of our time (Tom Hendes, Russell Crowe), you'll see that they have closed some flops. Busom friend? Australian soap opera? Here Jimmy is a successful career on a screen. I did not want to leave him SNL but what can you do?
