On an overnight flight to Los Angeles from Los Angeles, Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdam) meets a charming man who meets a tenant murderer who claims his help to kill a businessman or else his father dies. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is a great thriller that puts viewers at the edge of their seats. The composition is similar to cellular and phone booths but is better than both the red films. Almost everything about Red Eye is often accompanied by sensation, acting and direction. Most of the pictures take place on a flat plane, but it does not slow down the movie. Exciting and exciting with the film very slow or annoying. Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera. Instead of focusing on the Thrills, he focuses on stories and characters. The movie has a suspicious moment, but it really is not really. Wes Craven draws attention to other passengers and becomes less important after small details. Red Eye really shows his skills while telling the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdam gives a very compelling performance and is hard to hate her character. You may even end up cheering for her out loud. Cillian Murphy Villain gives a very awesome and effective performance. Initially he works impressive but then psycho actively means, especially impressive. Supporting actors are also good, including Brain Cox and Zayma Mess. <br /> <br /> This film is very stylish and has full vague VBs. There is obvious fear of isolation and no escape, because setting works well. Overall, the sound of the film is consistently vague. The script is not as strong as everything though. There are some unreal moments that can distract viewers. Most of them did not bother me, but some of them kept my head off. Also, last disappointing. It's a very easy end to a bad and a different approach has been good. Since movies focus on letters, so there is only a few jumps in a screaming moment. If you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed. In the end, Red Eye is a compelling thriller and it is one of the best movies of summer. Ratings 8/10
