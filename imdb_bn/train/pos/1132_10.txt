DTIM is the best of its Hollywood imitation operation! It is fun that we do not see. Great characters and great lines. Hupi is very sunny ..... Sally Field is so much ... Gerry Marshall line is a riot .... I love the good humor. Do not be afraid to make fun of yourself !!!!!! The sets were great .... the dress was the point and "Montana Morehead" backstage abb was a devil's delight. There was not enough line of Terry Harker as "Dr. Monica Demonico", but at the screen there was not much less spectacular and funny. I want to know how the film's idea came. Humans are not so interesting to see the comedy work! Sopadish must be and I'm waiting for the DVD !!!
