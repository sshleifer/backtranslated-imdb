Ideally a kid who tries to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system. A system that hides the truth and violates the right to exist. A boy inspired by Martin Luther King, and told the truth. A family is falling apart, and fighting against it. You can not hide from a movie. You see things, and you hear things, and you think things, that hope will die until you die, for the real did not happen. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents can not do anything, and a boy, I'm sorry, say, a boy who does not accept anything, nothing will happen to him, a child with power, and a child Who works like Pro, as he did nothing else, he finally carries the film and wants to see anyone who wants to find abuse within 60 seconds.
