Like the gentle giant, the last part of the title of this movie is created by Michael Oblovitz's latest production, but it is slowly and scholarly. The producer's last ending, "Mosquitoman-3D" was the same problem. It's hard to imagine a bizarre shark movie, but they run it anyway. The only draw for the Hummerhead: Shark Frenzy It was a portable animator, which is always interesting when dealing with the wonderful world at the bottom of the ocean surface. But even that was only passable. In some scenes, poor focus seems to produce amateurish. With dolphins and wheels, all of the technology is wasted. Many close-ups of cloud scenes and giant themes of the film can not do anything to take advantage of IMX's stunning 3D capabilities. There are many very few scenes up to any depth or variety. Clutter-ups of these horrible animals show only the flats and the camera is just one animal in the field, so there is no contrast to the depth. Michael Oblowitz is trying to follow his father's footprint, but you've got a shark week on the cable, a constant frustration of his self-confident and suspended treatment of his subjects.
