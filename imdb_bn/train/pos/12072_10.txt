Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Demagio and Senator McCarthy, if combined with the flexible evening of relativity? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " She also came to present. If you are confused with metaphor, or if you serve your films as predefined and pithy, then you will not like this movie. This is a demanding artist who rewards many levels of experience with the intellectuals. <br /> <br /> For a while, hard work to use the real names of the character, we see Einstein, about giving a peace speech to the brutally in the United Nations, we are being visited by the Marine Monroe, the infamous seven-year-old H scene after filming Saying ends his marriage with Joe Demagio. Einstein has an excellent interface that stuns Einstein with a downfall in the neighborhood around the innocence of the biggest sex symbol of modern times. <br /> <br /> Write Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is red. He is determined to assure Einstein's assurance that he will support the activities of the House Unification Activation Committee while supplying the ultimate weapon called Peace. Joe, an amazingly fragile and weaker person, perhaps not throwing like Gary Busy, who hates Marilyn's exhibit and believes that Einstein has become his lover, although Marilyn only wants to show Einstein that he understands the special theory of relativity. <br /> <br /> But there is more to it. <br /> <br /> Just like us, these characters have the deepest fears, which they publish in flashbacks hunting one after the other. These weaknesses, in the end, can not help us to give credit to humanity statistics, but we can often see it abruptly today. Finally, we saw the worst terrorism in Einstein's view, and the film's statement became clear. This is a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> Unhappiness is one of my top five movies all the time. It's completely amazing.
