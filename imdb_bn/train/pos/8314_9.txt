This movie was actually a romantic drama, which was based on three sisters, who wanted to become a famous girl group. In their endeavor, the oldest sister met a drug dealer and street hostler, who was known as Sati, because she believes that she will say "big time" that she wants everything in her life. Although he was also killed on the charge of killing him, he only killed his soul and could survive, then he became addicted and ultimately died in excess. The story is not about Italian brain trying to stop street life or status, then threatens him, the narrative character of the song's life and style and life character can also overcome the worst tragedy of life. Young women are trying to "discover" again and again.
