Preston Waters is off in a bad summer. Apart from his birthday, nothing else is committed. <br /> <br /> First you have to share it with your brother who is going to run a business. They can not do this in their cell because they do not have adequate space. She gets only $ 6 token until a birthday party, the other gets $ 32, $ 35 and even $ 50. When one of his birthday cards arrives early, he only receives a check for $ 11. <br /> <br /> She said that to get to the bank she will have to start an account of at least $ 200. By leaving the bank, a rapist stole the check. The kid almost steals him (definitely his bike is destroyed), a criminal named Quigli (played by Miguel Ferrar). Quigley comes to the bank to pay $ 1,000,000 to the owner to give this guy tomorrow. Quigley started to write a check for damage, but a police car area only succeeded in writing his name before the circle. Fear, Preston checks, to give him to his father to finish him. <br /> <br /> That evening, Preston told his father that he does not want a new bike, he wants his house to return, better yet his own house His father kept him in his house in the evening. Preston's picture could not get worse in the house, he realizes that he has forgotten the check because it is still in his shirt pocket. It's empty <br /> <br /> Consuming computer and considering it carefully, he created it for $ 1,000,000. The next day, while trying to pay cash to the bank, he took the owner who thinks he is the person who will pay him $ 1,000,000 and do it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even an Incognito Bank lady who is really going to date with FBI agents (who are trying to track 3 bad guys). He called this person Mcintosh, who worked for him on his birthday and even planned a party for him. <br /> <br /> Finally things are caught (money ends, bad people get him). <br /> <br /> Overall, a beautiful fun flash. Miguel Ferrara plays his role very well. If you enjoy him at another stakeout, then you will love him here. He does all kinds of malicious crazy things. <br /> <br /> Rick DuQamun (a ghost-pressed wife) is playing a nice friendly Chauffeur in this movie.
