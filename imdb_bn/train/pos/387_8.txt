This movie is good It's great to have great CG SINGU FU flicks but its pretty good. First thing first, the story is actually good. The complete concept of the god versus deity is pretty cool with the type of deal with super power. My problem is many letters! It got very confusing when they changed the scene! Special effects were incredible! The war scene was very fast paced and complex. This movie actually generates all the computers. Acting is fantastic, as always expected from high profile players. Ekin Cheng makes an excellent drama character, Lone. Zhang Zia did nothing for me in this movie. I thought he would be a big part but he was one war scene and a complete yapping. Bad guy, whole skull army and whole blood cloud is very scared of the thing. Music is also excellent. To me this story deserves at least a mini series and is not just a movie. Too much story to sleep for 2 hours Maybe there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the letters and details. The story for this movie action futility sacrifice I reccomend Storm Raiders on this day.
