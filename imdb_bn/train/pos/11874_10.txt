Arguebly Al Pacino's Best Role He played Tony Montana, a small time Hug from Cuba became a wealthy and powerful criminal in Miami, and he got two things in this world, his balls and his words, and he 'm for someone. Cuban Dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Logzia) started working for a big time and quickly escalated to his company with longtime friend Moni (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife Elvira (Michele Pfeiffer). After seeing the threat of his position from Frank Tony, he tried to kill Tony, but there was no fate. Tony is disturbed and nothing can stop him now. They have a great supporting film. F. Murray Ibrahim, known as a nasty gangster, tried to kill Tony as the younger sister of another familiar face, Harris, Eulin Tony. Ecxellent Screenplay Credit by Oliver Stone This image is one of the brightest points of Brian Depler in his long up and down career, you can see this person very talented. In the movie it has a fantastic look. Also pay attention to two memorable scenes: one at the fancy restaurant ("Say bad guy to good night"). The other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick a donkey and kill about 20 assassins who attack his house. This is certainly one of the most impressive lasting of a movie I've ever seen. For fans of Al Pasino and crime film, it must be seen. It is highly recommended for your rest. 10/10
