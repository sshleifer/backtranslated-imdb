I have seen this movie almost a year ago, and it may be a fun-out-loud fun. My mind is a real winner, It was underlining a stupid comedy, but actually there was a real plot as well. Most hit comedy, Elf, actually. It was a few serious moments, sandwiched in Hilarity. The Stahler Black Horse shot, usually at normal moments, you saw yourself smiling on its satirical antics. You can actually find the common ground, because I'm sure many have done something that they do not want to find friends, so that your friendships do not end. <br /> <br /> When I came to know how many people did not like this movie, I was totally disrespected. Much of the horror movies like Napoleonic Dynamite were rated, it amazes me with the implications of the people in IMDB. Take my advice and rent it. If you do not get to laugh at least once, then I'll pay you a fee. = D:
