One of Bagge Bunny's Harry-Rising, Walkie Shorts works in the famous Loupried * department store display, when Malik Gildarlive decides to stuff him. Of course, it is almost impossible to prove, because the bugs apparently know the store better than the Gildersleeve (and when cross-dress knows). Always keep everything coming at the top speed, and so you are wondering how ridiculous this cartoon was when it first started! Among other things, the word "conditioned" is a wonderful example of how Loman Tunnes saw the 'Tarmite Terrace Crowd' before the polishing of the '40s. But wrong, the cartoons were still really good after the orderly shape. <br /> <br /> However, this is a great one. <br /> <br /> * Leopards rabbit and horse.
