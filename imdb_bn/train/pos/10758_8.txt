9/11 is a true documentary film in this case, in the case of the New York Fireman, which is one of the most remarkable events in world history. It's all tiny, disobedient, hand-crafted video cameras, often driven by the poor quality of filming (and often by removing the screen in the hands of the director, nudity). <br /> <br /> In this picture you get to know Tony Benattos, NY Fireman local language Rookie (or 'probie'), fire chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who later finds out his brother lost) and a few others. Most of the people in this film have a studio interview, only emphasizing personal, reactionary nature events. The build-up is quite dramatic and well-executed, especially in the fire department's pass-out program, some useful sub-pans and limited dialectical editing of films (such as a very good man with Rob Reiner). ).
