This is a slow moving story. No action No crazy mystery No sudden surprise If you can not see two people talking about two movies and walking, then a story that gradually develops and will not waste your time and money through loving-romantic romance. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are in dialogue, tell a wonderful story, think thoughts and think of the true love of life, but this is your movie. When I'm most cautious you would recommend this movie, though the overall tone of motion, music, and film may keep you in the mood of festivities. It's really gorgeous I really want to say that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " They work with each other from the very beginning and feel each other. <br /> <br /> Their conversations contain great comments on many topics that will stimulate thoughts and conversations between you and your partner. I thought it is very deep and very diverse for young people, but I can reduce their intelligence. Yet it did not destroy the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple, I think the movie gives its charm and ultimately it's power. <br /> <br /> Button Line: The film's stream is slow. The dialog is interesting The story is slowly, systematically and practical. Finally the build is satisfactory and last fruitful.
