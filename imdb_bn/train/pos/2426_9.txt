"Life once" is a very good movie. But it is not good for everyone because of the extreme use of obscenity and in some situations due to violence. The film NYC surrounds the "life" of an atrocious, credible way of handling where the drug problem is important. This screenplay is used as a decoration for a highly thoughtful and suspicious drama backed up by powerful dialogues (but the English language is not my native language, but the video is fine). Sometimes a little more movement is done, but I think it is very good to the general adaptation of Fisherberg, which has provided the film, which is a reflection rather than a good style practice, especially during time / action management. Characters, though not common, are easy to relate and actors do a delicate job in their disguise. The way I enjoyed the soundtrack (B-Marcelis). If you are not too motivated, you should enjoy watching this movie once, twice, three times. I rated the movie 9/10
