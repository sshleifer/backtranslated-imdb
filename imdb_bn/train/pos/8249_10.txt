My luck This movie really shows the talent of the actor. Billy Connelly flexes his acting muscles. Truly an amazing man, if you see him as a rebel as a rebel, as a madman / gunok Santos as a madman, and then finally as a zombie on the fido! Fido is awesome from its character attractive, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Ann Moss is no hack! As a dark character in the matrix and Momento, a heart warming conservative 1950's housewife! These days, annoying actors do not look so type-described. <br /> <br /> Above the story (no spellars, do not worry). This movie will be delighted by Max Brooks (Jabber Survival Guide and World Ward Z Writer)! Finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy. <br /> <br /> If you want zombies, you do not like zombies, if you're just annoyed, or if you are too busy, go see this movie!
