Artemisia was late late last night. At first I do not think that I like it, but seeing that I do not feel sleepy anymore, nothing else is happening, I see myself and think myself as young, fantasy, virgin, authentic and enthusiastic. Envoked her romance recognized feelings with the old Taseer. Although the film is very romanticized and not based on reality, I love it more than a normal biography or costume drama. Great game, great camerashots, great music and texts. I like it and I like it more! :-)
