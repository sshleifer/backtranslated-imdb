The best martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is better than what Bruce Lee never did. A classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts film and the real king of Kung Fu. It is tragic that Bruce Lee became so much more impressive, that it took Jackie Chan forever to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie rules !!!!
