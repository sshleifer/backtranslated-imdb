All right, let's face it. This is a God-awful movie. The plot (as it is) horrible, acting bad. But the film was created for one reason and for one reason, just like the horror Mario Lange ... I heard his voice in this star puberty. All right, so lenja movies were an excuse to hit her on the women, but this movie is about listening to Luciano. The price of watching movies that are alone. A big opera star clinging to himself faces his fears, finds love with humility and path, and belts many hits. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I am confused at several levels. I italian I'm a big fan fan (there's something about a wallet that's not big with its fan base?). And when I first saw this movie, I was going out of my own, watching the height and depth of the possibilities of life and the first time love. So as horrible as this movie, beautiful voices and memories are enough to make me breathe deeper life and love again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's corny and terrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is all about it So I hope this movie will be given a high rating, anyone who has never heard of the pawrati before, will listen and enjoy new music and new levels of love, especially since she is gone now. Like Italian food you have never tried before, try it! You may be pleasantly surprised, as a Luciano lover or potential Pavarotti Pip.
