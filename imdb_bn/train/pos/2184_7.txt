Although there was sufficiently adequate musicians, what was stuck with me about this movie was that of the unexpected comedic chemistry between Basil Rathbone, such as musician and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Playing a high adhesive, misleading artistic style (crying far away from his more familiar role as a mensing villain or coldly Logical Sherlock Holmes), the character of Rothbone seems to be that he can not get out of bed without help. And that help starbark, Oscar Levant played with his usual drill humor. After applying Crossbay's character as her ghost songwriter, Rothbone would tell her with Starbucks, "She thinks about me for me.", Levant responded, "Ah, it's only a part time job." Of course it goes to the correct (or more) Rathbone, who will come from his next hit song, which is very busy. Another critic said, who knows Rothbone is so funny! Very bad he did not have more chance to show his humorous talent.
