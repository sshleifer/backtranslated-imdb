This series is exactly like you m Expect from Spielberg It's really terrible, funny, kids show that you do not forget. Just like the outside limit (another great show), this little series can not do much. It was great, and is worthy of the long run. It was a great show that even the children could see, even though they wanted to be something, they were a little scary, but ultimately they all were moral (like twilight zones) that make you understand that you do not want to end any situations, or What you did. When I was watching something at Science I at the age of 10, I still enjoy having fun with them. Really a fun, fantastic show. I like it, and still do it.
