How nice! I've seen many bad low budget movies in recent times, but it's a great one. The real screenplay of the police life in a city on the East German coast is a strong contrast to other crime films or series. I refused the main actress and any conventional continuity about the police. This image is realistic as a documentary and at the same time entertaining as a play. A perfect tradeoff!
