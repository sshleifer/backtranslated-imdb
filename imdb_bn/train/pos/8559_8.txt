There is a certain talent behind this movie. I was laughing all over. This talent / humor was an excellent effort by the phone sex office scene, how to love Doplegagenja, love love. The numbers are poor, but you can see the author's message and they have some talent. At the end, Dopplenner was divided ... "All right, there was not much expectation but let's see what the movie said". Of course ridiculous, but a sweet idea and is actually very relevant to a strange story. <br /> <br /> Which film's logic can be logical or is it entertaining at a psychological level or communicating? I easily bothered by many movies, but kept my interest throughout this one. <br /> <br /> I think there may be some auto-geographic roots in the story, but it's a guess. Awesome bad, but good. I'm looking for other cinemas with this person (more experience).
