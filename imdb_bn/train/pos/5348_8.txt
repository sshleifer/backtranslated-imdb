Another excellent Arnold movie. It has done a great job in this predictive film and it is one of the best movies of Arne. Arnold made this film as a bad guy and played a game of death. This movie is excellent and a great psi / action movie. I always liked this movie and it would be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 out of 10! Perfection
