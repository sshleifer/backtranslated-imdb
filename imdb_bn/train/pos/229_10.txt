In today's world of digital fabrication there is no computer than replacing the actor and the writer. Well, this kind of "character driven" film is very rare till this day. As well as Duvall's performance James Earl Jones believes his audience high expectations. Am I surprised when this movie is made for TV? It has a "close up" personal value of personal value. It's extraordinary that performance is all extraordinary. The only thing to keep it from a movie masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer, but not everything beautiful pictures. How can Jones and Duval's choices contribute well in the age where the actor claims for digitizing?
