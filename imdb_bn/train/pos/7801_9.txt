This movie is using imaginative painters, the depth of the camera keeps every character in it. Dan Zel Washington and Kevin Kylline have performed exceptionally well, although the accent of Washington dies in certain scenes. How did you forget this movie? Unable to rent or rent in recent times it threatens to be lost forever. A worrying idea. Attenborough, at the best of his time from Ghani, this master piece stands for what should be done in such films, Sotheby's does not express any concern about the audience's achievement for independence. Although biased for a biased nature, the film is trustworthy. The message is authentic for the publication of Donald Woods's book and the world. ta and peace
