Another small part of the Holocaust's huge picture puzzle has been faced with this documentary about Berlin's Rosensrasta protests, the fact that I do not know, which began in late February 1943. This review by following the details. <br /> <br /> The description of the film sets the story of this demonstration among others, a contemporary story that begins in New York City. Here is a well-closed, irrational Jewish woman, whose husband has just died, a very ghost shocks her children and others by emphasizing the practice of mourning. The non-Jewish drunken girl of her daughter goes further in demanding leave. <br /> <br /> The sad girl Hannah (Maria Shader) first learned from the old cousin that in WWII's time Berlin was, her mother, then 8 years old, adopted and protected by an Arian woman. Hannah drops everything, goes to Berlin, and finds this woman Lena Fisher, now 90. Hannah instructs her to easily tell her story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Who has married Fébény (Martin Fifle), is a person arrested on Jewish concert Violinist, Rosastrassus site. <br /> <br /> This story is briefly knit from time to time at the present time and again in New York City. Currently the scenes are synthesized in color, 1943 scenes are washed away, solid on blue-gray tones. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The story of the protest is easily told. There is only one feature that will help: Ultimately text text still indicates the consequences of taking custody of Rosstras in terms of those results, which is a result which makes the addition as clear, incredibly positive as follows. <br /> <br /> Most movies in "Rosenthorrass" do not look good on critics' opinions. Too late, inappropriately laminated, purifier of stereotype of the penis, manipulative with music: so go to normal raps. It's too long. But I found a strong, powerful, spontaneous and fully convincing voice of protest in women in this film, from women residing in Regentas, where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wait for some harmful attacks to get you started in a few minutes. Later, the pride of the film was with me. As I often wake up at night, my mind is filled with faded, gentle, chaotic images and feelings filled with feelings. For me, that rarely happens.

Add <br /> <br />: Rosenthal's protest: what they were meant to have turned away from their forced labor force. The final roundup among the 1700 to 2000 Jews in the national capital, most men married non-Jewish women, they were stuck in Rosnextras 2-4, the welfare of the Jewish community in Central Berlin. The Jews were German relatives, many of them were very involved, Adolf Eichmann hoped that separating them from other prisoners would satisfy the family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps more than the worst destinations in Poland. <br /> <br /> Generally, the detainees are in custody for only two days before the loaded trains are loaded. But before the exiles were expelled, in this case, the wife and other relatives got wind of what was happening and first appeared at the address of Rosrastras, first in both, and then in the growing numbers. <br /> <br /> <br /> Probably participated in every six thousand protests, although not at the same time. For a week, women demanded their husband to come back day after day. Helpless, helpless, and leading, they face the most cruel powers at the disposal of the third verdict. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " In both cases, she was worried about the possible response to women's actions. Instead of being threatened by the threat of confidentiality of the "final solution" of privacy in the street and shooting women on the street, Goebbels released the Rosenthalists prisoners and even ordered to return 50 already. Send to Ashwit! <br /> <br /> This decision was inevitably postponed to both Hitler and Gaibel. But they were wrong. Almost all of the releases from Rosenthros survive in the war. Women won a wonderful victory over the forces of destruction. (From an article posted on the South Florida website, "Holocaust Teacher's Guide").
