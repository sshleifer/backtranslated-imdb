This image is like marmite. You love it or you hate it. If you expect this movie to have the right production quality, then you will hate a good plot and great characters. If you expect a low-budget slash in this movie, you'll probably hate it. <br /> <br /> If you go to this movie you will see it as a Harry sometimes seen in one of the most harmful characters in the movie. Jean Zainespo is completely brilliant on top of his insane, killer Coke Friend. <br /> <br /> Special effects are uncomfortable, but who really beware? If you are a person who is ready to see Skizzophrenic for the film: The morning Magellan you have undoubtedly seen the number of horror films in the grave. Even though the film was made with the budget, even it was created for it, perhaps it is always intermediate <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Whatever it will be a good thing from the bread # 2, I hate Maramite.
