"Elvira, Brain of the Dark" is a kind of "Harper Valley PTA." With the supernatural touch. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) gets fresh with the owner of the new station after her stop working as television horror movie hostess. She is now dependent on the Las Vegas show to carry through her, but she has to come up with more money to start learning. Things are hopeless to raise the money until his aunt's death notice is received, which would later take Elizabeth to Massachusetts to a will. A house for repair, a dog, and a dog book are kept by her aunt, and it seems as though Elvira is coming with money for Las Vegas show. Adults in small and narrow-minded cities make things even more difficult for Elvivor. Only local Hong Kong (Daniel Greene), and a group of thirteen friends will be friends with him. Elvira's aunt "Vinnie" (Dr. Morgan Sheppard) presses to make a deal with Elvira for the cookbook, but Elvira soon includes her strong tradition that includes spellcasting, and a couple learn very effective casseroles. Elvira does not want to sell his uncle's cookbook anymore, but he is determined to get his hands on knowing his power. Elvira then took part in a procession in the city's old museum, and in the procession between her and her aunt. The plot is quite simple, but it continues at a beautiful pace with comedians and upgraded versions. The movie "Elvira, Brain of the Dark" is full of beautiful, poor, stupid and cute humorous songs with beautiful goggles, legs, promos, songs and parodies. The disguised touch of the film is one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is made of a good film with great acting by all actors; Eddie McCallurg and Jeff Convay ("Greece") have a great effect. Many people (including myself) may be able to carry a feature film to the character of Elvis, and the answer is pleasing, yes!
