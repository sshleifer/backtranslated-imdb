Logically it's a very good "Siegel", better than the first live action film 101 Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good joke and all right slapstick! <br /> <br /> The Cruvella Devil, who got some great therapies, is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them. Craella is once a dog owner, with Clo Simon, many do not believe this. Others like Kevin Shepherd (owner of the second possibility dog ​​shelter) believe that he has changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the dopstick gave birth to three dalmatian dogs with his partner! Little Depar, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a good family film with exciting and much more! ! This is a painting snapshot of the film, but not so much like the last movie. It's more fun than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatian"! :-)
