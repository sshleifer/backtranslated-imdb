It's from your psychic comedy '30, it's a great plus, it's some well-known '30s low-quality features of the actors. <br /> <br /> The story is not original and basically the movie is all its fun and 'no-thoughts' overall kind of atmosphere, it's a common playback with comedy touch. Apparently this is a 'Cinderella story' but I did not think that way when watching the film. The story has become very annoying in the story, with different characters and many small cameos appearances, when the main characters hit the Hollywood studio. <br /> <br /> Of course Lorry & Hardie show them their appearance and some of their routines. It's like watching a movie and making Larry and Hardy short with it. Lorel and Hardy have made a look as regular Director of Walter Long Routine and James Finson (without the difficulty of this time). <br /> <br /> It is sure that the main plot line and character confused by all the cami and concerts but there is no problem in this case, since it is more interesting than the plot line and shallow general main character and interesting. <br /> <br /> This is not worse than any other movie from the same time, though the rating here would otherwise be recommended. <br /> <br /> 7/10
