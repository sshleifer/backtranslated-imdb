This movie is just great. From the beginning to the end it is entertaining, you will always be the edge of your seat across the entire movie. In my opinion, this film is very obscure by critics. <br /> <br /> Grey Walker's role of Sly's well-trained mountain-rescuer is quite appropriate. Together with him Michael RÃ¶mer makes a great look as Hal Tucker. And then, John Litgo, one of the best performers I've seen him as a villain. <br /> <br /> And 75% of the film happened with a lot of bad guys on a hill. It makes the way for many actions! <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie!
