I was very excited when I was finally playing Patrick Soowz on King Solomon's mine. I was expecting a great Indiana Jones type action adventure. What I got was 4 hours long (including commercial) epic that was very slow. The second and third hours have been completely excluded and the story does not have to be enjoyed for it. The last was good (no spoilers here) but I still had more left to want. The way the Suez can make "Road House 2" can hunt, so he can go back to the action style which makes him famous. The 1985 version is not very good with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, but a fan of King Solomon's Mike is even more than seeing the 1985 version, but its life has gone for 4 hours instead of one hour and 40 minutes.
