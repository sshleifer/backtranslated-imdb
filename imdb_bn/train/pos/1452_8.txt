Being a transplanted New Yorker, I can be most important to see the City Hall. But I want to say that even before the story reached before, I was influenced by location shooting and the political atmosphere of New York City which created director Harold Baker. <br /> <br /> For example, Warner's restaurant has a reference in Brooklyn where the political boss Frank Anselo likes to eat. While living in New York in 1996, I was at Wonner's Restaurant in Rensen Street in Ramsen Street, Brooklyn. This was actually in favor of political parties of Boro, although they had some hangouts. <br /> <br /> No surprise because the script was written by Nicholas Piaggi's co-authors who still wrote both political and organized crime stories. He knows very well in the atmosphere and he certainly knows how they work in this film in this two world. <br /> <br /> An Detective group led by Nader Serno did an unauthorized meeting with a relative of Anthony Fransias and exploded things and three people died, one of whom was a innocent 6-year-old boy whose father was walking to school. Story mushroom and finally it reached the city hall. <br /> <br /> Al-Pasino mayor John Papass and John Cusack are his deputy mayor, a replacement Louisiana, a state, which has a UN Corruption tradition. He is trying to control the external and damage, Cusack has found more than it is necessary, <br /> <br /> Danny Iillo Brooklyn's Political Leader Frank Anselmou Acting and in New York for you, the late Borough President of Queens Donald Mans on the basis of his character was also brought to the scam. He was kind of like Brooklyn's politician, I knew the day, because of his friendship with friendly crimes and due to his actions, Elelo would do. <br /> <br /> City Hall was an act of farewell for Anthony Fran√ßoise. The most implicit and less appreciated talents on the screen. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is a complex part, she takes a decent enough man, but caught in a place like corruption in New York. <br /> <br /> City Hall is highly recommended for those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple.
