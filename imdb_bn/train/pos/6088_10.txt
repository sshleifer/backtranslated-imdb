Was the script more suitable for 30 minute sitcom? Yes, but they still work on it! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with the fake script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on board seem to hate this image. I personally can not see it, but it's just one of the movies that you love it or hate it. Many have been created like the Napoleonic Dynamite and Leslie Nilssen. You think it's the worst movie ever made or the most fun. Do not avoid this movie due to the reviews. See it and see to be the one who really loves you! If you, I guarantee it's worth your money. If you do not like it ... well, you know now.
