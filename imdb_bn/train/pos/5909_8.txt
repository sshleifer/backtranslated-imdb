I remembered at the age of five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie .... when the brass and bullets started flying. I agree with this movie that everyone and everyone will be pleased because it is set to discriminate between everyone and anyone .... but the truth is as fun as hell. I recommend this to those who prefer classical classic. Also try to live the Fritz cat and Cat Fritz's minimum. If I say right then Ralph Bashkiei did the film. It has a cat that can spend a lot of time with family, street, job, etc. When I was old I hired these movies. Coonskin was labeled as a street fighter because it was an offensive title since the ages. Ralph Bashki played the role of Brad Pitt in the role of Cool World. Heavy traffic was another cartoon that worked on the life of a young man.
