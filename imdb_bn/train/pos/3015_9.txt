Why such a compact, entertaining mystery can not be portrayed in the new century? It puts viewers all the way to thinking and guessing. Cast a great ensemble William Powell displays the true star quality. Who knows - perhaps he was rehearsing for his future as Nick Charles. He is a joy to see. Why Eugene has made more than 200 films in the Palestine? He is a great supporting character actor and his fun chemistry with Powell to watch fun. Mary Astor is not above the average work of a very muscular role. In all 73 minutes, it is a completely enjoyable way to create all other hand chips. I pointed out Michael Cartidge as one of his balls. Say!
