The most watcher and funny Brooks movie I've ever seen. I can see the 100 times tape clock and watch again. I smile a ** off of mine and I cry at some point. It's really good and funny movie, and if you want Brooks - this is a must! In a nutshell - Brooks (Billionaire) gets out on the streets as homeless for 30 days to win the entire poor district from the entire rival. The reality bites, but ultimately - the warm relationship between humans ... Haiti recommendations!
