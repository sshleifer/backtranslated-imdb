<br /> <br /> I think this is not the best movie ever made, but I have voted 10 of them the same way. Mainly ended my feelings due to the reason. I and all the people around me are simply touching. This is something that you do not often feel like. We all are a bit ridiculous and excited by the promotion of tenderness, lazy manipulation or modern films. The story of the film is around Jane, a young girl around Jane and the center of a friendship that grew between Richard and Richard at the end of a break. It can be a dull and fragile piece easily, but it is very ridiculous, lack of humorous and uncomfortable, that it has completely won you and a good film against impairment. <br /> <br /> The performance of Brunge and Bonham-Carter is remarkable, especially modern, who is always credible and strong in his role. Chemistry between the two also took the picture and lifted it. <br /> <br /> The title comes from a master of Richards Masterpiece, Junk and his old image. Here is a symbol for living the life of Richards and Jensen in full life so that someone can bear and the other can face up to the end. <br /> <br /> is a beautiful and funny movie that I'll recommend to anyone. Do not let the subject close you.
