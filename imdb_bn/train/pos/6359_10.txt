If you go to this movie to go to see some huge award-winning Academy Awards ... oh well .. but if you want to see the fun classic adaptation of the old classic, you would love it .. Jim Carey was as unbelievable as usual. The storyline was great, it was made better by some parts like Greenwich History. Ron Howard does not miss a beat. However, although some adlot comments and clauses have been added, it should be a kids or family show. Do not try to lose this scene. If you really do not enjoy the movie ... and to comment on Ron Howard, try to manage a major motion picture and see how you look. ...
