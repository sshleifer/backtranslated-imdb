I picked this photo at my local library. After meeting director at a movie festival late last year, I was interested in "check out" his work. I was glad <br /> <br /> The photo takes a new look about the familiar matter, love, infidelity, friendship, jealousy. It can sometimes be a little 'Taki' but it will not take so long to sink the film completely. I was enjoying a love story with characters that was clearly together and saw conscious decisions rather than "falling" important things like love. <br /> <br /> Shoot the black film opposite this movie and the average low budget M 'is quite different. See it If you are lucky then your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like me. Good thing
