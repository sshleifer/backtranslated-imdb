35 years ago Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Aning Bicker once again gathered together to create three songs called "Cream". Those who had cyclical days in England and America and this people saw this: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a mixture of rock and blues and it was the best thing in most cases. Well, these guys are now 60-years old and they still can play and play at high level and this shows us as a wonderful DVD concert disc. I was always very familiar with Clapton, of course, who was never out of extremism, but I do not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, among whom I have not seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, the unemployed was so shocked that he saw a movement near death. Now she looks healthy, shaped and her drum was difficult to play. Bruce looked a little disturbing but his voice was very good, as well as before, and enjoy listening to these old songs. It's just amazing stuff and they're doing it from people who know what they're doing. <br /> <br /> Some people condemned this show at least. I do not agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very well The second song, "Spoonful" was outstanding, the concert highlights for me. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
