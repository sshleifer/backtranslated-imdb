I love Eddie Ezard. I think this is awesome, and the other television specials should look as well. There is also "Dress to Kill" to buy a good book, which I think should be read by humans. I liked that this program won an Emmy, and someone who likes history would probably get a smile from Eddie. Enjoy :)
