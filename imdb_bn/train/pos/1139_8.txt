There are a few comedy like this, where almost every line and every character comes near neutral. It's very fun !! And there's a lot of sarcasm in it there. Sally Field is really outstanding actor title in the field and a good, if not perfect, her day working with TV-Diva. Sometimes his acting is slightly broad and above, but 90% of time he is a riot! Kevin Clayne, Robert Doni Jr. and Hypie Goldberg in the same league (unfortunately there are very few here). Donny Jr. can not fully believe as a curiosity and his time is not always right, but he struggles with his part which is honest, most ungrateful. But here is the shining star Cathy's Marriott Celeste, if the real worry is to hide a lot of nasty secrets (you'll see the final final!). Unfortunately Elizabeth Schu does not seem quite comfortable in her part. I usually like Miss Shue, but here he seems to be working as a fish as a fish and sometimes to be a different movie. But it is not harmful, and in most part it is at least adequate. Otherwise, a comedy to watch with memorable lines and situations, it's on TV or wherever it is.
