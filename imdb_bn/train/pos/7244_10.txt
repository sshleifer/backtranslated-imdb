This bridge features only the full length feature film about the world. I got the first 10 minutes slow, but then, the film describes the professional bridge players and how they are told to earn a living is absolutely perfect. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very funny. I do not think a non-bridge player will get the kiss of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some dresses are really beautiful, the movie is black and white painful - I can only imagine what they can look like in color. The way the media is portrayed is absolutely sunny. There is no way in the world's bridge that will never be there. See <br /> <br /> as soon as possible, and tell your friends about it.
