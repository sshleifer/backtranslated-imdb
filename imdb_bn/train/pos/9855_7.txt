This is my first cgi animated film that I have ever seen. Generally, the appearance of other animated films makes me mad at seeing them. Ice is not the age. I smiled at the trailer with laughter and laughed and laughed <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story originally set an animated version of The Men and a Baby, lasting 20,000 years ago. The visual was great. Just beautiful The only thing to build strong solidarity is that the components of the apparently arrested items are quite different, and the ice age is great for seeing its stylized visual visions.
