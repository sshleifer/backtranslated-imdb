At the Covent Garden Opera House, at least a little inspired by actress Ivy Benson and her all-girls orchestra, the film tries to play an older Saxophone player (almost) all the girl band with her as a schoolgirl at the end of WWII. All the short flashbacks of the original band on the stage bring us some nice music and help the band members fill the background, and especially the relations with the only male member of the girls - their Transvestite Drama (who is trying to call-up the DOS) <br /> < > Ian Holm ("Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judy Dale's recent widow Elise Beth acted as a great performer and congratulations, naribadikarana Patrick, drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as the band's leader, now playing the bar piano beside the ocean, and the June Whitfield Salvation Army is burning as a trombone player. Other great actors such as Cleo Line, Leslie Carn, Olympia Dukakis and Billy Hotel have created this unforgettable experience. The film is a slow down-down memory lane, which by all rights, there will be a bunch of mountain actresses with all stars cast. What I can say is that I hope I will look good in their age! Leslie Caron, in particular, at the age of 69, is still incredible fox. He's still going to pulse me! I saw it, I'm empathizing the casting director mentally for not using appropriate age women. Afterwards, I looked at these girls and found that each of them was very old enough to play in London in 1944 (though it could be a part of the Judy Dunk). <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie, if you like the swing band, improve nostalgia, or just want to see how well a woman can handle behind her at least three quarters of a century. <br /> <br />
