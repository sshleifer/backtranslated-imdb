I did not think when I first heard about this movie, but I hired it six years ago, and it is still one of my favorite comedies. I admit, you probably hate this movie if you do not know anything about rap music. But if you are a rap fan, even a casual, you love jokes and references inside. One of the best lines in the movie is the difference between **** and an H **; I still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it. One of the best performances is Larry Scott, who played Nerad Lemer's 'Nader's Revenge'. It is unfortunate that this movie probably will not get a DVD release.
