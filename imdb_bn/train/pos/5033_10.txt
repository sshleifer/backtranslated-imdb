It's a movie that after watching it, you'll be thinking and coming back after a few months after watching. Spectacular for the acting of two children (I usually hate the movie with whiny infants played). Bill Paxton is awesome, his director is better than an actor whose most memorable line is "Games, Man! Game Finishes!" (From movie "Alliance"). <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is in the scenes where the actor plays a family and when they are doing their "work". This really makes the movie credible and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it, Bill. I'll wait for more movies "I'm sure of love!
