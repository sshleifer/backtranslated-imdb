For the first time I saw, I did not smile too much. At that time, I was only fifteen years old and I thought that some humorous humor was able to understand for me that time. A few months ago I had seen it for a second time, and at the same time, there were similar reactions, because the attempt of suicide at Felix's suicide at the beginning of the film became a bit dark. This scene tells some of Oscar and later Felix appears to be discouraged by acting in movies, and their personality clashes are not as ridiculous as they might have been. If I did not know the story before, then I feared that some inconsistencies in the Oscars could push Felix to the edge. As it was, so did Jack Clogman and Tony Randall do not smile or laugh like a television show. Nevertheless, above all, is a beautiful movie and it is one of the greatest sitikamas on television. 10 out of 7
