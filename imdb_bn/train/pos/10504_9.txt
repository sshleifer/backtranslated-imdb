Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very fun and very cool game for N64. Bowser is up to its usual shenanigans (yes it's a fool word but only one I can think) and Mario will stop him again. This game is very fun to play, and I have many nostalgia. The only bad thing about this is the graphics, which are awful for today's standards, but everything else is quite good (especially the small mini-games that you can unlock). This is the second best N64 game (the worst of the first year, the worst is the bad fee) Mario fan, or recommend a fan of platform games. It brings out the middle Super Mario Sunshine any day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A.
