About ten years ago I saw this picture once. I bought the DVD two days ago and after seeing it, it seemed that it was even better than me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The paperhouse is much more than just a horror. It's such an amazing level of passion and great characteristic running through it. I particularly thought Charlotte Burke was really nice here. So sad she did not do any other work, because she was an excellent actress. Emotional screenplay across the world matches the exact message, especially at the end when he realized that Mark had died, but he knew he was going to be okay. <br /> <br /> Several scenes make me jump (which is annoying to me on modern horror films), especially the Bathtub scene, where the scene where Ana's father is seen in the background with strange radio and on foot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
