Coming up to the issue of brutalism, a film about ideas. Many films present an aspect of the future, but some efforts to show how our future is seen. The first part of the movie, when war comes to every city, small but powerful. (Wickedly, filmmakers laughed at the accusation of attacking England in the years of Liberation War, that the slogan was at its height. Wells's prediction came out very soon.) Following the continuous battle mood, par model works, the most effective. Explanatory title: German Expressionist graphic design is strongly remembered. Art director was great William Cameron Menezes, and his set of relics of Evertai are among his best works. Margaretta is very seductive as Scott's mistress. An equally attractive design of every city of the 21st century. The story of 21st century story is not compulsory - perhaps it was an unwelcome effort against the technological rationality of this time with the brutality of the 1970s. Unfortunately, the model work represented by the angry mob is frustrating as well, and even 30s have been done with much better work. This is particularly impressive because of the very strong beliefs of giant aircraft scenes. This film is released by concluding the remarkable lecture of Ramm's Messes - rarely the standard of scientific progress has been released. Massez's final question is now more relevant now, in the hard-working Manded Spaceflight era. This scene is supported by the music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose last name I proudly share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, VHS versions of this movie are absolutely awesome with serious technical issues. Most versions have edited an interesting mood than predictive workers and machines that take us from 1970 to 2038. I hope the whole DVD has a good DVD.
