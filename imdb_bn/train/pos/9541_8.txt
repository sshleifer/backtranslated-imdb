Wow wow, this is really some delicate Asian horror / gore, and a crazy ornamented movie. This is a Japanese splatterfest which reminds me of Tetsuo, except in this case, except for all blood and void, there is a wicked love story. It is difficult to imagine how they dreamed of this visible stunning film, some unique aliens that infect humans as parasites, make them partners or think I am a cyborg. The only mistake after taking these animals away is that they can kill each other and ate another. Hmmm, yum yam This would probably be something like that splatter or art called, to add all the fun to a fun soundtrack. The film lends a bit to the carpenter's "The Thing" among animal designs and effects. I would definitely put it in the required category for Gaurhunds, because nonstop hawn and some very fine grains. And for a stoners, you do not have to read the sub-title alone because the visual image alone is a mind-trip enough. The design of small creatures living in the body of the embryo reminds me a little of Frank Hennellotter's movies, which is another tribute to some of the finest gore films, including humorous ideas. "Meatball Machine" Great fun for Gorehound, no doubt, and I just like it.
