Roman Polanski plays Treklovski, hired an apartment in France. The previous tenant is in a hospital after trying to commit suicide. He went there to see him where he met Stella (Isabelle Adjani), Simon's friend. She and Stella are pretty close, then Simon died. Terlovski landlord began to think and neighbors tried to change him so that he would eventually get out of the window. Since 1976, the last film of the Le Troslachi (Tenant) Polannski Apartments Trilogy The previous ones were the children of Raplen and Rosemary. Ramon Polanski did not work as a director but his performance was fantastic. Isabella Adjani with her big glasses is wonderful. Landlord, Monsieur J. Great Melvin Douglas Van Fleet plays Madame Deauz. Excellent Shell Winters Concert. Tenant is very scary from time to time. It gives many psychological fears. This movie is not the easiest to understand or interpret. It makes it all so attractive.
