I first saw it at a foreign movie festival. It's a beautiful luxurious nail-bitter that is about a billion Estonian treasures to be set free from gold. Hollywood shot it in a great, cool style that uses very little - but it retains the newly released Baltic state's atmosphere beautifully (remember: in 2003 when Tallin was actually much less bad). <Br /> <br /> There are many comedies and some romance. I do not want to waste a lot of stellings yet logical surprises, so I'll only ask this fantastic movie to start with a great script, and guidance and performance top notch. The Darkness is the fastest and most nervous example of variation in TALLIN - I put it above raiyphai, TOPKAPI, and new OSIAN 11, although it's not (deliberately) as shiny. Rent or buy it now.
