Now I have always been a fan of full Moon doll works. But I would say that robot jox is a good project Yes, you heard me. The story works wonders, the environment really works and actors do a first rate job. Gary Graham shows that he really can be the action star who will take away the donkey and take the name, making really his mark on television like the Allian National Series and Star Tray Enterprise. The stop motion effect can be a tiny bit better. The color was wrong, instead they seem to be metal, instead they look like they look at the plastic. But the smallest complaint is the robot jacks, if you like Gary Graham or other full moon movies, you would love this movie. 10 out of 10 stars
