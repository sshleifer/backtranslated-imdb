The Spanish director Augusti Villarangar's latest film explores the experience of violence and isolation among their remote communities, which develops among frustrated young adults, which require specific mental resources to deal with their secret psychological weaknesses. Whether these tools are followed by the level of rituals, care for others or if only a male image is placed while being attracted to prostitution, successful testing of this success affects the influence of three teenage girls in Spain under Villaranga Franco. Before the three witnesses became naughty, they witnessed dual deaths or their friends, and later they killed their colleagues with feelings of weak body, until they again met again in the hospital for patients suffering from patients. <br /> <br /> The symmetric style of the curriculum is generally visually appealing from Spanish ottur and it is a very memorable piece of fellow Spanish pedro Almodorovic that deals with sexual matters related to both sexes in both sexes and homosexuals. Different elements between the two directors, Vilaronga, support a unique supernatural spiritual support with clostrophobic, which opposes the use of Almodovar's supernatural, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> There are violence and scenes disturbing the young mentality and disturbing a sexual nature that gives insights into bitter frustration. I highly recommend watching this movie because it is such a component that will be viewable after viewing the viewer for a considerable period of time.
