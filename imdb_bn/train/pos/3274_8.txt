This is one of the 80 films I can remember that was sadly ignored at that time and, unfortunately, was still ignored. The other one was ClownHouse, directed by Victor Salva, who scoffs critically because of the legal / sexual issues of Salva. Another camera's closet that will reduce me as a bit underrated - not great, but the reviews I've seen are not nearly as bad. The paper house is valuable to your time and I think it is one of the silent movies that's just stuck in your brain for a long time. I mean, after 10 years I have seen it and I still give some breaks, but what I saw 6 months ago has gone into Etha.
