Acting This film is a very well played film. I would say that performance is a little weak at times; But in most cases, acting is very good. The only actor to expel me for his performance is Zenne La Harlan Maguire She was incredible! Tom Hanss seemed vague on some points throughout the film, but he was also incredible. Paul Newman, always good. Cinematography This movie has created an excellent composition (and I rarely use that term). Conrad is a true genius. If you break it at any time in the movie, you can see the work that is made of this man. He has set up each shot so that nothing is left. When the camera is still there, there is a postcard like the quality on the screen. While the camera is moving, every shot is designed to be understated perfection. But it does not stop there. Contrast and contrast between colors and lighting and dark settings is a work of the Conrads industry. He worked some of the most amazing lights I saw in the light of the set light. This movie made its work what it did. The film is topped by the list of best cinematography with LTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge, and Vertigo. The story will tell people this film is gangster Fleck of 1930 but I believe they miss the point of the movie. It's a love story about a hit man that he chose to try to protect his life. This is a brilliantly made story that becomes a beautiful bond between the two, with none other than the other. Screenwriting is an Oscar worthy. Music Thomas Newman conducted a sad but upbeat score to make this sad but upbeat story intensify. I made some of the most beautiful and ongoing scores in the song. Guidance Sam Mendes is a new director with a feeling of an experienced director. The roles that he uses and the performances he received from his actors are an irony in the world of today's filmmaking. I will be hidden for the next Sam Mendes film. 10/10 One of the most moving and beautiful movies I have ever seen.
