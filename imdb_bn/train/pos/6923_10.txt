Without the possible exception of John Owen's spin-bearing spinner, no other actor was far taller than the West Stands of James Stewart, and this film proves that. This remarkable story of centralized revenge near Winchester Rifles is my only weak spot, which I can remember: Casting as Will's Gear's very neutral Wyatt Earp. The villain cast was good: Steven McNally, Deadly Dutch Henry, Dan Durrya, Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntyre (both good boys and bad guys are versatile to both play). Stiefert and McNally are great on the middle arches! I will stack today's west against the entire western part of this western region. They will not have a chance!
