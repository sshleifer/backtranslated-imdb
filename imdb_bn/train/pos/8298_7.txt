Better than the commonly-made TV movie, Invention to Hell is pleased with the excellent casting (Ureich, Lucie, Cassidy, McCarthy, Pre-Murphy Brown Joe Rigalbutto, Solle Chun-Fry) and a high-profile update of the known Fostian plot. . Urchich is always preferable and lukewarm all female fatty mothers are especially fetching and devilishly above. A hybrid version of Stephen Wies and The Live Live, the film starts from its mysterious Miltonesque perspective and the horror fans probably will not have much complaints until soppy, maudlin denoument. 7/10
