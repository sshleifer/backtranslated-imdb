I love Sabrina! It's one of my fave shows !! My favorite episodes are; Where he turned Liby into a singer, the first episode, the true love episode and the rest of the first series. I think college classes were not as good as high schools, but they were better than last series which was awful. Wellerie was a better character than Genie, but Jenny was in some wonderful episodes. Hilda and Gelda were amazing, and there was no explanation where they went! Libby was very good character. I do not like Morgan or Roxie, they were not as good as their other friends.
