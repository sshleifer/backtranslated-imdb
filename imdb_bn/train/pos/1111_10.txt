It's "very bad that's not good", it's perfectly good! Those who do not understand have four-year-old intelligence (as a reaction to a specific comment ...) However, eating a deadly tomato, France itself is a parody, a parody of me and a parody to me. This is the single most talented text in the history of the movie. Me and sitting on my DVD shelves beside it three prequels Herzog and Kurosawa. It recognizes irrationality and reduces the number of people you call me or money. I write scripts and this movie has opened a form of comedy for me alone, which we have never seen. It can only be taken in part ... its kind of exploitation ... So far I have been trying to take the minimum ten lines. My comment ended a few minutes ago. Hope it will work if it is submitted now.
