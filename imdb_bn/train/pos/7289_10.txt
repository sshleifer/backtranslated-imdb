It was one of the first crape movies I've ever seen ... I was then about 5. It's a good fear of me! But that night I kept chewing gum in my eyes like a monster ... and my mother was very upset. He had to clean my eyes with alcohol and the next day my eyes had a smell like double mint! Now that's a movie! Hey there it was a great movie at the time. That was as real as sitting on top of Head Lab Counter's top as it got back. And if your 5 is it scary too! The kids now show too much that a day is spoiled by special effects and leave nothing for your mind to imagine. Your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects! (IMO)
