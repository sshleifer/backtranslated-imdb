Director Sidney Lumet Network, Do Some Good Compositions Like Dog Day or Afternoon But he was not very lucky in his recent works. Gloria (1999) was unfortunate and the Find Me Gilli was an interesting but failed test. Now, Lumet has brought her best film for decades and, by my perspective, a real masterpiece: you've died before the Devil. I think this movie is like rebirth for Lumeet. This movie is a wonderful story that has a deeper, many levels. Also, I think the end of the movie is perfect. Performance is bright. Philip Simmur Hoffman has naturally brought a great performance and he is, of course, one of the best actors of our days. Ethan Huq is a wonderful actor but he got inspiration from my perspective. Its performance is excellent here. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially, great Albert Finney) but these two actors brought memorable performances which sadly ignored the kind-hearted Oscars. The film has a good level of significance, part with the performance and, in part, thanks to the great screenplay. Devil Knows gives you a perfect masterpiece with perfect aspects of Dead, a great screenplay and extraordinary performance. We need more such films.
