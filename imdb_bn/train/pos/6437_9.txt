A famous conductor decided to return to the village after a heart attack, where he was born to a quiet life. There, he came to the Dutch with the lyricist of the local church, which would change his life. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when I had no hope; I do not like to see foreign movies which are not English, and I have already seen some of my life in Swedish films, but this is still the best. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? In my opinion, this image is a gem, thanks to many things, of which an outstanding performance. Michael Nyqvist is thoughtful, almost as shy and dedicated conductor Daniel Dar√©us as perfect. Beautiful Frida Hallgren is enchanting with her beautiful smile and her subtle acting. The guitar members have all the advanced, attractive characters with their own story. <br /> <br /> This movie depicts a story, a beautiful story, song, love, pain, memory, death, his life in a song about a man, and in the village, while maintaining peace with the past and living the way of his living. He was born and tried to create peace there. Kay Pollack shows us that Swedish outstanding movie makers. See Sam I Hemelen, a movie that makes you think about life and love, and this is also a little comforting.
