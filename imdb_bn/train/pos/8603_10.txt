The movie is a fantasy. The line of the story is thin but works as a framework that is sung some nice songs and is sung well. (I still can not believe that such beautiful and attractive people can sing well.) Some conversations are surprisingly clever. Since 1942, I was watching a fashion show in a house comedy, though dresses made me think. <br /> <br /> The film is designed to serve different purposes. This one is designed to be entertaining and it certainly does. If I have a negative comment, it would be that Nestle Eddy was very young, which could be a handsome dashing county. Some closeups close me uncomfortable. But he can still sings and sings glorious. However, Giant McDonald was as good as ever. She makes a spectacular angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is good before my time, and I'm new to Genit McDonald / Nelson Eddie and related conversations. The music is beautiful in this movie. Since I love the classic rock music that fills most modern movies, I have no question that the music is simple and clearly more memorable, more joyful, better. They are more meritorious than the stars I see in today's movie theater. And Beverly Hills, without the benefit of plastic surgeons, Genet McDonald, I can see today is even more beautiful than that. Why do I apologize so much to the liking of this movie and more generally to choose this group of movies? They say that it is dated and try to explain why this is it. And those who do not like it, it's not very good, but what's the comparison? I think the film will still be surprised that many movies will be entertained when people forget for a long time. In this movie there are only very high quality in every way that can not be remembered and enjoyed. I recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent, great looks and great music.
