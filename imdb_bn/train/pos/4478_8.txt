Overall it is a delightful, light hearted, romantic, musical comedy. I think the film can be made a small case for a long time. But I'm not sure what you will spend Kelly and singing singing? No Kelly is not that nice dance? No Does the movie take time to develop and develop character relationships? No (It seems to be a common complaint that many recent movie characters do not develop) <br /> <br /> <br /> Some comments that Itabbee did not bring much to the movie, but it looks like us and 1040s To hear a great talent from. So if she is not an actor? He was an important part of the movie as a basic fundamental plot to get Grace with a myth. <br /> <br /> Basically, Catherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. The girl who brought her a MGM for a screen test included an Aria. During his audition in the film, there was a shot of MGM Brass and laughing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can see why Frank Sinatra became his star. Sintra (still a female man) wanted to find a date going on vacation, a nice counter-point in the film. You'll feel better after watching this movie. 7/10
