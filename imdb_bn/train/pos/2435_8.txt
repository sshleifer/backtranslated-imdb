I think old cartoons will bring tears in my eyes! When I first bought Kaspers and friends: Spooking about Africa, I wanted to see the first Kaspersky cartoon, The Friendly Hot (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, House Good Bus to Night (1948), it broke me! I could not believe how sad and sad after killing Kaspershire fox! Other Kaspers cartoons have not seen anything! This is one of the saddest one! It was very depressing, I just could not see it again. It's just like to see Lassie's death at the end of a movie. I know it's a classic, but it's much more for old cartoon fans to handle like me! I wanted to see some old and classic, I rather see something happy and funny! But when I think about this Kaspersky cartoon, then think about my cat!
