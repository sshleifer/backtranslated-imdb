This event was absolutely fantastic, and I was always looking forward to seeing it. All the characters were their own fun and awesome, giving each stage non-stop laugh and it was completely entertaining and different from many other shows. . Everyone was absolutely mad and sensationally funny, that you can not love this show. There were a few deadweight episodes, but they were always directed to create a customized environment where the show of '70 was really where it really happened. This was one of the best programs of all time, and at any time I can see this event, because it does not become old, never irrational and never become uninterested.
