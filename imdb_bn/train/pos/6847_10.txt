I'm just looking at dressed-to-teal, which is written and directed by Brian de Palma. DVD is both "R" version and irregular version. I chose unrated version.i because I still can not see the "R" rate. Version, I can not be completely sure of the differences. However, this version has a very graphic graphic female nudity with a clear expression of clarity. I guess you can do this scene softcore porn. This type of thing can insult you, I suggest you show the "R" rated version. However I digress Any comments from here refer to the irregular version. This is the mystery of the murder / psychological horror / suspicious film. It is very little violence and blood. But the continuity of a section of death. This killing is roughly graphic. But the blood that does not really show it. This reminiscent of how the 70's slash film will look. I believe it is intentionally done to give a view to the scene, mostly due to the violence of the budget, or the possibility of offsetting the violence itself. This movie is very good. As far as I can say, the view of each scene was very rare compared to today's movies. However, I was also good at acting, especially Angie Dickinson. And Mikhail Cain played quietly in his role, which works brilliantly in this case. This picture also has a great turn in my mind, although some people might get it predicted. The only complaint (and it is more of an observation) is that I consider that the character played by Nancy Allen has been fleshed more, especially in her most screen time. But I think he works well with what he has given. And it does not really go away from the quality of the film. This film is a more rugged moral, which is more relevant today. But the film also really liked Pinoy Dinajiao's music score. The original Cycote music was very similar. To me, this music really enhanced the movie. I think the film is bright. For me, Dressed to Toll (1980) is 10/10
