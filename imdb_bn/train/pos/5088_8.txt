I did not cry while watching the movie meant for the movie box. I always thought it was a very successful movie at the end of the 90's. But on the internet I saw it was for TV, I was shocked because it is absolutely fantastic for a television movie! <br /> <br /> The thing that I was most concerned about was the length. I think that one of the war scenes should be completely removed as unnecessary. Also, by the end, it began to drag, as if it seemed that the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> Plus, there is a strong, very interesting and fascinating plot with great performance by everyone. I felt that Patrick Freyze looked a bit weird. I also felt that the Gog, looking at some scenes, became somewhat stupid. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see the beautiful scenery of Africa. Also, the first half of the film gave me this movie 9. However, this is a great movie for television. 10 out 8
