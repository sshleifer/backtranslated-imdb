Stephen Rideau was already a star for his tour D-ball, "Wild Rids", and he is one of the biggest indie stars in France. In this movie, he is a Cedric, a local man who meets Matthew (on holiday holidays in Jamie Elkim, surprise, dancing, miraculous performance). Masu has a complex relationship with his ill mother, asks aunt and sister (with whom she has a competitive relationship). Soon, the two are falling in love. <br /> <br /> The fractal narrative of the film - which includes long flashbacks, bits and pieces of the current, and in the real-time forward-movement in the future. - A little harder. Director Sebastian Lifetzt does not indicate whether we are in any period, and it may be difficult to follow the story line. But keep it up: The final 45 minutes of the film is so mad that you can not take your eyes out of the screen. To break the heart and lift, this movie must be seen as a "beautiful things" to watch movies.
