Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Janet Aman (Jasabir / Jones) are raised in the family of single parents. Jasabir (sister) grew up in a rich environment but was not enough to lead him to reject his life and eventually joined the Hippi movement, which eventually led him to medicine. On the other hand, the sage (brother) grew up in a less prosperous environment but became mature mature man. The story marks the attempt to protect her younger sister from the ambivalence of the opponent's hippie. This film has stood the test of time, commenting that slogans and hippies leave the group for their lives, when they should stand and count in the face of disaster. In this film, great music compositions give different things to different people and different things, and the director expresses his stupid feelings.
