Surely one thing ... if you have a bad day then you will not see this film. The story is based almost a sad incident and follows a character, that he must live with a sin that he can not manage. The story is fed to you instead of the usual stupid statement so that it is amazed by what is happening. Eventually the point is joined and performance makes sense. All the characters are OK and there is another good day at the Will Smith office. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that many moral questions should be asked, but if you only accept his apologies and want to buy it is easy to accept what he has chosen. Irrespective of whether you agree or disagree. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Will.
