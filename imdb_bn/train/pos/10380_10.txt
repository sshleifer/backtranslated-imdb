In 1976, I just went to the ceylon. I was 23 years old and was married for three years, and started coming out as a homosexual. I saw this movie on the old black and white TV, terrible reception, alone, and uninterrupted, which seems to be a reflection of the story in an awakening. I was living in a small house in Tucson Arizona, and it was warm ... like everyone else, I did not forget the feelings of the picture of this story and the remnant of the fragile magic, and I hope that I hope I will see it again. I'll keep in check. I want someone to make a movie on the other side of Sheryl Varel's Venus. It has some of the same delicacy and continual poignancy ...
