I love this picture and it's a wonderful example of a family danger, romantic love story, and a very sad story plot. Everything was just so perfect and nice about this film. It was such a big mix of actors and actresses, and with a lot of smile and a lot of crying, the film deserved a lot of rewards. Beautiful scenes mentioning, and although I would add this movie to this notebook and The Family Stone, it was much more tricky, sad and brighter than those movies. In the evening, a little girl has a dream story in her little years dreaming, and her two daughters are not good at staying beside her. Dating back to the story was so firmly told and I was sitting on the edge of my seat. You really know all the letters and eventually, I wanted to see all of that again. This is a surprisingly tragic and definitely played and planned film which is really a kind of and it's really amazing to see. All the performances are amazing and the movie draws your attention from the very beginning and never lets go. I liked it, and it was really a wonderful movie that I was so glad that I saw it ...
