This is a good adaptation, but the TV version is not as good. Actors are usually okay but I've seen Jeremy Northam as a Mr Knightle, especially compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is okay and his English pronunciation is quite good but again, I like Kate Beckinsale's Emma. There are excellent support performance from Tony Colette, Juliette Stephenson and Sophie Thompson. <br /> <br /> This script has often played a lot to laugh, the book is a comedy, but there are many set pieces in Gaga, and Frank Churchill subplot is almost totally missing. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the scenery. It's a lot more fun. England has not been like this. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans will make it like this. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie even after this criticism but will make more recommendations on TV adaptation.
