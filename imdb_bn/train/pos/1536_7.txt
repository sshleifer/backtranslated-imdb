The drama is tough, sisters better than the rival movie! This little Mani was originally promoted as a comedy after his release in Sweden, so I was happy to see that I was not the whole case. There are funny bits of small town vacations to enjoy, of course, but the drama takes center stage, the story goes on. And not only family dramas, it also raises respectful questions about the differences in the choices of people. <br /> <br /> The great character meets many fantastic and ongoing dramatic scenes that achieve credibility points; And they just do not scattershot, but keep everything in place. It just guides me that if Engmer Bergman made this play (the play would make him fit!), Then the international focus could be perhaps. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 out of Ojjep
