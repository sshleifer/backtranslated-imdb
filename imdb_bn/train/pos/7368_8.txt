I think the team behind this photo did a great deal with their limitations. I think the whole thing is to write, film and edit only Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks which itself is an achievement. Although this film is not for the public (although a young innocent teenager is killed and the story involves homo lover) I think the film is a tragedy of the heart and you are involved in a deeply involved story. You feel more sadness. He feels more love for Hiton but he does not come back. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British movies I've enjoyed a lot and want to see again. I think it's a shame that the movie is not heard very well.
