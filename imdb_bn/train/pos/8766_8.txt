I saw this film for the first time in a million years (5 years to be right). In the light of recent developments, Australian woman Shapal Corby was imprisoned for the so-called smuggled pot in Indonesia, I decided to watch this movie again. I gave up my heart weeping, 'Because I need hot girls (I read my review of' Stocking of Lori Shows'). Some wets escaped from my eyes, but it was rarely filled with tears. Why? Not because the two actresses were completely inhumane and helpless, because these two children were not heartwarming, they were locked in almost inhuman conditions. Then why Why did not I cry? I wanted to cry! When I rented a movie like this, then except for the move, I do not have any day tomorrow, feel sad and feel like it. This movie was very easy to do this job. It was okay to reduce the script to the original plot elements and the mental aspect was removed during this. Claire Danes and Kate Bincassell did a great job by portraying the emotions of excellent friendships, but the film shouted for more footage of these girls around their sadness (and repressive). Mental journey is missing here for some reason. You'll only see what time it is (which is very sensitive, I accept), probably because of poor editing. Sometimes I think these girls were walking around a postcard. Relationships with family members can be more focused. What happens to the relationship between girls and parents (especially Alice and his father)? You caught a glimpse of it, but quite a whole picture of the film, not sorry enough to offer. <br /> <br /> Yet it was a great movie, and at the end I had to even bite my lips. But I think there is more to do with actresses (and music) acting skills (and looks), with the merit of the director. To be honest, I very rarely knew how Kate Beckinsell before watching this movie (again). Now, I'm a fan! Great movie, until you expect it to be a classic movie.
