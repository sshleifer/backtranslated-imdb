A bright Russian émigreé contract creates the Stanlavavsky system for the winner at the brid - which makes him and his beautiful wife America's Grand Slam sweetheart. <br /> <br /> What could be another silly soap opera? Fine production quality and a very enjoyable little comedy status are excellent performances. Some unexpected touches are drawn to attract viewers - the way the face of the card deck is presented; Introducing a zany acrobat in the plot for any other reason than enjoying a bit of chic; And by converting different types of Americans in different ways the game is transmitted through broadcast. <br /> <br /> Works very well like Paul Lucas and Loreraya Young's lover - Luca suave and sophisticated and Miss Young is passionately loving and beautiful (even if the script keeps puffing a little over her cigarette too). Their behavior is not always the most credible or compulsory, they even make fun of seeing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Playing a small role as Pall has overtaken her traditional advertising personality. Roscoe Cornes handles a conversation conversation as a radio radio announcer. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is a snobbish bridge expert as an expert. <br /> <br /> Movie mavens will recognize Davy Robinson as an intelligent nightclub sponsor; Emma Dunn as a sister sister reporter; Paul Porcasi as the owner of the Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; And Jimmy Conlin as the key player to play the final bridge - all strangers. <br /> <br /> The film took advantage of the Pad for the contracted bridge entering the country since its development in the 1920's. Visitors may have basic knowledge of the complexity of this game and do not try to explain anything unauthorized.
