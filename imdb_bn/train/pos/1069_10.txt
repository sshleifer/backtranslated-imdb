Two weeks ago I bought the Dark Angels Season 1 and 2, after holding some episodes of Channel 1 episode. The brightness of the show did not prepare me anything. I did not enjoy much from Firefly (also and amazing show). I will not say very well in season 2, but there are still some amazing episodes (see it, Bag 'M, The Burffords Agenda, Harber Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alake Superb. I've heard some plans for season 3, and I have to say, I can not believe it was rejected - I will not let it down for you - but it would have happened suddenly! I think it has a lot of potential as a movie (though at the moment it seems highly promising). As proof of my tendency, the maximum barcode number is 332960073452, and in two weeks I've done it, I have seen both seasons twice since the 3rd episode away. It's very good.
