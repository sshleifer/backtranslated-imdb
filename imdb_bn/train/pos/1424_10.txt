It's rather annoying that critics compare it to Planet Earth ... * Of course * Planet Earth is good - there's more to it. The Earth is like an extended trailer for Planet Earth series, and thus inevitably inferior and simplified. But it can not be compared with. <br /> <br /> A feature-length documentary (or actually a feature-length), it's much more than what you can see in your whole life, with many long-range cameras, helicopters to cross the earth and the world's most extraordinary Wait a few months for the most extreme environment to catch a glimpse of animals, which can be - it is unlikely). On the description: Yes in the UK - everyone in the UK - a lot with me - greeted David Attenbaire, and here's a little excuse that it will not be described here, but it can not defeat a star or three. He was not just an interviewer on Planet Earth, he was just a narrator and I am sure he is humble and gracious enough to understand that it is better to get more visitors. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees it will be frustrated by his surprise, greatness and greatness. All critics agree that. Those who love it (i.e. everyone) will go to see / buy a Planet Earth. So instead of three cheaters and Planet Earth box set for cinematic release, a big wife for someone who is cheap enough to buy it in DVD. But due to artwork they are not in competition here. <br /> <br /> Earth is big enough for both.
