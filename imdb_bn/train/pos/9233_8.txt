Falvia (Fulcin Balkan "Do not Do a Duckling Torture Tournament") has been locked in a conference with his father's physical desire. The distraction that surrounds him is far from all. (A nasty girl, sexual harassment, horse-throwing) Flavia persuades her Jewish friend to flee from the outside of the Convent. The two do not come too far before being captured and then come back to torture and are forced to repent. After the punishment, he joined a band of Muslims known as Tarnulas, who attacked the Convent and led a cusud, which did not become a short form of bloody war behind the convent wall. "Flavia the Heratic" is a well known and fairly notorious part of Italian non-plurality. The film is sometimes a bit awkward and lazy. Acting is great and the characters are improving well. Above all, "Flavia the Hertik" is a very real and ongoing and intelligent movie. You can not make mistakes 10 of 8
