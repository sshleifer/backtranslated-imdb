Indeed, this movie has a durable moment in both the dirt and joe's pace and children's part, and it's much worse than other MJ movies like "The Wise", "Captain Yo" and "Ghosts". But after almost 11 years, like Michael Jackson's hard work for the Fan's body, (yes, this is my half-life, you're saying!), I can not complain much about it. Just watch this lovely guy and listen to his wonderful music for me a trip to heaven. But as a movie, it's not good, and I'm scared, it will get a very low grade for me, if my darling mic is not playing it. But Mike is without a candle holder, I can not get 7 of 10 out of me.
