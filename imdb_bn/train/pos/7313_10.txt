If some spoilers are you a big horror movie fan, then you know that Halloween paved the way for much slasher film. Often imitated, not as duplicated, this movie is a genuinely classic and it is definitely one of the horrible movies, if not terrible. <br /> <br /> I saw this series after seeing the rest of the series (why not ask me). I first saw these 7 films, how it works. But I would say this one blows away all the other. It's really terrible, and Michael drives you out of a shrub or shifts in the dark, cools down your spine. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael beat a man and took the movie aside. This is one of the most perfect images in movie history. <br /> <br /> Friday 13th Friday's slashes were more fun and less intense than the movie. I like the F13 series more than the Halloween series, but this film is only better than F13 movies. Michael Meyers is so terrible because he is realistic, you can imagine that a madman like him is killing him. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What looks amazing for this movie does not depend on poor or humorous viewers for entertainment. It's just pure terrorism. It's worse than Sirius's next film, because it came as a spectacular example of a spectacular slash.
