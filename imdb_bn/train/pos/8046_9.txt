Who knows they might be so funny ?? Christopher Melonie and Genel Moloney are more familiar with some of the extraordinary works of television dramas. ("Law and Order: SVU" and "West Wing") keep them together on the big screen and an interesting romantic comedy with a lot of smile on what you get. <br /> <br /> The story of the actors is going on in love with the impressive efficiency of the audience, with Barry Singer (Melonie) attached to the audience, although true humorous, it is also becoming a theoretical, sexist blur. <br /> <br /> You will follow her almost all over the country (Molly) with the hope of conquering her heart with all its insecurities, and she will become the root for her. They are rarely among them ... but when Barry finally opens his heart, you wonder why he goes away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Your time is good <br /> <br />
