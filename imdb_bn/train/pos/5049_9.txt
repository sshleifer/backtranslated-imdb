I really had to see this jewel all the way to appreciate it twice. When a widow obstructs a father with a frustrating expression of sleep between two boys, he or she is not trusted. As soon as the horrors of this story are exposed, we learn a lot about the father, his two sons, and their fate. With the frustrating twist after the twinkle twist, this movie never gives a continuity between the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father, but the most notable performance is his oldest son, Fenton, Matthew Oline, and his younger son Adam, Jeremy Fuller. This is one of the best thrillers I have seen for a while and you would like to see it a few times to appreciate every critical aspect of the plot. I give this picture 9/10.
