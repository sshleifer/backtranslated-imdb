It was a beautiful picture. I do not seem to comment on a spoiler, but I do not want to take a chance. However, at the end of the film, the prosecutor read a Bible verse and then another quote from memory. I can not read the first text, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He said it was Genesis 9:12, but he actually quoted verse 6. This is a common passage that many people use to save the death penalty. It is very bad that the prosecutors do not have the courage to quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of Supreme Court Justice John Jean in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. Very bad we've lost that scene in America.
