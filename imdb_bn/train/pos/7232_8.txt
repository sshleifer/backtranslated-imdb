After the normal Chase scene, Jerry's stray ink was a chemistry set part of the air in the air inside a bottle. He quickly discovered his invisible ... so predictable results would occur, that is, he used to hide Tom in his new hidden condition. Jerry often preserves himself, but often he gets a wicked cat, which, whenever possible, hurts the cat. <br /> <br /> Here, she thinks Tom is cheating on her face when the cheese from a glasses disappears before her eyes, or milk from a dish. Tom is no longer able to sleep, so he tries to sleep this nightmare, but Jerry fires his legs! Man, I hope little kids will not look back at these cartoons' 40s and 50s! Thankfully, the cartoons usually lose a character that goes away within a few seconds and they go back to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is to show the two-thirds of the way through the story, and try different methods to identify where the mouse is located (like the flour on the floor to see its footprint).
