The guidance behind this photo was fantastic for a comedy. Most of the scenes are beyond the comic book and more intense than I expected (apparently - not the story). Undetected, it may not be a fun movie ever made, especially if you are very candid sex jokes, but very few of them (such as Mary or American Pieces). As you rewatch it, the different jokes stand and get funnier. If you ever read a comic book or watch a comic book-type movie (Batman, X-Men etc) and prefer, you probably would enjoy fine humor throughout the film. If you do not like them, then you can choose the honorable laugh for this movie. If you like this movie, then DVDs are super cool. (8/10)
