The third and final installment of "Hanzo Razor" is the most concrete among all of them. "Training" is also done in the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, the story of this film is being executed through the order of blind monks in Hanzor's investigation of the loan. It gives a historic comment about the proud denial of old Japan to include Western technology. The first Hanjo film was just a fun and glorious journey, where there was little connection with its plot, "Hanzo 3: Who Gone The Gold" manages to connect everything and eventually brings it home. Definitely perfect finish. Oh yes, Hanzor still has many sexes, and there is plenty of blood and violence (this is * after Hanzor razor).
