This musical instrument I did not expect was quite a lot, in the first place Brando and Sinatra did not have many scenes. Based on the story of the Damon Runen, I hope the surprise and surprise, one of which was really good - when we see that the gang in the synagogue used the Salvation Army office for their bad game, Brendo was in Havana with Simmons. Of course, when Brando brings him back, Brando will bring him back. I did not really expect much from Brando as a singer, but he surprised me. He was not great but he was just fine in the role. His large number of scenes, but the rest of the sons of Sanatra's children were the only place where Brando's voices were weak. He was not claiming power grand climax. Overall, I found the power to fill electricity in Brondo and Simons, and I do not think that when we first saw Simmons myself, and later when we were trying to speed up Brando in a restaurant with Sanatora on one of them. Brando does not go to his office, the story does not come in life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I guess for playing Broadway, it just started reducing the proceeding. His scenes and scenes were visible. Also, in the case of both the story or the character of his song progress my felt weakening. On top of that, all the Goldwind girls looked horny in shoes, just for glitz. For example, when Frank meets the nightclub with Brando, we only start cutting the routine for the cat number - then it goes back to people who continue, as if there were no dancing numbers. When Brando and Simmons were on the screen, I had a great time, but we returned to the story of Sinra-Blen, my level of interest was reduced. <br /> <br /> There were some good things for the song, especially the first number with the stubby ki, the Fugu (can can!) for the threehorses number. This is a great song and it reminds me of the first song of Music Man - Cash for the Merchandise ... what it's said. And the number of suwars - I could not help but remind the "cool" from the West Side Story - which brought me to a point. I really did not like industrial aspects in this film. The False Times was only pulling so perfectly that it draw attention to itself. Havana sequence, and especially for sewage are the same. I think most of the musical sets were shot in 1955, but the things are changing - for example, carousel makes great use of photography. Even in Mohattan, even Shawon's scenes are visible in 1949. After reaching West Side in 1961, Manhattan's staff was actually shot in Manhattan. So compared to, Guys and Dolls felt set-bound Manhattan dates and are a little too clever. And Lindy's Mindy's Change - What Do They Really Do for Legal Reasons? Now, I always thought that music about Musical instruments with Gais and Dosas Cinetra and Brando and their various events. It was more attentive than that, its credit. In this case it is much better than Les Girls, which was interesting to its own right, but it had some solitude. <br /> <br /> I have a big complaint about guis and dolls, and I do not know whether it is local to the real stage show, but when Jane Simmons realizes that Brando did not take any money for any exchange with Sinatra and even said that he was goodbye He's lost, he's just got to find him and we're getting married. I think a scene between Brando and Simmons has added to the story's story. When Brando walked around, he would come around him, it was a great scene. There is a scene in The Music Ahed, when this pair of Harold and Marion is waiting for her change. She has been on her house, she's down the road. He is singing 76 trombones. He is singing some of my good night. They suddenly switched and singing each other - a beautiful way to express their cross on each other. It's an emotional high moment in the photo. Still, boys and dolls had a lot for it.
