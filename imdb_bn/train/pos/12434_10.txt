It gets the right balance for the first movie of a proposed series. It looks as a refugee with style and class and as a refugee on Modinaly's first day and begins to emerge the rise of its power in the growing crime. I think that for writer Peter O'Donnell, this is a very honest / true illustration of his character. Alexander Staden as the Modesty is stunning and is a wonderful choice. He worked very hard as a tough survivor outside of cool / intelligent / innocence. For selecting an unknown actress for the role and the full mark of Tarantino - creating a new face part is more credible. I look forward to the next photo.
