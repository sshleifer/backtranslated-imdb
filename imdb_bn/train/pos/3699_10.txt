The story "loves the sun", with its intelligence and grace, works a bit more humorous, the story is not only compelling but often humorous. It's been a while since I found it completely touching, thoroughly enjoyable movies. <br /> <br /> This picture is beautiful, beautiful scenery and eye-catching scenery. Peaceful imagery is very human, very flawed, and still surprisingly contrasts with tensions between very favorable characters. Due to excellent cast, the main five major players are surprisingly attractive and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "love the sun." This is a really funny movie that we can suppress each other and it shows a deadly look to hit the unusually difficult but even effective way to apologize.
