Still has her moments in the movie and is quite watchable. For me, Christian Doble's prominent role in this part of the film's attraction She might not be the best actress in the world, but because of being the first player of the month, she is quite clever. All life pods are like other low-budget cy-fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < (Not a Titanic sister) which was sold for scraps in the 1960s.
