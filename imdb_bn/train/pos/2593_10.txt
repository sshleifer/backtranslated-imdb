It comes out of the left field, and it is not really what you expect. But I love that. The most memorable movie experience comes to surprise, if you ask me. If you are not isolated about this mysterious "thing" which makes these brothers so weird ... you're doing a treatment. <br /> <br /> Cast is fantastic, but not so elaborate that it is palpable. Special effects do not come from anywhere (seriously, it's like a weird dark romantic comedy - unless they're - then WOW) and they're cool. Overall cinematography is easy on the eye, edited and the word is very good, and the twisted story is released without clips. Although none of these aspects separately creates a blockbuster, "What is hell?" Because Elon makes it a movie treasure. <br /> <br /> Those who keep this movie do not give any idea. This is one of the most frequently visited flickers of the 90s that you have never heard of, or you have mentioned so many titles to mention its title. <br /> <br /> I'm in the next group.
