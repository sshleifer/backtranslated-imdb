I do not easily hand out a ten star rating. A movie has really influenced me, and Bourne has gone far beyond that of ultimatum. Furthermore, this triangle has been so nicely combined that I believe this is one of the biggest motion pictures of our time in the triangle. Although these three films can not be different from Ludlame's novels, they are still standing as a strong landmark in the film's achievement. Bourne Ultimatum wants to cry me to complete the series, but I could not try to stop smiling for hours. <br /> <br /> From the opening title I knew we were floating. Paul Greengrass did it again. The love we have from the previous Bourne movies is here again: action, dialogue, and of course cone cameras. But for me, that last was not a problem. I think it adds to the sensation. <br /> <br /> I will come to see this movie several times before getting released from the DVD, because it is simply gifted. It is a perfectly convincing conclusion, and a fantastic movie, and together, should stand in time test as an unforgettable triangle.
