Providing a great imagination from the new world of young Erindera and its quarterly grandmother. Gabriel Garcia Marquez's explanation, "La incrIe e trist histarrias de la Canada erendira, ..." can not be a true deviation in the streets of Marcuz, the story remains intact and it still carries its full power. His performance in this film power is especially as a grandmother as a father. Marquez fans and Marquez novels will likewise enjoy this movie for their true reti brand Wight.
