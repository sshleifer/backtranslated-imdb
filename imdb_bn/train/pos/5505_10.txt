This is something new <br /> <br /> There is a coup and some of the Irish documentary filmmakers are inside it. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president, who uses his power, is encouraged to read the literacy and constitution of his people, through public media, by public media, openly open to the government, mentally unstable, new Hitler etc. without any reaction from the government. Duplication (eg, bullets and other traditions) Ttbika methods to keep their silence)). Oh, they still claim that they are being suppressed. <br /> <br /> After overthrowing the government with the help of a coup on TV, see how their role is revealed through a coup on TV. Generals (How Much Can You Get Fool ??) <br /> <br /> And see how Venezuelans conduct raid in the palace, hold constitution on their hands and restore their elected government. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a Hollywood story, but it has happened to the reality against the obvious will of the United States. Documentary is a historical masterpiece, which is totally embarrassing for the main supporters of the shot, intense and silent from the center of action: good, democratic, free-loving, liberal America (who still channeles huge amounts of money to political opponents of Chavez.) <br /> <br /> It is also very entertaining and exciting. 10 points
