This picture is in my opinion, its flaws (which I maintain * few *), are a great composition and a great and glorious part of the industry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She has shown her extraordinary talent and versatility as a completely beautiful film and director of animated films. For the adult audience to save the art of animation literally, he does not get 1/100 of the achievement of credit. If it is Mr. I do not believe that Animation will survive on the invasion of Disney. What's more, with Lord of the Rings, he has not only made a beautiful animated film, but he has created a whole new artwork - unfortunately, it has never stopped the ground. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in movies (the use of live action images which are used as background images and often use animated techniques that are shorter than complete leakage animations). But I think people complaining about it can not just accept an ideal form that is out of the norm. No, it's not Disney Animation. No it's not live action. No, it's not "fraud" - it's a new, interesting and absolutely amazing art form. Somewhat fresh, and so new that it feels completely at home in such a wonderful story as "Ring of the Ring". Bacci's use of this technology brings a very dark and mysterious way in the lifespan of medieval life, in particular, the dark of the token's body, especially the nagul, has been realized in such a way that traditional animations or live action is not able to be able. <br/> <br /> In a draft drafting of Peter S Bizzle's screenplay (I realized that very small, very devoted adaptation to Tolquen's work). Where possible, he used direct dialogue from the novel and felt it in the home of the world built on Bakhshi. The first book, and 3/4 single, 2 hours and 15 minutes of film has lots of fits to fit, but there are very few changes in the story. There are some holes that were good to fill: Norsil's gift, Gladriel's gift, horns in Hornbach's war, but again with its time limit (in the history of the longest animated features already), these can certainly understand (though it makes a surprising how they Can be interpreted in a growing way). <br /> <br /> Leonard Rozmanman (who is my favorite) also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (scores, which are clear based on his work). It's bombshell and disturbed and I say, perfect. It has its own stand as an orchestral win, but when it comes to film images, it enters the whole new world of symphonic perfection. So far, it has stopped many people from the Hollywood rental. <br /> <br /> Voice Actor Wonderful. Especially the note is John Hart as Argon, who has overtaken Stryder's summary. <br /> <br /> The character's design is also amazingly unique, though it is not often the taste of everyone. But remember that the responsibility of the adaptation director is to show you what you think, not what you imagined, and so Aragorn is realized with a distinct local American feeling and is displayed in Bikomie's Vikings inspired dress. Perhaps not what you might imagine, but I just saw "saw" only Mr. Congratulations to Bakhshi. It can also be mentioned that he spent enough time preparing for the film's character with Priscilla Toklin. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Bachashi is not afraid to reduce the speed of a moment, and his skill is clearly shown through incredible tension. Bachshi's artistic skills and the incredible task of token, in this sequence, is a glorious peak that will not be the same. <br /> <br /> Recently DVD Release (2001) Warner Bros. is unfortunate. We can finally give our eternal thanks while being available in the widescreen format, but the package is more harmful. How glorious the operative commentary was, the 20 feet moved to the dramatic release was able to see additional footage. Another fun addition to live action footage may be combined which were later animated. Also on DVD release, the end of the film is a terrible violent Voices, which is a simple departure from Voices that happened in the final frame of the film. This version has been plastered and correctly presented on the score of the musical measurements of the score. <br /> <br /> Of course, the greatest tragedy is that this section was never created. Explanation of the Gondo of Bocci, Fermi Shelby, Crack of Doom, we will never see his clash with Wich King or the Gundfoff with Ion's war. We will never be grateful to the pictures of the buffer Dunethor or the fugitive or the dead. Apart from all the shame, it is also shameful that we will eventually take action film versions of Peter Jackson's Glitches and Glad Holivier, next masterpieces of Tokio, but I think it is better than having a cinematic version. <br /> <br />
