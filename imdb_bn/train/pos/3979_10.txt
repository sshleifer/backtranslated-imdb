Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I'm not proud of all the fans of this documentary. This mini series, shown on VH1, has been a great feature of the culture of medicine in the last 30 years and my uncle has worked hard on it. The time and effort I have seen, the documentary and the book that started (not finding my home home) makes it better than watching it on TV. I know that he loves what he does and he does it well. His lecture was shown in the interview, which he himself did and the amazing additions that he himself associated with the comment. From music to video and everything in between, it is a great documentary that actually shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of a person residing through it. I appreciate any comments on this from those who (or do not) enjoy it and love to hear from fans! Uncle Martin's three cheats !!!
