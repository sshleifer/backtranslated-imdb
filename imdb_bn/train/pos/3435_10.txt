This picture is a wonderful simple job. The enjoyable from the beginning is both uplifting yet sad at the same time. Miranda Otto's performances (oh, how much she has earned the recognition!) And George Dale is beautiful and still painful, because two oppressed souls understand each other. Cast staff supporting the dead letter office in the wonderful bit of part, such as Alice's long-suffering boyfriend, I could not help but apologized. I can see a specific scenario over (and I have!), Such shame that such movies are not recognized and so bring them back to the public to enjoy more people. I started crying, I smiled. I'd recommend this film to anyone.
