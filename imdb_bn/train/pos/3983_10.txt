Completely nominated for his prestigious Hollywood awards, this entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some delightful surprises. Wonderful fun scenes include a ridiculous drawing (and reddraction) of a WW1 Trench scene with the Hopeless McDoux, like an optimistic non-lowered and bary / pen messenger with Australian comedian Claude Cooke ?? Ralph Sanford's delightful dirty fingers with all the sticky eyes! A lost macadocco jack carcane is also managed and re-operated by misleading; Assistant director Chandler is delighted by the McDoux-sent opportunity: "I'm going to be a director!" <br /> <br /> AC Comic O'Hannan has played two dual roles, McDoakes and Macdo playing himself! Surprisingly, Richard L, who can play in one or more other entries in the series, Buyer has made that opportunity here. In real life, Bearer's young man, six feet rock Hudson look, but here he is disguised by old actors (more than 500 movies!), Jack Movers.
