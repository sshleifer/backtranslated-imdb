I can not remember many details about the show, but I think how I was enthusiastic about it and how I was determined not to miss a single episode. Unfortunately, we did not have any VCR, so I did not see the series again. But when I see it, how I felt and I remember how thrilled I was when I came. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor on this day (I think I was almost in love), and one of my favorite actors that day, most of the time saw her presence in the series. I would gladly steal / steal / download this series, I think I will look at it again and go towards a long time to become a childhood long ... no ideas? Does anyone know of a site devoted to the series or have their episode at tape from the first air?
