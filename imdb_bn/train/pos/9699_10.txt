Some pictures of "Polly" touched my heart. It's a diverse, funny yet emotional movie. I'm becoming a fan of this movie a late comer. I did not see "Polly" in May 2004 and then ordered to sell a widescreen DVD from eBay at the seller. <br /> <br /> The special effects of polly talking are fantastic. My son asked me how many words the bird got. Perhaps my favorite part is when Peli followed Chechen Marin (Ignacio) with Gane Rowlands (Ives) company. Tony Salahb (Misa) took an excellent part as a good heartwarmer. Through the movie you have always rooted for him. <br /> <br /> You can not rent or buy this movie wrong !!
