Reveals an excellent film that expresses how people are connected to the common man for exchange of marijuana. This film is much more than a commentary on globalization. In fact, it makes human workers humanitarian to the workers of China, the factory owner, the bee-breaker of New Orleans and even the New Orleans razakars. What's the key to say a tricky story with such a simple and seductive way to explain complicated stories is the director's ability. His amazing access to the factory is another aspect that is provocative and I just knew how he entered. This is a beautiful story, without the sensitivity or crime related to it, and the conclusion gives hope to people without isolated feelings.
