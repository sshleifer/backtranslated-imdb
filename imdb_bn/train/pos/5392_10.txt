Whopping Omn Ward at the hospital's big hospital, with all his joy and sorrow, wherever life is. <br /> <br /> This almost forgotten drama is full of a fine small soap opera, comedy and tragedy, tied between the lives of all maternal workers and their patients. The firmness of the picture indicates the pre-code status of the movie. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary all-time Macmahan as a sympathetic head nurse, a quiet center of the film, which is almost all rock stream flow. Able to handle any crisis or emergency, he is the mother 'best, sometimes ending, friend. McMahon is a part of some of the finest clothes: Loretta Young is a convicted criminal on the release of prison; Eric Linden as his scared young husband; The fathers hate those children as a demise for the glenn; Sweet Clara Blendic as a very mature mother for her six birthing; Preston Foster and Hale Hamilton are worried, sympathetic doctors and Frank McHug, as a wonderfully ironic parent. <br /> <br /> Movie Magnons Bobs Watson will be seen as a cane tuck who wants to see Stark; Paul promised to act like a 'little soldier who fix as a nervous husband;' Gilbert Rowland as a fierce Italian husband and wife of Fenrell as Elizabeth Patterson as a lively doctor's wife - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />; Farrel became drunk in the ward, but none of the workers noticed; A clear psychological patient is able to roam deliberately - but it really enhances the amount of fun entertainment of the movie and prevents things from being too serious.
