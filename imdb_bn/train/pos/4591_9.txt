It's sad to see where Jackie Chan is in the end. He punches, kicks and incredible stunts are used in an unstoppable hurricane. To be fair, he would now expect a fall in his fifties and some. But with 'Rush Hour 3' he returns to Chris Tucker (all the people!), And then there is 'Kung Fu Pandya', where he does not just play the full voice, but his character has no dialogue. Jackie Chan seems to have seen a good day is a tremendous difference. <br /> <br /> This is the time when the only dust to whip the old VHS tape and Jackie kicks off his little asshole, give the fighter, Chris Tucker free. <br /> <br /> Write 'Police Story'. Jackie Chan, a policeman named Kar-Qi, whose main defense is to defend the witness. He faced silence from both unco-operative witnesses and both of the men hit by the crowd sent by the crowd. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, who care? We do not see the Jackie Chan film for the story. We see Jackie Chan to show eye-popping stunts and generally beat up less than ordinary people and kicked many people. <br /> <br /> And at that level, 'Police Story' is not all disappointing. There is a great showdown in a shopping mall that pushes Jackie under a giant, high-voltage chandelier. Seriously, if such things happen more often, a man will be curly to shop for clothes. <br /> <br /> There are comedy, most of which are unconscious May (unexpectedly mood chang), its eternal pain and apparently never forgiving girlfriend The whole humor is quite impossible, but it works so I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The acting is not very delicate, it is. Actually, I'm not sure that there was some fine about 'police stories'. Director Jackie Chan (yes, he does it) clearly understand what we are seeing his movies, and we know that we are waiting for the war to start, the last thing we want is to look for the nanata. Depth and inner meaning <br /> <br /> So a 'police story' is a blast. For most of her movies, for example, Jackie actually looks at the stuff you see on the screen, keeping the head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan is really hanging from a fleeting bus by an umbrella, a completely new "Wow!" Factor is added to action.
