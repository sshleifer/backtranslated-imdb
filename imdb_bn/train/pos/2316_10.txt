I saw this movie by chance, to get weird by the trailer on TV. I like when I discover such a movie, little, flexible stories about ordinary people. Sad to the end, "The Man in the Moon" has some interesting moments, especially in Dania's first character, with her innocent and pure love relationship with the court. It's really a beautiful, moving love story with 3 high points: Rid Witherspoon's performance, who kept her promise in the world of the movie, "Old Lion" Freddie Francis's beautiful painting and James Newton Howard's superb score, which is really the soul of the movie. His themes (which deserve the Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have turned the screenplay into music.
