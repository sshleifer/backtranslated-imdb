When I saw this first, it seemed that I was really laughing so hard, which I saw as many other movies, no words got out! Curley is really gorgeous in "Gyeing" opera of this song, I was surprised that she did not consider her career as a professional singer because she was really good! <br /> <br /> If you notice, it was staged at the end of Carly's career as Stude, you can really say that he has changed, because he lost weight and was thin, his voice was deep, his face was with fork Lined, though he could still stop it, he saw that he was fifty at the age of fifty. Because before the end of his career he had suffered a lot before the big stroke. He will still be managed to stop it from his last ones! <br /> <br /> If you do not think that Curley is getting very sick at this moment, it's actually one of his most interesting shorts. I know that I do not think that Kelly is actually changing, because I still think she was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
