Attractive Marbles (Farah Fouzet) accosted by a lonely biker after living in fear. He is seriously shaken with his attacker's address to his address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the attacker forced his way into the house of Marjorie and ignited him for insulting terrorism. Deadly and bloody, Mergari managed to get a high hand on his attacker, wasting a living daylight from shaking and helpless thanks to his eyes and neck spray. When Hoge tied himself up and beat, Joe tried to explain himself to Margaret Rummetts (Diana Squarevid and Alfred Woodward) when he returns home. Mercy is almost an indication, but it is not coming from Mergara. Will he punish himself? Violence, sexual abuse and rough language makes for an R rating. Fawcett really gets away from the ditsy role that his career spots forever. Director Robert M. Young
