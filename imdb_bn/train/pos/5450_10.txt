Frequently the Stanwick Lily plays the power. She is a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a small crummy mining town. She sold her to men He escapes from New York and is literally sleeping his way upward. <br /> <br /> I've seen the 71-minute version, but it's pretty extreme - for its time. Nowadays it is quite a joke. The film comes very fast and has tons of sensual innovation - most of it comes as stupid (but funny). It goes so fast that you can easily ignore that most of it can not happen - even in 1933. There's nothing classic or memorable - it's just a fast, slow dirty little movie that makes lots of fun. Sensors claim that it is eventually separated with a little "moral". It's incredible and foolhardy (I saw in a theater and the audience laughed - a guy said quite correctly "no way") I saw the 75-minute version which is different, a bit sad and much better. The end Until 2004, this version was thought to be lost when it was discovered by mistake! I believe the only faith in this release - but beware. <br /> <br /> Good acting - Stanwick jumped into his role and managed it at the top. She believes that she is cruel and sleeping. The handsome Donald Cook and George Brent also have strong supporters. Also look for a pre-stardom John Wayne as a humorous bit as a humble and light office worker! Fun, dirty and fast I give this a 9.
