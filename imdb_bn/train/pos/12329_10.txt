Before you see, make sure you saw the Night of the Living Dead ... This is probably the best 7-minute parody that I have ever seen! Inaccurate, crappy 'special effects' (rope, rope !!!), and crumble into bread ... What more do you need? <br /> <br /> (Do not see this movie while eating ... you might be scared!)
