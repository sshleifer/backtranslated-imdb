This is the only movie I've seen Prince but it's no problem. And I thought it was just wrong to sing the boy. This is probably his best performance. The music is great. Thought won the Oscars for extraordinary music in 1984 (or something like that). Now he has an Oscar and Grammy under his belt. Although the curse goes on the way to the movie (just confirm it in small children or the house). There is not much to say about the release of the plot. You should get this movie until you really go out and get your collection done to get this movie. What can I say more than what I say and now I can get this movie!
