Cuban Blood is one of those sleepy movies, which is a very traditional way of life. I actually saw this while traveling around Cuba in West Caribbean Cruise. It gives details about the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. At the very end, the revolution did not take much time, when the socialist regime came and took the property of the father's father. Most of the film produces the child's upcoming age and relationship in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. Some powerful scenery that everyone can attach A film with a fine acting and direction in a class. This is a film that tells stories with a special effect or grand scheme or real twists. It's a movie about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their win. Annually a few times the observer price is a good film.
