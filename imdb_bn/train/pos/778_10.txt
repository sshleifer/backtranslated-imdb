I am not an expert on acting or other film details, but this movie has hit me deeply. I'll never forget it. A scene especially (I think that anyone who saw this movie will know that I'm talking about it) is printed on my brain. <br /> <br /> I saw the same movie in Liljah 4 by the previous commenter). It was very moving, but not quite as straightforward and brutal. If you are sensitive then you will have to tears in your eyes, but Anjos Swing Sol (Sun Angels) can stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is very sad, but I think, no, I hope the film will be successful for more attention. <br /> <br /> more people will see this picture !!!!!!
