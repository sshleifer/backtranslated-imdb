The hole is a horror movie. I love it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies. It's not one sugar in a few flicks produced by Disney. The hole is usually a very cool motion picture. I want Disney to take more pictures. The hole is actually a rare reproduction of Disney Flickr listening which is cool. Do not get the wrong idea, I do not want to tell Disney a bad face, but most of the content is looking at the kids and it's okay. Children deserve to have their entertainment too. But Disney is trying to appeal to young viewers and they usually fail. But not with the hole. It can see and enjoy any movie of any age and does not seem to be a trick. In fact, it is a movie that can enjoy many young hoods because it has characters that they can relate to. <br /> <br /> Holes do a good job of mixing good family entertainment but are not extremely lean and a little alive on the edge. I like Disney more risk and hope more edgy flicks like this.
