Paul Hennessy and his wife Kate must deal with their two teenage daughters and strange boys ... But after the passage of John Ritter's passing, the show became more of a deal to deal with the loss of a loved one. <br /> <I crossed this program through the channel in one afternoon and I mean that I was laughing myself until my woolens entered the character range; Wicked line and situation Paul will behave most often with his own girls ... Then when I was free when I was free, I caught the rest of the show and had to tell me that writing was good ... but then I read that shortly after John Ritter's death, Goodbye 'part 2 and I have to say that I was often in tears, I saw the passion of letters, lost loved ones ... Rory anger and despair How dam walls. Kat roams around to sleep on his bed ... Brigitte and Kerry talk about what they have done. <br /> <br /> But the event is going on, Jim is coming with Eggen and CJ Barnes, who gives a great smile, like Kat's father tries to protect his family and gives Rory 'talk about man's issue ... but the real woman is CJ ... who is absolutely sunny like a wild cousin. <br /> <It will always be the best composition of John Rotor.
