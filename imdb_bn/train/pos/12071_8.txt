Nicholas disease is not variable to say at least in the project, but is less than attractive. "Blurring" evidently, first and foremost, in an adaptive phases: it sounds sound and pretty - many 'room-bound'. However, it pays to watch this movie at a time: The underlying themes are not presented more and more, it takes some time to change the rationality and role of four more plays: Einstein, McCarthy, Monroe and DiMagio. <br /> <br /> Einstein was leaked to Hiroshima, but still has expressed similarity with the relationship with Munna; Munro is sick of getting sick and intellectuals wish to believe. Senator McCarthy is the height of his witch hunting power but is an impotent sleazebag; DiMaggio is insecure about her celebrity, self-confidence, and tendency of violence. Each of them has their own destruction seeds. Each character has an annoying, abusive / abusive past and a suspicious future. Gradually, we see that the central theme of the passion itself. America's emotions with its retreat cultural icons and mores; Someone's obsessions for plays: Peace-mind and / or happiness <br /> <br /> The theory of relativity, a proposed Unified-field theory and, in fact, the cosmic self, all the desires and interactions of the character of the disease seem impossible. Yet these aspects of the real universe (it's all Quantum, believe me!) Affect us when applying for the development of ways to destroy us. Monroe does not refer to the policy of neutron-bomb (not named after it), but it is understood by contemporary audiences. In fact, all the references in the script are accessible only to a cognitive audience: one fight with 50 events / personality numbers and how they affect us in the 21st Century. <br /> <br /> This film and its scripts are either very cute, or extremely obsolete and pretentious. Finally, incomplete, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
