Refreshing 'lost' jewel! Effective conversations combine with excellent acting to establish a characteristic characteristic and care about what happens to them is enough of you. Douglas and Wyomdark characters are realistic heroes. Palance has its usual evil presence. Wydmark wins the scene of the war, with a 'logical' ending, a car travels less than 60 seconds and chronic chase on legs that cite contemporary Hollywood's Overdone Chase. You probably know how it will end, but the mystery and interest are running throughout. Chase is the most realistic one you will see. The film seems a little slow in the middle past, but stay with it for the fruitful conclusion.
