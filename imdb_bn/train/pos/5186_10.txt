Finally, I was happy to publish the first season's Amazing Stories in DVD. I just forgot what actors actors and directors act on this series cast a star. For the longest time you see this awesome series with VHS 2 or 3 episode collections or when the psyfi episodes will be replayed. However, when Sci-Fi hosts host again, they are usually stuck in the same phase. There was a few outstanding episodes in one season like Mission that they did not repeat. How well do anyone know how to run this series? It said in the leading IMDB from 1985 to 1987, but I think it has been running for more than two years. If you like Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outside Limits, you will like this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
