Sadly, eight simple rules, to make dating to my teenage daughter, finished John Ritter after his tragic death in 2003. He was my favorite actor of all time. He was the star of all the comedies (those three companies might forget him) but he was a wonderful dramatic actor (worth watching TV movie) as much as I liked the other cast members of the show (Katey, Emmy, Kaley) and Martin), he was the first The reason for dragging the show was in place and it was his perfect comedy delivery which was able to crack me every time. <br /> <br /> I did not see how the show was all sweet sweet (as much as I liked the Cosby show, they were very nice to each other) they miraculously portrayed family dynamism. It was realistic with all the brothers' rivalry and revolt in parents, but they still keep it fun. American sitcoms make a lot of efforts and completely fill the shows with ethics and this does not do the show. Yes, there were some important medicines, such as drugs and rape, but they did not try to do anything other than a fun comedy comedy. As <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The show was done brilliantly, I still see it when I sob like a baby. You can feel that you can feel the passion during the incredibly difficult episode. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that the show has been canceled, I'm still enjoying seeing the resurrection, and I'll never be tired. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you will always be reminded of this lively screenplay on this talented father, who will divorce his daughter by divorcing his daughter, =) you're right rock!
