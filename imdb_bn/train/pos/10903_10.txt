These people are nothing short of surprising. You really feel that you have lived with him in these unfortunate incidents and we are crying to your family. He was not only concerned about himself but also because of his reason for ensuring his survival to others that this painful pain should not be avoided. Every time I see this video bad or "down", and it always with my unbearable pain, just like Jonny, I managed to see the great and bright aspects of life. The only reason I'm sorry for Johnny is not as soon as I know, I went to England twice during his life, and used to say that I would meet him. It's comforting to know, Johnny sitting in his cloud, pain free! Peace Rest, Dear Johnny You deserve it!
