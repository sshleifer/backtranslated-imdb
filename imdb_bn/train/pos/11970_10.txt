I came to my age at the age of 9. It seems like most of the funiest videos in America are seen again with Bob Saguet and one day my mother told me that he is also known as the Flower House. One day, I was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting the family. It did not seem to be very interesting at first, but as long as I could see more, at 9 nights, I was just staying in it. <br /> <br /> This show will really want you to stay there, quarrel with girls, make room with them, and even "sing" to their little family. <br /> <br /> The thing that I most like about the Flower House is that it's a great show. Children and adults of all ages. There will be more parts for adults, then the parts are meant for the children, so the whole family will enjoy it. Whatever it may be like, it's still a great show, and I will definitely recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
