I was amazed at how big the man was in the moon. My first meaning was, I was hoping for a very hungry and anticipated movie, but when I saw it I decided to exclude it. Yes, when it was over, I was just left to be the Man in the Moon. This movie is so entertaining and aware of its voice, and it's just an extraordinary movie. The acting was particularly like Reese Witherspoon (who was very nice and loving), and everyone else. There was nothing that really bothered me, I felt the last trend, but it worked very well. I also felt some things being flat or as they were done. Before, but still a great movie. Above all, I must say that I do not say much to tell about this movie, it was not bad, it's just a movie that you like or do not like. But I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, even if you do not like this kind of movie, but it's still an enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8.7
