This is my fourth Joe McDoakes I've seen and summarized one of the so funny. This one, Joe takes a voice lesson from a Charles Brier and Ronald Callman incognito record. She went to Warner Bros's Studio (eventually the company behind this series), she asked Jack Carson to get instructions which both got confused. Then he also met with actor George O'Hagan (also known as McDoakes), who used to say in his usual voice that his next gerro was not far from Jetsson and reached the set, where he automatically compromised the director. I will stop there and say that I was fascinated by the fun and lasting star star Kayomas. The final scene was particularly hot on that note, if you want to watch, go to YouTube so you want Picutres to be!
