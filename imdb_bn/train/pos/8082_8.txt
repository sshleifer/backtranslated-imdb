I've seen this LOTR quite a while. I'm currently hunting a copy for purchasing. Bose's work is true for the main work. The visuals are engrosing and sometimes haunting. <br /> <br /> drawbacks? Occasionally, the movies are confusing or muddled. One or two times the story has a slow motion of the crawl. But, overall - buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
