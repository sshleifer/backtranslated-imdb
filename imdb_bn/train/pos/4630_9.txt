I saw the second iTian Fox photo. Actor Leer Ashkangzi, who has played Walk on Water, also played a minor role in the film. <br /> <br /> The real stars are small Israelis who live together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and Yelli (Alan Friedman); And the Palestinians who join them and - Ashraf (Yusuf Joe 'Sweden). Most of the city / town is going to town (most gay), and they all want to end the war so that they can live their lives in peace. <br /> <br /> but rub. No matter how many posters you have placed or how much peace you have, war will not end. Many have tried to bring two parties to the table for years, but they want to keep what they want to do for any reason. There are many people on the Israeli side, here and here in the United States who simply want it and do not consider peace. There are many Palestinians who can not work with peace. Nobody is interested in ending this war, and the children suffer. <br /> <br /> If you look at this funny and compelling movie it will always be in your mind. It does not go away. You know that some tragic is going to happen and, of course, do it. Feelings on both sides are steadily running and as soon as the motivation takes revenge, the tragedy will always happen and hence make an adult version of this friend / gender in the city. There is no superficiality. It was a real life, and it was a beautiful thing to see.
