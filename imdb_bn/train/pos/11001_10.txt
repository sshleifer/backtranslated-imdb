Canadian director Vinceenzo Natalie took an art-house circuit by storm with a frustrating and amazingly intelligent Cube, which was my personal favorite SF movie of the 90's. It created the basic feeling of a group of strangers stranded in the form of a giant cube, which completely shot on a set and took the idea in interesting direction. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Natalie's follow-up, and although it may take five years for another project, I could wait and say, it's worth the wait. A fascinating exploration of the people of the world of cipher, and how to find themselves in a situation beyond its control through the complete logical discipline of events. <br /> <br /> I do not want to express too much plots, because one of the happiest of ciphers is our way. The viewing age of this SF film of this day and age is so fresh and has many ideas in it. Cipher is a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To send For his mockery, they are incredibly annoying. Covering topics such as shaving cream and shaving as cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan is waiting for a seminar, he defines Rita Foster (a continuously cast Lucy Liu), an ice definition. He closed the brush, but he had something that he thought was irrelevant. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, and I'm not saying anything more about the plot. To do this, we will have an impact on the rest of the picture and it will be very interesting to follow the oppressive path. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever, And cipher follows similar patterns. But this is not the carbon copy of the cube. It has its own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cipher is a film that is more common with conspiracy theatrical and paraniah stories. One of the great things about cipher, these themes are shaking in the story without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his fame is a part of a big puzzle, it is a shock like it to us. <br /> <br /> One thing that distinguishes cyber from cube is how smooth it is. While the cube was limited to a minimum set of budgets designed with a minimum set and unknown cast, the cipher was in a low budget, but Natalie paid as much of its money as possible to the economy, thereby expanding the horizon and launching an extraordinary ride to Morgan. <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some amazing camera angles from above, such as Designer The magnificence of the building is a huge, powerful office block that combines with the small spec that stands out outside Morgan. The image of all the colors in the picture seems to have been found, which congratulate the voice of the film completely like the modern day film-noir. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful all over the world. Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure to question his sympathy with his boyfriend's marriage. Its performance is excellent so it is modulated. He literally feels right in front of our eyes. From a clinical, incredible people will have to do something to preserve their new identity from the incredible people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is borrowed from among black men that it lives in. His view is the best one because it is carefully calculated on suspense and paranoia exercises. He is a supposed expert to mark the double agent, and it is an excellent part of writing, wildly played by Hewlett. He only needs to look at Morgan, and we're dragging him into his complex mind. <br /> <br /> But Lucy Liu is the place to steal this scene. Often he acted in films where his potential full impact is not used. But in the cipher, he finally gave a character that fits him like a glove. Rita is a separate, protected femme fatale that lives with Liu taste. I have always been in constant control because he always appears and can reduce the room for silence by the strength of his ice strength. <br /> <br /> The things come at the end of the very delightful end, which is not often concluded on a hesitant note. But Morgan is worthy of his happy ending. After entering through such a rage, I screamed for him for the final scene. This is a perfect final moment because it comes like a sun ray after 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " And it comes as a refreshing antidote for great and inexperienced matrices. <br /> <br /> A good follow from Natalie And now I'm a fan of a man. Excellent stuff!
