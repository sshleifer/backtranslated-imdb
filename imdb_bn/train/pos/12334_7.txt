Anyone know where this image is shot? The airplane scene on the hills is beautiful. It looks like England. However, the building of the Ivy Apartments is certainly like the brill building, with its attractive elevators. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendel listed "Sir Charles Gaze". Maybe I embrace, but I did not see him. He was probably the husband's lawyer, but, again, I do not think that character is in the film, otherwise besides mentioning phone calls. Perhaps he was the aircraft scene? Or Belum's view? Did anyone find him? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 when he shot this image.
