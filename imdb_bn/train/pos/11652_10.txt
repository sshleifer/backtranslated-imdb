When I was on vacation, my sister wanted to record for me when I was listing all the pictures I came across and I am very happy that I included it. Most directors are ashamed of the fact that my only problem with this movie is that it was made for TV so I could not buy a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> It's amazing how people with diseases eat food, do not necessarily shy away from everyone and actually have many dieting friends. It has brought my attention to the fact that although the bubbles can maintain a fairly stable weight, there are serious consequences on their health that many are unaware of.
