Einstein will be released in theater on 24th March in Sweden. A good occasion for discovering this real and thoughtful documentary for our Nordic friends. It was shown in the clubhouse with an archaeologist dedicated to the festival "Focus Director" Kim Longinototo. He gave a master class, made a lot of praise about his method as a documentary filmmaker and told the audience about special circumstances, which led him to shoot twice in law enforcement forces: the first version was good, so the second shoot was organized and the end of the film Turned to be different. A very horrific problem happened, in this case, to create the possibility of a very powerful movie.
