Disney (and of course, Pixar's Wonderful People) is a nice, funny story that matches the best computer animation. I acknowledge that the 'mouth' of the bugs was probably more static than 'ants' and they had only four legs ('anteja' six ...). But the background was fantastic and the animations were exciting. But let it be a text: it is not a computer that makes it successful: it was the man behind the machine, who added a nice little twist, which I missed from 'antza'. Some highlights were 'bloopers' at the end of the course (so keep watching the observer at the end, it's worth!), Which was extremely fun and original. The lines 'fully portrayed on the positions' were intended for more attentive viewers.
