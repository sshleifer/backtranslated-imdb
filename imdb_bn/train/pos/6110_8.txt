Like "My Sassy Girl", this movie is based on a true story posted on the Internet, but there are similar matches. This story is usually about the rebel man named Jean-Hun (Kayan Sung Wu), who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a teacher named Su-Waiyan (Kim Hall Null), who is a poor background Came from, but he must be of the same age. There are some obstacles in it, martial arts (Gogh always after G-Hun for retaliation), a fool after him, a cold boyfriend sick girl, his campaign to give lessons, and you can generally guess the whole story. I mention it a romantic comedy? This film has some good fight scenes, great visual humor and a lot of reproach, thanks to Chem Ha Nouel and Kavon Sung Waui, a good chemistry, which gives the story a lot of strength. Because romantic elements also work. And, I want to say, I want to make my girlfriend, Kim Ha Nuwel, more like "My Sassy Girl" (by personality, at least) than that girl. She has some spunk, but it's tricky, sweet, more on the hearty way better. Characters are mostly preferred (so someone could say that "My Sassy Girl" - was less than the mountain to climb with the movie that worked for it), and the film is quite tricky and interesting. . The story sags, however, about 2/3 of the way (where it is known, the value of the rental, where the sort of treads on something really interesting interesting), but ultimately, it takes up a little again. Overall, a fun, cute movie. 8/10
