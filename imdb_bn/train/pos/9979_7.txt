To begin with, since this movie is a classic a remix, the ratings have already decreased. This version helps Viggo Martensen, in the role of Kolescisk's main role. <br /> <br /> This is not like the United States, although it is not for the terrorism of its citizens. Jason sounds like Prisonle's character from the movie! But the truth is that the government can destroy a man's life trying to get his wife back home. A wife who is not less in labor, and can not do it. <br /> <br /> "There was a time in this country that a man would take his pregnant wife with a man." Disc jockey's words <br /> <br /> There were some great shots in this picture, and there was great spirituality and there was great spirituality. After a lot of consideration, I gave this picture a 7.
