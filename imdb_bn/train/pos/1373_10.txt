This film should be needed for all librarians or librarians to watch. Best lines are all related to direct librarianship. Public libraries are argued in the academic library of a librarian librarian and the library is waged among school students. It breaks many lithographic stereotypes. Librarians may even be able to stay funny - even if not * usually * are sex in the language section of the romance! (The best movie about librarians? Of course, set up the desk with Catherine Hepburn and Spencer trash.)
