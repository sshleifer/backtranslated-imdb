I just saw the strike back for the first time and it is quite well found. This was George Sanders's first appearance in St., where he replaced Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> This night, Saint Francisco was sent for an investigation into a night club shooting. With the help of her known Inspector Farna, who came down from New York, she helped a girl from a criminal sister. <br /> <br /> Joining Cast Sanders is Wendy Bari and Jonathan Hale. <br /> <br /> is not a bad cinema movie. Viewing price. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 5 out of 3 stars.
