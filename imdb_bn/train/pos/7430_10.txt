Personnaly I really liked this movie, and it moved me especially. The two main actors are giving us such a big performance that, in the end, they really broke down to know what happened to their characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The songs are great way they are. <br /> <br /> I was not surprised when I learned that it won 5 Golden Globe Awards (Golden Globe's most rewarded movie), Oscar and even Grammy. This movie is a classic that is seen by somebody. A great movie, which has often been criticized (maybe Streisand dared to get involved with him, of course, as "co-director"). Its artist's biggest, and that surely you please!
