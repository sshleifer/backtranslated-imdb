Well, what can I say, this movie really came to me, it is not so bad, many say, I really like it, even though the idea is so simple, and rather feels annoying. First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack (Brian Adams), it really goes with the movie. The second general story, and Spirit plays gets your attention. One thing I like most is that they did not give a human voice to communicate with other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, now many animations do not seem realistic? But ... I do not know, just talking about animals ... Lum. <br /> <br /> My opinion is one of the most beautiful animations of 2002, I recommend everyone not only for kids but also because it is very relaxing.
