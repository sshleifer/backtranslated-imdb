Although "Spider-kissed kiss" Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unknown Latin American country, at this time he worked for dictatorship in a fictional Latin American country. In particular, the dictator suddenly dropped the dead, so Julia replaced the President with Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfas) for a movie shooting nationwide. From there, Dreyfas has to be a dictator, maintaining his balance with his own life. <br /> <br /> Is it worthwhile to make the exciting situation of Latin America comedy? Well, "paradora over the moon" does a good job with it. No matter what they do in this movie, they pull it off. It shows why we lost to Richard Dreyfas, the greatest actor of our time and Raul Julia. The price is definitely worth seeing. Also played by Sonia Braga (who played Raul Julia in "TalksW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davies Jr. <br /> I agree: The first lady is hot.
