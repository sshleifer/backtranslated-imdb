The Nifty played for a little part of the primarily smile, but with the tricky tricks of the mystery. In any way a Martin ran somewhere on a broken down bus, but no passenger (talk about your illegal immigrant!). All-star supporter Jack Elam (shying shamefully), Sexy Gene Wils (if he is Martian, then I say that the borders are open!), Huan Hatt (doubtless suspected suspect)), known faces John Attractor and Barney Phillips As a nice turn from Bill Cairns). Even if the action is limited to a single set makes for a very entertaining half-hour.
