This picture was awesome, I thought the original was cool. However, with all four speed transmissions, all components of the Hummy Challenger were found in 1970, which really showed that the Mother Maper knew how to make the best muscle car! I was in Chrysler's heaven, KÃ¶lsky floated the big block Hemie, and he was sure that much :)
