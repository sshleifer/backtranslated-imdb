This was a wonderful 2-episode episode, even though I never met the older ones, I never thought that the doctor was unusual, but not unusual for the overland area. Against this, the episode brings things that we are most afraid of, and how we can make realistic menace in the future and defeat when most opinions are impossible. <br /> <br /> This is a family movie. It was astonished that they brought some things like fear and faith, especially if it was for American entertainers. But what Yannes is talking about, we rock! From the new series in 2005, who have probably shown the potential since the episode, the first is frustrating, fun from serious, light to dark so damaging. I hope many old fans are soon expecting "old doctor who has returned". <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
