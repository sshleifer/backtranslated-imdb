I have shown interest in my son recently in 9/11. He was a kindergarten at that time and had no idea what was happening. I liked the way it is called "documentary". If 9/11 related movie is shown then this will be! Generally you know that you have played it in a movie that is well-known. This movie was known to anyone. Also, you see a movie related to 9/11, you hear a firefighter or two people losing their lives to save lives. I do not think that this was any! I would only consider hiring this movie and adding it to my collection! Very well done really well! My heart goes to families and families of 9/11 victims!
