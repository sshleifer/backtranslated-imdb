"Dressed to Teal" by Brian Depalir, is the best movie, mystery, humor, and style of romantic movement that remains unknown today. Devlum has a left rap in Hollywood, because most people claim that he has closed Alfred Hittak. He is not Hitakoos can only dream of what he sees and show his dream. <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that the original version of "Dressed to Teal" is no longer available on the video. The current copy, published by Good Time, Jack Valentine's approved R rate is cut. But some copies of the actual cut of the depleuler are still available. It is covered by Warner Home Video, in a green cardboard box with Angel Dickinson, or in a black jackfruit with a silver lining poster with a poster. If you can find a copy, get this one. I have a green one and it's in my treasured assets. <br /> <br /> However, the story is back. Dickinson starred Cate Miller, who is a sexually disfigured wife, who for his brutal imagination. He is being treated by Robert Eliot (Michael Kain). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> You can guess what could happen to him because of leaving the ad and box art story. But there are some complications. Hooker (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murderers. Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) is a teenage genius to solve the culprit. And more Eliot's answering machine has a specific message on it ... a missing razor ... <br /> <br /> I'm not spoiling the film for you from the above described opening half hour and the biggest surprises in Dalalama for the last hour. Saved. However, this picture is clear, but enough for Valenity (MPA chief) to demand the film's cost. What he wondered is what he wanted. Some cuts in the initial shower scenes and a few slashing scenes and some of Nancy Allen's dialogue (Valentines changed to "buzz" instead of "cock"). This is a movie that is very violent and bloody, but the objection is to sexual content. Rather than blowing people with a chain gun of Arnold Schwarzenegger, "Lost and Dilereaus" seems like listening to the interpretation of Valentina about how to show two women in a flexible love scene. It is not just fair <br /> <br /> How to "dress up" is so good that it is not only the first rate of technical credits, but performance is also good. Michael Caine, who had many frogs during this period, gave one of his best acting as the doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, perhaps she has played a strong role here. Nancy Allen has added this range of her performance, who screamed her as one of the world's underground and neglected actors. Keith Gordon is wonderful as that talent and I love all his innovations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dialup is one of our best directors who has never been recognized. The latest joke on the AFI's 100 Best Thriller Show shows that very few people really know what a thriller is about. In fact, if they want to open their eyes, they will see that Daplma has kept her career thriller and in fact the best craftsman. Even better than this "psycho". It is a shame that actually very little knows. <br /> <br /> **** 4 star out
