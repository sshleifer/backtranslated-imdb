Hi, I skot (AKA Wadi 7777) I love the film Twisted Discovery, and I love Melissa Jonah Hart on TV because I think she is good. I also like a real fan of Saberina, so it helped my clock (do not ask). Nicole is the way her parents plan to assassinate her very seriously, because she is sure that someone pulls the trigger and practice of bottles, so she does not give her fingerprints (very well planned idea), I guess its old Backfired all over nicole as the lover comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt I'm not ten in this picture, and I'll put it on my top 10 movie list. And last but at least no one can see this image in the store, please tell me that I saw it on TV and did not record it. Bye
