Even at the beginning of his career, the capa was done with his camera-work and his time. It's a slim story - and in most cases, guessable - but he's got very good performance from his cast and some playful camera moves that are intimately related to the audience. The first part looks like the story of Cinderella, though anyone with a brain that comes down from below will fall - the rich 'princess' will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> Yet, due to its good cast and speed fast, easy to get caught in clich√©s. Then the movie has become more original, because married couples have to find ways to live their lives. The end is very expected but satisfactory. I want to appreciate writing the title: Very funny and funny.
