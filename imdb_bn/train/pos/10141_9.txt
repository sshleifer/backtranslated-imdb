I was ready to pan this episode, saw that this 'master' is not really a horror movie under his belt .. but it is easily the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> acting was good !! I do not know how he did this, but we got some real talent for this episode! And when you see things according to plots a mile away, at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me employed for 56 minutes, which was lacking at this stage of the series. <br /> <br /> I especially like the bits, I do not say every one, but wherever they are, it is just as funny. <br /> <br /> really good effort I have said in another review - this is the real master without these episodes. But they may be going to be masters in the future.
