I mostly like Peter Seller. I have never seen this movie portray him as a high-grade Brit. He pulls it off nicely, though you see the Inspector Clouseau bit in the mix. It's not interesting until Golden Hauon arrives. <br /> <br /> I do not expect such a strong performance to be such a young man. His time was great and his expressions were invaluable. She is conveniently looking for ways to shoot down the lecherous character of the vendors and seduces him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is just sixty Down price Hawn's nude for the first few glorious seconds. Enjoy ...
