These low budget erotic thrillers have some good points, but a lot worse. The plot surrounding a woman lawyer is in progress trying to clear her boyfriend accused of murdering his wife. Having a soft-core film, which entails being a secret at a strip club and having sexual intercourse with potential suspects. Go for this type of plot, do not get bad. The script is okay, and the story looks good enough for someone until morning 2, it does not see too many plot holes. But everything else on the film seems cheap. The main actors are not bad, but most supporters are incredibly bad (one girl thinks she is drunk and / or high). Cinematography is burning badly, everything looks violet and ugly. The word is so terrible that you can rarely hear what people are saying. This is the worst thing you see in this film because the sex is sex. Because loaded shoe diary situations are really hot girls, because people see this thing because of hot sex scenes. Sex scenes are not hot, they are terrifying, in the style of the dresses, where both of them shot two people on it. They see women like refuges from a porn shot. I am not trying to be irrational or meaningless here, but all of them have breast implants and a burned / stained look. Even the title, "Deviant Obsession", sounds like a hardcore flick. I do not have anything against porn - actually I love it. But I like my soft core and my hard core. What happened to actresses such as Shannon Toyd, Jacqueline Lowell, Shannon Hiromi, and Kim Doshen? Could that woman work and fully energize you? And what has happened is physical chemistry, nighttime and even stripped to kill. Sure, none of these masterpieces, but at least they felt like movies. Also, they were screwing freak out of the relatively annoying attitudes of Hollywood's sexuality, sexism, and distortion. Now they make hard-core films without hard-core sex.
