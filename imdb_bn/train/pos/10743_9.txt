I read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone is a threatening part of 9/11 history. There are some people who think that yoga is weak and <br /> <br /> I accept that the description is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers after the catastrophe and looking for Tony after a mountain storm. But I do not think the description is unnecessary. I like a lot of the doctrines that I think are narrations of our own lives. We are living and making our own autobiography. So if we talk about our life, then always in the form of a description. We are not involved in the number of such information, birth, childhood, high school etc. We create a story about our lives. <br /> <br /> Because we are familiar with the story, we want to keep history in the story. Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves. When we were told in the form of stories in history, we can understand better. So the purpose of adding a story to that documentary. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand what's going on. If I was there I'd be sick for my brother. <br /> <br /> and the second point, to create a blockbuster movie about it. The truth is, this is the latest incident about bringing a big movie about 9/11. Although, there have been some issues, but none of them are like this documentary. But what will happen if there is 5 years of cinema? I'm trying to earn a lot of money in 9/11. But I agree that movies are the best way to tell history. How many movies have we seen about World War 2? If I do not see these movies, my opinion of WW will make me completely different. I remember the Scandlers list, and I cried for an hour for classes. Films give you a good picture of the events of history, and although it is fiction, it contributes to the memory of disaster and loss. <br /> <br /> So my point: It's not always bad to tell stories, it identifies with our story and we can never forget what happened.
