This special episode of Smith is probably the best episode of the wind after reconciliation after the reunion. This is for many reasons. For example, it leads the series to some of its roots. Lionel was welcomed in the absence of a long time with Metropolitan Luthercorp Plaza Office. This room is not short-lived for a short time, and it is again seen to be a lot of memory from the past. Not to mention, Lion's conversations with Lex are always admirable. <br /> <br /> Another happy return is available, you have guessed it well, Bart Allen Steven Denite does not reconcile only the former Justice Legunaar, he mixes it with a small formula in a unique way, it seems almost like a feature length movie. <br /> <br /> From there you will find basic stories, forming the Green Arrow League, attempting to hit 33.1, Bart is captured, Clerk saves him, and this facility is running out of state operations. All good and impressive, with a good mix of stealth, action, speed and mystery. Oh, and some great new upgrades in Cyborg are the truth of the Justice League :) <br /> <br /> The music probably works so well in this episode. If you think correctly, the first episode was directed by Steven Dignet, it was a season of season 4. This was a medieval episode, but it was felt from a few places. Perhaps it was music, or acting, or true clerk seis, "we did not find you, you found us", the type of people lost faith in the formula. But with gratitude, Steve Knight released himself on this Justice Episode. <br /> <br /> There were a few quizzes about my Justice, which had been completely shortened. 10. First, the Reese Advantage Explosion I think if it was too cold, then the green arrow and cyborg came down to Oliver's bicycle (remembering from the episode of the arrow). Clark and Imps must have run, and Acquan would have to swim with another route. But that was incredibly chessy, closed the whole 10 to 2 points. Second, another Chess moment is not as bad as the first, but when the green arrow seals "let's save the world" That made me cringe. Above all, judging by acting performance, music, direction, and production values, professionals are more than consoles, and it is still one of the best episodes of Chilvilla's history, and perhaps the second best episode of the 6th episode. <Br /> <br /> Out of 10, 7 ...
