9/10 - 30 minutes pure holiday terrorism. OK, so it's not awesome. But make sure it's fun. <br /> <br /> The Crypt Keeper (John Kasser) tells the story of the holiday fair, giving us all the Christmas hues ... gossip Bwahahahahha. You really should be careful for AX Santa. Have a terrific Christmas and a Happy New Fear. Okay, I'll stop. <br /> <br /> In the story, a greedy wife (the world's best screamer, Mary Allen instructor) killed her husband (Marshall Bell, an coach who has killed an ante!) ANOES 2) For the money. However, his plans are destroyed when Santa Suit (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) comes from a crazy killer after his dress. <br /> <br /> If you see it on YouTube you can see it for free, but most of you have already seen this (my third view). But if you do not see it, I recommend you
