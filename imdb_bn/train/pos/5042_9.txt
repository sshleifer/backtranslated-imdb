Explaining what the film's summary should expect is a great job. This is a very good thriller Good shot It is difficult to believe that Bill Payston's director was an early introduction, although some shots are similar to the storyboard version. <br /> <br /> Still, there are few shots that look really good and show some real imagination in the Paxton area. <br /> <br /> This is a great story, and finally some great packing, many of them, all credible, all the fun, and best of all, have kept them well enough to create their true twists. <br /> <br /> The child actor of the film also works very well. I'm usually aware of the movies with the role of kids acting because they often come around as Niccolodon's refusal, but these two kids do both a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie is not glorified. It's not too scary. But it's very, very awesome.
