A series of vinettes, mostly spoofing the television in the 1970s, but with some digs in government and corporate America. One of the longest sections, "The Dealers" is not funny to me and I do not know how it is parading. Something else, though, is totally divided into side. I especially show cooking shows segments. I know most of the silly words are used in movies and, if you protest completely full nudity then stay away.
