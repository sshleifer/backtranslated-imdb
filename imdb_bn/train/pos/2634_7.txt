Lion King 1 1/2 is a very funny and addictive sequel. Do not expect the theater release production standards, but expect maximum quality directly for video release. <br /> <br /> It is starting to see the original Lion King in a dark theater of Timon and Pumba. And suddenly start tracking the tracks and narrating their own stories. This is done with frequent comedic barriers. For example, during a special moment a home shopping commercial pop and an incognito Pumba understand she is sitting on the remote. These little moments are movie of pepper, and if you do not entertain them or not, then it will depend on your humor. If you particularly feel that the audience reminds you of a movie that is deliberately watching, it might not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation has invested in the best Disney DTV line, and is seamlessly integrated with the original element. The new, independent element uses a lot of original artistic styles. Although voice talent is all performed well, I can not think of merging Simpson every time I hear Julie Kavna. <br /> <br /> Many of the movies are presented more with the introduction of comfortable quirks to old friends than annoying generations, but annoying repetitive will be fully acknowledged by the audience. <br /> <br /> Music is a good musical accompaniment I have enjoyed and missed in conformity with the features of a Disney. The dual-tapping opening of the Dig A tunnel is a good dancer and ridiculous. Lion and Pumba lions are taken in the King's opening sequence and take their role in Heaven. The only problem is the replay of 'Dig a Tunnel' at the end of the movie, its music, and the music from the hoarding. <br /> <br /> The line of the story is done very well, and the new integration plot elements are completely complete, although during the Heiner, the final bit has credited the story's credibility. The new story does not look like managing a sachchain or mentally charged moments and it's even better to enjoy the whole comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, the purchase price. If you like all the bonuses that come with a standard 2-disc set, go for it. For Penny Piner who is still interested in investing in Fine, wait four or more dollars to drop off and rent it directly. <br /> <br /> Damian Crowley
