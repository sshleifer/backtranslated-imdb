Modern, original, romantic stories <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Benn Chaplin is shy, dull as well as Clark. Men (and for some women): Miss Kidman looks gorgeous and very sympathetic. I forgot what a beautiful girl! It is not hard to imagine that he fell in love with her. Some unexpected changes in the story are good for mystery. Although I hope a happy ending, the last part of the film was wonderful for me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pace-base: Whit Point.
