This is a fine play and a wonderful change in the speed of today's more powerful and loud movies. This is another solid-based-on-a-true store, which can still be made for dramatic purposes. Actually, I do not know, but I like the story. <br /> <br /> The story has come back in the fifties, people who are interested in rocket and want to enter the field instead of working on coal mines. Everyone else, including his father, is in this West Virginia town. The big problem is the conflict between boy and his father, which I think is overdone. I'd like to take a little less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> Young man, still a boy, Jack Gilillahl, is one of his first acting responsibilities, I think. She is interested, as her school friends here. Beautiful kids look beautiful in modern day movies. The other two main actors of the movie, Chris Cooper (father) and Laura Darn (child teacher who always encourages him) <br /> <br /> Interesting to hear the soundtrack of cinematography 1950. Again: I would like to have more such pictures made today.
