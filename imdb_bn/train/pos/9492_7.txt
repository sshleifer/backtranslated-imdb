This picture was enjoyable but due to the wrong reasons. The combination of action sequences is ridiculous and the movie has some interesting skip stick moments to create. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson saw memorable scenes together at the end, where Williamson said to GTK, "Be sure you become friends!". I only enjoyed this movie for Ginti and Williamson, but not for the story that is written behind the four-line napkin and the rest is probably the most advertising-free. A film with more than 30 parts has a credit list for 10 or more. It seems impossible that there is no credit to anyone else in this movie, perhaps there was some insight on how they could see the last product. The one thing that goes on for this film is that it is violent, so that Fred will be able to produce three times the film with Williamson and Robert Ginti.
