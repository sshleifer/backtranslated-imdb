"Tarzan and Hais Mate", one year after the events of MGM's Tarzan photo, "Tarzan the Ape Man". Tarzan and Jane are happily living in the jungle, and Harry Holt (one of the first movie explorers) came back, at this time elephant graveyard was with less respected Martin Arlington than elephant elephants. Naturally, there are various kinds of dangerous and exciting events. <br /> <br /> The first movie is romantic everything - jungle, adventure, romance itself, wild animals and even death. The second image still has a great deal of romanticism and wonderful action sequences, but more serious voice underlines this step. Characters dare to ask such as: Tarzan something happened? What could he do in jail if he could keep himself in the middle of the jungle and he could save himself? Although probably these questions will be asked by true people, this creates a certain amount of softness that is not much fun than the wind-like attitude of throwing up. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is that we grew in the relationship between Tarzan and Jane. Tarzan still speaks very broken English, but he clearly learned some new words from his partner. In addition, their love for each other is really blistering, and we think they have really lived together in the jungle for a year. <br /> <br /> Most people "Tarzan and his companion" are the monkeys. "Personally, I like the first picture a bit better. The main reason is that the relationship between Harry Holt and Martin Arminton is essentially James Parker (Jane's father) Along with Hollt's relationship, it is not nearly as good as Mr. Arlington's character could have acted as a great villain, but he is more of the film's hero Who acted as a hero. The movie can never decide that we like him or hate him. (Also, I do not want to give anything, but in one of the scenes where he should definitely hate, Jane never gets to know about that incident, So the end was not as much as possible.) These opponents are relatively small, but this is still a great movie. <br /> <br /> The first movie Like the "Tarzan and the House Met" amazing action scenes, amazing wildlife footage, and the greatest romance of the screen. If you liked the first movie to be a sikyuyala it.
