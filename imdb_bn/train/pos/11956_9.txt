I would also like to say some shades of Hitcoak ... it is obviously better than MMM, which seems to be most convicted by Woody fans. However, did you know that Annie Hall was considered as the mystery of the first killings? However, Woody reclaims some relevance of film comedy with this. The plot is beautiful and tight to activate. I would say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some actors hurry very fast while giving their lines, but nearby sticks. Scarlett Johansson plays the role of Dean Keaton and there is no uncomfortable moment between him and his older Woodie. No perfect actor could have imagined for Peter Lyman's role than Jackman.
