The final nightmare of Movie Freddy's death is the nightmare of all nightmares like Elm Street, awesome and annoying, yes, there is comedy essence about it, so there are all the other movies, but how can anyone say that you will not find Freddy Kr√ºger, if you are in this dream You come to the man, but you do not fear him with a comic summary about him because Her comedy shows that she does not take care of her to kill you that she thinks it's very funny, and Freddy played comic match with them, which is very annoying in her own way, using her ridiculous ways, I think that this horror Movies make nightmares on Elm Street, which they today, the author is very clever and makes Kruger laughable and scary. Like opposing Jason Verishis, who did not say anything and did not really grasp the intricacies of his victims, this film is as good as Freddy's intelligence and I would recommend it to someone with a sense of humor "Do not sleep!"
