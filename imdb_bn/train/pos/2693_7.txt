Although the story is basically a routine, and "wonderful" is nothing but a bad joke on the end of the audience, but you can see how these good actors have attracted the project - it gives them the kind of role that the good actor can enlighten, and they shine . The film is made arbitrarily - for its time. It was rebuilt as "under suspicion" in 2000 and if you only want to see a version of the story (it's all deserved, really), I mentioned Hopkins's up-to-date direction and more clearly pointing to the plot points that could only indicate. End, still, hit. (** 1/2)
