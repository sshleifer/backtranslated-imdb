You probably already know this already, but recently 5 additional episodes can be seen at ABC.com which I have seen several television and it is probably my favorite show. It is a crime that has canceled this beautiful writing and acting show. Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mei, Damian, Anna and Omg, Steven Kasman - the actors are incredible in these roles and so normal. Even the kids are great. Wonderful show So sorry it's gone. Of course I wonder about the reasons it has been canceled. I believe that there is no relation with Mrs Mannahan's pregnancy. It was the perfect time slot in this market. I have seen all the episodes again on ABC.com - I hope they all come out of the DVD for a while. Thanks for reading.
