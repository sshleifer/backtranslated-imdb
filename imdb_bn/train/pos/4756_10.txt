It breaks the tension of some confusing moments, with some fun dialogues and fun characters, one of the more interesting episodes of Twilight Zone. Normal blonde vamp "dancer" (What is the relation between Sterling's love for this type of character, as it is shown in different episodes?) And other mixed characters, but Jack Elam's "old man" who steals the show completely. I consider this fun, light-hearted version of "The Monster's Era Maple Street at Du" - or, perhaps, the 20-minute twillite zone parody of "The Thing". On another note: I thought that young lover of this episode could be someone who had finally gone to other things - he was known - but it seems that "Ron Kapping" disappeared after the two TV credits of his name.
