I saw both "Fire of a Black Hat" and "This Spinal Tap", I can honestly say that both of these movies must be seen. "Fear" that many times you will have hysterics. It's no wonder why both cinema follows such a huge culture. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. If you must rent it, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to do it for yourself.
