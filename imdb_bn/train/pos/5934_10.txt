Saying I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Of course, our batman started to give movies like that. Oh, on the way to Hollywood, I think they can cover the story line of Movie Batman, but we really want to see Batman and Superman together, do not entertain us. I really hate this trailer because it keeps me missing for more. I was around to see when I was coming out. It was like a terrible real joke. The story line is good where the graphics seem difficult and it was a great movie all the trappings. Unfortunately it's not going to happen for now. Great for producers, directors and all actors but I hate you for doing this. You left me more neglected.
