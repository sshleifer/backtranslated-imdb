I've read the recent comments from this movie and I want to give feedback. You probably are not familiar with the original story of Rap group NAAA. Dates started in 1988, the density of ice in the year 1989 left the band and in 1991, As a result, many beef came out with the density of ice in 1991 and the departure of dr.dre. This story was somewhat based on him. <br /> <br /> More movies were funny than this 90-minute sunny spree, the way they explain the booty juice songs to be political statements. "Love songs" are not mentioning delicious hooking up. And when Vanilla Sherbur kicked her ass, the record company executive was also happy and they were shooting every time the managers too. <br /> <br /> Those who do not enjoy this movie, they might have got it or were completely stupid, my opinion
