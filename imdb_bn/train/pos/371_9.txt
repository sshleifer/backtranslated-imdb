I think the film was for academy awards and did not win any category. For my life, I could not remember what it was against, but one thing I can say is: This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And Steven Spielberg's film did not mean anything to me. <br /> <br /> Basically, it is a black woman who is growing up from a girl to justice and misery. Many injuries that are annoying and alarming, but they all need to see how much this woman has been kept. Alongside the road, we see other women who have suffered hardships and have been walking along with them. Hoopie Goldberg gave her best performance in this movie. Danny Glover has also got nomination for his role in this movie at least. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it deals with its subjects humanly, like some of the recent "loved ones" like crazy fights. Any nation I see this film encourages someone. 9/10
