I feel obliged to respond to comments posted on the front page of this photo page because it was a bit of a mistake. <br /> <br /> I originally posted the quote from the original poster, but I was not sure it was correct that it was not a "comment" index and a message board (although we used to do this before adding the MMDB film message board) So I'll edit this to make it unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Well, you would not be aware of this before, but Gene Kelly became famous for producing the original "PAL Joe" on Broadway. When Vincent Minerali decided to create a Garswin "Panorama" film, he wanted his Kelly characters to be more sophisticated than most of the "good two shoe" roles in the movie (except for "Four Me and My Gallo"). Allen J Larner was instructed to create a new story set in Paris based on "Paul Joe's Story". This allows Kelly to play her famous role from Broadway, although Warner has excluded outgoing MGM for the rights of "Paul Joe". In my opinion, WB film "Paul Joe" is a relic, although Sinatra was perfect for the role, but other issues narrowed the film (script change and poor direction.) ================== ================================== <br /> <br /> You have complained that the pictures of Kelly prove them It is also not good to quote your art education, but you miss the fact that Kelly's bad industry is clearly eaten. It was designed as a rap and it is necessary for stories / characters.Photos are so bad, visitors know that Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, even if Milo has sugared him around her point where she is not. "But, he is a great artist, if he gets the chance!" You were completely aware of his shortage of viewers. <br /> <br /> Then you complain that he has severed his interest in the show; again you do not understand the structure of the story he refused because he does not want to feel a gigolo, and because he knows that he is really ready for the show No His source for the show is certainly not as great as "encouraging" the "nightclub" tide. But it works the same as the plot. Remember, it is indispensable in "Paul Joey" (play) that Joey leaves her nightclub when she realizes she is not worthy of her. The same with the art show If Kelly's images were really good, it would reduce the entire point of view. ================================================== = <br /> <br /> Then you complain that because Kelly does not have any "chemistry". I guess in the eyes of watching it. I agree, chemistry should not be as strong as them, but it was just for me. Compare "Worst" romance with Curry Grant and Sofia Lorraine among "The Pride and the Passion". ================================================== == <br /> <br /> <br /> When you say that there is nothing else to do in this film at the end of the big dance, it shows that you do not sink as a symbol below the surface of the film. In the continuation of the dance, many elements are related to stories and characters, and through dancing the plot is resolved through picture and symbolism. Find it love, enjoy love, then lose love (he looks around and his love has gone). Symphony's movements were created so that each dance scene mirrored a different stage of the Paris industry and a different stage of their relationship. If you do not see it, then it's not a movie blame. It certainly does not have a "shit load". ==================================================
