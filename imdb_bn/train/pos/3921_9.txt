In Carmen, Solar again wants to establish a dynamic relationship between reality and fantasy, among the real feelings of the personality of a dance company, the dance form of opera Carmen and the fictional Carmen story, to create dancers, the famous fatal mix of a free spirit (negligence for honesty Read) and crazy men with the desire to drive his powers. Solar The fiction / reality of this same car was previously used in black and white pictures, Bods de Sanger (blood marriage). However, tensions between blood dancing practitioners show how they acted in the imaginary characters of the story, acting in their roles, in Carmen, among the small dancers, parallel rehearsals of the dancers, the spirit of building relationships with paranormal rehearsals and never becoming credibleAchakachi not come. This is a gadget, and, for that reason, remains an annoying distraction. To appreciate comparisons, one must see blood marriages next to Carmen. However, it is rarely important, the Melodyram Solar tries to put pressure on his Carmen, because Flamenco's dance and rehearsal guitar music, which is in the 95% of the film, some of the best Flamenco dancers and musicians, have more entries than its value. A flawed film, and a surprise: Keats' 'negative power' is probably suitable for a drill, perhaps?
