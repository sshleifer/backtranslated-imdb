It's been one of the best movies I've seen in the summer of 2006 (after the end of the last war ... ...), because of the war, people make me fun for a long time, and it does not matter whether the boy- Girls, direct and gay, Jews and Arabs ... I have seen the bubble three times, and it's still wonderful and exciting me- every character I am I am reminded, and the difference between them is the same difference as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw - was my friend, who was a Christian Arab, and it was the day of Israel's independence (I can be the most symbolic! How wicked) and .. He cried in the end! If he is touched and not embarrassed - everybody will touch the bubble!
