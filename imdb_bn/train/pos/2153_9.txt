This movie was charming. An accountant wants more life than an approved conventional success. It works so well and distinguishes it from a map dance film that it is not about being "cool", it only finds ways to express your own voice. In the end, big wins are not a win-win contest, but not a whole new lifestyle, but it is easy for you to fulfill other parts of your life. Nobody is discovering their emotions, they are finding their quiet soul. <br /> <br /> The Japanese background makes both understandable and personalized dance of "the secret life" of eloquence and vowel. We all can see ourselves all.
