"Callifiler" is a strange and terrorist Odyssey from Hollywood that tells two couples that they share the cost of summer to cross-country from California: Decreasing (Lewis and Pitt) and two Vietnamese artists, a photographer and a writer (Duchovny and Forbes) Pitt's "nails" is his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller. A good watch for those who are in Psycho-killer flix.
