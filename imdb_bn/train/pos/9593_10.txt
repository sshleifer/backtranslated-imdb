First of all I have a chest, straight white male. But even with that disorder I love this movie. It's about real people A real time and space. And of course, in New York City of 80. I was about to become many gay friends in New York in the 80's and one thing about them that I always admired was that they wanted to live their life so that they wanted to live their life. No matter what the consequences It's brave. You have admired that. It's a great movie, and see what was a bright African American or Hispanic gay guy in New York in the decade of the arrest. This is real life. Below it is real life in the line.
