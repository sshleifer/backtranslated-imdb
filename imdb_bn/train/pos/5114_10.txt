The urban cowboy was not absorbed with the same testos found in a rodeo, it gives an accurate focus on that day and age of urban Texas. I think it should have been time and time to really criticize the film. Nice music, funny time and yes, some "rough and tumbles" were at the honky tonk roadhouses. Bud and Sisir's relationship, "It was better to cross two ships in the night". When Pam had written to Bud, the note was drawn, it reflected the true romance tragedy. The whole story is well thought out. I cast and crew did an excellent job. I was well written and directed at the screen play. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
