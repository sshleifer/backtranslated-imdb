"Bruce Almighty" looks and is incredibly stupid, especially from the trailer. Still, I got a deep message in it that actually made me like this movie. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is given anger by God and given divine power by him to be God for a week to see whether he can do a good job. Morgan Freeman acted as a godly man here as God, and although it is not his usual type of film or his best role, he does a great job with what he has done to work with him. Although sometimes crude, the film gets a lot of smiles, split its sea from Bruce into half of it, like the red sea, and with customers' responses, Freeman's seemingly decorated and image of God's advertising It is sometimes too over-exaggerated, and has some strange humor, but overall it guides to be a little fun. Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carle, who always helps, have a suitable supporter cast. The end of the movie is proven to be very romantic and tears, and the message is clear that we should do what we should do and make "miracles". The film is perfect, but still enjoyable, and better than me and probably many people would expect, especially if we see the film's deep message. <br /> <br /> *** ** **
