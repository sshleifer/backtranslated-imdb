Cast was good, and I think it's a good performance for Christopher Lloyd, which I liked from previous movies. The film was a great family movie, which is nothing to show you concern for younger kids, it is a good story line, cheerful, light-hearted and enjoyable. It fits the bill if you want to entertain children without tears of tears. The child is not happy, and is not difficult for a parent's watch.
