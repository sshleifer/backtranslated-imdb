I thought this was a totally charming film. The story seems to be a thinly obscure autobiography of John Waters: The best gift of the peacock is its ability to find beauty in an unexpected place. Edward Furlong has done a good job for leadership, but his acting is his grandmother Minnik Stol (a cheerful sitio) and everyone has a patty heart. I think critics are the way to close this one base. It seems that they are taking the worst assessment of his work as a packer's gospel, when I think the film clearly says that he is really a promising artist
