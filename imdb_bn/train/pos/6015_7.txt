In the early 1970's, many of us were involved in the transparency of Hippies / Acid / Alternative Culture, realizing that the mainstream society would not change as we thought. For me this picture is "now what?" I knew that many people felt at that time. We raise our heads for commune and make ostriches their own views, or do we push for radicalysis and change? <br /> <br /> From the distorted gesture to the police, radical ornaments, pinky floyd songs, love in the desert and explosive images - there are so many. It captures a significant moment of time well.
