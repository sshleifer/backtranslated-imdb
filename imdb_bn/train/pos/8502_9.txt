Gong Ho is one of the movies you want to watch over again. A Japanese car company, Michael Keton, was charged for coming to town, making jobs for the residents of Hadvill. What will happen next is a later sunny moment. Clash between two cultures and hold things together as Keaton. Find out great performance from Keaton, Zed Wattenby, George Wendt, Mommy Rogers, John Tarturo, Soh Yamamura, and Sub Shimomo. All are fully cast. Few numbers will not be fooled by ratings. This is my book a 7.5. It is interesting to note that the name of the city of Haidewen was also used in High Nun√©. Yes, there is a real Hadleville but Oregon.
