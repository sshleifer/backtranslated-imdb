A good little thriller to see Red Eye on a Saturday night. Strong performance, extraordinary villains and unexpected actions <br /> <br /> Somebody does not want to see this movie because it is for less than 85 minutes and 88% of the movie plane and just right. Do not worry they will drag it very well with smart and malicious conversations. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a new ground for PG-13 film director Wes Kraveen. But definitely he is as fierce as the thriller he has achieved. <br /> <br /> These movies are the strongest aspects. This movie requires good actor to provide dialogues and thrills. If they do not have that actor then the film will lose and be annoying. We had Rachel McAdams from average girls and wedding crashers. Batman starts Cillian Murphy and 28 days later. Brian Cox X-Men 2 <br /> <br /> This picture was great. Just when your thoughts are going to get annoying they throw a twist on you. Thankfully, this is not a long movie and it also does not seem to be so. Many good flight movie flights. <br /> <br /> My flight plan here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not very long and not very cold. <br /> <br /> 8/10
