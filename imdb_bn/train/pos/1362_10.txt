My own and my groovadelic 20-something pals just can not get this awesome Parker Posey classic! I tried to rent the DVD, but it does not look very bad, because I'm sure the features will be "extra special"! :) We all recommend this uber-cool comedy Flickrino for this date, even sitting in the house in the night! It will also be a full-screen film to watch with your cat, or a party party based on a party like a "party girl", such as a movie, that will be loving, stylish, shaky, fashionable, a party based party like Pozzy. Oh, and look for a gripping and luxurious wonderful completion ... move apart, borrow six, you've been outdone by a radar movie! Sorry, no crime, just like calling it! Take it from an old flick lover, not better than "party girl" with comedy Parker P! Feel it! Yours, Ronald Marie McDougall (Ur DJ Cyber-Rap)
