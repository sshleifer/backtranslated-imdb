When I came out I saw it in the movie theater, and the crowd was really in the movie that made the experience more fun. It is a big cast of letters, a big name in it, some of which are not considered as recognized. I think it's a great idea, if you follow any of these actors, or like them in other movies, you can add it to your watch list. Some of these scenes really remind me of the good decreasing comedy with some professional supplies from my favorite actors, The Birdcage or even The Clue. The film has made you a great job as some observers in the soap culture of the day, perhaps even very realistic.
