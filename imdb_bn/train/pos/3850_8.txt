This last Dutch language film, Paul Verevenen, was created before the mainstream Hollywood film "Basic Institute," "Robocop," and "Total Recall". He opened this story with the story of a black widow spider with the victim of its web, before we met Gerard Rave, an annoying short-lived author who imagined Morning. Gerard was invited as guest speaker at the Literary Club meeting in Amsterdam's city center for an hour or more from Amsterdam. Verhoeven has glimpses of how Gerard's imagination twists the reality of us. When the author wanders a little closer to the madman, he admits that he reads the magazine and "I say," I read the bomb, if I read 'Blood', 'blood' will fall when I read 'red' when I see 'dead . "When he told a story enough times he began to believe it; "I lie true." He took the proposal of the owner of a beautiful rich salon owner of the club's treasurer overnight. When he asked her and her husband died, she began to imagine that she was a 'black widow'. Is this a twist of his reality or is he a murderess? It is a psychological drama and one of these old movies is stuck in my memory, I think my favorite gender Looking at his body's work, it seems like Paul Wehrhoven, and he really is a master of our own understanding. It's a nice change in speed from normal Hollywood hire. I saw it in 1983 and it is a film that "stuck."
