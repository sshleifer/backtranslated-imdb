Another reason to watch this fun movie is Florence Rice. Who is Florence? That was the first response as the first credit screen ran the credit. I soon found those who had to roam Florence, who are a real beauty who enabled a simple wonderful performance. They do all these gripping ensemble pieces. Since 1939, it is a different time but there is a lie of charm. It's you transfer into another world. It starts as a light comedy but then turns very serious. Runs the towel from the heroine to Florence Rice comedienne. She is absolutely delightful, at the same time develop a strong, weak from a woman to a girl. See the expression of his face at the end of the movie. He made 40 movies, and I'm not going to find another thirty. Alan Marshall proved to be a perfect match for Flint / Gayle mode and for Florence. Body Ibsen and Una Merkel provided some excellent comic moments, but the real star Florence Rice. 30/40 movie supporter, do not miss it!
