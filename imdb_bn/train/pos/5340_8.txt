As the Spanish / American girl goes to Spain near Spain during the Spanish Civil War, Clara is very nice to have the character title of the film. It turns out that the mother dies at home, and she goes with her grandfather. She has many experiences in friendship and in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) first became a concern to her then they became close. The image is shot nicely, mostly dancing in soft colors. Carroll is interested in his father, who is a war pilot, and you can feel him for love. Although the war itself is the kind of thing behind this film, it surrounds the character of the character. I think you would love it, especially Clara, look at it, who has done a great job as Carroll. He must surely see one.
