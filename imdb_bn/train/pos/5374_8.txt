William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Petersen (Rachel Davis) bought an old house where a brutal murder took place years ago in a very bad way with the intention of recovering it. They went with their daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley) and became friends of their neighbor Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, barking barks, death of Sophie's cat, happens. At Sophie's birthday party, a piped blood torn and they leave the place, then reveal the secret. <br /> <br /> "The House the Death Blood to Day" is a terrific and one of the best episodes in the series "Hummer Horror House" Excellent twist, revealing a secret, and tragic conclusion is really nice. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A dead body is dead" ("death sentence")
