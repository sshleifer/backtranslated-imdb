I have seen this movie almost 20 years ago and have not forgotten it. It nicely portrays and keeps a riveted for the whole time of the story. It is difficult to believe that it was made in 1946, because the story is still fresh, and really makes a thought. I am not very knowledgeable about film technique, but the special effects of this movie were made when it was made to look fantastic. In addition, superb acting, and quite wonderful use of English and American actors. I recently bought the DVD so now that I can see. I highly recommend anyone interested in British film fighting for this war.
