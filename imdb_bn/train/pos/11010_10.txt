When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned about existence and identity, many movies were expected to be used as inspiration. It did not really happen, surprisingly, and it appears to be taking up to 2002 for a movie of the same theme. But cipher would say its cloak would be its dishonesty. <br /> <br /> This story is about Morgan Sullivan, who is applying for employment with a high-flying techno company called Designerpe. His job is to gain information about a spy and a competing company, under an assumed and false identity. His life is completely normal, but he has to lie to his wife about what he really is doing. However, before the plot starts the conspiracy and knowing what is happening, he really asks who he really is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br> It will keep your seat edge round with a sensational journey through the very near future, and well played. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
