I'll start by saying that it will be panned by everyone inadvertently! In fact it was not what anyone expected, especially from Guy Ritchie. Did everyone expect what cocaine gijers and good fishing boats "Like?" Etc., but this is much more mature than his previous work. I would agree that it is confusing but we have all the facts that we only have to see them and listen to the harsh, this movie demands all your attention! Keep an eye on the cool and striking look of the movie, instead of praising performance, try to listen to the conversation and I think we will get more thorough understanding of the whole film. <br /> <br /> Yes its effects from modern classics (combat clubs, decor fiction etc), but it is not the musical score on both sides with the main aspect and pacing. I think that if everyone sees this movie over and over, it can understand a lot and it may be appreciated for the fragmentation of the modern movie and I hope Richie will continue to disagree because I like it in his "best".
