More about Taki than the movie Grey watch. It is also about Indigenous, Canada, English, Gray Oul's Ant and North Bay Nugget. Nice story <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary movie, like a book that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and quality. The original scene is Gray Wall Pony and his reaction acknowledged his imposture. <br /> <br /> A few observations on user ratings. Note that user ratings are in bilateral clustering 5 and 7; It's not for everyone, but there's a strong follow up. This movie is underrated and ignored but will be targeted for years to come. Also, some women watched the movie but it was higher than men. Has it been marketed properly? <br /> <br />
