Simply, one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. It's a parody of crime-parodies, all of which represent Chicago-1930s. - There is no real need to underestimate this movie because ratings are below 5 years. It is a mass opinion, and the mass is hypnotized. Who has decided to see it - it will be sad, who does not decide to see it - will be more sorry.
