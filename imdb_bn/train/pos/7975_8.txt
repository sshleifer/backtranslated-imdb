I just love the documentary of Malel They are so popular and simple but still fascinating. I do not know why this documentary works. It's about Glenco, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, really. But still Malle managed to make it interesting and interesting. His love for humanity, even racist or authoritarian, is so damn that you can not only help but fall in love with them too. <br /> <br /> Most of its pictures were painted in Malay in 1979. After 6 years he found out what he came back. It has been a good film without material after 6 years but this small addition makes it great. It may have been just like malice, but that's not really what happened in the series. About up to the series people Malle's emphasis has happened to every person but this is not so much what happened to the community. And the change is great. 1985 Reagan era and peasants are suffering. Once proud people, no one sees so much future and parents expect that their children will educate them and do something other than the farmer. <br /> <br /> This documentary is quite relevant today. Our financial crisis started today due to the incident. Look at these final words in the picture, spoken by an elderly lawyer (1985) from the city: <br /> <br /> "Yes, I have high expectations for this country because that's just right now, just as the emotion of greed characterizes my mind It can be done and a nation can not live long with that passion and especially a democracy which is ... well - well - there are many good people in this country and many good people and they will not go - they are This will not subscribe to the philosophy of greed which is now going on, it is very dangerous. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately it's been over 20 years ago and a hell that had a headache earlier.
