Cinderella is a beautiful young girl, who is cruelly treated by her mischievous parents and stepisters. One day, a ball will be held in honor of the prince, but there is no scope to go to Cinderella, because her parents and children will not let her go. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she is close to the ball, with the warning back home by midnight. He filled hands with handsome Prince Tumming. When the clock strikes midnight, he runs home, leaving behind one of his glass slippers. With the help of his animal friends, his true identity is revealed. He and later the princess married, and they lived happily afterwards. <br /> <br /> The Cinderella box office success was released 56 years ago, and it has attracted visitors today. This is a well written script. Characters are memorable. The song "A Dream Is It's Your Heart Make Up", "So Is It Love", and the great "BBBD-Bobby-Bu" story helps to help the story. This was growing up my favorite movie, and it lost no of its charm. A true Disney Masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 PSS The latest DVD release is the best way to appreciate this movie, including features, deleted scenes, music videos, vintage radio programs and the restored print of the movie!
