Like the comedy pair of his title, "The Sunshine Boys" became a classic forgotten after 30-year-old years. In addition to the comedy of other great movies in the 1970s, it is notable. Given the singular specialty of this photo, perhaps the best Nile Simon ever wrote. There is no point in it. <br /> <br /> Walter Clark played Wiley Clark, once famously known as Luis and Clark, the legendary Vaudville Comedy, now a bitter 73-year-old singer who is not getting a job in potato chips. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is convinced that if he can get the job, then the will agree with celebrity partner Al Lewis (George Burns) to celebrate Nostalgia ABC-TV in the show business. <br /> <br />> Nostalgia is the "Sunshine Boys", it started from the beginning, clips of the 1920s have long before many entertainers displayed our entertainers in line with Cole Porter's "BA Clown". Then there is the current setting of Manhattan Film, where there are plenty of floating trousers and spacious polyester ties. This time, in the glorious world of Manhattan apartment will be confronted with conflicts, where long dead celebrity photography and cartoons come out of the walls in the lorried tabloid title and empty jabber grocery bags. If you were alive in the 1970's, you might also feel that you were in that apartment. <br /> <br /> <br /> He is sleeping in front of television while kettle flies in another room. Wiley wakes up and raises the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is this?" A break <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, gold. The wonderful thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is that it cuts off your noses without closing your noses almost in the absence of the will. "89 years old and like him, he does not die." The friend of an old songwriter of Willi said that people probably died because of writing a song "Lady" with "Baby". <br /> <br /> Burns has won an Oscar for his disgraceful but firmly lucrative performance as Louise, but it is Matthu who makes this one home, his makeup and pride but really he has sold you at the age of 73 when making this concept. Wiley is extremely extremist, fully describing Ben's "Crazy Freakin" is suitable for the old man, but you enjoy his bread for others, even when he has the patience of others to gain his small victory. His lines also kill you, especially when he is trying to kill Luis, for which TV reunion is going to be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You are out of touch!" Wiley tells Lewis at one point. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Herbert Ross comedy and shoots at least a bit less casual and differently, with less light and moderate shots on emotional moments to leave the message knowing the whole of the film through taking a quiet silence. You never see what movie you see, many characters of "The Sunshine Boys", and RUSS instructions, like acting in three principals, cross the long path towards achieving that end. <br /> <br /> <br /> The comedy is difficult, especially when things show people life passes by them, but "The Sunshine Boys" makes everyone happy because this is our view.
