At the end of the 19th century, somewhere in the American West, the needy money was needed in a buffal hunt The leader of the group believes that the buffaloes are too much to influence the victims, but more experienced hunter-gatherers can see how fast they are slowly watching, and he is not sure. The film's roots in South Dakota and the actual hunting movie (showing the role of the movie as the necessity of the beginning), this film is a great work to present with the scourge of sculpture and after this it is a wonderful work of its influence on American Americans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The real story is about a complex family that creates a small group for hunting. The character of the father is a violent man with a little fuse. Sandy, her "brother", an experienced hunter who is tired of the killings, but needs his job after losing his cows. A half-Indian boy, who completely hates caucasian appearance, took the role of adopted son. Dada (and moral compass) is an alcoholic steam skinner; Charlie's "wife" was an Indian woman whose associate was stolen after her horse was stolen. <br /> <br /> Charlie is obviously the most attractive figure. He is humiliating and humiliating to everyone around him, but at the same time he knows that he is the only family and friends who have him. Hijacked Indian women expect to hate him, then take him, but he does not tell how he will not react when he responds. He was the first who gathered the family, but eventually he was also to destroy it. <br /> <br /> It's all like the classic "Red River", which also features a family of isolated family by increasingly violent and isolated father's personality. As one can expect, this movie is suffering from comparison. The character does not focus on the development of letters and family dynamics, and the aspect fails to keep all the scenes of working towards this common goal. Charlie is not so unlikely from the very beginning that we have no reason to care for him or her family. Positively, though, the surrounding herbal duff adds an extra layer of film and its conclusion is far more than the end of Hollywood, which moves towards the end of the "Red River". As a result, "The Last Hunt" is an interesting and entertaining movie, which is well-formed, but it will reduce what is needed to consider it a classic.
