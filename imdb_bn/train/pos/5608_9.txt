Sure, after this film he was quickly disgusted, but Roman Polanski from "Knife in Water" can be counted to provide something interesting and unique to "Tenant". Despite many ongoing themes (isolation, paranoia), none of his films are really the same. This story is somewhat similar to its own "perversion" ten years ago, but the voice is completely different. "The tenant" managed to maintain a bold balance with some truly suspicious pleasures (though I'm not hesitant about it being ridiculous though dramatic behaviors and conversations were occasionally funny). Polanski was always a master of luxury building, and the moments of this photo are almost unbearably unclear. The picture's overall oddity plus <br /> <br /> In addition to the normal aspects of Polanski, the rest cast and the crew contributed a lot. Polanski actor Polanski director is often overshadowed, but here its performance really captures the ideas of awkwardness and a distraction in his character. The themes of social discrimination make this movie more exaggerated than just curiosity. The rest of the cast also offered a strong performance, especially the Adjani sympathetic turn in Isabella, and Mellveen Douglas and Shell Winters. "The tenant" is often made because the testimonials are favorable for both "Replus" and "Rosemary's Baby", yet bright like those classic ones. (9/10)
