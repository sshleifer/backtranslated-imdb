This movie was disastrous at the box office and behind it was the film's innocence, the story's sweetness. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of this story is very good, the director tried his best. Wonderful and impressive, and he is again flowing in his role, he played the best of comedy or psychic scenes. Soha movie looks so sweet Throwing a rest star was easy. Music and all the songs are good, Himesh is impressive as a singer here. Do not miss this movie, it's a great movie and a good feeling for us. The best job ever. I will give Ashtahasta 9/10.
