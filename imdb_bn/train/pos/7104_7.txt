Los Debutants, the story of two orphan brothers, who went to southern Santiago after their mother's death. Confident and on the street Silvio, elder brother, works for the owner of an ornamental strip club after accepting the absolute Victor for his 17th birthday. <br /> <br /> Silvio is like a flower under her boss education, both brothers are owned by owner's sexy and manipulative ownership, Gracia. As the film is released, the characters are redefined again, as we begin to see each other as fascinating and delicate and in extra ways. <br /> <br /> The image is well-crafted with good cinematography and fast pacing. It is also quite sexy with nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes. It uses popular-popular techniques of stratification to different scenes from different perspectives from the chronological order. Many people hate such movies because they do not understand what they understand - memotis, pop fiction, reservoir dogs and many other good movies are using this device. The plot itself is nothing new, there are silent elements of body heat, PL fiction and many other good films. <br /> <br /> Various levels have been exposed, our understanding of characters and their motivations develop. Although the plot may be somewhat frustrating, it is also tricky and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I'll call it an enjoyable movie, valuable, but not something memorable. I did not see many pictures of Chile, and it is always interesting to see silence of movies from other countries. Otherwise, rent it if it is available, but do not lose a sleep if it does not.
