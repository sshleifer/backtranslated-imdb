Although I love this movie, I can rarely see it, it is very real. So, I keep it tonight and hide behind my computer bank. I remember it clearly, but just wanted to see that I could find something that I did not see before ... .. I'm not going: because it is very real to me. <br /> <br /> Another "user" writes that the comments age should be shown by their summary. For all of that! It is very clear that these people who comment on "Midnight Cowboy" can not be born when they are released. Later, they mentioned other movies by John Voight and Dustin Hoffman. I'll just be upset: I am 82 years old. If you are familiar with some of my other comments, you will be aware that I was a professional woman-incognito for 60 years and will be present in the film - you could not recognize me, even if you were familiar with my night club personality. Do you know a lot about the character of this picture? I bet you .... .... <br /> <br /> I am not ashamed. If you do not run anything between them, it's your loss - but, you have a great opportunity, but it just did not know. So many mothers, fathers, sons and daughters can surprise you. It should not be a secret that many actors have appeared from the background of "Midnight Cowboy". Who will judge? I have several cities, which are raised in the city of painful streets, they can name a big time, and spend the little time there by their time is not damaged. I do not make any verdict, because we all like - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you name attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like. <br /> <br /> The "triangle" about Hoffman is actually begging on the streets in the street so that he can play the role of "Ritzoos" - it turns out that he is driving his auto around Los Angeles - do you think he gets his input? I can name a lot of men-they who stand on the street and cruised the bar for the money. The Knight Club that I have been working for the last 26 years is famous and valid worldwide, but I can also name some of the biggest big names that make us run back-roads, try to pick up a pickup. <br /> <br /> It should not be a surprise today, though it is certainly big and small in Hollywood and other cities. Awake and smell of rose <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw him on a bed with a boyfriend, but I could not find any events . Believe it-no, kids did not always have their own rooms - because of course you must know that something in the master-bedroom is going odd. Whose car? Hoffman may begging for a change in the street, but some "user" points out that John Voight is not a big star for the movie "Midnight Cowboy" - his real wages will surprise you. Looks like he's been robbed! Nobody can doubt his transparency in the role, or it has made him a star for this great work as "the distribution". He defines a strong man, who conquered his devils and was even better for it: Some people commented that he was sdmized in this movie. One of the first films of the 60's was so open, but society has always been hip. <br /> <br /> I could not find any homosexuality between "Roto" and "Joe" - they were obviously opposite, unexpected to each other. They found a very purely high relationship - true friendship. At the end of the movie you do not understand but your time is wasted "Joe's" animosity, but unashamed devotion was clear. Yes, Voight was eligible to receive an Oscar for this role - John Wayne never could pull, and he was handsome like his young man. <br /> <br /> Hoffman Hoffman - You expect fireworks. She gave them nicely. Owen got her Oscar. Each character is well defined in this picture - if you do not think that they are still close but you have misunderstood. "Ceremony"? - Join some part of young people's "Rave" ... if you can enter. Look at the people who are trying to go to hot clubs - you will see every disparate person. <br /> <br /> Brenda Vicaro was a symbol of the smooth women of society, who had to come down from dancer occasionally. If you are stunned by his brilliant performance, "This is not real", thinks today's "woman" lives in the humiliation ... .... and praised for it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately "Joe" appears in the loot of an old man, unfortunately, it is a part of life. You do not have to comply with it, but it is not much different from any violence. "Joe" explicitly named his motive - in that case, I'd handover the money faster than he did. This is a scene that produces this movie through a break, which I do not see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> If there is any part of the screen that anyone understands that they are creating history, and should be proud of its honesty. Perhaps "America Only" we can close our eyes in unpleasant situations, other filmmakers do not agree with the public presentation. It does not mean it's there - every time I give it to the truth. Say! To all ......
