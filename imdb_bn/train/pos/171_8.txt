I strongly disagree with anyone that might be dismissed as "just" entertainment in this scenario. Her heart is a sincere warning story, with just a clear message about how the 20 minutes roar, the Great Depression, the dance, the statue, the first days of the dance, how to be well tolerated after this discontent. Yet this fast and firmly-crafted film is far away from a neutral morality story. <br /> <br /> In the 30's, Hollywood was an entertainer and * enlightened listener-a person crying differently to make the film different, without losing a frame of film. Dance, Flowers, Dancing - Harry Beaumont One of the four * movies * in 1931 - is about 80 minutes long, yet its characters have been well-developed, its story has never been spread, and despite the many twist of the plot, the audience will still see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Christopher's brother William Beckwell, Cliff Edwards (Jimmy is the most known of cricket's voice) Reporter Bert Scro In the first supporting role as Leinster and Clark Gabelle Jake Luva. <br /> <br /> The film of Juan Croft, and she shines it absolutely. When he was only 27 years old, this lesser known version of Crowford could probably be unfamiliar to his known acquaintances. However, there is evidence that he had a truly real starring Crowford, long before he came to Oscar's home for Mildred Pierce, a great actress with Carisas presented herself with all the pictures. <br /> <br />> Score: Ten out of EIGHT
