I really love this movie, saw it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, great acting, great story, great instruction / camera-work / music. It's a gift to show it to anyone you love. Not very bad Jacko van Darmel made more movies after this one. Top 5 jobs Really !! <br /> <br /> Today, comments above 3 years and 3 days later. It was not posted because it was not more than 10 lines. However, I saw "la huitieme journal" again yesterday. This is no doubt at the top of my movie. Together "Cinema Paradiso" is an excellent composition. Soundtrack is really good. I'm really interested in the new movie "Jaco von Dormel" I hope this will complete my movie Top 3. If you see this movie then rent it. Or better. Buy it Because you want to see it again.
