Each time this movie is broadcast by the Radio Times BBC, some say it is ridiculous against the world of war and the welfare state. I do not think this is the point of the film. The image was Spieves (small time criminals who run black markets) and the housewife league who campaigned against government sanctions, but actually had a Tory Front organization. [<br /> <br /> Yes, the situation is sending the film to the political / social, but ultimately the people have realized that they need all the controls to ensure a decent society, they want to be British and want to change foreigners. <br /> <br /> But I do not think they're going to be right like they were before.
