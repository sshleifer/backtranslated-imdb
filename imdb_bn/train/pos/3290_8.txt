Anna (Charlotte Cheyen), who is on the verge of puberty, has started her strange dreams, which began to influence her in real life - especially Mark (Eliot Spears) she fulfilled her dream. <br /> Very unusual imagination with some really awesome moments. Despite this that there is a teenage girl and a PG-13 rating, this is not for children. Also, if you stay away from the imagination hypnotism. But if you make the game to do something different then it fits the bill. <br /> <br /> A beautiful beautiful music score directed by Barnard Rose and a few nice, scary holds. This is the only thing that really hinders from being a great movie - she's not a very good actress (she is not disappointed that this is her only film), and it's hard to imagine. However, everyone else is just great. <br /> <br /> Sparrow is very good as a marker. Glenn Headley (very well to spell the English pronunciation) is very good, both fearful and sympathetic as Anna's mother and Ben Cross Anna's father. <br /> <br /> There was a sleep injury when released in 1988, since then it has become pale. That's too bad - it's really very good.
