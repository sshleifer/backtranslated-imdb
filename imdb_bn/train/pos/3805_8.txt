After watching the trailer I was surprised that the movie was never made in the theater, so I ordered the BluRay. I had a great time to visit it and saying that this movie is better than some big animation movies. Of course, it has its errors but I can still really recommend it. Animation is good, very entertaining and unique and the story has kept me watching all the way to the end. Backdrops are only drop-dead, and you can see the French genius behind it. I thought that the performance of Forest Whitaker is a bit useless, but the character of Leanne-Chu is portrayed in this movie. So overall, up thumbs up, I love it a lot and hope I am successful enough for all the studios involved in continuing making great movies like this. I suggest to give it a chance and may be wondering how a movie might be with such a small budget. The only hectare movie is worth seeing because some of its moments are sunny.
