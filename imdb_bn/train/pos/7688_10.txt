Back to 74 Eric Mont Classic TV Show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching Reruns on T.V Land. Hoster Walker was always a star and like Easter roll. John Amos was more enthusiastic about the popularity of hostage Walker for most of the time and won millions of fans while sitting and watching good times. If JJ was not there to always save it with the Cool Aid attitude there was a show that was dead. The KOOL Aid was like his favorite thing to get the show. When I got out of 3 and finished, 8 Instead of 1974-1979, when I was growing up in the 1980's, it should have been more.
