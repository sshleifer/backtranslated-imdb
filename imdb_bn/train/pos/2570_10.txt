Well, maybe this is one of the best movies I like to watch and I love it so much that I reminded most of the script (especially when the scene of the storage unit was broken by Jerry Lee) and even with the script. The head I still want to see for Jerry Lee, that German Shepherd is violent and who really wants to check with skill. The tag line holds true as well. It is not uncommon to mention acting, although Christine Tucci is different in a hilarious (check filmography under the CSI if you do not know what I understand). It is very bad that the only problem with this film was to work with Droolie and Jerry Leyer, which was quite calm to see the techniques that Zeus and Wales saw on their riddle.
