Having been a fan of Andy Goldwarth's artist for some time and being the owner of some of his books, I had some expectations. I got something completely satisfied with what I got, and I was quite a bit better than expected. As an artist (I work in clay), it is vital to find inspiration in our surroundings to create good art, and Andy Goldworthy has become somewhat skilled. After that in a year's course, the director felt devotion with the spirit of inspirational inspiration for the spontaneous strength, skill, and nature of nature. The music set in the film is embracing and narcotic. If you need an artist who needs inspiration, or someone else needs an uplifted experience, then watch this movie. I knew that Andy is out there somewhere. Wrestling, dance, wrestling with the power of nature to make our world more beautiful.
