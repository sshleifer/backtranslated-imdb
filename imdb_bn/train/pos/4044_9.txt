I found this movie very well paced. The compound was quite fantastic, and as a spectator I was drawn along as the characters improved. Pensing is done very well to remember - enough is hidden from the viewer and the questions are answered which are answered later, both in the brain and in a verb, both make a good thought and highly satisfying film. Outlook Looks like some people are looking for a non-stop roller-coaster ride with this movie - one of which is charged from the door. It will be even more similar to the beaches that will first raise the mountain slowly - create a wonderful feeling of confidence - and in the end, in my mind, the more fulfilling complement to the foundation. <br /> <br /> Nice movie.
