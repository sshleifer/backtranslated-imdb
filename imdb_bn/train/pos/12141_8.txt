Among the three remakes of W Somerset Maughan's novel, this is not the best one and especially John Cromwell is going to the movie. The film is a point of view for the break due to the breakdown of performance by Bate Davis, who is Melredrade Rogers, he showed the film industry that he was a star. Finally, his struggle with Jack Warner and his studio paid the state off. <br /> <br /> The movie is influenced by Milldale since its inception. From the very beginning we realized that Miledred does not care for Phillip and never do so. He does not conceal his insult with such a soul which is in love with the wrong woman. He will humiliate Melidered again, again, he really does not make any bone about that. <br /> <br /> While being kidnapped, the poor Philipp Kerry is a weak man. When he tried to attack Milldale, he refused. When Miled comes back to her, when she is weak and defeated, she stole her desire to this terrible woman and stole her childhood, depending on her dependence. <br /> <br /> <br /> Mildred is a fantastic illustration. It was his best role and he escaped with him. His hatred of Philip is clear from the onset of their relationship. When she told her that after she kissed her washed her face, the most powerful moment in the movie. Leslie Howard was under Philip and weakened even more. Frances D, Reginald Danny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owe, played a minor role. <br /> <br /> It's Bate Davis Show, and you do not forget it!
