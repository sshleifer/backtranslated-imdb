Okay, the first thing to do is correct the tags posted on the main page of this movie. Ebe Lincoln did not walk with her sister in the movie, nor did she stop her sister's grave. The Q & A person is Non Routledge, who was a close friend of Lincoln on his new Salim day. Some say that Anne was actually the girlfriend of Lincoln, but there is no evidence to support it. <br /> <br /> Now the film has fabrication and imagination. Hollywood has always accepted the dramatic license with something under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the film's court case was based on the real event: William "Duff" is accused of murder against Armstrong, and although this name is mostly fantastic with change of name, it will still be returned to the viewer. It is the Golden Age of Hollywood, with its best drama and Henry Fonda, who probably played the best Lincoln.
