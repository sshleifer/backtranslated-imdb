Most of the movies in Nick Mancus have been seen because I love the guy, though he is usually cast like a bad person (for a long time fans should remember that he is Golden for some reason). It is a roughly familiar movie in the context of the plot (but most movies are not fairly original these days), but Rick Roberts is applying as an incomplete husband, Martha Maxassak is equally objectionable to the girl, and Mikey Capture did a good job, her goal was to get angry and sometimes Pretty hard choice. Nick got it in terms of being able to show both still charm and psychology. However, most of the plot does not create off-screen motivation, previous behavior, good times and bad times - and those that seem obvious to characters (eg, mine) do not make it to the audience (eg, mine). The final scene is "Everything for ..." but in the division, and the overall choice, I can not say that I'm much more careful about a character. That said, what was it - a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon - and I still loved Nick.
