Most of the movies of Ringo Lam are seen, I can say that this is his best film and the most unusual. It is an ancient china piece piece, which is grooveing ​​inside the kick-ass martial arts, where the full underground part with no underground birds and hollow plays a major role as a part of the character. The action is fantastic, the story is imagined and entertaining, and the set design is really memorable. Sadly, burning paradigm is not available in DVDs, and HHS is more likely to get your opinion, even if you're near North America's second largest China city (as I do). If you can find it, do not pass it.
