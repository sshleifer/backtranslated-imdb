It was a powerful Poirot / Suchet, the selection of television mysteries. The characters were animated and played well. Plot and main setting - A student hostel - was excellent. Jap was nothing special but not confused with my story. One important point, many Poirot observers do not recognize good acting or good characterization. I also think that they are rather rigid than the decisions of the Pirot Mystery. Finally, I read a few Christie novels - no one in recent years - and instead of mockery it seems very annoying to see them. Please, viewers, consider what is presented to you in the movie, not what you think. That said, Poirot mysteries have changed between values, but as long as the reviewers and raters will not believe you. Plot Little Pig's single exception, which was fabulous in plot, character and theme, and long pirot films are not good or bad. For the record, I saw more long Pirot / Suchet films. Finally, movies without Limon, Hastings and / or Zap are not good or bad because of their absence. However, appearances are harsh (almost always with jap) or irrelevant to the hassles. The lemon is in the middle.
