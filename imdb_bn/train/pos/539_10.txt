The first was good and original. I was not a bad horror / comedy movie. So I heard another one was created and I had to see it. <br /> <br /> What really works in this movie is Jude Nelson's character and sometimes cute scripts. A nice good script for a person who wrote the final destination movie and direction is OK. Occasionally there is a scene where it was pictured using a great video camera with a great view. <br /> <br /> Movies made for great TVs. It was rented and probably got that nice eerie feeling and buying was probably worth buying and see Judd Nelson's Stanley what he's doing well. <br /> <br /> I recommend newcomers to visit the first one before watching supercomputer, just so you have an idea of ​​what Stanley liked and would get a little background history.
