I just watched last night and I liked what I saw. It was a great movie. The dolph bikes looked nicely cool. She also liked this movie more than her other recent films. She is now pretty beautiful. The story was correct and other actors were passable. I would not call this movie the best, but it is still a good film. <br /> <br /> But it was also a partner of problems. The first was that the bullets were flying all over and even when they were expelled in empty spaces they still missed the target. They noticed that the yellow bullets escaped better. The way the students were taking an oath, I had another problem. I do not know that no students can take an oath in front of their teacher even in the classroom. The third problem was that the number of bad people is very low. There should be more bad guys The last problem was sure that the set was sugar, but it was due to the small budget. Overall the movie was a good movie. I've enjoyed it. I'll recommend others to visit it. Now you're a dead beat police versus now. (Some one liners were also cool) <br /> <br />
