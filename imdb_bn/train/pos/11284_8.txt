When I was young, Lex was like Tarzan at Barker. I have often heard from the elder that Johnny Weasmulla was "Tarzan" and I did not understand why I saw the last few movies of the character of Wiseman and I thought that he was like a shape. After many years I came across "Tarzan and his partner", and then I realized. The size and appearance and vague appearance of Wessimulla's film character are not yet matched with other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jack Mahoney, Danny Miller, Miles and Kef and Crisher Lambert. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the sensual presence of the beautiful Maríneño and Sullivan that the film was strong, confident, active and "no barrier" like Jane's way before the time of the making of the film In the pond, she was naked and excited; a detector kissed her and kissed her and even though she did not kiss him, she would give him something to do. And does not mean that's no big deal); "Jane's" behavior such as Brenda Joyce, Vincea Brown, Virginia Haston or Dorothy Hart was unlikely, they all played pretty sweetly weak women, they believed that they could survive in an unfavorable place like the African forest. <br /> <br / > Wonderful personality of O 'Soulivan character steals his own show of Tarzan, when it comes to action and Wimmulla easily leads He captured; The combination is perfect. Another highlight in the movie is Cheater's second role, and later, Tarzan is not as a major lead of the film, where he often saves. <br /> <br /> "Tarjan and his companion" stands as a fine product in his style. Tarzan films) and perhaps best, I must admit that I enjoyed the "Budget's Best Adventure" (1959) and with its high budget and strong supporting cast (and despite the acceptable role of Gordon Scott in the official role), his very perfect "all gymnasium" A rustic pain is not suitable for people) <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her partner!
