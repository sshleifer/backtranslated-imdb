Lifetime TV Network I remember showing this film a few years ago and it was a fun story. After several years I love to see this picture again and bow down to the heels. The story behind the movie itself is interesting and interesting. Cast just makes it more interesting. Merrill Strip is definitely the top of his play in this photo. She also behaved, spoke and even nails the appearance of Mrs. Chamberlain. He showed anger to hurt, hurt, surprise and anger, and in this process it is difficult to remember that it is not lindi. In my opinion, Morliss's performance was better than "Sophie Choice" Oscar's winning streak and won his third Oscar. Sam Blue is perfect like Michael Chamberlain and for some amazing reasons, the academy has not been recognized with at least one nomination. Above all, this film received only an Oscar Node (Strip for Best Actress). However, it got several Australian Oscars and nominations. <br /> <br /> Definitely a top rated movie: It tells a great story and you get great performance from the whole cast.
