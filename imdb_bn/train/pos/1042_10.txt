An American woman, her European husband and children returned to her mother's house "Watch on the Rhine", in 1943, based on Lillian Hellman's adaptation of the play and the role of Paul Lucas (whose belief I repeat the role of her stage here), Bate Davis , Lucele Watson, George Kuluris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Donald Woods. A fascist, often wounded in the geological movement, and by the Nazis, Kempt Mueller (Lucas) needs a long break in the estate of his mother-in-law. But he found out that there really is no shelter because Kulauris is as suspicious as his true identity and more suspect than being willing to sell him. <br /> <br /> The great acting in this film, a lot to highlight from Lillian Hellman's liberal perspective. It was a strong media during the War of Liberation, the evil of war and what has happened to the people of other countries reached the safe American house. The film's biggest debate is Paul Owkas at "Casablanca", winning the Oscars on Humphrey Bogart. Humphrey Bogart had an amazing screen presence and a fantastic rick, but outgoing as Luca Kurt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sarah, a loyal and loving wife of the cart. Tugs at its acting heart, and the love scene between the cart and the whole is beautiful and flexible. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film was in tears with the fidelity of my passion. Lillian Hellman is not every cup of tea, but in contrast to "The Little Foxes" he has written some true sympathetic, wonderful character and good story, which has a casting and production value from Warner Brothers. Highly recommended.
