Unexpectedly Griffith's intolerance, The Three Ages is a full-length comedy featuring Booster Keton's first attempt. The only similarity to intolerance is the "opening" scene, and through this era, the same stories are executed throughout the film. Ketan's argument for applying this style was that if it does not succeed as a feature film, it can be reduced to three relayers. Fortunately, Three Ages has been brilliantly successful as a comedy and saw any fun routine in Keaton's film. There is nothing unique or bold about story lines. They are simple boys-girls, boys-old girls, children's and children's plots, but the type of times are contradictory, and Mel Brooks and all the films of this genre determine the value for future work. Anyway, I do not believe anyone has been leading this comedy. Love cave like Keoton and the stunt of this photo can not play some of its best. In addition, the appearance of Wallace Berry as Keaton's opponent joins the appeal of this film. The comedy of the 1920s is not to be appreciated by modern viewers, anyone who thinks this movie will be seen.
