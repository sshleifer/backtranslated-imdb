I have seen higher education for many years and it was always a delightful smile on an enjoyable slash, but I never knew that it was pictured in the UK and I never knew that actress Marty Rantzen (Simon Squadmore) committed suicide after the movie was released. I think I've seen it last night when I think actors seem rather weird for Americans, and some of them are not very good to hide their English signs. <br /> <br /> The story of the class dance, Marty, who ridiculed his classmates, and on a special day, April Fools Day, he entered the locker room of Caroline Munro (yes, playing a teenage) inside the locker room, and insulted film Big time Of course, the coach holds the gang in the workplace and they are given hard work to punish them all, but some boys do not slip Marty together, which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab, but it is something that makes him sick and when he Goes to the rest house, one of his classmates jumps into him and puts a chemical which Rtike mixed reactions to some, and a bottle of nitric acid, thereby allowing the fire to spread and be fatal Marty. Burned and horrific harmful. <br /> <br /> After ten years, these same gangs lead to the reconciliation of classes in their old DodsSavle High, which are strange and seem to be accessible, but thanks to the skills they manage and thanks to. Find the place in a seemingly brutal way ... except there is a room where the banquet and wine are kept, and of course they can eat, drink and be glad. They will die soon, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They do not know they are working for logo bint or IBM, they are not sure. But anyone, he is working them fast. Especially the nasty girl who washed her blood from one of her classmates, while drinking her toxic beer inside, she drinks toxic beer. He was an acid bath which I believe is basically one of the cut pieces in the tape version, because when I saw it it seemed extra nasty. I could be wrong but I believe that the tapes were not there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I had other bits in this Oscars version, but perhaps it was not noticed, but it's probably gone. At any rate, if you are a fan of the 80's Slashar Flickr, then Snap the new release DVD because it feels funny little slash with a good atmosphere and it feels. 10 out of 7
