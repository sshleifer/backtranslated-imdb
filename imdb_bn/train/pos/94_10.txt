I'm a huge John Denver fan. I have a large collection of Vinyl her music. This Christmas special saw and loved it when I was originally on TV. I have the original vinyl album and cd. I have the original CD and later releases. The next release is missing several songs though. I found that this year all the original songs were released. To my surprise, I sold the original CD for $ 75.00. WOW - A Christmas CD that seems to be worth a lot. I have no amount of money to sell this treasure. This is my favorite Christmas CD. I have not been able to find VHS or DVD. I'd like to have the version. Please let me know if there is an available one. Thank you
