Cross-eyed is a very original and fun movie. I think Adam Jones has brought a new set of new refreshments to the comedy genre and it really revives it in a good way. This image is smart, concise, and consistently entertaining and fun. As a writer / director, Jones shows complete control over his characters, who are both weird and loving. The story is something that you have not seen before. It's unique and fun and visual spectacular elements, as well as to create a hearty comedy in the long lost slopstick genre. <br /> <br /> is a very promising first movie.
