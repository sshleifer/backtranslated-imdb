Do you love Daddy Poffer? I did not see him for a while and I forgot how much I miss him. I did this a great job. Supporting cast was very nice. In some corners, the girl looked like a small Nicole Kidman. The kidnappers were quite vague and the stories were usually some good twists. The young boyfriend was a hottie. I'm sure the husband must definitely have something to do with it. <br /> <br /> Just got a Lifetime movie network for Christmas and love these movies. Will capture my interest and see it again when they restart it. Can anyone recommend this similar movie? If you can post on board or send me a personal email Thanks in advance. Aboutagirly
