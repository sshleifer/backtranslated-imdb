Anthonyone's other hip masterpiece aimed at the other side of the Atlantic rather than "Blow-up" at this time. Although young people like critics and young people did not have the success. Why? Maybe the US had European views of the United States, which were filled with clich√©s, which do not work and they are not good. (Initially revolutionary students are shameful.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps the big blockbuster movies were released and especially those who noticed the young market. If it was released a year ago, the desert hips would have seemed fresh ... it was a very interesting movie, like making love in the desert, and shooting beautifully in Antonio's view. End of the desert palaces and explosives ... that Leads were not helping two amators. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshtie is slightly better than Daria Halpin. It has been so good with the right actor! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange ... dialog is actually quite funny and disgusting, so you do not know the way to distribute lines ... <br /> <br /> 60th of course for a very interstitial document photography and soundtrack Sure!
