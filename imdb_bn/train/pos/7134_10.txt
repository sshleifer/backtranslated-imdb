John Tha is a wonderful actor. On the streets of London (WWII Period) I was influenced by the scope of an increasingly old man who agreed to accept the exit from the street. <br /> <br /> That's saying, the film is excellent. A very moving story with a satisfied end Some letters are a bit of support (especially school teachers), but none of them is essential for the plot. Basically, the story is about old people and boys, and the film needs something else.
