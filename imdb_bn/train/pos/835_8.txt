Pierce Brosnan is new but now James Bond is not a killer. He is very good at what he does, but he is old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as straight and narrow business people. Now while opening the story, the movie shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one night they are drinking in the bar, and they begin to talk. Then suddenly you see these two drawings together with a series of events. The story is excellent, acting top notch, and humorous delightful I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would have been fun at this, but he really and I must definitely see this movie.
