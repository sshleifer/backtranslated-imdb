This year's best and most original shows ever seen. The more I see the more I love. Cast nice, writing is great. I personally like each character. However, there is a favorite character for everyone because there is a good mix of personality and background like real life. I believe that ABC writers, actors and the potential audience of this show can cancel so early and do not publish enough advertisements and do not give a real opportunity to follow it. Since most television is awful, there are some shows that I now see. My Opinion This show was right up with my favorite Grace Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. Actually I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters will love this show if they knew about it. Why the losing shots are so extra time and winning shots with great potential always get dumped directly. I do not see any of the reality shows so sick I have none of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for the show and then to hire an excellent actor, this show was so much promise. The latest episode was still the best because everyone really got into their part and the show made it so real. Check out this show on ABC video and let ABC know that you want to get back to this show. Sign In ABC Online: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
