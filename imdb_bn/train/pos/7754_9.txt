Tom Barmanus (the rock formation known as 'Dude''s first person) is the first film in any way to wind. Completely shot at Antwerp (Belgium), the film starts on a Friday morning and eliminates excessively from events that fill dozens of major characters. When the movie ends, you have lots of things to think about, because most of the story lines are wide open. <br /> <br /> is a (fully-sound) sound track in the movie that opens your socks. In most of the scenes, music actually enhances and feels the general atmosphere, in fact the film is made to look for hallucinates at certain times. The main scene of the film, the team is very good shot <br /> <br /> The director has not hesitated to use his video chips, recently he has heard his main characters dance to my best soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Screenplay is a great thing. The camera angle and color are very well selected. 'Clothing' is very hot and very 'seventy' too. And I played (mostly) acting. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie most often, it's a weird, miraculous, very dry or even comical touch of humorous humor. <br /> <br> Without a comedy (this film is not a comedy, but an alternative part of the industry), it still drives the audience to wake up and sometimes laughs. <br /> <br />> It should not be a last manager that should not end. I had good time because I hope to see more Tom Pearson movies in the future. Cheers
