First off, this is not really my favorite film ever. I do not have to give a description to anyone because each one has a ** hole that is. I literally enclose these bloody, hungry, harmful effects 'showing bombs', poorly educated, covering 80's terrible skills. The director (I heard) hoped to hit a box office so that he could do succession and make a Freddie / Jasson contract for himself. Great, I could go down like that! The soundtrack's banging '. Well done .... check out this MOFO. And there are no dead-hearted fans, email and some time to feel free to chat. Drugs .... I can be found in Yahoo.
