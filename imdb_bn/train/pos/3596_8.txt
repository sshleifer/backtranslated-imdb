Finally I sat down and saw this picture completely, and I must say, I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of the few of my new favorite actresses - she can not only act *, but she likes the roles that she has more meaningful and important than her. I have read a few comments expressing their relief that they were not a terrible feminine thing since they first thought, but I certainly do not agree. Diana is a feminist. He follows his dream and believes in his mind against everyone in his own neighborhood (besides his caring brother Tinny and his coach and director Hector, who proved to be the father's character more than his real parents) the word "feminism" is all about. It is good to see a feminist realistic film - they are not a group of frustrated - but they have dreams and can do anything. Diana feels herself to be true when she falls victim to love, and she and Adrian have some realistic, complex relationships that only work in the museum. Girlfight is a true taste of reality and it's back to believe something in my human perception. Thanks, Michelle. 8/10 - A very important film not only related to young people, but everyone wants to go far away in their lives.
