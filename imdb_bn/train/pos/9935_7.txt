My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP} My - my - my name is Domino Harvey. {Cut, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {Edit. Cut Playback} <br /> <br /> I have never seen a director much fax for his style. So far it is clear that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's sticky, dazzling, dizzying editing technique. I would love to love it and hate it, I'd love to say I love it. It was sometimes confusing, but the end result was pretty good, and it is beautiful to see with its creative edge and its style and some fundamentalist director (although it is also very disturbed from MTV videos). <br /> <br /> This stylistic edge manifestifests itself in the role of Keira Knightly cockky badass monster hunter Domino Harvey and thinks its conversation is weird choppy. Otherwise he played him weakly because I hated his character a lot and consoled one of them, how much he suffered. He followed Domino through his life because he joined fellow monster hunter Mickey Roche, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew split into the FBI and suddenly there is a reality show agreement under Christopher Walken's TV production company (Christopher Wycken working in every movie?). I guess it's a trick movie strategy, because now Tony Scott likes to use the sticky MTV / Reality show editing footage. It has become a pasic of MTV culture at the moment. <br /> <br /> This story is said to be at an amazing speed, with lots of strong language and gun violence. There are some funny jokes; It's all very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a rather enjoyable mess. This is ultimately defective in many ways (actors try to make their characters "cool" for one reason) but it works. I think this picture may be generous compared to the normal gravity of the movie-gear which is 7/10? But I think it was some good idea and their good execution. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 7
