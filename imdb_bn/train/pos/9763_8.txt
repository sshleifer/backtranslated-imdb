Ragged An End And Andy is the first movie I have seen in the theater. My father took my sister, and the funny thing is - when we returned home, Dad asked, "What do you want to do now?" And we said we want to see Raggedi Ann and Andy again! Lol, and my dad really came back to the theater to see him again - at least I remember that way. I was then five years old. <br /> <br /> This movie was scary five years old. Sweet big ocean scenes, and mesmerizing camel scenes .. I do not think much from this film, Naturally, the start was a witch, and a few scenes - I want to find it again, and probably find it out. <br /> <br /> I think I like Raggedy Ann and Andy.
