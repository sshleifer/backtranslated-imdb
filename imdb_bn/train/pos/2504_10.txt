When I first saw this movie, I think the first movie was like an animation than a movie. Because the reason involved in the vampire doing incredible stunts. Stunts are like a lot more matrix, which are very fast for bullets and running like many remote jumping. Why is the film that is full of animated movie during the movie? Gackt is the perfect way to pouting her mouth or the stars she works, too n IME. I think it's a really good movie to see. ^ _ ^ The verb of this movie is 10 (not to mention gasket and hed) 10. ^ _ ~ If you are a Gatecut and Hayed fan then you have to see it.
