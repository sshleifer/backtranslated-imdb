For more than a week of my experience in Finland, I would say that this film correctly depicts the nature of the Finnish society. Especially the problem of young-couple-serious problems are very familiar to me, because I saw the same thing in person when I was in Finland. Human relations, problems, atrocities of marriage institutions, drinking culture, unemployment and upward money problems are all very good, without any development or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There are some points that are not necessary to understand and connect with each other, but the joint image is still rewarded. Not everyone is brief or exciting in short stories, but as the above says, the bigger picture fails to provide "real-life" feeling and influencing the audience. I think at a quiet moment: what is happening in the lives of all these people on the streets? Well, this is what's happening. The movie like this is good to feed your imaginary power. It would be safe to believe that this film can be applied in many countries, but it particularly shows Finland as well, and displays it nicely. <br /> <br /> A comment about the acting: I became a fan of Finnish, I have not seen any of these actors in any other movie, but I found this feature acting perfect next door next door. Maybe not a great composition, but a very good try by the whole crew. I will monitor the release of director and cast future. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
