I saw this image at the Adelaide Film Festival 2007 and was absolutely curious for 106 minutes. I like the documentary, but often pulls for about 25 minutes. Although forbidden Lie $ driven, my interest is not losing. <br /> <br /> Photo topic is a biographical story found in fame and fate in 2001 with soft Khoury, a Jordanian woman who publishes love for her book, a person who was killed in her family to establish a relationship with a Christian Related to Muslim Friends Even after a few years, some journalists began to tear the hole in this story, leading the people to believe in cheating. The film has been quickly and thoroughly added to the beginning, and from there we spend most of our time in the soft company because she believes that her novels are more than imagination. <br /> <br /> Director Ana Brunowski has found a really interesting woman to study, and she has conducted an interactive interview with Khori, because she is looking for the truth. As always, life is not so easy to find. Narma was afraid of his life, worried about the violent reaction to the helpless portraits of the Jordanian Muslims with his novels. He refused to return to Jordan and show our facts. Bronioski is not disturbed, and gradually puts a piece together in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is incredible look inside a con artist's mind. Naturally, what we find out there is a little understood and very hard to follow, and finally we do not know what Norma believes. He is trying to survive, or is a fantastic spinster rather than a well-liked creator. He became a film of lies, truth and half-truth web. <br /> <br /> The movie uses dramas to tell many interview footage and its stories, and Bronioski uses these plays to show us why people like Norma are able to exist: we want to be conned. Every day we go to the movie and believe what is happening on the screen. It might have read me a lot, it did not come with a questionnaire after the film, but I'm going away from it. <br /> <br /> This is a great Australian film, and if you should ask me an international release, and the reward must be received in a swag. Of course I saw at the best AFF 07. See <br /> <br />, if you get the chance, see it.
