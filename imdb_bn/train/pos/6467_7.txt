Two movies back which deal with Indian POWs; Veer Zara and Deewar Although Vira Kora is a story of love of a man who gives everything for one, he gives attention to the main issue. Many Indians stopping many Indian pounds in Pakistani jails are not secret - for whom the Indian government is not. Time or sympathy or not on the other side. I am sure that there are some Pakistanis in Pakistan, but let's focus on the film. The actor is full. Someone was an actor like Raghbir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan played a major role, he acted. Akshay Khanna did his good work. Amitabh Rao was nothing more than a few gigolos and couple songs. I think Sanjay Dutt's role was not very difficult, although it was not too long. He played really well here and the delivery of his dialog was also impressive. If you compare it to the lock, it was nothing but a movie. If the story goes all the way (if it was a story) - Deiar is a well-directed film that plays well and judges all the actors. 7.5 / 10
