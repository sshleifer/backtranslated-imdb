It has been about 50 years since a film about romance and mysticism was created. I can think that the two films "Entered in April" (1992) and "The Enchant Cottage" (1945). Both cine stars used to be wonderful actors. In both films, all actors gave their best romantic performance. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" WIW's four English women who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy during the holidays. This amazing "Enchantment April" was created in 1992. It stands as an enjoyable classic.
