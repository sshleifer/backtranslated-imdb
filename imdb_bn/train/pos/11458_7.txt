Again greetings from darkness. A wonderful artist mind and motivation insight. It is strange to see if anybody has to work ... there is no condition, otherwise the reasons for living are closed. Goldswari's sculptures look alive and each sees its response extremely visible. This artist is created because he must - not for money or fame. This is his life. When you see its failures, the power bursts from warm body air balloon. It's not afraid to start again, so he takes his strength from his work. Just look at him and make his work a bit painful, but nevertheless, he is very excited. He discusses the flow and time in the brief dialogue and the artist and the world are not the only suspects in doubt. When he said he needed the world, but it does not need it ... I want to be different. The only complaint seems to be more dynamic to make the musical score even more dynamic.
