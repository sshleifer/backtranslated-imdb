I feel confused in the reaction of this film and find a mixture of different degrees of personal individual. Yes, there are stereotypes of vampires. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes covered here. Even martial arts stereotypes. All well and good, and sure, not all done perfectly. However, I understand the importance of this picture being ignored ... its cultural importance to its position. The film is set in Pensacola, Florida, and so does not try to avoid it. It is a bold step in the world of today's film, and it is a rare treat for the Indi film fans. And indeed, it can not end. Pensacola is renowned for being a global navy, an aviation town, a wooden city, and sometimes even a warmth for political controversy. Seldom it is seen as a growing film town. But that's all changing now. More film companies are coming in shoots. And more local pensacoles are discovering cinemas for themselves. This image is part of the growing trend of Pensacola-based Indie Films, and much more. Pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community, and by this the world is paying more attention. See and hear, the world. Penicellians are coming. Like a virus.
