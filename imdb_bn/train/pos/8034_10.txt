There are some movies that provide entertainment and realism. If you've ever been surprised by the sniper's role in the modern war, see it once. <br /> <br /> I like the scene where hundreds of soldiers can get shooting in the jungle, which is not sure where that shot came? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, so it has some capabilities in the scene. <br /> <br />
