Most of the Stuupfilms do not consider this as the best stuigs short time and they are right. A slogan made in the dragon as "Carnitia Kucara" as the Cottage and Maar and Larry are the top form of "Senator Muncho" and "Senator Gusto" respectively. Christine McCain's beautiful operatic voice is given in full rains - she was actually a trained opera singer - and it's surprising. Great Gino Corrado is pleased as a pompous Italian singer awesome by a socialist team Stooges. The effectiveness of some really funny goggles, good aspects and very tight-edited Stooges makes this increase at the very top. What is more surprising is that Carly had a health problem and during this time she made several shorts that you can see she is sick. His time off, he talked very slowly and haltingly, and had difficulties around. Thankfully, he was an upswing to his health while making this film, and it shows. The classic Stuog comedy, even enjoyed by non-Stuog fans (I was a girlfriend who could not stand up to Stougage, but he laughed together). A must see.
