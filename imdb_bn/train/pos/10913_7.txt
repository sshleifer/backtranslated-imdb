William Powell is a doctor involved in the killing and has played former wife, Mrs. Gin Arthur, Eric Blor and James Gilleson in "Mrs. Bradford". It seems that Powell was just chemistry with a woman with whom he was. Although he and Mirza Laure were the perfect screen couple, the actor had also made some "Thein Man" type films, alongside Genezer Rogers and with Arthur, these two very good effects. <br /> <br /> One does not get tired of seeing Powell as a wicked, devoner professional and "former Mrs. Bradford". Former Miss. B. Mr B served with a submarine for retreating B and then moved him back to a mystery that helped him drag him. And this is not the first time! It seems like it was a "Bradford" film or it was called the first genre of a movie - Mr. B has alleged that his mysterious writer, formerly, is bringing him to the cases. During this time, a horse riding a horse in mysteriously horse breaks mysteriously and dies just before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution to the case is adoptive but it is next to the point. The point is between the couple and the former Mrs is the irony in interference. B. Jean Arthur is very interesting in his role and very funny. However, an actress who closes the brain like Arthur seems to be deliberately rather than humor. I think the writer was thinking something in mind - say, the weak side of Carol Lomerdard. When Arthur heard that the police came, he said, "Oh, probably about my espionage. I was waiting for the police to wait for it", it's rather a serious statement than Powell's ribs. It still works well, and it shows how a good actress can make her own part. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can see William Powell and Gene Arthur.
