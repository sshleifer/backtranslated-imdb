Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon plays the best role of all time), the newest spy child in the block, closes his identity with him because he is the CIA's latest program "BlackBerry" himself. <br /> <br /> I was so monk for that I saw yesterday and today's predecessor. The identity was as bright as it was, and the defeat was the weakest (but still enjoyable) long link for the weak plot and its car chase, which is easily topped by the film's chase, lack of action and lack of suspicion. <br /> <br /> Hu boy, what is the ultimatum! Even when you know that Bourne will run away from the authorities (and these guys spot these photos as ineligible to police), it's still brilliant. Two people with handguns and mopeds think that 150 million monster robots can create 10 times more mysteries than the transformer. <br /> <br /> In places like the CDA headquarters where none of the 10 miles with the camerade will be allowed, they are filming a lot of letters in general, although Stadimir is a la Documentary He enjoys hearing about my various complaints, because the ultimatum's action is nothing but terrifying, with the tools used as a candle, a hardcover book (I will not look the same again) and an electric fan (do not ask). The song helped create many mysteries, and there was never too much time to nail. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, and the evolution of Julie Styles' character "Nicky" is a new highly sympathetic light to its condition. Demon reserves his signature role with the reserve, but the merit (which seems to be small, it may seem like Matt Damon is actually tied to the CIA and Interpol), but a striking moment of struggle for his humanity. His desire for real life can become annoying, and he has achieved almost all the greatness, but it works well with ultimatum (good script). <br /> <br /> I have reminded of a scene from "Goldeneye" (the only good Pierre Brosnan Bond photo), in which the character of Shan Biyan asks James, if the Martins kill those people shout and shout . All those who killed Bourne forgive them and consider that he has done purposeless actions (at least I have considered), meaningless life, and how the government has transformed people into wealth. However, Crave could tell Magna and surrender to any weapon. Sidneyot: It always irritates me that superspeaking is happening and CIA, Interpol and Police have often hunted, almost anywhere in the police, Bourne disguised its features or even made the best effort to create some new passports. Never thought Can sunglasses be? <br /> <br /> If you have Bourne Ultimatum on your side, you have a Pulse and Love action movie. Hell, probably this year's best picture. Of course, you'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first. It drags a touch near the end, but I'm tempted to ignore it almost. This summer's first "3" movie will be met at least, if it does not exceed, it's original and it's saying something. <br /> <br /> A-
