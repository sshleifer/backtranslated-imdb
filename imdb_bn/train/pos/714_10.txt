Even if you are not a big romance fan, Rock 'n' Roll High School is still * the greatest Rock 'n' Roll movie of all time. Why? Because under all the camps, it behaves with respect to abusive and hated Teramas and often seems boring, stupid, fascist, (and appropriately) for the established world of adults. That final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes of a movie I've ever seen. "My eyes have seen glory ..." Rock 'n' roll! <br /> <br />
