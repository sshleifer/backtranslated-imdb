It is an unusual and unique little western, originally created, which is due to all its stories about its unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and it can create it at any other time in the movie. <Br /> <br /> This is mostly a very entertaining movie, but it is still not Western yet real. The film is usually done in the style of Western film making of '40' / '50, so the series of lovers should not be stopped by some of its unusual premises. <br /> <br /> Because the rifle is actually the main plot device of the film, it allows the story to follow multiple characters across the film, which must of course be attached and the story ends to complete the circle. In addition to this, the film was quite beautiful, because the story often goes from one dangerous event to another, with continuous characters involved. Quite surprisingly how they managed to make Wyatt Earp in all of these. But it's really no criticism. I was the original movie and its story and how the movie likes to move from other events to another. It gave the movie an adventure and entertaining ideas. <br /> <br /> This is a really cool movie. I like the settings to use the movie, and it seems quite amazing that it is actually the first West of the director Atheny Mann. Fortunately, he will be directed towards further west, which will often play James Stewart in the main front. <br /> <br /> This is a nice bold casting choice for choosing James Stewart as the lead lead. She is one of the simplest and most submissive looking and acting actors, so throwing him as a solid gunman seems to be a peculiar favorite. But Stewart is incredibly believable as a tough guy and it's actually versatile and is actually capable of actually as an actor. <br /> <br /> This film has some other wonderful actors, which are often not associated with this genre. Shell Winters plays female lead, and subsequently known actors Rock Hodgson and Toni Curtis appeared in some minor roles. <br /> <br /> This is a real western and lots of action and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
