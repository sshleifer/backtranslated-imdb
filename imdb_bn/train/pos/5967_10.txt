Sammi, a metallic rock angel Curar, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, trying to sneak his music! (True life, like Die Snyder, twisted sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzie Osborne) burned in the fire, Simi felt that he had to play Halloween for his old high school dance. Now Eddie Winbauer, his # 1 fan, And the only one who was Sammy and what did he feel (or did he?) Nook, DJ at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) and Semi's last record Eddie The only copy of the era .. But when Eddie tries to record the record, she's talking to him ml to say what to do. Back to his school bullies that hate him and his music .. Everything works back, Sammi is starting to kill !! For a great movie and heavy metal hair fans, of course, the Fastway must meet with a great soundtrack, and if you do not know how sounds or sounds like fastway and they do not like it, they will change there a bit, and style as well as more familiar Cinderella , Or sound like rats. .. is a true horror movie in the movie? Well, depending on what you call a horror movie, a real horror movie about me is a slash, a lot of killings, or just plain scary. This movie is not enough, not enough death, but it can not be called an action, comedy, drama, mystery, or thriller, so I guess it must be a horror .. So if you "rock n" roll, rockin midnight Want to Steele your soul !! "Sammy kara and trick or treat." I mean, "What are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'n' Roll !! "
