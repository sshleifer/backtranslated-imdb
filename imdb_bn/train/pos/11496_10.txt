Love this film. It was shown for the first time in the I8N Germany in a small independent movie in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. Film lovers hit viewers and producers and directors of talks with Moritz Bonner were always drawn by him. In its continuation it was a very ambitious film, especially when you thought it was an independent movie. <br /> <br /> It does not contain many copies of the movie, but it came from Morte's Bonnar's theater and became a therapist before going for more work for two or three small film TVs. <br /> <br /> For those who want to watch that movie again, you can find it on their homepage which is not easy but to search for its potential.
