*** Spokila *** *** Spokillars *** After two outouts ("Magnum Force" and "The Inforcerer"), Wendy Harry keeps his "Sudden Impact" intently with his energy: Clint Eastwood's Curtish, who directs , And a story that spends enough time for publication and preserves its power for a bigger view. Once, the case took Harry to San Francisco around his native San Francisco (where he had problems with his high profile, "Suit first, ask questions later" strategies). There, (warning: the potential spoiler) was being killed killing a group of cruel missions, at a time, a woman who had been gang-raped years ago, and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia since the attack. /> <br /> The killer has been portrayed by Sandra Lock, and he made an amazing mix of Jennifer Spencer's character with sympathy and cold bloodshed. When the cold eyes of the lock and the cold voice, when tried to comfort her in the hospital, or to try to take revenge on the rapists, she is very effective in drawing a woman whose years of suffering and anger are now beginning to bear severe consequences. <Br /> <br /> The rapists are frustrating, especially the leader, who has practically "psychological work" on his forehead, and often a person with a physical disability to the participant who almost thinks. Flashback scenes, though not graphical, are enough for the night, and Jennifer explicitly intended to encourage the audience to kill his attackers. <br /> <br /> Some will dismiss "sudden impact" trash: stupid, manipulive revenge stories. It's true at a certain level, but it's a well-trashed trash. What does the power of Sindhu Lock performance work in the movie facility, provides us with a complex character whose wound is more visible than its image from its gesture or speech. What we do here is an action movie with a perspective <br /> <br /> You can take or leave the ideas given to punish any wrongdoing by any means necessary, but the mystery behind slayings becomes clear to Harry (a perception that he is not conversing with the conversation wisely), a Is presented with a choice - what should be done about a killer, whose purpose is to be sympathetic, but whose behavior he does not tolerate the law Bara bound. This story makes it more interesting than the usual Disney Harry Rentals. <br /> <br /> Another release of the movie is the aspect of Eastwood. After all this, a dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than another character. The movie is directed with style and intelligence, and the action scene edited to give a big payoff. Here are some of the best "Harry Moments" of the series, including Harry's best known line, "Go ahead - make my day." <br /> <br /> "Sudden Impact" is a movie which has a reprehensible offense and follows a story about the brutal outcomes that show its courage. It's a riveting detective story, well-made and well-known. And it certainly does not dull. On those criteria, it's important to succeed.
