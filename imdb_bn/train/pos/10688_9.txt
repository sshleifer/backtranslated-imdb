I really do not know what to expect when going out to watch the film, as well as a simple platinum, a lonely man orders the Russian bride on the internet. It was Nicole Kidman. Although I absolutely love the film, I got out to think of 'oo'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The relation between film, Nicole and Chaplin works nicely against each other. Humor is subtle, with scenes like some of the bank's "office", and the thriller element adds tension without Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is about the unusual situation of real people. It's more about subtle and fine relationships about hero relationships. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br />
