In spite of Leslie Howard's performance is enjoyable. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat, weird character. One is supposed to feel sorry for these people; However, I make myself happy with Bate Davies' Milldale. Mrs. Davis gave her best performance (she received nomination for Academy Award). Thanks to his performance he brings this rather dull movie to life. ** Make sure Miledred does not miss when Philip feels about him.
