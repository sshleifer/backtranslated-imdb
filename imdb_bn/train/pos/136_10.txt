This movie series is finally a great way to finish. Peter (son from puppet master III) is all big and now puppet master. Well, this girl has learned to destroy the doll and learn about Toulon's secret, but instead she listens to stories about dolls. Most of this movie is puppet master second, puppet master third, puppet master 4, puppet master 5, puppet master curse and retro fool master (sorry ... but i guess the paramount will not let their scenes use 1). Personally I wished vs puppet master. Demonic toys will eventually be made, but how the film ends, they are basically saying "the final film in this series ..."
