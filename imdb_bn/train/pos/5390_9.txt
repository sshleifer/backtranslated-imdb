Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code movie that will be the best actor of the era. It is set in a hospital maternity ward, especially in the rooms expected for hardship for women. This is an old woman, a harsh unwanted mother (Glendha Farel), a weak young girl, an Italian woman and the main character (Loretta Young) who is imprisoned for 20 years in prison. Her husband (Eric Linden) is injured every second in the hospital and knows that everything will be fine. Alain McMahon plays an extraordinary nurse in his job. <br /> <br /> This picture is very interesting and entertaining. This is not terrible in any way, but it is interesting to see such neglected things on the silver screen. The acting is bright around. Loretta Young is pretty impressive here at its main Eric Linden may come out somewhere and be as sincere as possible. Her innocence is Michael J. Fox's memorable. Glenda Farrell is always as great, pre-code is a major and good reason.
