When I first saw this movie in the early 1970's, I was scared for the fear of this movie. Apparently it was stunning and the events of Europe and America's campus related to attempts to tell you so well in the last 15 minutes of the film Antoinini: Remembering your "psychological" organizations and big business interests. Beautiful room in the middle of the desert is running out of time, the main female character of the natural flow of cold water, drawing a flat image in the psychedelic design (even a few years ago, the British airport also made it a few years ago), the picture that has been copied by advertising workers worldwide for decades. Even after the film was released, Pink Floyd increased their fan. <br /> <br /> You've seen this movie after 30 years and you wonder why the same image has lost its appeal. Today the anti-film films have more material - information, documentation, fine performance and excellent screenplay. Antonio appears to be old; A flawed talent Even when you see Antonio's "blow-up" he gives you a similar feeling that he is frustrated. <br /> <br /> It should be evaluated for the release of "jabrisky point". It was a great movie if you see it on a wide-ranging panavision screen, which is against the Dwarfed TV screen. The visuals of the visual and the Aural (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Pink Floyd, et al.) Still remain. The lead pairs were not great actors but they were cute and natural. In the United States prison, one of their Mark (Mark Freyte) died, he made the role of non-conformistic pricing in the film. <br /> <br /> Today, Antonioi appears to be "sync". But watch out carefully and you will appreciate the silent words of regular actors - Rod Taylor, GD Spreading, Swimming Pool Ladies, Air-Strip Police. The actual words in contrast are from non-conformists. 30 years ago Antonioi was relevant but today its medium perception can not be questioned. He knew what he was doing.
