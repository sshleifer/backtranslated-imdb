One of the classic Kung-Fu films that came back to the 36th Chamber, which came back in the 70's and 80's, is based on Hollywood's Spaghetti Westerns and Gordon Gordon Liu of Western Clint Eastwood's opponent. A new print made for the digital remastered and fabulous film festival, it's better presented in "Shaw Scope" like a mother-in-law. <br /> <br /> This picture is a good versus an easy story, said 3 activities, in which the description of martial arts film in less or less detail. <br /> <br /> The law sets up a court. The workers of a small village die-mill are very unhappy, their wages decrease by 20% due to the coming Manchu gangsters. They can not do much about their exploitation because none of them are gangsters, and martial arts for their boss skills. Initially, a small success was achieved in Liu's highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences) in disguise, but many times they shadow the credibility limits by revealing their rounds. <br /> <br> The law shows the missing hero to get back to the two crowds. However, apart from real martial arts, he started the journey of the Shaulin temple, tried and learned to learn entrance and elegant art. After some shady moments, he was finally accepted by Abbott (whom he was disguised!) But he was disappointed with the teaching method - such as Karate Kid's Mr. Miyagi style, but instead of painting on the travel, he set sculptures around the temple. . Nothing can hold good people, and he unknowingly creates strength, patience and teaches Kung Fu unreasonably. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the battlefield there are three laws. With the effect of the Chess word, each of the film is given the most effective treatment of non-contact. But here its strong finger shots are refreshing to see battle scenes here with clarity and detail for sparing partners and slow-motion use of stents to be displayed in different corners. You can find the speed of motion with speed at a very slow pace, but Yuan and Ping and their style use add-nose in Hollywood Flickr, they definitely do not use war-like scenes! Return to the 36th chamber with a repeated screening on Monday, so if you are a nostalgic trip under memory lane, what are you waiting for?
