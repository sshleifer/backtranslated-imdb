Despite the excellent trailer for Vanilla Sky, I'm hoping to be frustrated by the film because I've heard that it did not get great reviews. However, I left the film completely due to the fear of Vanilla Sky. <br /> <br /> There was no bad performance in the whole film, each letter is credible. Romance moments in the character of the cruise, the character of David Amus and Cruz, Sophia is tantamount to realistic and pregnant (probably because she was a real-life couple soon). <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky's plot will confuse you in the last third of the film and you have fewer opportunities to guess the end. However, ending in the end, David gives you a strange blend of embarrassment with embarrassment, shock and sympathy for Em's. <br /> <br /> Image is intellectual and you have to pay attention to your life. This is not difficult because the possibilities are that you completely pull in the film and do not close your eyes on the screen for a second. <br /> <br /> I will usually forget about movies, I just watch the movie. But Vanilla Sky is still lingering into my mind day after watching it. I recommend it to those who want a change from simple, shallow films.
