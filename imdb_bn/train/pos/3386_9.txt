Is this waiting for our future? An overpopulated, unforgiving fallen land with a brutal, unwanted existence? This picture remembers an issue which still beat us, double, since the film was released in 1973. Hope the world will not end this way ... <br /> <br /> Swallow Green is a wild movie that I've enjoyed so much. It was a preferred character, a semi-mysterious setting, a compulsory and worrisome tale, and there were macho-est macho people: Charlton Haston. Richard Fischer gave this movie a very unpleasant, messy feeling. You are poked around by the stench from the city and its dirty inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The letters are wonderful. Charlton Haston, who has become my favorite actor, Thorne. People have played the role of this race, but are still like tough people. I certainly could keep Thorn's shoes myself. He saw that something is not right, but everyone around him does not listen (not much to listen to) or thinks he is dead. Edward G. Robinson (his last film, RIP.) Has played the lover of old Soul, who got this great place. Everyone else is great, especially a piece of "furniture" like Leg Taylor-Young, a rock that comes with his apartment. <br /> <br /> Special effects for 1973 are fantastic, pretty. The factories, future apartments, and especially "scups" (Bulldozer to get rid of the public) were excellent. The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very painful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br It's terrible, but if you think about it, it's a beautiful The idea <br /> <br /> The following line: <br /> <br /> A great 70's Fiction of science fiction that lets you think and gives you a very uncomfortable feeling.
