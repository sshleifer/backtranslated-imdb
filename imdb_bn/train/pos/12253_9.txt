It's been one of my favorite adaptations of Austen novel for a long time. Although it is not explicitly in the same category as "Pride and Prejudice", however, "Emma" considers a strong and relatively reliable TV version of Austen's novel - especially its short length. The biggest change in the novel and the film is good, it has been removed as unnecessary nervousness in the end of the story, and replaced with many more like Emma of any other book. I thought that the characters selected for illustrating the characters were well selected. Kate Bacinsel Walking towards the fine line between the completely lost girls and social snubs in the '96 edition of Glenneth Paltrow. Samant Morton's lusty blonde lock has enriched his attitude and character with the role of the previous character, which we know from Harit in the book. Mr Knightley's role is very good in my opinion; Both the seriousness and gentle condolences portrayed by the hero in the novel are in this neglected, rich film.
