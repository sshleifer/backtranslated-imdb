Despite the title, The Sword Bearer and the DVD cover (Accord / Heroes of the Sword Bearer Pose) is not a superhero film. <br /> <br /> (Little Spoilers) It follows Sasha's story. Sword Bearer, his forearm is cursed with a revocable sword. Tell you cool, but not, this real life. If you have this power as your child, you can control it when you say, face a crazy person, or when your mother's lover attacks her. And if you do not control it, how can you deal with being twice the murderer at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> This is basically when we meet him. Undoubtedly roaming horrific after another assassination (much like Bout de Souffle). Then she met Katie, and the pair went in love, trying to live a life of real life and tried and changed her ways. However, behind her past, she still pursued him like two police officers. <br /> <br /> This is basically a story, and there is no practical step on the screen, though many are proposed. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood movies, 'Super Hero', we get a little back story, there is no bad guy (unless you count Bearer in heaven), yet many hearts and good characters develop. <br /> <br /> You can find it out to check out valuable.
