I started watching the show in the first season, and at the beginning I was quite skeptical. The original movie was a child, and I was just looking for some sci-fi shows while waiting for the new season of BSG. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes I became a fan. I liked the characters - like the one who stupid-you-think-he-Jack O'Neal, the only smart evening carter, the glorious teal, the women and children's favorite, and the bright Dr. Daniel Jackson <br /> <br /> Of course, sometimes the stories are serious, sometimes not even ridiculous, but in most cases it's not about technology or space war - it's about helping your friend even even the risks of your life. It's about "we do not leave anyone behind". The struggle ended when all hope lost. Free will, and all the good qualities that make humans - human. <br /> <br /> And now it's breaking records, the 10th menu is going, and still doing well.
