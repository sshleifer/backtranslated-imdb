Repetition: Jandali is a little girl who is more stuck in her marriage to Thierry. Thiey himself is fighting with the death of his previous father and lost his way. He has drowned himself in writing, along with his writings, the janadali also rarely missed the attraction among them. Johnny entered it and Thierry's old friend, who was once a captive artist. But Johnny has kept painting, and he has only one day working for the tenant. That day comes and tomorrow he will leave his fate. There is an instant raw material between Zandalee and Johnny, and they enter into a matter of fact. But the janaldali struggles for her wishes and her conscience and love for her husband. But none of them is janaldali, not Johnny and Thierry can not completely control the relationship between them. <br /> <br /> Comment: This is set as a thriller. But more than a normal thriller is the thriller where it is life and death, and the threat of violence. The heart does not take a thriller fatal ratio, but the threat comes from a different angle. And until the thrill is raised it is not up to the second half of the wand and even if its foundation is placed in the first half, I can not really describe the form of an exciting form. Many more romantic dramas than anything else, but with other styles the underlying currents. There are developing thrillers, but it has a little tint more of a sensual erotic kind. As it is what is all about, which characters and so the whole story drives. Wish There is a need, and must be. <br /> <br /> In my opinion it's pretty good, of course it's much better than its current (4.1) rating. It takes time but it enhances the sensation of sensation, and it is very good to manage the lovers part with taste. It was always an integral part of the story, it was necessary to stay there for the necessary weight of the story, and I never felt that it was an excuse to show a naked breast or something like that. But unfortunately, the end of the story is good before the end, and finally the plane looks like itself, even if it is dramatic in its own way. <br /> <br /> Cast is impressive, directed by famous actors Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show was completely stolen from Arena Anderson. Very beautiful and deliberate at deliberate deliberate delights, he excels both cages and Reinhold sometimes becomes a boat overboard and becomes a rough rough. His career is very slim for the talent shown later in the wand, I can only hope because of his own preferences. Also two personal preferences are shown in small roles which give some additional edge to the film, it is Steve Bussy and Joe Pontioliano. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie when you are in the right mood, it may be a real claim that the other end uses to get credit. <br /> <br /> 7/10
