This gave me John Carpenter's Halloween realization. As a kid, I think I really enjoyed the signal, especially the Return of Michael Mayors, which I still think is the best Halloween Siegel. But I think the first was slow and it took a lot of time to reach the point. I've seen it a few times recently and now I know I was wrong. Today I really understand this movie, that means, the complete feeling of this awesome masterpiece. It's not about blood and gore. It's not about naked girl and lame joke. It's about the worst night of Laurie Stroud's short life. Her psychic brother came back home at the last moment, about 15 years before he started. This movie was meant to be awesome and I think it's very good. This is one of the first slasher movies, a horror sub-series that I always liked. Halloween has such a very dark atmosphere, obscure music and talented young actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. I want to say more? Anyone who did not see it, a horror fan or not, his cinematic homework should now be right. Very highly recommended!
