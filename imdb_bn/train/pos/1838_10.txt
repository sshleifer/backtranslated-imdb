WAQT is a perfect example of not just a chicken soup for your souls. Unfortunately, unfortunately its original taste has been lost, thanks to the extra vulnerability of its excesses and the garnishing. <br /> <br /> Wonderful and frustrating about WAQT comes from a director who was away from normal clich√©s, but at the second end of the Hindi film, who gave the stereotype film for the formula. Vipul Shah had strong conviction to show blind people such as robbing a bank in Uncle, but he failed to persuade his life in the entire packaging of Waqqiyyat, which can be likened to the father's son relationship. Received from a Gujarati game Bhoj Vaala Fari Malishu, WAQT has a sharp story with a social message to back up. A mature face on the relationship between father and son, unconditional love of father to his father and responsibility of his son towards his family. God Chandra Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who started his life from the hay of his entire empire, lived with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). His only son Aditya (Akshay Kumar) did not have to make some effort to do anything after getting some durable-made and spicy food. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He said that he already had his Ladolov Mitali (Priyanka Chopra) ) Are married. God hopes marriage will make Aditya more responsible but he is frustrated. Aditya still lived helplessly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He has no option but to struggle for the livelihood of his wife and his unborn child. He started looking towards an independent man, but his relationship between him and his father increased. <br /> <br /> This story is a simple and straightforward approach to simple images. One can easily relate to and relate to both credible letters of both father and son. If you are not one of the two, at least you come in real life like people like them. <br /> <br /> It's easy to handle director Vipul Shah's screenplay. With the family relations of such family, according to the cinematic laws of Bollywood family dramas, another director used to add enough melodrama to protect the tunnels in the film. Shah, however, extended his hand to the ruthlessly managing feelings for most parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Its neutral clean-cut example is clear in pre-break scenes, where the father expels the boy in his house. A rather terrible method. The audiences are achieving the purpose of the scene without blotting a fool on the brain. Dieto for the second half scene, where the now-separated father's son had a separate conversation. It separates WAQT from a Kabi Kushi Gaham or an EK Rasta, and in fact it places one level high in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after achieving all the difference points, someone might wonder if WAQT is still failing? The problem is that WAQT separates itself from others in its leagues for treatment, but it provides glitteys for packaging conditions. Do-not-dance with the director every now and then for the first half forced A johar type shadi song, a chopara type song, a father son disco dandiya song, a dream song and a dream have inspired the tide of the audience. See this picture ... Dad just drove the son of his house and the boy was dreaming of a song on his wife on the mountain of Morocco. Outside the place! Because outside! And the audience seats out. <br /> <br /> The image falls into the first half and the real story starts only in the second half. The director has lost too much WAQT over unnecessary components. A lot of things about dog cheezing order are not bad but are not redeeming either. But Akshay Kumar's dancer dance is simply ridiculous. Imagine that he has been able to find a star in movies (oddly) ridiculous ridiculous Add it to the climax set in the Star Final, where the boy goes out with emotion. That's so archetypal! Also, the change pattern may be inverted to conceal the father's reason for changing his attitude towards his son. <br /> <br /> Although the case is unnecessary, Anu Malik's music is good. Santos Tha and camera camera-work is not enough demand, but is quite worthwhile. Atish Kapadia came up with some good dialogue for the dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav has recently been confused with his comedy art in several films, this time his character Decreased and completely prevented. The expression of his death is perfectly appreciated with bomb's top-top histrionics. <br /> <br /> The role of Shefali Shah's mother is believable. Will not be taken as a sensor but he's playing his character and 'look' both faulty. Priyanka is superb and performs well in her part. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main congratulations to Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay, especially in the scene where his father Dad spontaneously empowers him to make him aware of his duties. Although the child has become somewhat dramatic in some scenes, his shine hits throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Collectively, the WHT is like a soup whose ingredients are both delicious and nutritious, but the final recipe is in any way.
