There is no doubt that he was fully present with his father (Ed McMahon) during his tour of Romania, the teenager Tony Walker (Adam Armin) of the 1950s, called "Full Moon High", fully called Campi Mix. Sure enough, Tony gets thorns, and whenever a full moon increases fur and fangs. A special interesting aspect in this movie is that he can not age until the age of the curse, and he must fulfill a destiny - even if it takes 20 years. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, once the movie continues it's just plain fun. Ed McMahon's character is a patriotic right-wing Yahoo (he thinks that everyone has heard Joe McKay), Kenneth Mars's instructor / overseer has an intense bizarre and then there is more. One of the most open-eyed members of Demode Wilson - is the best remembered as Lamont on "Sanford and Sun" - who is astonished as a bus driver. But perhaps the most interesting scenario is the President's change; Then jerk with Gerald Ford summed him really! However, it is a practical behavior. Remembering Alan Orkin - who was a Janice psychiatrist - won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his boys, wondering if I'm remembering co-acting with both of them in this movie (apart from Adam, his son Anthony also has a small role). Pretty funny Also starring Elizabeth Hartman <br /> <br /> Director: Larry Cohen is probably well-known for the killer baby's "It's Alive".
