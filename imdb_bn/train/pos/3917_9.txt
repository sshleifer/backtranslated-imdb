I saw this movie when I was released in the United States in 1984. I saw it long ago. What makes me hit the film is that it involves the art of living in contrast to letters and visas. There are two internet intervals throughout the film and sometimes some are not sure if a person sees the life of the characters or the rehearsal scene. It continues till the end of the film. After all these years, my friends and I still love to debate whether "Carmen" really ends up knocking. From the response of other characters, stylized murder, it opened the debate. Dancing emotions, acting quality, love of art, and talent of performance gathered everyone to create a great movie, which again merged the line between life and art.
