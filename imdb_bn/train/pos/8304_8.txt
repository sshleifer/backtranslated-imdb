I grabbed this photo with my brother late in the evening / Sunday morning. We were drinking. This is one of the best movies for ripping apart apart I've ever seen. The 'luxurious' ocean fishing boat is actually 'roll-on, roll-out' from ferries, stuffing everything from custom iron to stainless steel sticker door, then the same scene is being used in another scene - this rock rock !! The continuity is so poor that you can not help but notice that it is facing you face to face. In the final scene, he closed a lifeboat in the boat by a distance. His son and new girlfriend (the PR director of the ship who knows Kung Fu and used in police but was dismissed for his work - the truth) was going very fast in the blast from the ferry. ...... Then the parents are hugging them. How ??? Who care, its magic. This image does not have a redemption feature. Casino is a large bedroom shape with a casino table. When chasing by the villains, there is only the hiding place, you have guessed it. Write Villains, instead of checking below a table, draw four fruit machines and a small corner bar (an angle bar in the casino). They allow our Caspar to travel around them and let them 'get out'. <br /> <br /> Drink some friends, get some drink, insert this picture and cry.
