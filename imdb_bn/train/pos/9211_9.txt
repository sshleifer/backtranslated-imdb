Action, awful, sci-fi, exploitation director Fred O'Nean Ray shows some talent as his manager. Character actor William Smith is one of the best tough / bad boys in the industry. He treats the visitors with the best performing performance in his career. Randy Trives as he gives his best le Van Cleef impression. She's not bad in the film. Smith and Travis make movies. None of them are really standing for everyone else. Ray did a great job to handle this memoir, Smith and Trevis were good, I could have given this B Western one to ten (ten best) scale.
