What's good about it: Some inventive and truly unclear little effects that even the most funful fan can get under the skin. Hackneyed soundtracks for their "gotcha" moments do not depend on stabs. Even if you have seen everything, then there are some things in this movie that will make your jaw drops. <br /> <br /> What could be better about this: The role is sometimes flat and uncomfortable. In some places it was a "shot-on-video" quality (though, it mostly achieved the environment for it), and camera work is full of inappropriate close-ups of meaningless activities. Although in reality the effects are frustrating, I think they may have gone well with some people several times. Finally takes up, and glossed over what might be more dominant moments. Not as a challenge by filmmakers, viewers have been let out to find a lot of things for the audience, but they just missed it. <br /> <br /> Still, there is a nice little indie horror film which is easily several steps above average. Good rental price.
