The only and only comment about this film is completely inconsistent and I received very strong comments, so I decided to write my own. I have seen the first movie and since then it has been caught several more times. First of all tell me that overall, what does this film deserve? It does not matter that there are fewer budget quirks and other faults. It's worth watching. The idea of ​​maintaining a film by Walt Whitman is that it visits the narrow, narrow psychological Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario and makes people a wonderful mis-scene. This film has inspired Whitman inspired about humans in humanizing catalysts. And in that sense it's just right. Acting - especially Rip Torn (Whitman) and as a doctor of pen fair - very good. The scripting and conversations give strong attention to the strong and timely hen and change. Overall, what does not like? Besides, Whitman is the name of another film that is so clearly brought to life?
