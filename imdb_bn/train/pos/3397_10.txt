Swallow Green ... really a good movie, <br /> <br /> <br /> I never thought of it. I do not really like Hesson in his science efforts. He is one of the actors who, like Superman, always runs shoes and many junior. I like more weak heroes. And in fact, he has opened up a great way through Swant Green, but I do not think he is playing a terrifying bandit. <br /> <br /> I understand why some people will turn their noses into this movie. Swallow Green does not make any effort to create future visuals (you know - it looks like 1973), and it lacks action. But I praised the complexity of a complex, corrupt, and highly laminated society, and Edward G. I was very happy to see Robinson's so active, funniest role. Excellent small moment moments - when he shares some valuable food with Heron - actually making movies. <br /> <br /> The message of Swant Green is very relevant nowadays, when no one knows what the government or the government corporation is up to. Funny, it's not Prototype Michael Murray to watch the movie Heston ...
