Each episode vilifies a single person in particular and he end up finishing until the end. It's fun to see you get screwed completely though they are completely wrong and ill. You see others screwing, drunken, dirty game, trailing, fleeing and eventually kicking with the tram. Tears seem to be rising in the season. <br /> <br /> The efforts to compensate for past insults and hardships have also been greatly reduced.
