Spoilers ..... <br /> <br /> I saw the TV on the TV a few days ago, and this product has been remembered for less popping than most conspicuous clothing drama. I rewatched the DVD this week and still it has the same impression. This is a good story first, but when the heroine becomes very brave and noble and when her completely weak husband comes back in weakness, I become weak and I become completely excited with her affection. I think when it was written "the right thing" then the story was written and a lot of anger was expressed, and it was difficult for a woman to be independent from her husband because marriage was not more than her rights, leave alone with a lover I hope the modern audience has loved to see a lot as to carry scandalously. But nowadays, consolation is difficult to accept and especially when the strong, courageous fans of this heroine were ready to defend him and everyone against him. So I publish the story again in the story. It's as good as the novel, but somewhat annoying in today's kind of life. <br /> <br /> Strong protagonist Gilbert must have been involved in the change of his Ladyville and often with cryptic behavior and steadfast self-denial. So be consistently supportive So I'm very disappointed that when Helen was free to stay with her for a long time, she did not allow headlines to be read on one another for more than one minute. We were absolutely ridiculous when we were waiting for the unexpected husband to get in touch with dialogue and the harmful attitude of feeling for a good hug between heroes and heroine. Instead, filmmakers like to go out of time or money or just can not get annoyed. "Here you can - one minute, you can do whatever you can, then the director wants to go home now." I became completely dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> However, the performance of Toby Stephen is very much a complimentary and perfect and very nice hero and Rupert Graves is nicely nasty and self-hearted villain congratulations. They were satisfactory in the boundaries of the Fitzgerald scripts, which forced them to become very bothered and instead of being terrorized. <br /> <br /> He said, I love these classic plays and virtually all of them are much better than the "modern" drama on TV this day. So 7 they are still a good watch despite the cause of pain.
