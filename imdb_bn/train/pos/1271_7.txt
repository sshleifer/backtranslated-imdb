Based on the novel novel by Nicholas Katzenbach did not meet this movie, and considering considering the first rate cast to combine production, we decided to take a look. "Just Coz", although not a horror film, took much more independence with the original element that Jeb Stewart did not successfully succeed in his treatment. Arne Glimcher guided. <br /> <br /> For the first time when we think that a young black man is given police brutality to interrogate the local youth. After all, Sheriff Tenny Brown, and police officer Wilcox, do not show any mercy to beat Bobby Earl, who is accused of killing a small white girl. How did the officers fear the prisoners? <br /> <br /> Then the scene is changed. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's Grandmother is sent a question to ask a prominent Harvard professor of a retired lawyer, young man Paul Armstrong wants to protect him. He is quite confident about the elderly woman to look at Armstrong's case. He is also convinced of the youth's innocence. <br /> <br /> What we think is not right. When Blair Sullivan was spending time with similar benefits like Bobby Earl, he came forward to tell about how he was involved in the murder of a young girl and changed the movement of the case. How it is playing in the film, it confuses the viewer and prevents Armstrong from reaching the truth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This thriller makes Shan Connani an enjoyable performer with Armstrong. Lawrence Fishburn, an intense actor, has a great impression like Sheriff, as far as we can see, he is guilty of insulting his prisoner. He has an excellent opportunity to show why one of our best actors is Ed Harris. Blair Underwood, Kate Cappasso, Ruby D and the young Scarlett support the role of Johansson. <br /> <br /> The film will not be disappointed even by its flaws.
