Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story about everyday crime, which leads to a complete disaster in a crazy scene. The greatest Greek series ever! Actors such as KT Constantineau and Maria Kavogianani showed themselves a whole new level of talent and gave us incredible 'guilty' smile moments. Every audience recognizes bad character in one of their characters or at least recognizes it for their own interests. The actors of every age acting in large and small parts have earned a great deal of place in the heart of the Greek audience. My personal favorites (I've mentioned the first two) Vassilis Haralampupulos, Athenodorous Prosoulis and Stevros Nicolides, but many of these amazing actors passed through episodes. Time to time Anyone around the world who understands Greek should definitely find a way to see this series, although it was on television for more than 5 years. In Greece, they continue to repeat the series (Anti-1) in summer or afternoon, we will never forget Eglimata or counter no one!
