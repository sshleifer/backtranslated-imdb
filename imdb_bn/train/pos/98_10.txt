For me too, this is the Christmas special one that I feel very fondly. In 1989, I snatched 2 CDs found in Soundtrack Recording, gave to my sister and kept the other for myself. It is now part of my family's Christmas tradition and I would like to be able to see the show again instead of listening. It is mentioned elsewhere that John Denver has created a number of muppet shows, and they are more than simultaneously together The good relationship between Denver and his uncle's friends evidently comes here, a charming and fun show which is good for all ages.
