I love this movie so much! Animation great (for a Pokemon movie), CGI looks so cool I love singing in the movie. So great they keep Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As the story: its great. It has a great feeling of friendship. Celebi is a very intelligent and powerful Pok√©mon. Ash is really cool in this movie, and I love his friendship with Sam. The only thing that I do not like is Sookina's face, she suddenly pops up, helps Ash and Coat a bit. They could make their part a little bigger in the movie. <br /> <br /> But overall, great movie! DVD version of the USA can not wait!
