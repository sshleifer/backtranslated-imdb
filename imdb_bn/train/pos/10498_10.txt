It's a little easier. That's about it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clear and realistic, the band is something 2d, but without that apathetic. Cleaner than the rest of the graphics in GoldenEye and many other N64 games The sound is fantastic. Everything spoken with SFX is happy and realistic. <br /> <br /> The camera angle is a bit annoying, but it's the same as every platform game, such as Bonjo-Kazi and Goncong 64. <Br> <br /> I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and after that, I got 120 stars for more than 10 times.
