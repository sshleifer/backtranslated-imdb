Wow i like this movie! It's about a normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! It's the thing about all encounters in life. You have to do things with passion But some people will not appreciate your emotions and will try to stop you. There are people who find opinions from others and neighbors will feel more important than following their heart. Do not let anyone's opinions stop you from fulfilling your dreams and emotions. I am honest that all of the actors really loved normal people, it could be my family. No big beauties, but during the movie everyone loves you guys.
