Traditional Western wide open space, clear ethics, synonymous with inevitable stories, optimistic hopes for a hero's power to attract his own fate, escaping from his past. These qualities appear to directly prevent American concepts, self-reliant dreams, border borders and borders, for which the novel is still indicated by opportunistic politicians. Some great exceptions (such as Wellman, Huq), Western healthier nervous or actual concerns were free. Anthony's value has changed this forever, and this first trend is not like telling a consistent, vivacious, complex, sometimes exciting Westerns. <br /> <br /> Traditional Western relies on a hero who removes the barriers of past, which he may already have, the influence of the order and rights, who influence the film, restore the similarities with the effect of the past. ; And a clear arch, who often, scoffs, tricks the plot, forces the hero to certain steps. The difference between the two is often portrayed as easy as wearing white or black hats. <br /> <br /> The map's background movie was silent, which was a public open space and there was opposition to optimism. Silence is morally charged, focusing on the isolation of an unstable character, in which morality is destroyed, the hero often wilens, trapping inside the inside of his own making, a passive victim to the fate. Nur is not progress about progress, but the question of protest and representation of the interrogation and methods of representation is not their creation and confirmation. <br /> <br /> 73 Winchester is full of anxiety. Silent is often considered to be a mental style, which shows the head injury to his hero. 73 also does this, and the drama is very nice, which hates Jimmy Stewart, starts his cool with quality and tough movies with Hitscock. In many ways, nature and sweet, right representation and tries to restore obstacles to natural order, he is also a poor man, who can not stop anything to take revenge of the murder, whose uninterrupted search mirrors Ethan Edwards in the investigators. Inhuman stability, whose human senses are confused by this investigation, and whose crackdown is dangerous to give a true testimony. <br /> <br /> As a light, his anxiety is a psychological basis - in contrast to most 'healthy' heroes who are excluded from their fathers (symbolically killed), Macdham's father died before he died; Less moral revenge than the angry protests against the frustrating growth of his brother. Climatic shoots are not cathartic: MacDom has seen some of the world's most fearful fears, as he has returned to the 'normal' society. <br /> <br /> The most unpleasant about this image is that it's not really about all of a hero or a villain, but a timeless piece of laziness that runs the action. The 73 headlines are open with guns, a glass is shown behind the window, its fans are trapped, squashed, spontaneously created, made, outdoors. Throughout the film, human capabilities are reducing the most arbitrary of the cyanifiers - names are changed; Lin and Dutch Maim shot each other because they have no guns; The quests lose their moral animations and their practitioners veer around the crazy; To fight the soldiers, the Confederate seeks help from strangers; When a person mentions his name, he is respectable; While abandoning his fiancee to the Indians, another man is expressed as a coward; The gun maintains its talent, power, integrity. <br /> <br /> This is not a plot of retaliation which drives the film, but the story of the gun; This conventional expectation wrenches out the film, and creates an eerie, isolated, modern feel. We have been caught so much in the plot of revenge that when we follow the gun, completely another plot, we will feel a little ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The emphasis on a gun, a symbol of strong manhood, is actually to express the criticism of manhood, the costly education of society and order; Barbarous capitalist greed; Killer Indian businessmen who cheat vendor and enemy; Cowards; Psychotic killers; Before his 'true owner' came back, a broken hero was completely compromised, who became a murderer as a murderer. The gun is not printed with the name of its owner, because it is not a permanent owner, but there is no specific brain, because the orphan in the traditional western <br /> <br /> 73 bright Western imagery - Wat Erip, Dodge City, Cavalry, Civil War, wide open west - only weaken them. Yerp has a reputable reputation that is not all the names but never proven - the Dodge City is not safe against extroverters elsewhere; The horse has been inactive (the cat only lost the Little Big Horn) and the war was shown to be bitter warlike irrelevant. The open western mythology is a very close, inaccessible, circular plot that captures its character, does not allow them to shape their fate, but instead it gives them shape. <br /> <br /> Old John Ford is reprized with the riders of riders on a huge mountain, but here the signal progresses but it is not repeated and round. But for all its rebuilding, the film is definitely brighter in some way, which some Westerners have ever achieved. Manna's stimulating strategy leads her camera to a very important position, revealing distances with acute testing, salon doors and tactics seem to be romantically alive and live.
