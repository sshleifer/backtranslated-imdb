The bold movie of Mel Gibson was a spectacular movie, but it kept a yeast taste in the mouth. On the contrary, Rob Roy is a little less polished, but a far better film. It is a historical film that combines uninterrupted themes with real historical value, while Brahhart puts an obnoxious and unpleasant contemporary gloss in an ancient story. What is this film throwing. Liam Nisson plays the protagonist, playing the role of a re-established (in a waterfall-down fashion) role in Phantom Menace. Character is heroic, but not the greatest fighter and most monster lover. Praise man is still, he commands the screen. Team Roth of Cunningham, Opponent But Bright and Human Heart's Morally Corrupt Layer has been selected equally with human adversity against him. Also praising Jessica Lange, as a progressive wife of Rob: strong and advanced, but 300 years away from the modern heroine, which should be it. It's not the original movie you'll see, but it has its own strong beliefs and strong performance.
