Like many people in Arthur Bach's social life, he is undoubtedly unhappy and attracted to 'below him' social people - he pays for a hooker in the first scene and then he is very attracted to the shopkeeper. <br /> <br /> He drinks too much, and sometimes he is driving when he is drinking, of course, certainly not funny. <br /> <br /> The movie is superb but there is some reality behind comedians. John Gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on the screen and creates a character for ages. Talk about an Oscar worthy. Moore and Minnie have their moments, but her Gilgood "Hobson" as you remember most.
