If you were born at the end of this movie and I had a liberal / open family of family, then I am sure that in the early 80's you will first have to show dirty movies or walk in dirty movies. Movie You do not know 100% pornographic, but an alchemical mix of real drama and pornography, or you will tear them in their collections and pop in the presentation of the plastic volume, in a presentation of a VHS movie on a large Doctor machine. While you're out of fear of discovering buttons like tablet, you want to be very calm and ninja but still have a small heartbeat. Anyway, these types of movies have been sent behind your mind, waiting and are waiting to be reconnected to the visible "industry". Not saying, this movie fits into a story mentioned in a "T". Many will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps because of me being helpless, I get more annoyed by the subtleties. The Creator was speaking deeply on our human motivation and which may be considered as genuine hatred, interracial relations, bed frame masturbation, cruelty, or social status in the face of pedophilia / homosexuality, or the suppressive sex of the socialist society of France in the 18th century. Nature? Who could say, but Mr. Borowcyzk clearly, despite being "ideal" for his job of raw sexuality, I'd say that in reality this movie does not speak on the deep level about the audience's sincere carnality. Once I learned it, the story became more attractive than passing the speed of the shock and it was also good to check it out there.
