If you like Long Way Round, you'll enjoy it almost. It's educational, fun, attractive and tense. Charlie shares the screen with two attractive colleagues, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameraman and lots of ribs. Ian makes some presence but Charlie really pulls it alone. He is funny, engaging and still a lotus of pressure and doubt. Great stuff! <br /> <br /> The series has spread in 7 episodes. Like LWR, preparations are interesting as nearly as interesting. Although they cover well the race and insides, there may be more explanations of trucks and cars, which are only mentioned and rarely seen in racing. Although it's a motorcycle movie and anyone on both wheels will love this. <br /> <br /> This series features amazing photography and some interviews with people. Father There is another very interesting theme song like the LWRA, but it's often not as good as stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you are a resident of the United States, then you can get it after you release it so buy it at Amazon.uk. I see it on your computer. Oh, and ready to buy another motorbike.
