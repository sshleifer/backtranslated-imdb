This is one of my favorite comedy ever. The hero does not want to abandon the unwanted lifestyle, but it is not funny to despise the narcotics, but the film makes a lot of fun. This is an eternal story of an eternal drunken, some 40 bachelors named Unprotected irresponsible Arthur who have inherited a great fate, but only Susan is chosen to marry because the family thinks he can do something about it. Arthur proposed, but then weirdly lindas, waitresses and little thieves. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Confession, Moore Arthur and I agree with them that any other actor can imagine the role. The piece is also well illustrated. Liza Mineralie is striking as Linda, and with screening of Moore's screen chemistry, she is very cool. Jill Klerberg Susan, elected to Arthur, the wealthy and more competent women. <br /> <br /> However, this film has literally made Sir John Gilgood, who illustrated Arthur's sarcastic but moral Butler Hobson. There are mutual affection relationships between Hobson's long-term employment. Hobson Arthur's best friend and unexpected comments and advice conveyor. The most interesting relationship to this movie is not Arthur's romance, but he has an extraordinary relationship with this malicious, uncommon relationship, and eventually disrespects the servant. It's the end of the credit roll after you remember Long Butler.
