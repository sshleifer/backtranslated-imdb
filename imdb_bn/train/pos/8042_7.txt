**** Speaker **** Film "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploitation of legendary US Marine Sniper Carlos "Gunny" stubbornly. The overwhelmingly soft-spoken Mr Rogers sees the same, who increased the number of 300 confirmed and unelected Vietkong and North Vietnamese military incidents during two visits to "Nam". It's really deadly and effective trained military sniper. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, meaningless. As he learned in US Marines, he has nothing to do with his skill, unless he decides to become a public hit man. Bettake reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifelong professional killer for his country. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie "sniper" is focused on the widget. It helped with the silver silver medal on the East Coast and the support of US government agent Richard. Miller, Billy Jane, being sent deep inside the Panmanian jungle. Two sniper rebellious general Miguel Alvarez, Frederick Miraglitua and Colombian drug drug-pin Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alvarez, who have been helped to support the country's military plan, have to find out. <br /> <br /> We saw Sindhu movie before. Bract's chance and I think of taking a rebel leader that was the best view of "sniper". For how it looks step by step Sgt. Beckett with the help of his spt CPA. Papy, Aden Young, do her work. A sub-plot, which was then waiting for the rebel Sniper Desilva, Ever Wiley, who beat Beckett and later killed Papi, who was waiting for the exit of the jungle through military military helicopter. You thought that a deadly cat and mouse are going on both ends but the movie ends. In the beginning of the film, there was no problem of baked using incalculable miller as Desilvha bit. <br /> <br /> This story was the worst, when the story was about fifteen minutes or more minutes. A kill sniper movie shot like a Rambo with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller fight a whole battalion of the rebels in combat with frequent flying fights like London fog. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is still a story about a person who "sniper" is not really glamorized in the war movies: a free killer who is killed with master hectare or full neurosurgeon accurately and efficiently and it is a total privacy Who works in between.
