From an extremely compelling cast performance, from intelligent cinematography to beautiful music scores of Carter Barrell, from intelligent written (and very quotable) scripts, Rob Roy gave a rare distinction between the experience of going to the movies: one that is impossible <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I told Mel Gibson with proper credit, barbarians confronted me with rival Roy RAW And many serious injuries, such as the promotional epics, once again I would like to see this kind of movie. Although Bravo works hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy only arrests you and enriches you in the story of a firmly edited story. The single scene is not lost. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy holds the perfect balance of dramatic excitement, action and even sometimes humor. Characters are well-understood, completely communicating with local languages ​​and approaches that anchor them in their authentic time settings. Besides, they are not good and temple dancers as well, because we often observe modern films too. <br /> <br /> For example, we hope that when the heroic verdict of the heroes becomes stronger, we will realize that his prophecies are his own pride and knowledge of honor. Team Roth is playing one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of the film, but there are moments when we can understand how the events in his life have become his shape. Rob Roy has appointed a level of development of a character that makes his story more credible and secretive. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a delightful treasure, among which the greatest ever to have any dancing skills and the ability to complete a climate.
