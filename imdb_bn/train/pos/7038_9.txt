"The first battle is 100% outsourced." Dan Acroids's line tells it all. This film is a difficult to describe; Comedy, Sense, Action, Scrubble It reminds Dr. Strangelov once or twice, especially in Ben Kingsley (who has done a great job in my mind) in integrated scenes. I did not have any special expectations for this movie, although I'm a big cusack fan, but I just washed the film on me. And as a result I was quite entertained. Political satire is painful to the US military-trade complex, right and quite damaging. Although sub-plots are somewhat predictable, the final lines of story lines make them perfect. I understand why this movie was not very popular in the United States, but it's a timely story for the rest of the world.
