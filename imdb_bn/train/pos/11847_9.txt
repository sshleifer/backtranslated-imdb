Horse is actually a fine creature. Imagery illustrating wild horses and their grace was not more royalty than an animated flick. <br /> <br /> The animation is simply awesome. Fine animations form a background of beauty that bind horses to horses. When the Stallion travels on various coastals, the arch and the brides go across the water. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is very impressive. Wonderful instrument music lures you to appreciate the movie <br /> <br /> "They say, western story has been written from the shoulder of the horse." Well, the story of a beautiful horse was written from the western clay. <br /> <br /> To everyone, this movie is clearly the best. This is one of my best animations flickr. A lonely night will be a very delicate choice. An easy 9/10.
