I was not really that bad. Art is not a great job but Darmt M is a very strong actor. Patricia Arquette was overacting a lot during the time. He was actually playing Sollo which was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. Besides, he is an incredibly beautiful man. Really sexy Add that to the talent, and he's been mostly that much more tolerable. Although he was involved in projects he did not always get the highest mark, he always gave everything to him. In most cases, the actor is not guilty. Unfortunately, he is in some strange films that did not fit in the box office. Always a list of actors but always always a "hit". But in a DVD rented or bought "he is worth every penny". See the date of marriage with Debra Messing - one of her best overall movies. Penny everything! ; ) (If you have not seen it yet, then you can understand the quote!)
