Note: These comments are for those who are watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a bright, complex and exciting movie that explores the tag-line that does exist: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Maybe the movie movie may come into focus for a confused movie-gear if someone shows it from a different angle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Through the scene of the scene, I have to be more vigilant about my statements, (and I welcome your thoughts) But try it out and see if the movie does not go anywhere: where the controversial 'splice' is okay <br /> <br /> <br /> Now I'm not talking about Spell, Le le Technician, the sequence that really Inside the mind / dream / coma state of David Yum Ktisangata can be interpreted as a form, but the real division between reality and dreams. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the reality is like a car crash, how it is painted (for example no explosion) is probably a 'splice' point, and any sequence that holds an existence / dream / coma / non-reality Feel it - it is shown whether the screen on the screen before or after the disaster - is actually part of the personal journey of Aames towards self-realization in your own mind. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the last (if you know more, let me know): actually the oops have become obscure and Where does he sleep? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Makes Today's pop culture is the meaning of society <br /> <br />
