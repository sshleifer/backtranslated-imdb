This was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Irie. The only problem with me was that I did not like Jellie Clark. I thought he was very old and knew very frightening. Jane looked like a very strong character in the book. I was really annoyed by this photo of her. Rochester asked her to marry her in the morning and she goes towards him and always embraces him. I think they have made a bad choice in her welding. But Dolton was absolutely amazing as Rochester. He makes this price version of Zen Iory. Another thing that does not make this version is 100%. I know it was made for TV in eighty. It was a feature film, and good quality, it could be perfect. My main complaint, however, the Jellie Clark was certainly old.
