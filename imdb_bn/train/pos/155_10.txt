El Maar is a tough, superb, completely bright, brave act of the cinematic industry. Anthony Allay and Bailel Masueida, with an adaptation of Blue Bonnet's novel, Auguste Villaranga, created a movie that dramatizes the impact of war on the minds of children and the anger of adults on the life of adults. And although the war on tattoos is the focus of children's war, it is clear that changes in the impact of adult-born citizens and adult citizens. This film has become one of the best anti-warrior documents without using pumplatering: The underlying story has had a lot of impact due to the outcome. After the children's expedition to adulthood <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spain's Spanish Civil War, blackout and civilians threatened to kill at night. Rama (Nilo Moore), Tur (David Luzano), Julia (Sergii Moreno), and Francisco (Victoria Vargar) are the terrorists' killings, and revenge that witnesses one of them murder and suicide terrorism. In this wide-eyed look, children become adults, psychological diseases and suppression of their mind. <br /> <br /> We then see three people who live in the elderly, where they are all limited to volunteer sanitarium. Ramala (Roger Kasmozor) survived as a male prostitute protected by his 'John' Morel (Julie Mirah) and kept his lifestyle private. Turi (Bruno Bergenzini) has become weak of sexually transmitted males, whose cover is its commitment to Catholicism and the illusions of self-separation / crucifixion. Francisco (Antonia Terre√±o) has become a nun and serves patients in sanitarium. They reunite with their environment in three sanitarium, and gradually release each of their war experiences in childhood. For Lara's long love for Ramala, Ramal would like to be free from his Morrell, and Francisco will face his internal needs covered by his white noon practice. <br /> <br /> The setting of sanitrium provides graphic planes where thin life and death between threads, desires and love, and play in devotion and destruction. There will be enough reasons to say that graphic sex and complete nudity are involved (in most of the film's most entertaining raw footage still in the film), and the audience should be prepared to testify to the fantastic form of cruelty. These scenes are very important for this viewer, and director Wilaronga is appreciated for his courage and courage to make this story so intense. Both actors like children and adults are fantastic: Roger Kasamour, Bruno Bergenzini and Antonia Tereno are particularly fine in very strange roles. Jaim performs a directorial view of Parakoula's film screenplay and scores of Javiya's Navaratte Hunting musical instruments. This is a tough movie, but it is a very strong, who refuses to face the horrors of war and the subsequent events. Spanish with English subtitles <br /> <br /> <br /> Gready Harp
