This is probably the best small crime drama I've ever seen. The actress is extraordinary, especially Amanda Burton, whose character becomes scary and sweated by pessimism and then some ... she balances the feelings of Rachel's / Carlos and plays the pain of a child whose son is lost, so convinced that it is a real Life story then feels more like a drama. Other actors are definitely cool, which they usually have in British TV / Film. The last, which I'm not going to give, it's really amazing because you do not really get one ... (You can see that I've got it, I can get it) It's better to buy and see than and again and if you're not touched by this you're a cold impressive Person
