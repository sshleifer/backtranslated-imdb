I used to live with the roommate to try suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could violate fifty dollar noise for sneezing after midnight - so I can easily relate to Polanski's "The Tenant". <br /> <br /> But I enjoy this movie for other reasons. I'm not sure that it works entirely - reproducing between Polannski's character in Paranayi and madness, which takes half an hour or more, rather it seems shocking and bizarre. For one, Ebert was totally disgusted, and he crushed the film with a star review. But I think that different scenes and moments work nicely, so I did not fully understand the whole film - for example, what should be done with the urology? I still have its overall positive impression. <br /> <br /> I love the unpleasant friend pictured by Bernard Frereson, for example. God, how often I am determined to be such a friendship instead of a friendly friendship! I like the movie theater scene - the most fun "out of" moment in the history of the film, I would say. And boy, I love Isabel Adjoni - he's so dirty in this movie, it's almost incredible. And he always gives a great performance as. <br /> <br /> Polanski is a good actor, too; I do not agree with occasional insulting comments made about his performance here. His character is supposed to be less original and thoughtful, so it fits his less key performance. I, for one, thought that he was completely sympathetic - though he had lost me a bit, when he pulled for a clear visual reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is unclear. And slow. But it captures the isolated attitudes of apartment living - everything I've done completely - so I dig it out. It's a fun thing all you need is a common reference point, and suddenly a strange movie becomes deeply significant! Picking for DVD Pocket Change Surely worth it.
