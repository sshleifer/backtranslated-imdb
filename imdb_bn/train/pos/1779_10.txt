I like this movie! 10 hands down 10 hands! Good that's good! I'm not a fan of movies but I told you this opened my eyes. Wonderful color and fast power. I was lucky to catch screening at the time of joking! Boston Film Festival, and stories really enveloped me from the beginning. It was too much adult theme and character and it ended when I wanted more. I hope they make a signal. That would be fun My only problem with this is Melissa Connor. Esse! He's dry! I've seen to pull out a good performance of a block of wood. I was not thinking of him when the director thought. But if you ignore him you can not help but this movie can give a big ten !!!
