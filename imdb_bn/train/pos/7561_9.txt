The version I saw in this movie was the blockbuster rental with the same title, but an oath in it. <br /> <br /> This image was as fun as hell. It was true of the bones. If you've ever spent time in Hollywood or the neighborhood, you can understand humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a play, but it's a drama, as much as a deer Hunter is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Loren Dean is always excellent as a helpful actor. Jamie Kennedy was able to keep her own good. Its performance is especically impressive during the Poodle scene. Carmen Electra was the only negative reason but we can not have everything
