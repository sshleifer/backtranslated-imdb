I saw it in the early 70's (when I was 16 years old), and in spite of a long slow set-up, meetings, riots etc., once the desert section began to fall in all the context and I liked it. (Still, it has been very good age.) Then I think what happens to be a miniature minority. All criticized focusing on action and lack of description seemed. Joyfully I am not this minority. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> grown, and I'm happy about that.
