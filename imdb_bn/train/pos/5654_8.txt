I saw and loved the show 10 years ago !!! I'm grabbing the DVD and watching the series, and I was waiting for the scene in the show (when Lucas faced Gayle in his room) and realized that it was missing - suddenly I was watching the greed without lead up. Then I checked all the BIOS and received comments about the cancellation of the programs. Thanks !!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Some comments "Strangle No. 19 then triangle 20, while the other was beside them, and the opposite of Potato Boy 5, and Dead to World 6. Anyone could explain ?????
