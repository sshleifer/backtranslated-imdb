At the age of 60, I learned that when we see a movie there is an identity (whether we do not want it or not) with a particular character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the character runs a certain gesture, sometimes because the character determines the word, or sentence ?? We use or do we want to use that ?? In a strong situation <br /> <br /> Confused movie, should be seen by this perspective. Who is to find a parking place now ?? In a mall, downtown, or street - which car can not remember the driver that he is not the only driver in the world? <br /> <br /> Who is "Rubber Out" sick psychic spot? <br /> <br /> Hein said, I asked - did you identify with Della (played by Kim Basinger)? If your answer is: Yes!, Then do not try to find stupid details ?? Relatively with the reality of life ?? In the movie, because you definitely will find the movie ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Abstracts created, you'll see that the movie has a startling moment, such as: 1- Holds the lid box in order of trunk tools (the box that has a gun, and does it block holes to use it) ?); 2- Continuously where Terry dies while he dies; 3- According to the series that attracts the pulse by chikira "mermaid call" <br /> <br /> If you've already watched a movie, or if you are planning to watch, keep in mind that there are "realistic" movies, "fiction", "political" "Movies, and the movies in which you can" wash your soul "? For example, we can quote the last example: "Trampa de Elite". <br /> <br /> According to the newspaper, unanimous congratulations when Bopa's officials took a specific view. (As I have seen the movie in the DVD, I could not respond to the audience) <br /> <br /> <br /> From the direction of direction (Susan Manford), Explanation (Kim Basinger, Luca Hah, Craig Schafer, etc.) Version (William M. Andersson ?? 'Dead Cubs Society', 'Green Card'? Exceptional version, 'Robakop 2', etc. It is good in context. 1 (Awful) to 10 (Master Peace), I "When He Was Out" Rate 7 ( Regular).
