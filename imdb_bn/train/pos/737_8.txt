After the punk rock group Ramon's # 1 fan rank playing "Rock NN Roll High School", actress P. J. Soul is not a big star. Seals are so brilliant, you think that he was not too old at high school (the kids who were shown with 24). The film is a fast lullaby which is not a cop-out; Just as everything should fly exactly smithereens, and that should exactly be done. The strange strange and humorous presence, like Marie Bhornov, Nazi-like Principal, gets a bit of a start, a bit of a start, where Friesbase flies dangerously to his head (how many bodies he uses, or was it the ultimate final?) And the best of Day Young Souls , Kate Rambau is very interesting as well. The weakest link, enormously adequate, is the Ramones in this "high school" chain gang. They can not act, they are not funny, and their concert segment is too long. One Ramon song, "I want you to be around", is considered as a fantasy and is well captured; Other accessory songs are good, especially a rare Paul McCartney ballad has been heard at the beginning ("Did we meet somewhere before?"). Great joy *** *** to ***
