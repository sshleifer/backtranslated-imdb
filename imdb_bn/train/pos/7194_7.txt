I rank the best of Zorro chapters. Exciting music score adds punch to play an exciting screen. A wonderful supporting cast and mystery arch that will keep you guessing until the final text. Red Hadle has worked as well as Don Diego. And instead of Ego Zorro Last but certainly at least, Whitney and English great guidelines team.
