I was delighted to see this picture at Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great painter and I would like to see more of her pictures. He could have done what he did with the budget of the film, but I am very worried about seeing what he can do with a big picture. Cast castos for their great acting (that little girl was in gold), and anyone composing music. The war criminal "Your boat" blown me up. Very close creative film .... I really hope to find videos or DVDs because I want to buy it in a second. If you get the chance, you will definitely see this film.
