I understand that many people hate this movie, but I should admit that it is my favorite. I love it well, it's also better than its predecessor and movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think people never give a sense, it's hard to write time travels again, like the future, and in this movie they included Time Travel and a Spiritual Journey. <br /> <br /> I also think Keonu and Alex were the best performers in this film, they are cool, cool, cool, and cool things. <br /> <br /> The set design of this movie is very surprising, the set is quite detailed and massive and it is difficult to believe that this set has been made for both films, teenagers who can rarely spell it ... but the whole franchisee Not genius, it makes the two idiots bigger than the biographies which are responsible for the world's most futile future. <br /> <br /> The clothing costume was as well as awsome. Bill and Ted are actually showing coolness in Bagus' Journey, where they look like their brave courage, just as they keep it, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music of this movie is extraordinary, especially in scores. I can say so much about this picture because I like it. But in these movies I grew up and I liked it every time, so I understand why people think that people hate or just like Bogra than the wonderful intelligence (which I love on the road). <br /> <br /> Find yourself with your own !!!!
