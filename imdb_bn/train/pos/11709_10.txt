Now, everywhere for cinemographic baffe, this movie will not be the top of your list of things. But if you know something about plot development, deep truths and the purpose of this movie (series) you can understand my Pov <br /> <br /> The supposedly authored author of the movie can not expect to know what will happen at the end. But the film has to think about what might be the exact and accurate "horrible" viewer of the Bible. I'm not a Christian, because of this film, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. Movies and possible situations are something that is afraid of thinking about their actions and decisions similar to those described in it. This is not a cheap attempt to fear man in God's way, but a way to get your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian I know that I'm not going back and thanks to films like this, I can appreciate the depth of film appreciation, beyond acting, acting and filming superficialities of filming. This is a movie that you simply can not see but feel with your heart and soul.
