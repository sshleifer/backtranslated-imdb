"Pet committers" are successful in two main situations. First, it's a scary horror movie. Those who are not produced on this day. Second, it's overall a passionate, cute movie. So if you are looking cold, scares, moaning and apparently stunning settings, great acting, dialing, and serious effects; This movie is looking for you. A classic now and really will look for a horror fan. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, one of the best adaptations of King's novels. Events spread slightly more than novels, but this does not mean that the underlying film is a complete horror / dramatic success. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is widely known for being very emotional and terrible at the same time. The film basically assumes that feeling, because a great character is developed and you can feel the loving relationship between its members. Then, when everything seems happier (technically happy, because the title does not give the title "pet semester"!) A tragic event changes into the atmosphere of the movie, it becomes very dark now. The movie has a terrible sense from the beginning, but after the death of Gage, the movie is sad, gray, vague. Dealing with the loss of a child's son is something that can destroy the whole life of a family, and "pet commissions" prove it dramatically. <br /> <br /> Legend behind a pet is a legend that no one wants to feel, but sadness and despair lead to shooting a mentally destructive father. Sadly, the legend comes true and the gage comes back from the baby. The previous encounter with the Pet Semitic legends turned out to be a tragedy but this time it is much worse, much worse. What will happen to the lives of all our American families? Can Pascow prevent this tragedy? What is it with surreal nightmares? <br /> <br /> Check out the "pet seminary" in interviews with the most sensitive, emotional films of recent times. You will not be sorry. Although acting very well I did not dig the actors who painted the father. When he asks for his frustration in situations, he does not seem to be disturbed enough. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby truly delivers a great performance and works perfect as the noble, gentle mother. The baby gaze was amazing even in its unclear parts. * Shivers *. Overall it's the best of all time classic and a dangerous movie that touches the deepest fears of humans ... the loss of your love, the return to the dead and the feeling of despair. <br /> <br /> Certainly something ... I do not want to be buried in a pet sematary !!
