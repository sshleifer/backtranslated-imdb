. . . But it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very unclear. I saw in the first film because I really like to like the movie because I'm a bus driver and at that time I saw this movie, I was driving the model bus. It was only (15 years after the trial of his murder) that I think that OJ was a star among it. I just remembered that he was a driver and shot the bus and fired and was driven wildly. I have not been able to see this movie in the mid-80's. I like the movie, I usually do not see the thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV Guide and at the beginning (though unclear) I look for the whole thing.
