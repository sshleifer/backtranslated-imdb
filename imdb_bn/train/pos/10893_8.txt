One of the best things I've hired in the movie before viewing this rating from the site. This is an amazing movie which I will add to my Christmas selection. Cast surprisingly selected and Ben Affleck plays a good leading role. I will tell the audience who do not want to go ahead and buy the movie. I rate it right up with Christmas Leisure. The movie was very funny and well written and Ben's supernatural-rich executive plays very well. A person who does what he says and does what he does will have to imagine. This movie is much more fun than Santa Claus and Christmas with Crank. Plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of Christmas which you can not buy love with money.
