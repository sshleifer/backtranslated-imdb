For a long time, Red Sox fan, I was just going to watch movies. It was a lot better! There may not be enough live footage from the 2005 Red Sox season miracle, but some of my favorite Red Sox players had some great shots. While filming certainly flashing a chick, it's amazing to have enough baseball footage from the return of the 2004 Red Sox, it's one of my best-ever 10 movies. I enjoyed Red Sox fans, especially in the Ben Baseball family. The scene where Ben will meet with his friends on the draft day to ensure that the seats will be available in certain games! You must see if you are looking for a great movie to meet your spouse, date, or significant other ... especially if you're a baseball fan ... and more especially if you are a Red Sox fan!
