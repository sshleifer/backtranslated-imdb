This is a very funny and sometimes quite weird anthology, that makes the filming department do more for short, acting, positioning and lack of overall excellence. The best episodes of this are Danamel Eliot's first play by a horror writer (a perfect example of playing it as the first actor) directed by a title of his novel; Third, a man with Christopher Leah feared his own daughter and played a key role in his latest project with the legendary John Prentwei as the final climber with the final episode. The talks between Perteau and Ingrid Pitt are amazing and inspiring, both of which clearly enjoy the opportunity to ham! Cushing is generally good in the weakest segment, which certainly does not help the woman's candle in the local wax museum, but it is also believed to be "beautiful", which she believes! Nobody's beauty was needed and instead we were given a woman with a jaw in a turtle. This small film combines and it is considered when you can do a great country house setting.
