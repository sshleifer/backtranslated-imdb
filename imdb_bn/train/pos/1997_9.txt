As a fan of Dickens' lifespan, I've always been frustrated by the adaptation of his novels. <br /> <br /> Although his works recovered the life of Victorian Britons at every stage of Britain, all of them were described as a comedic thread that could be descriptive or satirical. In a way, he was a literary caricaturist and cartoonist. He may be serious and ridiculous in the same sentence. He is proud, proudly proud, foster humble, and empathised by loneliness and poverty. It might be a clich√©, but he was a human writer. <br /> <br /> And this is a comedy which is often missing from its interpretation. While writing, the Oliver Twist is being dramatized in the BBC television serial form. All their sadness and cruelty, but not humorous, ridiculous, and barbarous lighthouses. The result is simply a dark, uncomfortable experience: stories written by a journalist instead of a novelist. This is not really Dickens. <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Oliver!', on the other hand, near the mark. The official's mockery is fully explained from blustering beadle to drunken drug. The classic stand-off between Biddle and Mr. Brownlow, in which the law was described as 'ass, idiot', could not be done better. Harry Secombe is an ideal choice. <br /> <br /> But there are also dark clutches, the state is presented lazy apathy, cold, hunger, poverty and loneliness just as the master wishes to <br /> <br /> and then there is a crime. Ron Moody is a treasure as a miraculous Jewish fence. Bill Sykes has the full complement to Oliver Red. <br /> <br /> Perhaps not surprisingly, Lennon Bert himself gained independence from a former Jewish Jew - Fagin, reinforcing him as a more modest colleague compared to Dickens's origin. In the novel, he was completely cruel, sending some boys to hang for his own son (although he was caught and executed). When he presented something like a virtual father-film in the film, rather than children's corruption, rather than a rich thief, the long-standing anti-Semitic feeling for the long time. Otherwise, Dickens has very little independence with the original. All of the most memorable elements are included. For the child's sensitivity, only enough danger and violence are maintained in order to ensure the faithfulness of the book at the same time. Nancy still beat badly, Bulesey sinking sank, and Bill Sykes gets a credible graphic rotation. <br /> <br /> Each song is excellent, although they flush toward schmaltz. Mark Lester has his wonderful mimes. His and my favorite scene are both of which will make 'universal' alive. It's wonderful, but it's through Dickens and through. <br /> <br /> I could go. I could appreciate the wonderful set pieces, rich and poor in contrast. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, twist it with your Christmas dinner. No original has been well-realized.
