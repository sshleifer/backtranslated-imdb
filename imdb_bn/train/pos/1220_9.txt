The source of beer and their cousins. If you have seen the original movie then you will notice an inconsistency. Instead of meeting cousins, they are raised with care bears. However, there is no problem with me, films like to be considered as separate explanations. Children are fun and fun to see and play them in the game. My favorite swift is the heart rabbit. The villain is a delightful menacing shapeshifter. I can sympathize with three kids because I was never good at sports. Cree summer is as nice as Christ. The song is sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love toys or enjoy the original, it will not be missed. 9/10
