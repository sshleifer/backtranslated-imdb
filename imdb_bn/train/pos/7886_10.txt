All right, I'm a fan of the nightmare series and everyone here says it's the worst! But it is not !!! Did not you see Freddy's revenge ??? WTF! That was all bad !!! Now this movie is quite beautiful and it takes the story of Freddy and it was cool that she had a girl etc. <br /> <br /> And then I find that it's 3-D! I was very excited, when I saw this in the DVD box set, I quickly went to the 3D sequences. Lisa Janet's hands, Dream Demons, Freddy Clo (multiple times), Leslie Dean a knife, Lisa Zen, baseball bat, Doc's hand, Freddy's head blast, there were many things in the 3-D. <br /> <br> I really like this movie because it was in 3D, but I want that the entire movie is not the last 15 minutes in 3-D. <br /> <br /> The way it is not 15 minutes is not !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
