It is frustrating for Gandhi to make a movie in India, in which she does not see any person who can not make a mistake. This film shows that any Mahatma fails to be a suitable father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> Performance is awesome, cinematography is fantastic, the side is fantastic, but the film is frustrating. If this movie is made without the expectation of a box-office, then I'm going here, it's a brilliant attempt, but if the makers expect it to be commercially successful, then the fate of the movie will destroy the day they choose it. <br /> <br /> From now on for 20 years, this film will be remembered by Akshay Khanna for Harilar's brilliant screenplay. He is deserving of such an Oscar nomination ... and, indeed, his praise is not the only act, Shefali shadow is horrible. <br /> <br /> See the scene where Harill heard of his father's death. No dialogue, no screams, but a stupid shot by the screams. This is sometimes one of the best scenes in cinematic history. <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my father is always exciting movie but yes, its excellent movies and must be kept in mind. Great effort
