In 2003-2004 I saw several cold episode in the beginning of season 1 episode in a few years. And most of the time, this special episode is not only the best of the best, but there are some rivals in the Emmy divisions. Although someone does not agree with the content of the story (ie male-to-male romantic relationship), I doubt that anyone can see it without moving deep into their souls. <br /> <br /> The story was originally based on testimony from a dead drug dealer, that was re-opened. Two central actors, two police officers named Shan Kuop (Ur, cold-murder victim, his last name, Kuop) and his partner Jimmy Bruno, two police officers in 1960, two police officers. <br /> <br /> In the story, the Kuo singles, a Vietnam war vet, a deeply disturbed past. Jimmy, but married, with little kids. Both are partners in police forces and not just friendships, but secret romantic relationships, both of whom must have been deeply and clearly concealed from homophobic culture at that time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now with color bits, then black and white are mostly and then sprinkle throughout. For example, their red squad car, with a brightly colored screen in the gymroom bedroom window, where Jimmy's wife woke up coup and Jimmy, and then kissed each other while alcohol-induced. I found that only the selected items were colorful in the flashback view, black and white everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the baptism of Jimmy, Kopp had an important emotional scene while facing his father. In this scenario, Cuong's father, Sir, who is a respected colleague, confronted Kuup about the rumors surrounding Kuop's relationship with Jippe. Anyone can feel sorry for Kuopo, Kope's father was shy on shame and disrespectful coup - "You do not insult our family ... and you are not my son too." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He wanted more, and once Jimmy could show tension in the face, because he would have to choose between his wife and children, his church, and his cruel devotion to the coup. <br /> <br /> Jimmy finally escaped from Kuopo, at the same time At Coop I can not understand both of his family. Sadly, Kuop is probably killed due to his relationship with Jimmy, but he has also been killed in drug trafficking and police death due to corruption. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene During the whole episode, when the coup was being wounded by gunshot wounds in his squad, his partner could calmly calm his partner on his radio radio. Shaw said: "Jimmy ... we were lucky. Do not forget that. "<br /> <br /> The soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with actor Chad Everett, still playing tragic Jimi, now older than he is, and obviously still lost his ex-partner Kopp. <br / > <br /> I recommend this episode and think it's the best. I have never seen without any doubt that the best writing of all the cool episodes, good non Control, and well done.
