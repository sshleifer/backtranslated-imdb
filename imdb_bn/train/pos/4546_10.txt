This film will fall down in history, as is the case with the citizens, Casablanca and on the Waterfront. Satisfy someone to make a sign in Leco! Leno and Murita do not see a comedy couple, which looks like Abbott and Costello. Chris Sarandon, Tom Nunan, and Randall "Tex" emanates from Kobe that will give you cold chills. Dingman's character is back in Shakespeare's Comedy Days, like Buffoff's Wife. And the mountains. My goodness, Climax. I will not destroy it for you, but it makes the Death Star Pale blast more than that. If you can track the hard-to-find make-up, you should help yourself and your family and buy it immediately. I'm still hoping for a special edition DVD one on this day.
