I apologize for this movie only: There are many wide-angle close-ups, and if they bother you with patience too much. They carry me for the first ten minutes or Burmese. But then I created a kind of debate with terrible cinematography; And before the film ended, I took care. This is a comedy easily destroyed. It is ridiculous, it is malignant, all cast comic delivery is faulty, and although in most cases Usha is cool in her characters, lice in the fish-eyed lens - she can not take care of them much more - they lead them to present them with warmth. The 'mystery man' is, in fact, not only flexible, but more intriguing, but deeper, since someone thinks credit for it. For example, Austin Powers film Jokes, and here's less fun than Jokes, but also more teeth. When bites of 'Night Man' bites, some bite and become soft. It's not just any old thing to cheat. Because of this, critics have said that, unlike some (which should be treated as negligence), it never goes out of the ideas. <br /> <br /> 'Super Hero' is an interesting bunch. Sure, they are the second rate, but they just do not have second rates. For example, the Blue King does nothing except touching people, and this is not good for him. On the other hand, he is not comically bad. He is better than most people in his limited field, and he practiced diligence. He is not a buffoon, which makes him a much more funny character than him. If Superman is a Christ in a Cape, all the small glory of the caps from the footsteps of the mystery male Mount Olympus. A lot of fun; Many more respected.
