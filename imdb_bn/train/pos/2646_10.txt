I think most people do not get the right idea about the film, at least it's my opinion. I'm not sure that this is a movie about drug abuse; Rather, it is a film about the idea of ​​that gifted brother, the side effects of drugs, somewhat limited. Again, this is not a commercial movie that you see every day, and if the writer wanted it, he must have failed, because most people think that this is one of the most drug-related movies. I think, somehow, otherwise Like many movies depicting different cultures, audiences generally understand movies of their own culture filming, as they grew up and they were well-known. This movie shows what "gifted" people often think and they face problems. Why they work because they have become bored over their minds :) They will meet their intermediaries and they will accept those things as if they are launching the space shuttle on a daily basis. They start a fairly difficult job and in no time Excel. They think - I went to work, did nothing, yet when they were in my project all the time there was twice as good as the son around me, now what should I do with my free time? And what's more annoying? When you can start predicting behavior as a psychologist, instead you have seen this pattern in the past. So, on behalf of them, it is a challenging task, which is sometimes annoying, and from others they begin to convey the behavior of human beings. It's a recipe for big frustration. And this is usually the cruel thing to find in this state. The person who earlier mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to find out the reasoning (reasoning argument), even though life is not actually a logical thing, it is actually quite right.
