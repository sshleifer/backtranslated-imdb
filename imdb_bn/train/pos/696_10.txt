Wonderfully done well for an independent film, Insomniac's nightmare draws an amazing picture that suffers from insomnia. Well written and guided, it creates a dream atmosphere, because the viewer is taken into the life of uncertainty overnight. <br /> <br /> Calling Dominic Monghan as Jack, what we saw as a long time dragged on a lonely night. The description is almost hypnotizing, and from the opening line, it is impossible to counter it. Sunny and a little annoying, it shows how someone stands with sleep deprivation, maintaining balance on the fork in the softness and the madness. <br /> <br /> Walks around every corner, Insomniac's nightmare provocative and engaging. It is highly recommended.
