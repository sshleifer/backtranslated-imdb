Although highly recommended by my family members, I have never really seen this program before. Interestingly, my girlfriend lived in Hadfield (photo position) and during the first visit she mentioned some landmarks. <br /> <br /> This is going to my interest so I bought the first series in the video to watch the clock. In addition to some recognition of the position, I did not find myself at least bits. Once again, the BBC is responsible for creating one of the best comedy in the world. Toggle easily reach there with the Red DARF, the Fawlie Tower and Monty Python. <br /> <br /> I'm in the program now. The characters exhibit fantastic and unusual abnormal depth while maintaining a rigid realistic edge. The appearance and feel of the program reflects the perfect and sometimes silent feeling of the answer. (There is no inhumanity in Hadfield, which I found quite comfortable and warm places). <br /> <br /> I just hope that it is based on the originality of its run (based on the second round that ends its reconciliation in the United States last night) <br /> <br /> Well done by BBC !!
