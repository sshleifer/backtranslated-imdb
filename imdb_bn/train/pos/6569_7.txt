"Jake Speed" is a fine movie with a wonderful message. It certainly has its flaws. At times it's a little slow. It introduced its villain too far in the story. It is paced at a snail's heartbeat rate. It's a Z-grade cast (although I've always admired the work of Karen Kopins, who are in good shape with Sara Bullock's straight letter). <br /> <br /> It's all going to be "Jake Speed", really inspirational, thanks to Wayne Crowford (who plays the title role) and a lavish script for Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why am I finding so inspirational? Because it told me, "Hey, why not try to be a good man." <br /> <br /> The story is essentially "unfamiliar at the strange land", which is good and heroic Jack speed bad things put in the real world where good people happen. Jack is more of a boy scout. He is more than a knight in the firearm armor. Jack speeds up hopeful patron saint in a messy, average and evil world. <br /> <br /> Because of that "jockey speed" really need to be a hit. This is a great message that should be acquired in Hollywood and then the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a film industry that shocks itself to portray good and honest people. I'm not saying that we see Walton in every theater of Cyniplex, but it would be good if there were some other films like "Jake Speed". (Comparatively compared to what can be done to highlight American entertainment, a television show "Die South," about Canadian Mountaineer.) <br /> <br /> Of course, "Jack Speed" has violence, blood and guns , But the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person, you will always lose the power of evil. 10/14/99
