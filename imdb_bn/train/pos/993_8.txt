Actually this movie was not so bad. It contains action, comedy and tension. In this film, good actors like Doug Hutchinson ("The Green Mile" to Percy), who plays Bristol. Another famous actor Jamie Kennedy, "Scream" and "Three Kings" The main characters played Jamie Fox as Alvin, who was quite good and funny, but who was most surprised at me, was David Morshed Edgar Clintin. In other movies such as "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Landlieers", he was a very sympathetic person and was very good to see, in contrast with the dramas of dramatic plays, a man without any emotion. The only negative thing about this movie is that several pictures of the World Trade Center, which looks at this film perhaps a little dated. Overall I had a pretty good little film on this!
