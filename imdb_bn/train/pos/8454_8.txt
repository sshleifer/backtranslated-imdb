The second option is the story of the Gundam universe (the first is G-Gundam), another different view of the gundam wing gundam verse. Known components are available, but Thunder Wing is actually different after his opponent. The bulk of the gangsters are not the only organization more than terrorists. Frankly speaking, the series will not really be a fight of war until the Part 7, but the true conflict will not happen until the next phase of the Eve Eve War. <br /> <br /> The most positive of this series is the letter. All the major characters have swelled up to 49 episodes and you can truly sympathize with each of their roles. Another great plus series of great character and May Cha Design Due to the design, some other bullying opponents were shy. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms of this series is that the UC fans claim that the actual UC Sea is a whip. Why Gundam Wing gets this rumor when there is more clear UC clones of bullet seeds out of me too. Indeed many moments have been lifted but they have been called in new ways and there are different differences. For example, Compare Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Four Aznable's normal. Throughout the series, the Zach Alliance and the Oz on the other hand were stuck, when the red comet was Zion's burning symbol. Another big difference is that James has lost many soldiers under his command, so his first nickname he gave in the first episode: "The killer of his own men". Char is not given this label. <br /> <br /> Problems with this series are not the jumbu, but two problems. Animation footage of the first gundam attack repeated animation footage. Heavy weapons weapons, tanks, MSs, and planes are having fun with the first time. But its fourth reuse scene is out of date. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole series will be held throughout the year. If you really think about all the events emerging from the series, only a single year will happen a lot. <br /> <br /> I guess you can easily cancel this information when you ignore these first lines. According to it, perhaps it's a great role in the world of gundam story and gundam in the universe. Finally, this was the first hooter Anime in the air on American television.
