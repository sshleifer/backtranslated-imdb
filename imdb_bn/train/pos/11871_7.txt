Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian de Palma, Scarface easily forget to paint a picture. Al Pacino Torne has become a stunning performance in Montana, who became a strong player in the Cuban Refugee Drug World, because he has deliberately managed his self-reliant state for Florida crime. This gangster Flickr is a strict, violent, strong, rough, unpleasant, and must hold the record for the word "F-K" at most times. About three hours long, and yes it can get boring. A cruel heart is a ruthless crime in the constitution that puts you in cheering your seats for the death of the Lord. <br /> <br /> is also playing attractive character Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar Passino proved to be the greatest of its generation. He managed to bring the reality of his character, which gave a strong impression. Do not leave a thought for you that you went away from a disaster for a movie for this. Is that powerful enough for you? Do not pay a long time for the crime!
