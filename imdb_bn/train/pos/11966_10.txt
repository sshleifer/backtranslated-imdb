This is a nice series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be a part of your family. This family sets a great example of making each other aware and helping each other through their crisis, should we live our lives the same way. They work very well and like many bad things, but they do not turn their families behind, they work through problems. Michelle, little girl, I saw the most perfect thing. Middle girl Stephanie, suffering from middle child syndrome and with the help of everyone in the family, it is good. DJ, the oldest daughter, whether her father wants to happen or not. They all share a thing they miss their mom. Danny (Father), Joey, and Aunt Jesse love these kids, and it is clear in every episode.
