Halloween is a boy story which was misunderstood as a child. He presented his problems to his elder sister, whom he killed at the beginning of the film. This is just the beginning of things coming from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays doctor teaching myers over the years. He knows that something different to him, mysteriously evil things. This temple will be no more and it can not be stopped. <br /> <br /> After fleeing from an institution, Maya stays with her younger sister. If he kills her, then this misunderstanding may end the pain of the boy. But there is a problem in getting rid of his sister when other people are on the way. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But all this one, sort of start it. If you think about it, all the horrific movies that we remember are Freddy Kr√ºger or Jason, behind half of the naked girls. Well, if it was not for halloween, those letters did not hate our dreams when we were children. <br /> <br /> The director of Halloween got much more from the horror film of John Carpenter's 50s. And he mixed what he knew in a film, which was afraid of hell from many people in the late 1970's. These pictures strengthened him as a director to see and started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who performed the girl immersing herself in a masked assassin. <br /> <br /> This picture may seem like today, but then there was not much like this back there. It has been copied from and ripped off, but Halloween will always have quintessential teenage horror movies. We still look behind the other prey hunter Michael Myers when he gives rock to hear Carpenter's thrilling music.
