This is your usual delightful and colorful MGM music since the beginning of '50 and it's certainly better to see there. <br /> <br /> Director of the film, General Vincent, has acted as the director of the mineral and the lead lead Jean Kelly. Those days back in both quite a few movies together, which is probably this one of their most known. The movie was originally won by the Oscars of the year, meaning "a place in the sun", "a street named designer", "African Queen", "Kwa Wadis", "The Blue Vill" That year's "Cellsman of Death" is a real achievement, but at the same time there is a lot of credit for this fun, bright and entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When you see this movie, Everyone will be entertained, which is also the beautiful color of the movie and thanks to many beautiful characters in this film, musical numbers are also done nicely when people like Vincent Mennini and Jean Kelly are working. <br /> <br /> But Actually, what has been said in this movie could not be tried for an hour or more? I mean, where is the movie going?  ে তা আমরা ইতিমধ্যেই জানি কিন্তু এখনো যত তাড়াতাড়ি সম্ভব এটি সবাইকে প্রসারিত করতে পরিচালিত করে। এটি কোনও অংশে মুভি টেনে তোলে না, এটি কেবল এটিকে একটু বেশি করে তোলে। মুভিটি অবশ্যই কয়েকটি কম বাদ্যযন্ত্র সংখ্যার সাথে সম্পন্ন করা যেতে পারে। <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
