The best thing about this movie is it's fun. It is full of ridiculous character and interesting situations, starting with Blythe, innocent picker (uploaded by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything in daily life. Packer's friend Matt ("he is a thief, but he is really a nice guy"), Piker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovered life in a statue of Virgin Mary in her room. <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The film makes a point that how much money can be given on a daily basis, and it is successful in making this issue without having too much interference. Creating messages about "normal people" value and dignity always has a risk, which slides toward the "Greater than You" reverse - but "Packer" avoids these snares, allowing viewers to give points. For visitors, compared to this sound, the breathing room has a lot to compare with its own thinking. <br /> <br /> I recommend most funny pictures because it's so much fun
