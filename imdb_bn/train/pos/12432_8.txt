I'm hoping to be the same type of critic as the previous Modest Blues movie, so I kept it unknown for so long, but I was very happy. <br /> <br /> It was a thought-provoking analysis that could lead to a beautiful girl's nails, with stupid gunfights and car / boat movement, which was not too much or extra reasonable. This is probably the budget constraints that actually helped with it: Less time and effort was spent on finding stupid ways of stunting men for stunt men, and more films were dedicated for viewing. Hell, the biggest gun comes out of the war screen - and the view that is heard better than the background, which adds to that mystery - who is winning? Who's going to die? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nicholas Costa-Waldo Blood was the perfect choice for the bad guys. The character that made it look attractive and enjoyable - even favorite (and I suspect that I would consider accepting as many barbarians, psychological killers as drinking friends). I can not remember the Hollywood "ex-waiter" single that it could close the role well. Fortunately, Blay's Baddies always die, in the end (there are no spoilers!) That's really a good thing, because those girls can spend time exhausting their time and swooning on interesting Hong Kong, now pragmatically our common Can settle for Jess.
