It was a wonderful film. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. There were so many things, so beautiful pictures, and there was so much compassion in what has not been said. I was completely entertained, and I was left with a feeling of tender excitement, just as I finished the story of Tom Robin. Now I have not read this special book of Robin, so how do I meet now, but I can not imagine that this film can be a very bad explanation. The film has left a lot to define for you, which is the best part of a Tom Robins novel, dreaming of details. <br /> <br /> Those who said this were the worst movies of all time, I want to stay away from the light of your heart. This movie was not the most important. Long crane buses long
