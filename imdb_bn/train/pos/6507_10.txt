This series, perhaps following the events of World War II, is worth more than the critique of criticism of any person on the scale of prices on the price scale produced at the most effective time. <br /> <br /> During World War II in 1974, the events of war spread to the extent of three decades, allowing the remaining expansive campaigns and slots to properly related events related to occasional incidents. Allow people involved in crossing 30 years to back up by an impressive and impressive Panolini, which is going to bear testimony to the countless inhuman civil qualities of some of the field soldiers, civilians and survivors of death camps among the most military and political figures. At most approaching or senior years, interviewers had enough time to reflect on their experience, and in most cases there was enough time to preach enough, which had been frustrating before the past, leaving only memories. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Names like Gertrude Zenz (personal secretary of Hitler) ... are far too long to join the list. <br /> <br /> Today, young people in the lives of survivors of this huge reading of the terrible value of political ambitions speak of the campaign of similar military and nationalist war led by WW2. We should include the main foundation of a compulsory history topic in the DVD series discussed here, that day should not have been lost reading lessons at such an awesome cost but those who do not see the first hand should take the heart of the terrible value. <br /> <br /> I saw almost 11 disc sets, often seen mostly in the series when local TV channels have promoted it for more than 10 years. It has lost any of my mood, in fact, some dark days of humanity have become a great chronicle. <br /> <br /> The highest possible rating seems to not be applicable to this presentation. . I crossed the value count of this series.
