Eddie Murphy's Undignity Undoubtedly, I have the most fun things ever seen in my life. About two years ago when I first saw it, I used to sew for a few weeks. Till today I saw it 17 times more and I still smile at my ass every time. For those who did not challenge Eddie Morphy before those who were a Holivie Superstar. Unlike Eddie Murphy's raw, which was released in 1987, it is not a dull spot in a gifted piece that gets flattened in the middle. If you are not like a person who can not take an oath, I will not recommend it to you because perhaps you will hear the oath of some form every 5-10 seconds. I've paid 10 out of 10 because it shows their greatest great comic talent.
