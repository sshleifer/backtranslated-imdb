Why people are so annoyed and do not pan the movie! People should remember, this is a SNL movie, something that is not considered unpredictable and original on the plot or side! The Ladies Man is a ridiculous film, though sometimes stupid, though cast out an abstract and wonderful performances like Will Ferrell and Tim Mounds. Yes some joke is stupid, and yes, the characters are incredible but his comedy! I do not really understand how I can not laugh a lot during this sunny photo. However, what I say is that people accept it as a - an SNL, stupid and stupid comedy. Nothing that awards awards, but nevertheless, some modern comedy gold. "10-4 annoying!"
