I think the dark angel is great! The first season was excellent, and there was a good plot. Maxstore tries to adapt to a normal living, but still "Jack the World" as X (5) as the counter-X-5 with Jackieka Alba. And the series which has been hunted by manticore across the season gives some extra spice. <br /> <br /> The second season suddenly became a bit odd when compared to the first. Plot kindergarten disappeared, and the series lost its minimal attraction because of the presence of most weird "animals". Do not make mistakes if the second season is not good, but a little bit of "mottores". However, they were able to get back a new pledged plot in the last phase of season 2, in which I had the hope to see more. <br /> <br /> So I really like that they could start making new episodes. And with this James Cameron behind this could not be wrong. So as a conclusion I would say it's a great series, but I'm still waiting for the third episode!
