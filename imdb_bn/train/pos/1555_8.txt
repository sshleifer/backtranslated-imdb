After watching the WW1 spy thriller this afternoon, Madame Lily (1969) starred Andrew Andrew in TV this afternoon, I suddenly thought that I saw a lot more WW1 spy thriller. I could remember that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. It only took a short search of IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor. Once I came back to flood the memories recognized in the title. This is a reasonably furnished story for its time, a realistic storytelling of the death of Quiker and the real culprits like the 1918 German criminals. This is a female spy which is much more reliable than Julie Andrews! Like other critics, there were men and horses on well-fought battle scenes and gas masks of the first and strong memory. If you are interested in war films and especially WW1, then if you have a chance, this is a good movie.
