Fourth John (Paul Verhevien - Netherlands 1983). <br /> <br /> A movie based on Gerard Rave's novel, which works best as a thriller. It is very surprising that Revex often needs about 100 pages for a minor plot, and when I read his work, my mind is drawn to my mind. <br /> <br /> "Fourth Male" is the highest on symbolism. Paul Veronan is generally very concerned with proving something to the most adversarial critics and I'm sure he is trying to prove exactly what he is trying to prove. He generally underestimates his audience and tells his story in an unrealistic way that he quickly gets separated from the main idea or storyline and often thinks what needs to be seen on the screen and what remains to be left. The "fourth person" is not as clear as the details of the plot about sex and nudity (in which there are a lot), but like most of his movies, he thinks that the audience will not get it and the story with the overt symbol will increase the hand of the house some supposedly frustrating nudity And mix graphic sex scenes. There is no scene except sex or full nudity, most of it is very tragic, and it damages another good story in your mouth. However, when you can deal with Verneau's superb clear view, it is an interesting thriller thriller, especially in Thom Hoffman and Zerain Crab, especially with some plotter plaster twists and good performances. <br /> <br /> Camera Aspura --- 7/10
