"Party Girl" pays the splendid charm of Parker Pazzy. Actually, the film seems to be a car, in which Mrs. Pozy permits herself to live a normal life. <br /> <br /> Image is a treat for fans of Mrs. Posey, directed by Daisy von Skeller's Girl. Mr. Verne Sherlocker Mayer takes a wild trip to Manhattan to show our useless soul, whose life he is constantly dedicated to fun at various clubs. This is an era which is still much more similar to that area and nearby Mata Bazar district. At least, there is no tendency in movies and we see people who are taking their life in a natural way, if we can call it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because of Parker Pose, we enjoy the movie rather than acting to another actress Maryam. She's full picture. Cast the rest is better.
