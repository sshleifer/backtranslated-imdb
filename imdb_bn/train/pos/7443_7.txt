An old saying "If you think that you have problems, then go to a hospital." It has been updated in recent years "If you think that you have problems then watch TV talk talk ... especially for Jerry Spring!" This movie is so bad that it's a good, it's good! That's why I made it seven - but not right. This is a great way to waste 95 minutes, as daily talk shows are not announced as "one hour of your life you will never come back!" All the familiar themes here ... unreliable husband / boyfriend, the most wild visitors of television, wild women flashing etc. Shawkari saw Molly Hagen, who usually played Sweet Characters ("SafeField" and "Harmon's Head"). Trailer-Trash Maem and Jaim Pressley ("My name is Earl") are equally trashy girls, with whom they have sexual orientation for almost every person. The men (including the staff producer) are presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserve to get them. I do not want to loot or publish everything, but the movie can play like every day event. Here in Phoenix, it is shown back-to-back every morning for two hours and after that, everything else appears to be pale. Again, I made this movie seven days ... it's not good but cool. Jerry Springer is taking the best one-hour dose.
