About a year ago I finally gave up American television. A friend living in England showed me several programs, including offices, extras, blacksmiths, and the league of gentleman, until I thought of leaving the entire television. Then I decided to switch to British television. Among all the groups listed above, The League of Gentleman is easily surrounded by the most dark and all of them, providing a smile and material that I have not seen yet another comedy that I have seen. Characters are among the most unexpectedly married couples, a Butcher which puts uncertain (perhaps, for the best) material of meat, a couple who oversees a local shop that only supplies to local people and the worst veterinarian. This is the best one I have seen.
