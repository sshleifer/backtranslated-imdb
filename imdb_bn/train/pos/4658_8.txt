Talk to a dream cast - two most wonderful actors, who were ever present anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - "Hot Millionaire", Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Neighart, have played a fun, playful comedy. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and stays in Malen's strong movement - the mind of self-confidence in mind. It's not smooth sailing; He attracted the company's rival's attention to the company run by Neihat, and his neighbor Maggie Smith (who knows him at his residence in another name) became a short-term secretary. He can not keep a job and he is seen throughout the film, all of them being expelled. When Nihat gave him progress, he covered Apinov in his flat for cover, but soon both of them decided to become ready for each other. Of course, he did not know Ustinov a crook. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie - you can not help but Ustinov and Smith love and Ustinov's strategy, his talents, and he slithers out of trouble. But the end of a wrapper that shows you that's really the brain. Do not miss this movie, set '60 in London. It's only valuable to hear the cry of Maggie Smith, "I've been dismissed."
