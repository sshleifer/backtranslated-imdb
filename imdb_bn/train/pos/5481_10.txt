To me it is a more awake call, and perception that we mostly see, hear, read, and think, it depends on the media that gives us back. It is a wonderful example of high-level spin doctors trying to control the public through controlled information. This is an excellent example of how purchased in their constitution independently, this media will not be affected by the control or any false information. It is again seen that the needs of many people will be higher than the needs of some people at the end of the day. It is not a difficult task to implement such a illumination which is not seen in any religious civil war.
