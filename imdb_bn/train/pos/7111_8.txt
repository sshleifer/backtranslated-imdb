*** Spinners *** First WWII Films is coming out of Hollywood, which shows how this war influences GI's influence, or in this case US Marines, who fought in it. <br /> <br /> 21-year-old Al-Schmid, John Garfield, started earning $ 40.00 a week with Local Steel Mill and daughter Ruth Hartley, Alenor Parker for $ 40.00 a week, whom she was going to marry when Japs Forget everything, and attack US Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor and similarly millions of Americans Al America joined the Marine Corps in the United States, and hoped to return to the Jups' intelligence back to expectations that Marines would be the first American war unit to crack down on them. <Br> <br /> Al finally got his chance when his unit, 1st Marine Division, landed on Guadalcanal of Solomon Island on August 7, 1942, and the Japanese appointed Japanese under their control. During the Battle of Elu, al almost single handed Japanese Japanese army stopped the invasion, with the help of machine guns, until the end of the surrender, or after surrender, waves of wave after wave of suicidal attacks were poured. It was confronted by a jap grenade during the bloody war, which blinded him. <br /> <br /> Now a navigator in the state capital is moving to a hospital, something more difficult to overcome albeit then attacking a battalion-shaped attack of Japanese or German soldiers. He faces a future where he can not see again and do not rely on him to depend on others! <br /> <br /> As we can see in the film "Marine of Pride" al-war makes it difficult, he came to Guadalcanal Japanese soldiers only on the condition of his disability. I do not want anyone, especially his girlfriend Ruth, the feeling of sorrow for him, actually, that really feels sorry for anyone else in the movie. It is the navy nurse Virginia Pofifor, Rosemary Decamp and Roth, with the help of American marine friend Lee Diamond, Dan Clarke, to finally face the same power of his lightning face, after the encounter with the waves, the Japanese army on the warehousing channel. A courageous al thought that he had returned to Hell from hell in the South Pacific region. <br /> <br /> Based on the true story of US Marine Sergeant Albert Schmid's "Marine of Pride", we showed what we wanted to expect. Thousands of injured US soldiers are coming back from the war. When we left something like al-Shamid behind the battlefield, we saw how difficult it was for many people who fought in the fight during the war. Al's war was difficult with his personal giants, so the Japanese were part of the war, and thus had to fight to defeat them and ultimately defeat them. Despite the help received from both the nurses Virginia and her girlfriend Ruth and her naval-actor Gregory Peck, there is a similarity with the identity-she still faces the threat she is facing al-ups to overcome. The voice which he and only he had both fought and overcome, as he said to everyone in the movie, everyone was by himself.
