A great story based on a young black man and a true story about all the difficulties along the road. This is Denzel Washington's first movie which he is going to manage himself, I must admit that I was a skeptic, but who would not? But then again, he was a great actor with years of experience in the year, and the end result has turned great. The story is said in a wonderful way, which gives you problems during your childhood and the problems of young adults, seeing yourself in that situation. So, it hurts you hard, telling you that not going to hell alone. After all, a tactful story about a young man trying to do this in the f *** ed-up world. (The story was born based on Antoshon Fischer's life, born August 1969 in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, who was the author of this film) strongly recommended. 8/10
