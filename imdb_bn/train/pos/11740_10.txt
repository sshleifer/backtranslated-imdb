Critics do not specifically disable this film, especially artistic Fortis, who do not require a relative. It's a great car of Abbott and Costello's theater or more recently Don Knots. It does not shake the world or forever will change the movie. What will it do? The most important thing is that when all is said and done. Watch this movie and forget your troubles. It even has an easy and kind moral message of an extra charge. When I was living in L'Ely, I always loved the TV show in Tel Aviv. Vampira did not steal his sticky fact from Vampi even more. This is the kind of mythological character that makes it the best; And Cassandra Petersen does it well. Long live the lavira; We need more of these types of movies. Not enough. The villain William Morgan Shepard was also excellent. He exudes a surprisingly refined malice. I could find no technical fault Death penalty is as shameless as the industrial form gets. My deep congratulations to the director, James Cynorlie and all his crew.
