I first saw this movie years ago and I have a chance to see it several times a year. It's my list of favorite movies with something classic. Someone will tell you that it's stupid or old, ignoring them ... This movie is the one who laughs and enjoys music. Dancing through comedy and acting is so important that dance is not important among these great movies. If you can see this movie, it may be light but it is still very fun. So I know that many people hate black and white films, they think old movies may not really be fun, this film has to change their mind. I do not know that anyone can see this image at least silently without being surprised. The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire singing without dance. He may be a great actor and capable singer but it is not only interesting and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. The comedy sometimes gets a bit of clich√©, but G. Burns and G. Allen's VoodooVillex performance can be perfect for the piece and satisfied to find some simple smiles. Even if you do not like old movies, this movie is a chance, this film can make a laughable appeal to anyone.
