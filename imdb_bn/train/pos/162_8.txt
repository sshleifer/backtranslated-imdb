For a "no budget" movie this thing stone. I do not know if America likes it, we laugh at all the ways. Some really fun stuff. Really non-Hollywood <br /> <br /> hits the actor and the music. Cars and gags and even crack your staff off your face. Whoa ho! <br /> <br /> I have seen some actors before, but nothing like that, one or two of them, I think I saw it commercially or elsewhere. Basically it rocked! Thankfully I found a copy from a friend of the actors.
