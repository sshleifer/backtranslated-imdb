I recently saw this on a wire channel. Movie is great; It's a shock of the few musical ones I saw that are shy away from light and dark. It also illustrates some of the splendor of age along with several squalor. Set piece of dance sequence is something going on, I do not know where to look the next. One day I will go to the big screen and see, okay so I can see what's going on. But in reality it turns to another level, the performance of Oliver Reid as Bill Sykes. There is not just a thoroughly average and menacing man but there is something else, some inner demons. He impressed me that if you hit him in the corner, he was able to do something. The character of the Sykes was on the verge of madness, only waiting for the trigger. I saw Robert Newton's Bill Sykes from the 1948 film, and I thought he was just a 'bad' egg, but the performance of Oliver Reid scared me in my own living room.
