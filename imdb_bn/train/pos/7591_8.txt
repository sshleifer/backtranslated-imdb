The style is a mess, but it is based primarily on the inspiration of Stephen Chor's mash-ups for its inspiration. Magic Kung-Fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and some rodee melody for topping. Production is excellent and fast pacing so this film is so easy to find many errors. <br /> <br /> A child is abandoned by a basketball court. A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery, which is in the middle of the city, with a special Kungfu manual that the homeless man can not read in any way. The old monk teaches the boy, but his expiration ends when he tries to master the special technique. The school is received from a fake Kung Fu master, to whom four fools help the beggar. The new 20-month-old boy becomes crazy to get hurt by fifty fifty of his master and throw him out for the night. The boy threw a basket from the incredible distance from the basket, that he was playing dart and brought him to the gangster club. It leads to a big battle, expels the boy from the monastery and decides to make the boy a basketball basketball basketball. <br /> <br /> This happened in the first 20 minutes and most of it happened. The first 10 minutes Along with the extreme short band, the first problem is that how far we know the main character, until we go to the movie. The boy who uses the boy is more intensely defined after the first third is over. This plot does not follow any new ground except the film's insane workforce. I'm sure that you can easily imagine how the fans of Vicky fans will look at the end. Effects, photography and stunt work are all on top and are created for uninspired intrigue. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chawk has given better guidance to writing plot and comedy, and this picture will live in its shade, but it is not a good reason to ignore it. It's pretty entertaining even with a scatter-shot finish. Recommended.
