Girlfight is like your grandmother's cooking: you've tried millions of the same old recipe, even though something has changed in the new and new things soon. Explain the story of those who have not seen it before and explain: A young woman trying to improve her situation while dealing with the increasing attraction of a bitter, obstinate father and her male rivals from the wrong side of the track. . Roll their eyes on the clutch string, and they're okay: it * clich√©d. Even so, how well the film works, I often became fascinated because of the unusual acting and dialogue and the sensitive aspect that makes it 'new'. I avoided it in the movie because it was a full whip but I did not make the same mistake. Definately worth a look.
