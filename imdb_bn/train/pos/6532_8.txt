I think the reason for creating this movie ... and we should target the gamers who actually play all the Nancy Dru PC games. Recently there have been many movies based on video games, and I think this is one of them. <br /> <br /> So this movie does not follow any book. But it follows the parts of the game. I play and play each nancy drew game as soon as comes. And the game is for HerInteractive and for "girls who are not afraid of a mouse"! And some of these games really won the Parent's Choice Gold Awards. They're not just funny but you can actually learn the time of play or two things. <br /> <br /> I took the children of my two children to see me and they liked it! 10 years I started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before watching her movie, and she was so funny that I thought she would also enjoy the movie. And I was right ... he just did not like this movie, but could not wait to finish his first game and start another game. <br /> <br /> My second step is just 7 and she liked the movie but still young people can still play games, but she enjoys watching her sister occasionally to see what is happening. <br /> <br /> Games for children up to 10 years and older. All games are generally classified as get pretty decent breed reviews and as adventure games. For more information about games just see HerInterative Nancy Drew Games. So personally I think the movie was good and it would be bought after it was released on DVD.
