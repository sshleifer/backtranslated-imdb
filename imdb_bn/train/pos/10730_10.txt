Unfortunately, the SpaceCap Challenger came out of the same time as the explosion. Which is actually when it is to bring or even make it a crimp, bring it. I'm glad they do I saw the SpaceCamp in the first drive-in movie. Enhanced which is really a lot to see <br /> <br /> I heard Lee Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I did not listen to others in the movie. So, to find out my acting youngsters and to act real, it is a big shock to me! Of course, Kate's caption was very nice. <br /> <br /> I particularly like the scenes, where the kids are shown how to work, as a team. The children are ready for a scene in the scene they can only hope for. The actual launch of a spaceship, of course, our old news However, this one was different. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of my most treasured films. Escapist probably, but it was fantastic for a place nuts like me. Maybe 30 to 40 times after renting it. I finally found it at a certain store and bought it. Now, it comes out only DVD. I would probably have it forever. This movie got me 10 out of 9.
