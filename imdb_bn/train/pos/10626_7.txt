In Michigan, it's a decent little sparkling, about a person who has gone past her insatiable grandfather (Hansen of Gunner) and it has become very consistent. In fact, he is absolutely bonkers, but does not try to be very clear. She also got a entourage, that her own little monster and angel followed him. The monster never calls a word but really, and he is the highest Schreck-creepy. Let's just say that the angel is spinning his wheels in most cases, as Eric is doing something that makes him better, as people like it "freeze", which needs most beautiful young women. It's a perfect depiction of insanity, and you're doing something like yourself to find out what's going on, but overall, I've seen it from the beginning to pay attention to the film because it certainly keeps my interest in me. It's a little lack in some areas but nothing I can really keep my finger on. A decent effort and worth if you want a serial killer flicks.
