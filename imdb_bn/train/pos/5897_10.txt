This movie needs to be DVD. It was very funny and I liked it. Really, really cute and funny. Not realistic, but it is not estimated to be. The only thing I do not like is that the girl relies on a lot of people. It represents though though represented way from time to time. I have tried to get this movie for a while and it was unavailable for US format only in the UK and will not play in US DVD players. It looked tragic over a classic film! Believe it or not, but this movie can easily be a religion for all ages. Very bad, we do not give legitimacy to things that can really save a small country or our own. Lindy is incomplete, a positive character that makes lemons out of lemon. She is funny and charming. She stole the show!
