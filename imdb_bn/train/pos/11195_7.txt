The title has many meanings - Boxing rings, where discrimination and accusations are fought, the wedding ring, where the math is caught and the problems of the problem, and the reason for the problem, the ring is a ring-like bracelet given to the label as a love token. <br /> <br /> Former professional boxer Danish Carl Brison was cast in the film "The Ring" by Alfred Hitchcock on his debut. For a long career in films, Ian Hunter, a very young man, played Bob Kerby, who called a beautiful girl's label (Lillian Hall Davis) in a fun fair. She wants to be involved in "one round" Jack Sanderson (Carl Bryson) but it does not stop her flirt with Bob. Bob is encouraged to go "one round" with Jack. He has won a number of rounds and wins - he is a professional boxer and he and his manager have come to Maradal to know if Jack is a good soldier. He proposed to Jack Ferguson and Jack to keep his fate with plans to marry him with his mood instructor (The Great Gordon Harker). Jack won his fight and married Mabel on the next day, but the deep attraction he and Bob feel for each other. Jack suspects and keeps everything for his training so that he can fight Bob for his wife. <br /> <br /> Finally, the boxing movie where the hero does not stop the train - Bob behaves himself and can do whatever he can to become a champion - if only Mabel acting the same !!! He kept him for Bob - and at the end the fight is a strong one. It is very realistic - it lasted for the last 20 minutes of the film. From being raw and enthusiastic, Jack almost suddenly gets out - then in rounds, he reunites with Mebail and gives him the courage to win. The question is, why would he want to follow him - from the beginning he did not think of starting a relationship with Bob - why would he not do that again? <br /> <br /> The image is loaded with symbolism. Jack, shaking hands with the promotor, changing the hand of the labels, taking a bracelet from Bob. Jack keeps ring on Magellan's fingers, Bobs bracelet slips his hands down. Ultimately, Jack sees and reflects on the reflection of the table on a ringleide water ball. This is a nice movie that will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
