Douglas MacArthur's brilliant screenplay from the Battle of Corgrador in the Philippines at the beginning of the Pacific War gives the reason for believing in the above three possibilities, mainly by removing him as the United Nations commander during the Korean war. MacArthur's course of the Second World War (and, occasionally), certainly the most controversial American general has presented it as a man of great contradiction here. He claimed that the army wished peace, yet he probably gained glory in the war; He consistently denied any political ambition, but almost everything he deliberately used to promote himself as a presidential candidate; He obviously believes that under his commander's command, the soldiers must follow his orders, but he deliberately denies the President's orders of the United States; He specializes in other cultures (especially in the Philippines and Japan) and is still out of touch with his own country. All of these things are kept balanced throughout the film and in the end the viewer has to make his own decisions about him, although there is no doubt that MacArthur loved his country and especially his army, <br/> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> I said,) Ed Flanders with the possible exception. Although he gave an impressive view of Harry Truman and his attitude towards MacArthur: Circassic (repeatedly referred to as MacArthur as "his majesty") angry, frustrated, and finally he was completely annoyed with this general who would not respect his authority only as the president. Mercury was also bizarre as the wife of Macro's wife Jean, who was loyal to her husband (whom he referred to as "General", although his relationship seems to have been quite happy.) I enjoyed this movie, although it probably liked it. Learned more about MacArthur's early life. I always responded to the election of Meshaartha as the President of Aisenhower ("He will be a good President - he was my greatest clerk of all time" - which Mac Arthur thinks is what the President's role was to his military commanders during the war.) Good value observers. 8/10
