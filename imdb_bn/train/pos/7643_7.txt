Spoiler !!! What is this movie based on the concept? Of course Mr. Destiny can answer this question. The main character goes through a bad day, many of us, and ask this question. Chaos theory can affect anyone on here from a chain reaction to a butterfly kingdom in China. The focus of this movie is based on an event while playing baseball. The speed of this event is set in one set of Destiny; Using the comedy on Destiny's play, Ashton likes to just "The Butterfly Effect". The result is a fresh, somewhat original movie. If the philosopher is blamed with "The Butterfly Effect" then perhaps one will enjoy Destiny. I give it 7 out of 10. Surprisingly, I saw the first half of this movie 3 times and finally ended in TBS.
