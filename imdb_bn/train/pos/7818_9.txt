I think the topic of the story is covered by other posters so I want to write about my effect on this image. <br /> <br /> I saw this photo about the War of Liberation in 1987. My school has conducted a tour to see the movie, I think an RR project. We all got excited because we were going to school in the movie! We did not know a bit about what the experience was. To this day, I feel that these feelings were stimulating to me and I think most of my friends are crying like this. I think we were frustrated and calm down on our young way. It had an impact on me that I joined the anti-racist movement in the same year. <br /> <br /> I think it served its purpose in my case.
