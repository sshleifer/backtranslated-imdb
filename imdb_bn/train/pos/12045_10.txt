For the first time I have seen this movie and the only time in my life that I can keep my face and eyes very scared inside a particular scene. I once again thought of agreeing with my Annie friends and bought it in a video with immediate hesitation. I can add (I was surprised to be surprised when I saw it in England when it was created in England!) When I saw it, my response and my surprise were almost the same fearsome fear and fear, and my heart was so much beatled. This is the scarcest film ever made in my absence, Hollywood movies seem relatively little and some pieces and snares (shit), penal apologies. Although surprising, I saw so much power and energy of this film and 20 of my colleagues when I cried so much, block! Even the scene of the video brings God's fear in that special scene and I feel that I will never walk alone in the dark !!!!
