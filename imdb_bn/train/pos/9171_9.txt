I am a Jane Jane lover and a piousist, and this edition includes almost all the important details of the book, and I am portraying the characters as their imagination. Jane May is not a well-deserved story of great success and can not be properly distributed in feature-length format, so it needs a TV mini series. Timothy Dalton Rochester Probably Perhaps The Best He is very interesting and has talked a lot about his age. In the book, Jane (narrator) described him as "about 35" and is not young, but still middle-aged. I think Timothy Dalton did it at 38, so it's right. Also, we have Jane's opinion about whether Rochester is the best. She just met her and she thought she asked her intelligent. As an inexperienced and humble girl, I can not imagine that she thought her handsome. Playing Rochester will show the character of our people, and this is full of perfection. I love the relationship between these two stories, which are important issues about this story, and the humor that faces them. Other versions have blown it up, but it gets the right. The 2006 Toby Stephens (37 year old) version is in progress in BBC1, and in fact it is very good, so after finishing it will determine whether it is my darling. <br /> <br /> After watching this series again, after watching the 2006 version, I decided that this version is best with Timothy Dalton and Jella Clark. Charlotte Bronte's dialogue is reserved and power of this story is essential. Modernization just does not work - it's a Victorian story and old poetic lecture letter suits. This version has a nice cast - The Jella Clark is small and the height difference between him and Rochester is important; The actual presence of Timothy Dalton and an amazing actor. There is no extra view to dismantle the plot, and the screen has all the necessary scenery, but eliminates unnecessary details, makes it pointy and sticky. I recommend it to all true Jane Irie fans.
