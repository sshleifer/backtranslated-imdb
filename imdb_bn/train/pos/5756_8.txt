Alkohol's Pudunk Hick Hammlett ruled out the highest lawlessness and lawlessness. The city's elders have appointed the terrible Vietnam gentleman Harun (a fantastic and attractive performance of Chris Christopherson) and some of his colleagues to clean the place. The plan gets worse when Harun and his cruel cronies decide to accept Alk Heels after getting rid of all the bad stuff. Harun's good-acted brother Ben (played by John-Michael Vincent) stopped him before coming too far from his hand. Author / Director George ("Miami Blues", "Grant Pinch Blank") is a delightful, brutal and nastyly disconnected redneck drive-exploitation whipping the contemporary Western winner: He skillfully creates a radioactive, nonsens tone, keeps pace all the time fast and Lots of action scenes with vague, and sufficient muscular aplomb (phonetic explosive climax specifications) Ray is strong and stirring). The first-rate cast of the familiar B-feature faces is made as a major asset: Victoria Principal as Benn's sweet hottie Linda, Peters in a fantastic Bernadette like Flecky Salon singer Little Dyer, Brad Deckter as helpless mayor, David Doyle as a thin bank. President, Steven Stevenman, John Staidman as a memorial casino manager, is an old diner owner, Paul Gelson, as a powerful powerful hand shieldown bully, and a shameless, as a caretaker of John Carpenter's film, Carroll Carter, a 'gentle vats' of regular Charles Ciphers; Dick Miller as a piano player. Moral: Do not hire other people to do your dirty work. William Cranjgar's glittering painter, Gerald Fried's lively, harmonious mountain balloon score, and a lot of raw violence add to the overall trashial fun of this scrupulous neglected little dosage.
