Ealing comedies are good, but for me there is no denying that this movie has stood as the best. <br /> <br /> The main foundation of the film is that a small part of Pimiko in London has been discovered in parts of the burger, not the UK. We followed the lives of the residents of their war to keep the wealth found after the bomb blasts and found out black market traders who soon realized that rationing is not available because the UK is free from the law. When they get arrested on their own street, because the government decides that they stop boarding, we see them fighting against the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to drink water and food properly. Actually they got worse before they started, there morality came. When they think they eat the food they eat, they will lose and call for surrender, only to respond to their disaster from London, by sending food, this is a lot. This enables them to continue their struggle. <br /> <br /> This film is the perfect note for the whole life, acting is amazing, Stanley Holley, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Badlly and Betty Warren standing. It's just right, very sensitive and the moral of the story is not forced down your throat. Well worth a visit
