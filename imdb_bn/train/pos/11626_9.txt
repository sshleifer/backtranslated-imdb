This is Wes Kraveen (Nightmare of Elm Street), who has kept aside for 85 minutes in a miraculous way and gave us some more awesome gifts - the evil of humans Compared to Freddy Kr√ºger, we can face much more with the intelligent evil of Jackson Rippner and Syliel Murphy (Batman Begins) has done a great job of presenting a friendly, friendly, even charismatic killer. Murphy and Rachel McAdam (Performance from Craye, marriage crushers) are bright. Most of the films are performed in two people, their eyes, a very close level between their faces. This is a small scale action, not a wide swamp of canvas, and it is less compulsory for this limitation. Cinematography is nothing special, although certainly a passenger can do a lot with a camera within the jets, but the dialogue is excellent, the story is a ponytail There are no distractions, no subplots confuse a war problem in her heart's main character. By keeping his focus and avoiding confusion, Wes Krave is a very ultimate conspiracy and it is able to take turns in an exciting, fast-muscular action thriller.
