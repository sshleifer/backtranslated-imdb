The behavior of Will Engineer's soul on the TV screen follows many suggestions from Comic Strip pages or comic books. (Remember, the two are not exactly the same medium) It's really ironic that it's the smart alpha of the engine, the cracking of the ad, the only transformation of the tongue-in-cheeks superhero (during this writing). <br /> <br /> The story is that Republicans were interested in a film version and the copyright owner was in the middle of the 40's, but they were unable to close the deal. Left-on-screen play has become a serial, the best in the Republic of the Massard Marvel. Perhaps it was just that, there was a tendency in the studio to have curiosity with the elements of comic stripes, loop mags, radio and comic books. <br /> <br /> It was made for the 1987 TV movie, it is quite clear that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series. Though old, comic readers like me, may be a little harder in an adaptation criticism, an obscure audience with the character may be able to give some new observations, the clear version of what this screen version should look like. <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "It can not make her mind if it's serious or not!" Which best describes both spirit and its creator, Mr. Will Isana, the true creative genius of comics. <br /> <br /> The film is a heart-rending effort to keep the world on the screen. Danny Coult / The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Allen Welding were really good. Even though in contemporary settings, the "good old days" tradition has been so far, far too expensive, you know, when men and women still wore hats! It highlights a final (and distraction) point, and the director and production are conscious, and are successful in delivering characters to express facial expressions and body language. We say, Kados with them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It is not too bad to follow any series! Oh, today's motion picture seems to be a hot item in the world, comic adaptation of the world. Maybe some big timer producers and directors can really produce a first-class spirit for the Big Screen. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> Update: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 6/4/2008 So far, those shopping centers who go to multiplex movies are posters watching the new movie of Spirits (subtitles, MY CITY SCREAMS); Which will be released on Christmas Day, 2008. Well, we'll see what we'll see. Just keep your fingers crossed! Keep Ongoing ............. <br /> <br /> We saw a new movie, writer Milon's signature debut a few days ago. Well, we got our wish; But it's a good thing or any other subject "Be careful of what you are seeking, because you can get it?" Write us somewhere in IMDb.com Thanks!
