Star Trek: The Heden Frontier is the only complete fan film on the long-running Internet, fully completed in love with the series, and the track fans must be monitored. Production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes you can say that they're green-screenin 'it. But it is not far from the overall experience. The CGI ship is fantastic, as well as the scene of the spacecraft ... On the negative side, I can say in previous episodes (and even sometimes new) that some actresses / actresses are not quite comfortable in them, but again, this is the overall experience of Star Trek's new interpretations Not far from Cast and crew really came up with something special here, and overall, I would suggest this next to the next Next Generation and Deep Space 9 supporters.
