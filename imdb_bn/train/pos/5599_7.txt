It was my second time watching the film (for the first time, French language version, which was dubbed in Italian) and I think it will improve in the next editions. <br /> <br /> Up to the character research that is nicely shot and Paris's settings are equally impressive. Long run, it's not the top grade Polanski and I will rank it at number 9 in her filmography, but it's still an immovable mix of cool and cool, surprisingly, often wide comedy. It's also a fine cast, all of which are good forms, but especially Isabell Adjani, Melvin Douglas and Joe van Fleet. <br /> <br /> Even, I was a little annoyed by the sudden obedience of Trailkovsky. To 'change' the previous tenant; Apart from the apartment building, in addition to the owner of the caf√©, where he was given without asking Simon, if he wants to do something different, there is very little to indicate (as far as I can understand) that everyone wanted him! All right, so he has read the luggage of Simone yet in the apartment, but what steps did he take to dress him up and prepare himself for himself (even if he apparently started this unconscious work)? After his night vision in the bathroom, the last part of the film (where Adjani disappears) is almost anti-climatic - especially in the scene where landlords and other tenants tried to commit suicide that it was night at the opera, a concept that had already been 46 years ago. Quetco was used in a bloody substance (1930)! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < This fact has kept me alive at the first sight, and I am sorry that it is no longer clear! You think the first two-thirds of the film was quite strong but I hope that Polanski was dependent on vague plot points throughout life.
