When the plug breaks in New Orleans, Richard Wyommark is one of the great Elia Kazan's short-film films, for the rescue in "Panic in the Streets". Kazan keeps fast, and has a lot of great touch - Widemaker and Barbara Bel Gedes, who plays his wife and watches at the police station, show family life and work life and relationships with average citizens, the intense contrast between life and her life, a marsing jack Illustrated by Palenas, his weaker yes person, Zero motile, Tommy Cook, and Louis Charles. There are some interesting visuals - there are some scenes with Palense actors that seem to be up to their knees. <br /> <br /> The acting is extraordinary and the conversation is intense when the conversation is intense, to the direction and performances. It has some suspicious aspects which will be easily displayed by the viewer. That aside, it's a good price to look at. Kazan was a skilled director.
