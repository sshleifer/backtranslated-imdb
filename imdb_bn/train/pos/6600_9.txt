I'm going to keep this review brief and sweet. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer for this and thought I would give it a cyclone in 5 minutes and my initial thoughts were "What is hell? But after 10 minutes I got blurred and after 20 my jaw from the floor It's a great example of how the film can be different from a movie and its French, this is one of the High Art Eye Candy Media. The lovely predictive film is wrapped in silent packages, speed capture is very clever and black and white animation style which is not gray, though it did not completely affect me and it for me. The end of the film and I saw myself making this like every film. I think my opinion is that it was helped by the great dubbing It was very easy to do so. They did not land the so-called actors since many voice actors do not give any sense to the characters (just look for Hong Kong legend films to see in English a perfect example) I gave it 9 Although I feel fresh and new whole thing why it is an extra Gave 2.
