It seems to be a biography of Cloud Monnet, but it is actually a very interesting story of the relationship between three teenage girls in the French synchronized swimming team. There is no parent or teacher, no school, and boys are represented by a peripheral figure, Hong Kong Francois who enter timely sets and are always confused. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The youngest of the three, he is so much admired that he only wants to join the team. She's kind of looking weird. He is still not out of the growth of his teenager and his long, sister organs, big legs, and the brutality of speaking. She is progressive and sports this fat lips lips. After a while, his appearance can grow on you and from a certain angle. He can come to Enterprise. <br /> <br /> Adel Henel is older - better, physically improved. She is a picture of what is interesting in her swimsuit, sauntering around, teasing boys, swishing her long blond hair But he does not seem to. Or he? I could not quite find it. The French Revolution is a long and compact summary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, he is on the team but he is frustrated and Plain, and sensitive about it, and made a lot of pressure on Francois. Blackhear is a good actress and her performance joins the character's absurdity. <br /> <br /> This film is a relationship between three, which means dealing with plot, cheating, hidden feelings, and everything else. Young girls who spend a lot of time with each other. This is certainly a tricky thing. It became more complex during the growing development of homeopathic relationships between Pauline and Adele. You should not expect to be a soft porn movie. The only nudity that we see is much lower than that, and there is little sexuality under the cover, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to go to the plot or its analysis. Much more, because partly because it is stimulating rather than manifesting it, partly because it is complicated and partly I am not sure that I found it. <br /> <br /> Give me an example. OK. Adele girl is another jealousy. She is very remote and self-satisfied. On this he has visually shown the eyes of every boy and man, if he can use any of them, he is handsome, but from fool francosius to the bus driver, he wants from any party. He brags unashamedly about his skills to face. When Palin came to her about joining the swimming team, Adele used her hobbies while hiring her friends. A superior and self-motivated narcissist, you know? But then the Swie-Descent Falta Shrimp brought Palin under his wing and told Palin that he is still a virgin. Really? Yes really Paulin starts near Adele and Adele eventually acknowledges that he wants to free himself from his Himen and he wants to do this for Polin. Pauline, now working with Adele's sexuality, with a low taste. Now Adele is really old and experienced, want to get it with a man. So he took Palin to an elevation where he saw temptations with some people until he followed Pauline's powder room. Two daughters have stood looking at each other, or unexpectedly expressed another sexual tinged interest. But Adele became so intimate that Palin gradually blown her own rinse, reaching and kissed Adele on her lips. Adele said to laugh behind the back, "Now, it was not so bad, did not it?", And then went back to the club. <br /> <br /> What's going on is nicely described. Between Pauline and Adele - but what's going on? Initially, Adele treats Paulin as an irrelevant child, then like her closest friend, finally, like the potential boyfriend - and the minute's response responds, Adele is pleased. Is he using polyvinike the way he seems to be using a man? Has Adele been pleased to know that there is now another indigenous person? I do not know. <br /> <br /> I have little disapproved of Luis Blackhear as the third member of the three, plain and overprimed wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfundation but at least is completely discriminatory and the first three are to save the curiosity of virginity, but I only consider him I missed out <br /> <br /> have you seen it? All the way (Just compare high school children to ordinary American movies.) For men, none of which has ever entered the mystery of women, it gives you an idea of ​​how to look like a mid-shot.
