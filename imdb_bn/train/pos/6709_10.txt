What I like about this show is that it follows the life of modern document and it is an explosion to gain an experience of their daily love, humor and courage. Magic literature is so diverse that shows the concept of literary, medieval and modern wizards, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina Te√±ez Wich, this show is so funny and unique because it gives us many experiences of that modern wizardry, seven seasons are valuable! This show has many great qualities and Sabrina is happy to see her daily life live in the dead and "other" states. The television series is clear, fun and bold, because I would recommend it to any family. Classic!
