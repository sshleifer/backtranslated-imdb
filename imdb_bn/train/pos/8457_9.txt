I have to be a good anime of Gundam Wing. Moving a bit slow (especially around the middle of the series), but all enjoyable. Whoever hangs on my case and calls me "Winger", I will admit that I saw the original demolition, gangster 0080 and 0083, 08th ms team and gundam sid. <br /> <br /> I would admit that there was some problem with the story and some characters may appear to be "rip-offs" (i.e., near jacques marquez root gangster grape), but it is based on the original series Alternative universe displays, such as SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this series, make sure you watch the first thug and then you know that you are watching an AU series.
