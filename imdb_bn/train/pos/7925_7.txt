Silly movies are really, really fun. Yes, it got its dead moments, it can be a bit obvious, it drops somewhat in the second half and the story is an inconsistent mess, but it laughs loudly all the way. And Ed McMahon is only worth seeing as a right wing cock. This film is in the same class as Elvira, the brain of the dark, another incredible fun, unused film.
