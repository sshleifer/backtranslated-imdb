Well, firstly it has to be explained that Kakha Kacha is a part of Tamil and it means translating in almost mean means "to save". Khaki refers to the color of police uniform on the other side (which is the house!). <br /> <br /> Also, the Tamil film industry is full of commercial ventures, the testimonies of any Rajinikanth or Vijay film will last. <br /> <br /> Now a fantastic movie with a fantastic soundtrack. The final scene must of course be stunning, especially the last love (which is certainly unexpected!). Holes rather than at times, but of course this is a great movie!
