This movie is my favorite because it makes me think about all my choices and if my choices are different then how will my life change? It plays a precise role in the theory of "Plural Universe". <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not seem to be true is that there is so much of hard time to understand how Larry Barros (James Balushi) is moving everything that has changed. <br /> <br />
