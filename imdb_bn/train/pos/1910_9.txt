Ya That's what I think. It was still a great show with John, but I personally think that the way it is better than that. <br /> <br /> I love to live in CK and grandfather because they are so funny together. <Br / <br /> <br /> When I was around John, I did not really laugh so much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .) Because I want to see some new elements. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. The poor Rory is almost always left. It's always about Bridget or Kerry. What about the story !!! ??? This is really a great show and anyone who did not see it, must go and see it. I guarantee you will almost laugh. Good even chocolate.
