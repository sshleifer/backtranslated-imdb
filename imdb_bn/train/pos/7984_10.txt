Man of Fire, of course I've ever seen one of the best plays / crime thrillers. Despite a slowly starting story, it is rather complicated and sensitive that it sticks stick together well. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington, where he plays a bodyguard known as the CRC, who is suffering from his past and suffering from alcoholism, his latest perspective, does not give up his responsibility to save Pita. Dakota Fanning Father, loves a lot of smart, enthusiastic little girl, and works very firmly, she keeps a great future in front of her. I said the story is a bit complicated, to fully understand it, you must see it several times. <br /> <br /> This picture has been made in two parts, the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing is wrong, until everyone gets Peter's abduction and until the crew dies, only their life is happy. And then the second part, the rest of the picture, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat terrifying and annoying, when the crossover is retrieved from his deadly injury and attacks many criminals and "La Harmamadad" who is responsible for planning <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> Washington has shown us more talented actors as well as their best-acting acting talentsIt is a real shame that the film did not receive enough recognition, Washington earned another Oscars for its performance and was also a faning and director. And even very high visual effects can occur. <br /> <br /> If you like a cool, slightly fragile, suspicious thriller, you will see it. The most wonderful thing is that the material of this movie is actually based on a real story and original character! 10/10
