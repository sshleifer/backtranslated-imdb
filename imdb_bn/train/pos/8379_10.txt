I remember this movie at the age of 12, it was amazing. I think most of the day I have not seen, I even tried to buy it, but it's a rolling horse *! However, the actress is a bit impressive but the story is amazing that it was wonderful to watch the real B movie and the event of a low budget, but I saw it almost 20 times. This is a very well made movie and I like the idea of ​​fighting the control of the monster-controlled robots, sadly, they stop "crash and burn" to create an unexpected spin, it will not see the whole pants movie! If you have a really saif-fay fan then see it, if it is rebuilt, it will win. I really want to see a remake or even want to release its DVD.
