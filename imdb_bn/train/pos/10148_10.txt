I could give some of the film stars, only this is the "lifetime" presentation that was originally portrayed in the representation of the story - here, in New York City. In rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, L, etc., most of these channels are "set", painted in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or any other Canadian locales. <br /> <br /> But if ever there is a best rating - 10 * on this site, this is the movie. Surely not for fundamentalism, this story has many times, in many diversities, this particular one has been put together at the same time. This is mostly done on the big screen, with stars and stars from James Granger, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hendes, et al and Deborah Kerr, Doros Day, Meg Ryan and many more. I can think at least 10-12 more, as it is already prominent, in the presence of the past, from the top of my head, which can now be added, and perhaps many other things that can be considered. <br /> <br /> Do not be drowned, but my point is, in my opinion, by this one I saw one of these great superiority. I grabbed this opportunity at midnight on Friday, at the time when I was in the TV, especially after weeks I was taking a few hours. I have not been able to run across this flick after 8 years after it was created. And, when two leads have been well known enough, they were completely unknown to me. I knew there were only two actors, FÃ©lis Newman (Anna's mother) whom I had some things from his little day and Michael Repsoli (Henry, the best friend of Charlie), who is a prestigious grandson of "Grandma", hard, "Rounders" from the street guy . <br /> <br /> The opportunity to combine romance with the best of both leads, together with the relationship of their relationship like Anna and Charlie, is the opportunity to get together and publish only later, the conspiracy of the character in character, but there is no difference of enjoyment here ( In fact, it increases it). <br /> <br /> To test some other comments, I agree with the positive. The original term describing this movie is in ENGAGING caps. This adjective describes the performer; The character; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what do I say? escapist Schwarzenegger / stallion rental; "Goodfellows;" Even classics like "Casablanca", "Win with Win," "Citizen Cain." But for pure, extraordinary enjoyment, it was one outstanding. With the fraction of their budget, the results are similar to "You Received Mail" and "Seattle's Laziness". And Tom Hendes and Meg Ryan could not do better than Natasha Henstritz and Michael Verton; It was equivalent to co-star and support staff as well as these mega-films.
