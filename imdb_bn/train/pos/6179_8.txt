It is good to see that Vintage Film Buff has correctly classified his exact DVD release as "musical", because this movie is pure and easy. Like his unauthorized rebuilding, Murderer and the Windmill (1949), the plot of the murder is just an excuse for a wide female show with Kittie Carlisle and Gertrude Michael, who runs a cast of super-decorated girls, including Anne Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Berle Wallace, Gennellen. Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Frichie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Bryson has been holding his strong voice "Cocktail for Two to Two". Undoubtedly the most popular song in the movie, it is not less than four times. However, it was Gertrude Michael, who transformed the "sweet marijuana", not only stole the show through her strong actions as the hero of the hero. For the rest of the cast, we could work together without Jack Okey and Victor McLugan. The only good thing about Oki's role is the weak icon, with its Toby Wing pushing its weak running. In fact, to think of how comedy is too busy and too much strained, you can not easily put the super-Mumbai Inspector McLagle to the murderer, even though you believe that in this case you will be the most suspicious person. Director Mitch Leisson actually goes to great pain in order to point out to the killer near the most cruel member of the movie viewer by providing the clo-ups player after the clear-up.
