I agree that the capital city will be in the DVD. I saw this event only in 1994 and saw Rolf Saakson as Hodson Talbot. It was nice to change the financial industry to work overseas abroad in London. I love Rolf in this role and he loves the other roles that he has played. I can not believe that the show is only about the end of the 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as one of Hudson's finest charming friends in the series. While promoting this event in New York City area, it was always late at night or during closing. The show is less than one hour long. I think this show has gone a long way, but the change in the second season of casting has really made the show a little less interesting. I did not take care of Silvia, but last season I missed actress Julia Phillips-Lane. I felt taken this opportunity to show and often it worked. It likes Americans and likes to live in London. American characters were not arrogant or tried to cross their British counterparts. I like this thing that they tried to internationally try welding instead of making them all British. I liked watching an initial role Julia Ormond. I felt this show should last longer. I once felt running as long preview as one hour less show. They could move the cast space to New York City and it was hit in America.
