Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Akshay Kumar is an excellent female woman who has worked with 3 girls and is involved in the same time. John Abraham is repeatedly amusing and this is one of his best works till now. In most of her films ParSay Rayalay is pretty cool as usual. Director Priyadarshan has distributed great movies in the past. Hara Ferry, Hangama and Halal is the best thing to do. Garments are the most fun pictures made by her. Three new actresses are average. Rimi Sen does not get much chance in this film. At the same time Priyadarshan was surprised to see a relationship with 3 girls in a movie with a common story of a person. All 3 girls stop a day on the same day and end up at the same house. Laughs packed with loads, this one non-stop entertainer.
