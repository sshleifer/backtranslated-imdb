I have seen this movie several times and it seems very good. This film is also known as "Terror Castle", "Terror Caffeine" and "Dans Macbre". Barbara Steel, its usual / annoying self. George Revier, male lead, does a good job with his role. The whole film has fallen into the atmosphere, and there is a whole-life tension. The camera angle is good and played, most of the part is not bad. This image is suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have an inferred DVD, which is much more than the edited TV version. Hold some popcorn, turn on the lights, sit back and enjoy. John and Tracy
