Finally, Timon and Pumba in their own film ... <br /> <br /> 'Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Mata' is a new story in a classic story. Any classic story, you ask? Why, 'lion king' must be <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, if Disney is never short, then it is silence. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean that there is not a good film. It's basically called 'Lion King' event by Timon and Pumba's point of view. And because of that you need to tell the story of 'Lion King' to see where they are coming from. <br /> <br /> At one point, I was seeing this and thinking "Oh my God, it's so much hair. "And on another level I had a ball. Most humor is predictable - I mean, when Pumba makes two beds, a big one for yourself and a small one for Timon, in the first nanosecond, we all know that it will grow bigger. But it does not prevent it from being sunny, which is, IMO, Hakuna Matata is 'Short'. This is not what it is, how it is <br /> <br /> and a note of caution: There are some fart jokes. In fact, in which movie did you expect anything else in Pumba at the central level of Mumbai? But as fert jokes, this should be especially good, and even the most special connoisseur should be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Returning voice genius is great. I am surprised that some actors are willing to return, most of them have only two or three lines (if they are lucky). Hype Goldberg is particularly welcome. <br /> <br /> The music is also great. Initially, 'It is my need' starting from 'Diga Tunaha', 'Worthaad Rapti' (a song which was cut from 'Singha Raja' and was developed mostly in this avatar), an adaptation, the music has left me. <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> then it will be so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you've seen 'Lion King' more often. Especially if you are thinking now "Do not be stupid, 'Lion King" There is nothing to see many times! "
