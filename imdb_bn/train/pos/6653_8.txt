Firoz Khan and Anil Kapoor's 'Gandhi, my father' apart from all the good political views, Mahatmas Karamchand inquires about the family's confusion about Gandhi and the consciousness of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi's war with society. Bigger father than life, and most importantly the demons in his head. Gandhi's nation draws parallel to Father of the Nation and struggles with which a boy can live with his father. Shefali Shetty, Darshanarari Zariwala and Akshay Khanna - With this firmly-colored and heart-shaped story, the story of Harilal's story was aloud. <br /> <br /> Firoz Khan's guidance and production canvas is very interesting and interesting, however, the screenplay can be more difficult. I saw this game a few years ago by a pirated video type DVD (it was thought to be Mahatma Gandhi Gandhi) and it was definitely more damnious. However, the background score of the film and the moments of father-son and mother-son are simply a brilliant behavior. <br /> <br /> This movie can be great. It's that border line The possibility of a difference between the parents or just Gandhi or even both of them is so huge. Somewhere, the plot is lost and when you hope to feel full emotionally, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> It compares comparatively to other Gandhi. Of course, Kings are not an overview movie, like Gandhi, abstract as Kamal Hassan's Hei Ram. The movie only manages to find his foot; However, one wonders left "what if ..." is a clock value. 7.5 / 10
