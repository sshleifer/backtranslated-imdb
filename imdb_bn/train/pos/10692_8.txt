Good, funny, straightforward stories, nice Nicole Kidman (I almost always like that movie). Since it has both elements there was a good "car" for the adept at the comedy and drama. A romantic comedy bound around two crime stories, great off-line. Chaplin, good at here, was another good, but informal romantic comedy ("The truth about cats and dogs"). Maybe they are very impossible. Ebert did not even post a review for this. Unusual "scrub" comedy was completely impossible ("bringing up baby" etc.). If you watched an incredible comedy, did you see them all? Or maybe people are ready to move in the 1930s. Mysterious Birthday girl is a movie I've enjoyed many times. Nicole Kidman may be a "killer application" for home video.
