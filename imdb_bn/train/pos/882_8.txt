I picked this one on a whim from the library, and was very pleasantly surprised. Many tight, expressive camera works, an equally tight script, and two wonderful actors all make a very fine piece of film together. The spiral multiplex is not the brain, but the real fans of the film. If Hollywood ever gets a deadly hand on her, I'm sure it will destroy it. Behave in almost all manner of a choice. Here are other posters amply more than its complimentary song, so I do not need to be disturbed by duplicating their paeans; Just do not miss their advice, and mine, and this gem. Call what you want; I spent two hours entertaining it well. Read my lips: Do not miss it.
