Overall the film is okay. I think it's better than septettes and a lot better than a teacher, in the words of his story, his sensitive value. <br /> <br /> Some scenes that touch me. Yes I agree that the boy (Muksin) is very good in his acting. Bright I can say that his performance is almost normal. <br /> <br /> Neena Simon's song 'Ne May Quote Pass' really '' Manikikon 'My' Bulu '' Roma '' <br /> <I love the song. The song is both. "I pass my wrists" and "Hugen". I just downloaded the song. Beautiful <br /> <br /> and Yasmine Salam The movie's end credits makes me touchy. We can see how Yasmin praised his parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves the grand prize of the international jury at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I am 8.5 1o stars.
