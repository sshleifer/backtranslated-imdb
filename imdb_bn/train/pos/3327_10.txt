I love and appreciate the French brothers! How did I see this great movie after 3 years of liberation war? It laughs me, it is crying me and it has warmed my heart again. Big time It's hard to describe in my hard English - but how I would like to try: <br /> <br /> Excellent from the direction of the role - leadership, helpful role, acting great, dialogues are great and the film is perfectly guided and edited. <br /> <br /> I think Farrero's movies are often underestimated - they're not a mock humor - they're DUIP! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> You love someone: liberate them, let them - try to share emotion and pain and really true to each other. <br /> <br /> I am not an athlete, but of course a game is unknown. But this movie - Vibes get you I could smell the baseball atmosphere. Finally, this movie has explained to me that there is no sports fan and you have to be there a cool fan-family. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Pete and Bob! <br /> <br /> PS: If you have not seen it - please see the Kingpin!
