Mitchell Lizen's fifth feature as director, and he was in his previous movie heavy drama, shows his versatility by managing a musical. He plays a camio as a conductor. <br /> <br /> You can call it a pre-coded movie, and it was not created in America after some time later (such as 30+ years). Leissen shoots the number of music so that they look like viewers - from a widescreen screen shot or from Ela Boubi Berkeley. What I find interesting or interesting is that you never see the audience. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, Lead is fairly frivolous, and Jack Ocky and Victor McLaughlan play their natural film personalities. Gartrude Michael also provided some sparks. <br /> <br /> The number of musical instruments is interesting and some good (especially the inconsistent rape is fun) but the drama is disrespectful and faked - three killings are much more and there is a minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie has been a lot better.
