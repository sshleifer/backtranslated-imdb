Petter Mattari's "Love in the Time of Money" is a visible stunning movie. Mr. Matthi gives us a lively portrait about human relations. This is a film that tells us what to do with people in different situations, money, energy and success. <br /> <br /> About this same theme, a diversity of Arthur Sachitler's play, the director transfers this action to present-day New York where these different characters are combined and connect. Each one one, or the next person is connected to someone else, but no one seems familiar with the previous contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We have come to see how these people live and live in their homes. <br /> <br /> The only thing in all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness. A big city is not a good place where people's relationships find sincere fulfillment, as we can see that most people meet us. <br /> <br /> acting is Mr. Under the instructions of Matthi, it is best. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carroll Why, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest gifted cast, these characters come alive. <br /> <br /> We wish the best wishes and wait for anxiously for her next. Will be.
