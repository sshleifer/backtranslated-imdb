I used to watch this show when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I remember it all. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I vaguely think about surplus sequences and theme songs. Without that, everyone is ideally cast out. Also, writing was very powerful. Performance was very grade. I hope some networks will bring it back so I can see each episode. Before I wrap this up, I want to say that I always remember these shows in my memories, although I do not think I've seen each episode. Now, in conclusion, when some network ever returns it, I hope you catch it before it gets better for a day.
