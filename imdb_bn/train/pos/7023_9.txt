I love that this movie recognizes the intelligence of the viewers so that they tear the tiers apart from each other with their interactions about the vague losses that affect each other. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is beautiful and it is a reflection of the perspective of a person's view that I believe is a very talented new film maker and a story with maturity and artistic insight to accomplish that with many more experiences, others have failed. I can see a bright future for this writer / producer / director whose goal was to achieve goals and perform it honestly. <br /> <br /> Quds to achieve this.
