A community theater actor who works hard on it but does not act very seriously, I am always amused by those who behave as Great Art. This movie has made "Actor Craft" shamelessly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Meet a ham actor dictator for the movie's position. When the dictator dies due to a heart attack from too much drink and food, the actors are kidnapped and forced to play "part of the lifetime" of the neo-Nazi chief of secret services. He plays rushly, loves the tyrannical girlfriend with him and faces him in the opposite direction, and makes his captives a beautiful table. <br /> <br /> A lot of good work, a lot of good work is done by some unknown supporters, especially family workers and guardians of the palace, and lots of funny little curiosity. Sammy Davis Jr. highlighted in his own light, an exception to a semi-retired American businessman with Jonathan Winters and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, and Richard Dreyfas. This is a stupid movie, but it has a very beautiful position (Brazil), a ridiculous script, and good actors doing their thing, and in fact they are having fun and what is going on in the usual existence is not just about playing. !
