The perfect character of Brendan Filon de Sopranso He got blindfolded and died. This was the best ever and well-orchested scene ever in Sopranos. Brendan Filone is very good. Brandon Filon will push Uncle Jr. in his dream until Uncle Jr. can accept it anymore. Brendan Filon is the best character. Brendan Filon Episode 3 # 3, Denial, Anger, was killed in acceptance.
