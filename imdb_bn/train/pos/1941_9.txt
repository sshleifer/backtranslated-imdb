I actually think it's a comedy and hopes to smile off my ass sitting it sitting. Very soon it became very clear that no comedy, or at least a 'Jim Kerry type' one. What we are seeing is the character - the film has started some pretty deadly, troubled people, trying one of their basic fears - gathering, fear of water, swim fear of swimming We begin to get some bit of bit of life in them, feel their problems, guess their thoughts. <br /> <br /> I actually look a little darker than this, and in addition to the chains of events, some light comes and hope for their lives. <br /> <br /> I probably did not see the movie, I knew it was not a comedy, but I had a good time, enjoyed the story and did not seem to be. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> You will show him the light of death, do not let him out, do not leave him, he is your gift from the sun ... "<br /> 9/10 <<br /> peace love
