Read the original story in the 18th century. Curiously, the film disappointed the original soul very well, although the plot was widely revised. Film language, rhythm, special effects are all from Hollywood, but still have a Chinese core. It's amazing how Hark Suiu was able to unite them together. The result is pure beauty.
