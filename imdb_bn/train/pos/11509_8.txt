It is a perfect shame that this spin-off TV series "Inspired by the Night Stroller" and "The Night Strogler" is the only season and twenty episodes inspired by the best-produced TV series, because its best program is often the most enjoyable mix of winners and sharp humorous humor (The spiral spellings of Karl Kolcak's spell are forever shocking and dur Permanent editor Tony Vinceenzo was always a treat to see and hear), Clever Text, Nifty Supernatural Men (Love Offbat and Genuine Animals) "Spanish Mous Murders," "Sentry" and "Hight in in the Heights" with Jabbs, Vampires , Wevevovas and Duchess will not be able to make mistakes with awesome choices), colorful characters, star performers of great guests Lively acting (legendary biker flick Icon William Smith receives a rare opportunity to deal with a heroic lead in "The Energy Eater", in other episodes, Ken Win, John Fidler, John Dahner, Seven Darden, and William Daniels play a rousing role), genuine Saucer's effective moments (especially "Spanish Moss Murders" 's Sweater Set Climex Really Hears ENG was), and above all, the one and only Darren McGuin brush, offensive, and excited, but in the most prominent, like the most modest, bold and honest Chicago, Illinois newspaper reporter Carl Calcutta. <br /> <br /> An unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of tasty scopes and strong, chic and quick witted fellow with a strong nose. Moreover, sometimes Calcutta was something other than ironic; Although he was usually tropped or withdrawn from a deadly threat, he had a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to protect the time and time of mankind from all other deadly enemies. The Calcutta was surrounded by a slightly more enjoyable secondary character: Carl's Chronically Ill-Tempered Bonnie Tony Vinsenjo, perfect for Jack Greenidge, made Ron as an ideal comic foil in the wax, Ruth McDevitt was just as lovely as Sweet Miss Emily Cowles, and Carol is similar to Susie Funny Beaver Rookie Monique Marmelstein (who only disappeared after popping in three episodes Became) as much fun as possible. Allowed, the show was unthinkable from the unimaginable makeup and special effects ("Wehrolf" title Lycanthrope unlike Yorkshire's Terrier!), And the next episode featured some ridiculous intelligent monsters ("The Chopper", the title of the "motorcycle killer" in "young killer" in Le Cresby, like Helen Helen) , But the second-rate shows are even trademarks of the program Through the vile mockery and McGavin's unlimited vigor and are freely released through the presence of scraps.
