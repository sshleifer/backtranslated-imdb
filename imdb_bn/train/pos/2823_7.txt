After reaching Hollywood for the first time in Gibota, it was not sure how to market MGM. Fair that there was a lot of trust between the mayor and his appearance "Torrent" He did not even say a word in English, so he thought it hard to work, Ricardo Cortez could not even make it easy for him. <br /> <br /> The river Jupiter, which is a sleepy little village in Spain Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes that her voice will bring her wealth and happiness to her struggling parents. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love but she can not agree under her mother's toes and allow her marriage. Meanwhile, Dona Br√∫l (Martha Mattox), the parents of Leonardo, have been expelled from their homes, and they have sent Leonore to Paris to give him more opportunities to sing. Leonor sends a note to Rafael, urges him to remember his promise and come along with him. Her mother is angry and she is not allowed to go - so she must be cave at her request. <br /> <br /> Pass the year. Leonora has a new identity - he has become the toast of Paris opera La Brunna. Rafael became just like her mother - she ran for office and called a "safe" young woman remedies (Gertrude Olmsted) as the "Hog" heir. Mc Swann plays his father. Leonora decides to visit his old home, and I agree - why he did not help his soil. His mother is still living in the family home, working as a skvy and washing. Leonora and Rafael combined, but Leonore is full of ridicule. Gerva is very nice, it is hard to believe that he can be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> The dam is breaking down and the storm is flooding in the city. The house of Leonorra is on the road to the angry river, but when Rafael tries to rescue him, he seems pretty safe. Then they re-shine their romance. This picture has a "horizontal" love scene, similar to "Flush and the Devil". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and Leonora go to go. Rafael met Leonanor before traveling to America. Again he was willing to go with her but again she gave him down. He has often heard his other fame destroying - "What he will do for you but drag you". He has secured a top government job for him if he comes with her. They meet again, a few years later - he is as fresh and vibrant as before - he looks older than his year, lowered by middle class. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie with positive messages to follow your heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
