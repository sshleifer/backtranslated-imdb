I love this picture very seriously, I will not be sick of seeing it. The only line I can not really stomach is when the reef calls itself a teenager lobotomy but everything else is perfect from it. I was not a fan of PJ Souls and I did not hear that he did not even know who the Ramones were, until the film was made, but I can mostly ignore his little little face. Most people who are watching this over are Ramon's fans and really .. This is the only reason I love it so much. Daddy does not get tired of seeing his pizza line mess or over the teacher's name over, huh One of the best parts of the film is that they want to dance to you, under the high school hall ... I love it. The special edition DVD has a good predecessor, surprisingly Pije Souls is not over it. Maybe he was working on another project * Smile * Anyway, great movies, even if you're a Ramones fan.
