Most people, especially young people, can not understand this movie. It seems to be a loss story, when it's actually the story of being alone. Some people can not feel loneliness at this level. <br /> <br /> Chadles character is reflected in Johnson's character opposite Fennmeyer. While Johnson was trapped by his blessing, Feynman was trying to forget his life from the same perspective. Zodcast Casts pulls a wonderful additive and sandler tears. Chadell had a ridiculous role, and he was a great supporter for Sandler. <br /> <br /> I can see Oscar somewhere here. A very fine film. If you ever lose and feel alone, this movie will assure you that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
