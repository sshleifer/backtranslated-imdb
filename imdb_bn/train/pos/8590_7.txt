Kefar was watching my favorite character in Sutherland TV's history, it was a prediction that I would go to movies and spend about $ 15 in this regard. I think it also applies to fans of Eva Longghora. <br /> <br /> The movie is moving around a leak, which plans to kill a secret service agent president. In the context of the investigation, it is found that it is only equipped with possible candidate stomach (Michael Douglas). To solve the innocence, Pitt goes for fun, mad style, true search. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but not obviously spectacular. A modest cast, a decent story but it felt a bit embarrassing, but you can certainly do anything worse.
