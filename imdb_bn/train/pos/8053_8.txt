This is one of the great early comedy films of Samo. It is not a parody to enter the dragon, but the protagonist (Samo) is inclined with Bruce Lee and wears it oddly to a person in his shape. How to fight his beloved ones causes the slightest story - then fight. Oh, fight. Good, fast-sighted scenes with high impact (the white guy that played the boxer looks like he is actually hit by Samo's kick). <br /> <br /> The most fun bit of this movie was completely unknown. A gym guy looking for a Kelly (one of the three experts to hire Sammo), but he was a Chinese guy in the blackface with an Afro-Wig. Let's not have any black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I think I saw enough white counterfeit "Chinese people" in old American films. <br /> <br /> This is for any Samo or Bruce Lee fan.
