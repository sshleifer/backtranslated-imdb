This film was one of my childhood favorites and I must say that compared to any other film I liked that time when I grew up in Baghdad, I watched it's quality. It is not only a movie that is enjoyed by children, but also adults and adults. There are only errors, which one can not see before the bad effects of one (compared to today's effects), like a child. I did not remember those effects, of course I have seen this movie for almost ten years, when I was about 11 years old. Who saw the effect? One just wants to get good stories and entertainment and this film is exactly what this is. I think this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. It looks like Indiana Jones films are just like this picture. Comedy, romance, and adventure is one, which creates an amazing mix that takes you from the beginning to the end, and although the film is old and the music and style of the film is not clearly modern, but it is not successful Dhulimlin and old. This is all due to the main story, good direction and performance of the actors. In that section, Sabu (Abu) and Conrad Vide (as Jafar) mostly provide comedy and cold elements of the film. Great film and even though a 'oldie', definitely a? Golden ' I hope some people have brains and one day they can reveal it in the DVD. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8
