The horses that are still running is one of the movies that holds you up and does not let you go, especially when you see it as a child. If you look at the movie as an adult you must not think of it as scary, but the story is very interesting and there are plenty of mysterious scenes (especially those with strange mummies) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the movie is Their new RV suspects the scene with grandfather and grandmother. The scene with stone is very exciting and quite scary. Also the main character where his mother secretly discovers the information is very dangerous. <br /> <br /> The film's acting is not so big, and sometimes the film seems a bit annoying, but the horse that runs on the whole is still fun to walk around. Very few people have seen this movie, this film is really good. I just want to say: Mr. Flocker, you did a good job! And for all you Hollywood producers out there; If you want to rebuild a movie, rebuild this one!
