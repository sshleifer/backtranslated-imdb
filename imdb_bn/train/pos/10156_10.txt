This great movie has failed to register more than 5 ratings! why not! This is a great illustration of Christ's life without the cruel emptiness of Christ's animal. The public cache has done great things for God which is surprisingly avoided and neglected. Where in most of our cases we should be subject to churches. The film took less than a month to film. Johnny felt the strong presence of God's guidance through him. Great credit for all those who are involved with this great cinematic movie that will always be cautious. By its fans At least Billy Graham Crusade rated it enough to use it as the main source of education for new Christians. Thank you Fox for creating this. As the Walk Wright line proves that this person survived that this person is still alive, such an underlying masterpiece.Movies are not canonized through the popular vote as this proves this production! In short, I believe that this movie is one of the great documentaries worldwide, as it is honest, honestly portrayed and a great witness for Christian faith!
