This highly derivative movie will be entertaining for many who have not seen any more vague animated films. I enjoyed it most, especially after minutes of opening the flat instead of the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very entertaining and it includes a better bit of animation). James Garner's captain and Leonard Nimo gave the impressive performance.
