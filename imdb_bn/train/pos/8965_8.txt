Created as "Vertigo" in the same year, it is an equally deviating movie, although it has many light veins. It has been set in Winter in New York: Kim Novak has made a spell on James Stewart, but he gets caught instead. Attractive direction is starring Novak's rival Juanise Roule, who raised Magg's part in "Picnic" on Broadway (in which Novak will be famous in the film).
