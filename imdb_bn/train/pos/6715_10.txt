I loved watching ABC's TGIF on Friday night "Sabrina, Tianz Witch". I think this is one of the best artists of TGIF. My friends and I used to gather this Friday to see this show and we never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salim. She was adorable and sooo fun. I love Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey. She was hot. I think Melissa Yoan heart plays very well teenager witch. My favorite episodes are "Sabrina Through the Link Glass" and "Hilda and Gelda: The Teeny Years". Those episodes were great. <br /> <br /> Overall, I missed this show. I hope one day ABC will bring it back with a new episode. I give this show 10/10 stars.
