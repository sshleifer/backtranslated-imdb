One of the biggest hits of 1926, Harvard Brown is an exciting comedy / drama that combines regatta and football scenes that will make William Heness the necessary role to be a great star. It has patented Hans: Intelligent smart alike, until he raises everyone and becomes a male / hero and does not take anything seriously until the girl wins. No one used this formula like Henes. A horror comic actor (with Michael Picford to show people including Little Annie Rooney, Marion Davies), Haines could face a tragedy from the comedy, changing the facial expression. He is also happiest on this film because he was with Tall Itto Marines (with Lone Chanir) and West Point (with Joan Crowford), where he repeated the formula. Just like Mary Brian's daughter, Jack Picford is as good as a sick roommate, Ralph Bushman competitor. Edward Connelly, Mary Allen, David Torrance, Gunn Williams, and co-starring Grandi Sutton. This film is now well-known for the homeopathic relationship between Henes and Picford, and John Owen is an Eel football player (but I have never seen him). Henes was the top five box officer at the beginning of this film through 1932. It is embarrassing that he mostly forgot and most of his films were lost. She is one of the most striking and talented actors of her time.
