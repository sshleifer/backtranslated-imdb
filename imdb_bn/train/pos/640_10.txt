I and my sister saw the premiere last night ... It was so good that we were overwhelmed for the whole thing ... hahah .. I think I'm in season! .... they have some good actors, Head Coach and Plate Choice players were very good and I got the plot already, but I do not understand how they will keep it extended for the whole season. Maybe some big ones will be tight ... I I can not wait till Tuesday. Finally Jeremy Samtter? I can say I'm going to be big !! She was so good that we fell in love with her character. Can not wait for the next episode. Jeremy! <br /> <br />
