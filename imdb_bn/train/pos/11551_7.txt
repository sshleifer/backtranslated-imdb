ODD COUPLE (3+ outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I will always remember that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall confirm "strange couple". From the mid-70s to the TV series, their unbelievable work was a high pirate sign for television ... easily crossed the screen and screen versions of the story. However, how can you make a mistake with the Jack Lemon / Walter muzzle pair? Oscar, particularly well as the slogan form Matthau Lemon takes a bit of use as Felix, especially if you have seen Tony Randall's extraordinary performance before. The script is better ... clearly Simon Simon's best. Blue Simon is probably one of the worst, most performed plays in America's theater. This story is simple: Felix, a delicious ficak and his wife are separated from Alaska's Oscars. Those slob who need some help in saving money for runaway payments. Their living arrangements are too much like marriage, some are full of fun, tiffs and spaces. Many fun and some great one liners.
