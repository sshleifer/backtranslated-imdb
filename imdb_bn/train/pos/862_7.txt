Karla is a secretary who is deaf without his hearing. When he overloads himself at work, he is able to hire Paul to help him. Paul is not just from jail, and his past is entirely behind him. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this story is that when Kala is listening, the word is used to understand and when she can not - a "listening point" (like opinion). The first scene which was set up and simultaneously developing the first letter of Karla and Paul was more attractive to me and later it was launched, some of which were difficult to follow and / or some credibility was expanded. There are some unpleasant violence. Returning positively, cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The image is valuable to look at, but probably not looking for it. 4/28/2002 is seen in the San Francisco International Film Festival.
