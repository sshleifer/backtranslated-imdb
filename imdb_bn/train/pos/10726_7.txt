I enjoyed some spacecamp for my surprise, I think it was almost 13 years ago, and I hired it again recently. I was quite impressed. Clearly nowadays like the AzamSadon and Deep Impact, special effects on space films are far more than the spacescamps. However, there was a story in this movie - a very stereotyptic eighty story where you can read the next dialogue before you hear it. But what I liked - they did not make such films, so this was a fresh change. In the initial role, Kelly was fascinated by Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lee Thomson, to add elements of light and sculptor plot with Tom Scaritte and Kate Capps. Jeans likes the robot, it was very nice, but unfortunately it was more passion than the main character. The film was often inspirational in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was pictured on NASA's Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
