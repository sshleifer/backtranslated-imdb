I love this picture. I can see it again and again and again and again. It is played well by a good cast which does not make it very difficult to be stared to the star. <br /> <br /> A new widow's housewife can sell a pot for the end, a film or an action thriller, Americanized turd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A box of two old ladies and cornflakes ... (That's not a spoiler!)
