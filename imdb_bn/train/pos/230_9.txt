When I first saw this movie only, it became one of my favorite films. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duval. Draw a correct picture of the film south and racist attitude. Most attitudes came from SOL, an old planting owner who used convicts for labor. What makes Soll move, its fun ramblings then gave us insight on the way the south was back. I think if Soul survives today, he will be caught in Alzheimer's disease. Anyone who comes to work for his son and opponent is less complex in his attitude towards a younger boy. He has racist doctrine, he is raised to believe in all those who are guilty of black. He believes most of Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones) are most guilty. Between Ben and Soul is the best in conversation, they have real chemistry. Both James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler are both superb acting and smiling. <br /> <br /> This movie got more prejudice. But it is worth the DVD and money. <br /> <br /> Revin
