Directed by both Yudai Yamaguchi (Batterfield Baseball) and Junichi Yamamoto "Meatball Machine", apparently Yamamoto's 1999 movie with the same name is a remix. I doubt I'll ever have a chance to see the real, so I'll be commenting on this topic. What is the first of "Mtb Machine"? Nowadays pretentious low-budget art splatter flick is packed with great make-up effect and gore. It's not something you end up writing books, but if you're excavating such movies, it's also fun. <br /> <br /> "meatball machine" followed well-known plot. The boy loves the girl but a date is too afraid to ask her. The boy eventually met the girl. The girl turns her into a homicidal cyborg that is infected by a parasitic alien creature. The boy, in turn, turns into a thing said, and goes on a quest to save his love. Will he succeed? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In two leading letters. There is a subplot focusing on how her infected parasite came in their life. And yes it looks fortunately more violence. I'm happy. Acting is what you would expect from a budget splatter film. It's not painful for ears, but it's not good either. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of this movie is in addition to Violence and Gore (I have not mentioned enough) Cyborg Design Well known for those who work to create shameless animals and clothing for both movie and video games are done by Katia Amemiya. Nicrobars, known as "Macaw Machine", look amazingly in detail. Without using CGI Amemiya's designs is an exciting combination of meat and metal, their appearance is painfully horrible. Able to transform into various parts of the body such as sari, rocket launcher, blood-shotguns, etc. Although you can easily recognize film neutrality, but the good robor classes A-movie <br /> <br /> "Metallic Machine" "Tetsuo The Iron Man" is mixed with "Alien", all low budget and additional caching mode. This is a very entertaining movie that ignores modern special effects and proves that Splatters are still alive and kicking.
