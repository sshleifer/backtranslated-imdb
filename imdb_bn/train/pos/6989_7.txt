This movie was shown at the first episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this movie, I do not think of that wonderful TV series. I believe this 67-year-old public domain is surprisingly good for the horror film and surprisingly well with the picture and the horrible flick of 40. I actually saw Lugosi and his mischievous workers, including his wife, who needed fluids from the gland glands, the bride, an old thrust, and his two wicked sons, a huge monster, another ridiculous dwarf (from Angelo Rosito's 1932 edition) I enjoyed the lucky young female reporter, who is a stereotype type, but still interesting to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent movie is its plot, even ridiculous and incredible for a movie. I do not want to hide anything in this movie, so go out and rent it, or better, but buy it for a few bonuses.
