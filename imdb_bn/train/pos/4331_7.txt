Murder in Mesopotamia, I am always considered as one of the best pirot books, because it is very vague and it has a great end. TV adaptations are visually appealing, there is no doubt with some nice photography and very hunting music scores. Always unworthy as the David Sauce Hercules pirate, the episode highlighted during this episode of Pierreot's fight with mosquitoes, and Hugh Fraser as helpless Captain Hastings. Cast residual turn into modest performance, but do not overshadow two leads, some Christian adaptation is careful not to be a danger. This episode was somewhat vague, as a part of a tragic episode as five Little Pigs, which I enjoyed more than this one. In particular, it became unclear, when the music was kept aside when Louis Lidner saw the inside face inside the window. Regarding adaptation, it was fairly faithful to the book, but I would say that I did not like the three things. The main problem was pacing, it is slowly, and some scenes happen very little. I do not like the fact that they made Joseph Marcado a murderer. In the book, I saw him as a nervous character, but the idea of ​​killing him, and the developing under him made him less attractive, although I am glad he will not miss his drug addiction. . (I also noticed that writer Maradardo gets bullied in the book when he believes that he is the next victim of the murderer.) The other thing that was not so impressive I thought was that it could be more. If adaptation from Amy Lehner's viewpoint was effective, it was like a book, I was less sensitive to adaptation. Overall, despite some misconceptions by the authors, I like Mesopotamia Murdera. 7/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar.
