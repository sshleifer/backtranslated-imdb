This is a really fantastic and impressive film !!!! The location of Ripstain is spectacular, very detailed and well-lit, conversations unusually by Garcia Marquez, there is no doubt. Fernando Luzán and Mérida Pérezes gave amazing performance as Colonel and his wife. <br /> <br /> you will definitely see it !!!
