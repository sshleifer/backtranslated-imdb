I think Empire Cow is one of the best written and played "Drama" series to come to a network in a long written way. This show was huge and I could not wait to see it every week. It can be developed in a great primetime soap. We look forward to this kind of acting as an additional person, "Reality TV". I type of writing and acting that looks like Dallas, Notting Landing, Genital, Melrose Place, etc. for a long time. Monarch Cove updated this idea quite well and I expected it to be only good. There is a lot to expand with these characters and they were very interesting and engaging in their own rights. It will be a loss to explore and develop these characters and develop these characters and hook them up in their world after these characters develop. I absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious, attractive and sensuous without overboard or humiliation. Love it
