Well it's been a long year and I'm going to review the final film for 2004. Pangauo Su Suva (The River of Call) got second place in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival. Expected, it was not so good at the box office because it was very interesting for ordinary filmmakers, especially in the MMFF season where many families went out to watch movies. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to watch pornography or the non-English film on screen. I did a good job as a star and director of Caesar Montano. His great vision and creativity really helped in this film. He was very effective as a lead star and was able to express various emotional needs for the movie. Also played well was the young actress Rebecca Lusterio. He represented Durai's younger sister Bukkake. Perhaps I would like to see him in other film projects in the future, perhaps in other styles. I think that this movie actually helped her in her native dialect. <br /> <br /> Some of the camera shots in the picture have been very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the movie. I certainly will not be disturbed about the story of this movie.
