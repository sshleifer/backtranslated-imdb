I first saw this movie as a pre-teen, when the kids started thinking about their age. I was widely influenced by the views of the people and the children she raises herself as she herself. The eldest boy was excited that his mother is a prostitute and the same biological father (which Kuroshawa does not see anything like each other) makes it clear to any of his brothers. People still refer to the boy as he calculates his father with just one definition. The boy is all praised by the father, but one that still likes his brother. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br />> This is a great movie, even if it is not the best kurusawa movie.
