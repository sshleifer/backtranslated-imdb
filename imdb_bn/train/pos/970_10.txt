Now, I have seen many movies in my day, but some of them have been very well selected. And I'm a 19-year-old man who has directed towards a young audience influenced by this movie. It's a very underlying gem for those who visit foreign cinema. Almost all acting is credible, graphics is suitable (for which you do not care about the film you do not care about, believe me, the ugly about the graphics will be a stupid thing), the story is well written and this is a movie that everyone can not just enjoy kids . <br /> <br /> This movie originally made me here. This one, laughs me ... many, two, I have felt for your kind of characters, and three, it's a very upward story. At the end of this movie you will feel better. Of course, whatever an infant there is a great warrior and some great evils, whatever. This is a formula that is used a lot. However, in this case it is forgiving because they used dolls for some characters and some average graphics 5 years ago, but its appearance is not judged. It's very sensitive, the last is real, and it keeps you in the movie. But if you try to compare it with "The Never-Ending Story" or any other movie, it will make your opinion different. See it as it and you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's been a lot better, since I love it. The only other movie where I got this feeling is that when I came out after returning the TMNT method There's something about this movie that I've experienced about TMNT which really loves me. So do not over-analyze or take this movie seriously, enjoy it.
