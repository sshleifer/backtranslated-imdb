It is such a great film "Call me Anna" because it shows how many people have suffered to know what was wrong with her. The publisher of Patti Duke told his story to come out in front of the eye and tell the story of those who suffered from this disease. I have so much respect for him as a person. The only thing I do not like is that I can not get taped, I tried but successfully. Does anyone know how to get it?
