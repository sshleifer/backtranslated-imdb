In the public century, the first "side-story" of Gundam universe represents a new form of war between the world and the space colonies. In order to play an important role in the conflict, but there is no focus on a small group of people who see how daily civil population and fighting through their eyes. <br /> <br /> The story contains some hooligan staples, it was an attempt by a Geoan squad to hold an experimental demo, but it implemented this plan to implement this plan. This series focuses on the experience of a young boy named Alfred and a fellow pilot pilot and a young pilot named Barney Weasman secretly in his neighbor Christina Mackenzie. Alfred Barney develops "love of brotherly affection", when our young Geoan also falls for Pilot Cristina. <br /> <br /> "Pocket-in-War Pockets" proves that you do not need a detailed epic story about special people. For a good fight story. There are no uber ace pilots or large scale war to see here. This short 6 episode focuses a lot more on the emotional drama of character over other themes like OVA's Politics or Philosophy and I love how painted characters actually. Alfred is your ideal everyday child who plays violent computer games and thinks the Armed Forces are calm. Then he was given a crash course in the terrible reality of war. Unbelievable friendship and ties between Barney and Christina, the soldiers of different battles, who do not know, play romance with romance dramatic stuff and do very well. The same is true for loving relationships between Alfred and Bernie. Who says that I do not want to hide most of the stories here, but it is decorated that it causes a lot of heart rate to show the tragedy, which continues its emotionally devastating curve. <br /> <br /> Despite its lack of activity, this show does not fall into "boring" section. Characters are just compelling enough to carry the whole show. Do not worry about the number of mobile suite action scenes spread over here and there. Each is nicely animated on a level that surpasses an OVA and is sure to satisfy the hunger for some "compulsory" mobile suites in a thug series. <br /> <br /> Anime is usually seen in Japanese or English, I have to leave personal preferences. But in this case, I firmly recommend the English voice track on Japanese language. Not just the characters, who are all Cafsian without Alfred, they are more credible in English, but English voice cast performances are the same, and even beyond the Japanese, each character sounds with real emotions and words that they play in some live action TV dramas. <br /> <br /> In short, this show does not try to impress viewers. How it happened is a heartfelt theme that hurts closely at home, especially the death of the innocent in the battlefield, and the horrors of war with the eyes of a child. A real ongoing little story that gets more credits than that.
