Curseau, fresh in color, realistic themes of truth and perception of reality and dropped to Tokyo objects for despair. My opinion that Kurosawa stretches for a style, its antithesis- that means, I think Kurosawa wanted to make an ozzy picture. Badly ripe, poorly congested, this film is a rare bud in this intelligent body of excellent work. When Aikiru was very sad and depressed, it was funny and well, and the Stre Cooke dog depicted Japanese slums and social poverty without being too heavy or annoying, but Desu Kan has such cruelty that he can expect with him. There is no element of release of the pictures of the previous Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> Be careful, this film should not be judged by Kurosawa.
