All the sad people who complain about the dialogue, the budget, this and that's everything ... who wants to hear it? If you miss the point of this exotic movie, it is your loss. The rest of us who love this movie deeply do not care about what they think. I am a pilgrim, who has seen thousands of movies in my life and it is standing in my own book. It is not supposed to be a documentary, or a complete real calculation of what happened that night. It's the most amazing love story ever tried. I know it's 90 years old and the millennium is in anger, but let's get it. Somebody complained about this comment on the board that it is too much money! How is that hair? It creates bundles of money in every civilized planet on the planet and is the planet's top movie. I happily side with this time almost the majority. Okay, sir, while crawling back under your rock, I'm done.
