This is definitely one of the Jet's best efforts. Some actors can play stoic as Jait Lee. The action boosted the purpose of fire, and special effects intensity. As a result, it could take a little off guard of Americans. The slight suspension of disbelief in the Jat Lee film becomes longer. I think it is looking forward to creating an excellent role of jet work and more skill (especially boxing) in the US market. An excellent mix of gunplay and physical conflicts will satisfy enthusiasm to flare most action.
