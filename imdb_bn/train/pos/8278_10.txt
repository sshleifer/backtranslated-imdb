If you are not disturbed by the scrum or big studio's terrible products that are compulsive on this day, then you do not want to. Think about what this good writing movie told me. The importance of its meaning in our lives, how the child explains the world (and violence in it), the disobedience of our environment and its history and ignorance of legends etc. All here, but not flat on the surface. You can technically call it a "monster movie" however Wendigo does not eventually take up the physical form, and then even your faith as it is about you and your beliefs which are happening with the mythical spirit / animal. Some basic thriller elements that are just looking for basics and movies are never disturbed, although you actually see less than animals. Fasenden successfully used George Romero's policy as a parable and continued as a forum for discussion when he was still searching for us.
