Well here's another, good, romantic comedy ... but in contrast to this series, I've been away from what I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> I would admit I first wanted to see this movie due to Magn Fox, and Simon <br /> <br /> First, if you have seen a decent amount of cinema, you know that Sidney and Alison are together with movies, one street or the other. Together ... but at the end of the movie you did not know how to ... <br /> <br /> Well, now this movie has been made for Simon Peg. I can not see any other actors in Sidney's role and I'm sure that it will not be a very poor movie for Peg's superb performance. <br /> <br /> There are a few of the cool comic and jokes in this movie, which gives me the light of Simon Peg's character in the light of the scenes of Sidney ... but I think everybody in this movie is good. For example, Kirsten Donst is really strong in this movie (I do not usually think of him as an average law, but he was really good), then there are Jeff Bridges, there Jillian Anderson, and of course Megan Fox, who played the lost star Sophie Masse. <br /> <br /> After all, I do not generally agree with his rating on IMDB, this time I will agree with them ... <br /> <br /> go to Watch this movie, it's really light heart and positive, and I deeply recommend it ... My rating is 7.5 10 7 ... well ...
