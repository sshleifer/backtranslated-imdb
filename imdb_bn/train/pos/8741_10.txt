"A Bag's Life" is like a favorite candy bar - it's just a few small bits that add something completely delicious. <br /> <br /> The story could not be good; It has clever, "heart" (passion), and each character has a nice "pressure" (an increase or change). Comparing, the only characters in "Toy Story" have an "arrow" in the lightning, who learns to love a toy and Woody, who is beyond the annoyance of Buzz. There are plenty of sunny and cute moments in "The Life of a Bug". The actors perform great voice work and both motion and detail animations are superb. <br /> <br /> Left of this serious movie "10" "10" I deserve it.
