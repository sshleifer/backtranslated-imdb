In a certain amount, I really like this movie better than the original Vampires. I found that the movie be quite misogynistic. As a woman and a horror fan, I am using this reality that the problem of women is the staple of style. But they just slap Sheryl Lee around very close. In this movie, Natasha Wagner is a fully realized character, and the main bad guy is a girl! Arly Jover (who played Blade a Sidekick Vamp) is very weird and deadly. John Bon Jovi ... okay, yes, no great actor, but he's okay. At least he does not start singing. If you can catch it on the cable. It's on this unauthorized task this month.
