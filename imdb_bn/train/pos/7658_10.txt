<br /> <br /> I have seen this movie many times. At least a Dozen But unfortunately not recently. However, there is a scene that does not leave me at any time bound to my memory, where Mikey Rooney - "Killer Miyara" knows that he will be executed and it is nearing the truth moment, he will dance, cry and laugh, he sneaks from the haftia from Uphoria Read and sometimes carry emotional gambit. I have never seen such a brilliant performance by past or present no actor living or dead actor. Then I was certain that Mickey Rooney, yes, was "Andy Hardie" and a great gifted actor. However, I kept it, thinking about my thoughts over the years, I must be alone in this view. For the last time I watched this movie on television, after about 15 years or so, I wanted to read the old questions and a section of the Los Angeles Times. The question was revealed to Lawrence Olivia and the question was: "Mr. Olivier, you have been considered as the greatest actor of all time, whom you consider as the greatest actor?" His answer was, "Peter Finch and Mikey Rooney" I was surprised, but I was not surprised. I immediately flashed back to his "killer mears" and I felt very good to meet this great ability, and now my opinion is appreciated by the work of other whos I am appreciated. After the course "Bill" was very great and the moment with Mickey Rooney. This movie "The Last Mile" should be seen by all the acting students. I can not remember a great deal of film after all these years but Mr. Rooney will not leave me in this. If someone goes out, what do I think of this picture? I will be interested in hearing from you. My heart was set up alone for this picture, I just faced 10 of his performance.
