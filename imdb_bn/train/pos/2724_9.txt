In the end, classic films of the '60s did not have the power to disturb the viewers and face the audience. "Cold Blood" did not lose the ounce of its power. Its still good to make the visitors still forced to think. Some people have not only complained about the film, but the central message about the origin of truman caput's "non-fiction novel" is impossible. This may be true, but it is certainly an event where the lack of ambiguity is not cut off from the movie. Its refreshing, especially considering today's simple and fascinating moral drama, will not be forced to consider its viewers to see a movie with a strong political voice. To be honest, I'm not sure whether or not I agree with the central message of the film, but I appreciate his excellence. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with the anti-death sentence, the film has plenty of praise. Acting from two leads is awesome. Scott Wilson (still one of the worst actors) is a selfishist leader, who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake considers two people with conscience and one more person more modest. Perhaps there is a reason for his character, but he is afraid to go against Wilson (a good amount of homeopathic theorem in his characteristic part). Cinematography is awesome, smooth yet radioactive and really impresses the viewer watching a documentary. Add another classic score from Quincey Jones, and you have a great composition. (9/10)
