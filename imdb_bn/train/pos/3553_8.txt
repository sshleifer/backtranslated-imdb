Guys and dolls are a movie of conviction for a remix. It was done eight eight years ago. His two major stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Although a rebuilding box office with big stars can be a success, it can not capture the magic that has gone into this version. Its infinite power can not be restored, and you can get pure pleasure when watching something like this: A huge, widescreen, big entertainment movie. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (who is the last stop in 409 pounds. last time I heard) has played Sky Masters in the biggest gambler in New York. Frank Sinatra Nathan Detroit, whose often-as-discover-discover-a-escort-for-his-fist-game is famous for the city. However, when he is holding that place he is charging $ 1000, Detroit needs quick money. He gave Masters to 1,000 dollars in that he could not take Missionary Sarah Brown (Gene Simmons) to Havana the next day. <br /> <br /> <br /> Add it to fun, as it is here. It was obvious to see what a Broadway musical was like: there were not many sets and the scenes were long. If I complain about one thing, how bad the songs were. Occasionally, there were two songs in a scene; Another time, one went without one thirty minutes. Men and dolls are not boring, just a great time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Do not rate.
