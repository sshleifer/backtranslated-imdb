Compared to what Brian de Palma did in the 80's, when compared to what you've been doing for entertainment, his films look better and better. "Dressed to Teal", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarfus" and "Carlitos Way" are the best works of a filmmaker on top of their power. The guy was much better than average movies. This is a pure hitcock, which matches 80 dashes of liquid distortion, with lots of love and tender tones, great help in style, a stunning Pino Donogio score and a trashy, gaelo-inspired plot. Camera-work and delightful, bloody scenes help overcome logical holes, Dennis Frange, Keith Gordon (one of his own right-hand directors), Nancy Allen (at that time the wife of De Palma) and Michael Kain's great acting scene. Let the virtuoso take you to a surreal, scary, erotically charged ODC and you will enjoy each frame of "dress-to-kill".
