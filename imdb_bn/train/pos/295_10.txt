Bogdonovich's (mostly) unheralded classic is a film like any other. Because of the true Manhattan location and the use of "true" geography, it is actually a fairy tale feeling, but in reality it has played a strong role, perhaps I have ever seen the best position of filming in NYC. John Ritter reminds us that the good director (Bogdanovitch, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) he can be bright and the whole pair is a group that you really want to exist so you can spend time with 'em'. In the past 20 years, among some romantic comedians, the other does not seem to be transformed in any other way, after the fertile point of Hobodanovich's "success" career, when his best work was really completed ("St. Jack", "Long Last ...", " Closing announcement ".
