This was my favorite movie as a child, and I had been a few times in the stage product, so it would always be my favorite muscle and I suspect that anyone could ever recreate the story of the Oliver Twist, which is better than that <br /> <br /> <br /> All my time favorite beloved "bad guy" will be Oliver Reid as Bill Six. She was not afraid of my life only when she saw it as a 6-year-old, but now as a woman, I can convey more condolences to Nancy Character, Bar Maid / Prostitution, who helped Oliver to have a worthy life. <Br /> <br /> Jack Wild was fantastic as the artful dosher, and I do not think anyone could find him like Pocket Pictures of Street and find Fagin's best friend. Music is fantastic, especially in the number of Fagin, I am very thankful that they do not give a musical number of bill Sikes, it will not work being with such a sinful character with him. <br /> <br /> I think Carroll Reid kept a G rating rating in his fictitious disguise, but provided enough to show the violence of his bill. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is both charming, and a musical song as well as charismatic, as well as an ongoing drama that follows a young boy, where he tries to find out where he lives.
