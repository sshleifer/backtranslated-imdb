This film, short-term, a cinematic masterpiece. This image is removed wildly by intense images which have been moved deeper to the sensitive audience. The film is opened during Spanish Civil War because a group of children wants to take revenge on another child. In fact, they are acting in a version of what they saw around the world in adults around the world. Then we meet these three children again like children in Santorim. Here we see each of what their life has done. One is a sexually transmitted patient. Another man, who became ill, is hello. The third child, a young woman, has become a nun and is serving in SantoToam. This image is a fairy tale about the effect of violence on the mindset. <br /> <br /> This movie is a measure that is not meant for audience audiences, but it is logical and deeply moving. The acting is excellent and the script is quite well written. A musical score that provides an undercurrent of horrible throughout this film. It's not a movie to find thrilling, but a movie for a thoughtful audience.
