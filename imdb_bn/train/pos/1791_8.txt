This is not a deep movie; Most plots are predictable and "tried and true" but it did well and made some interesting points about how we can express regret (calling our "wrong" movie) as we look back at our lives. I could not read the book, so long ago I did not know that it is a story of a dead woman who has long been a strong memory that she did not really share with anyone. Thankfully, they got a top pure throw .... Marrell <br /> <br /> Streepe's daughter, Mamie Gama, playing young Lily, and then Murray appeared in the end of the movie like the old lilar ... In addition to an extraordinary similarity (dua! ) The little actress has done a great job (probably not until her mother's eligibility, but who?) In this movie everyone else was good, although I hope the glen is closed and the body is no Critical thinking was very dramatic. <br /> <br /> Girls' movies are more than these girls, but you are happy to meet your mother, or your daughter may start some dialogs. How difficult it is to know a parent as a "Father"!
