A few days ago when I saw this movie, my eyes were completely fixed on the screen. Its majesty held so much attention to my attention that I have focused my attention on it for the whole time. I would recommend not seeing this for anime fans, but anyone who likes a great movie time (or who really likes strange things). The art style is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbol between it is exciting. I've heard complaints about the strange insertion of English lessons in the film, but I think how it is the film's curious style supplement. The self-thankful story of "Acid at Hello Kitty" does not judge this epic episode of the epic proportion. I want to find more work by anyone doing this, and seeing them.
