I like this picture. I first saw it at the age of 20 (which was only four years ago) and I enjoyed it, the next day I brought my own copy. Comedy is well-played in all involved. Why Mr. Shanderara drink water at 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area, I have to always review it and have to resume the scene. Who also saw the father of Jason Roberts Play in Richard. The genius that ran within the family.
