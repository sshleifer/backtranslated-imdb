Gray Garden itself is a world. Edith and Little Eddie live in total separation near ice-cream and liver-pat eating in a temporary kitchen in their fairly shared bedroom. Mother Edith insults her daughter's statement after hearing about the cat. It should lead a Tennessee Williams game and stimulate the screenwriter and the dramas, because odd and overlapping conversations are 100% real. <br /> <br /> The situation of the house my grandmother and her 50-girl lived for a decade (even worse than they were). They all day, grandmother will talk about her glorious perfect past, when her daughter blames him for a missed opportunity with male, work, and self-expression. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to write this image must see such a mother / daughter relationship. It is sad and frightening, but filmmakers have found enough comfortable work to make Edison so unknowingly. It is very rare to show real life in such a way and even more important to be considered in context - the remnant of a strong family fades into obscurity among the skeleton of their own palace.
