When I was in school, I saw "an American in Paris" in his first liberation war and fell in love with him directly. I went to meet again the next day and lost in counting the number of movies I've seen in TV and TV. It's some of the best songs and songs used by the best-known musician of the twentieth century (George Garschwin), and show the characteristics of the greatest male genre (genuine Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. Oscar Levant's supporting actor George Getty (why he did not make more movies?) And Nina Fok (bright in disproportionate role) is at the top of his support. In the clearing ballet, unusually the title song musician, Parisian sights and excellent use of words and impressive and post-impressionist artists use the pictures beautifully. All the Gershwin songs are beautifully arranged, but the most memorable "It's Very Clear" (Carni and Kelly on the sine shirt) and "I Got Latham" (children in Paris joining John Kellie at "Uni Chanson America"). You love Paris, watch this movie. If you are not in Paris in your life, see. But see!
