I see broken people, especially if they do this in the best view of this movie but you take them to the disco club "Roxy". Especially during Christmas, because there is an "MC Santa Claus" present. <br /> <br /> Even if it is an old movie, even if I upload the video from the TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed its own big screen in the summer of 2004, I went there to test it. It's a lot more enjoyable on the big screen than the TV. <br /> <br /> Even if many people think of it on the big screen, it means that the money is wasted for the ticket price, I do not agree with this and I think when I paid my ticket, I found the value of the money, It's on the big screen, especially sitting in front of the movie, the wonderful experience and much better than the video.
