This is a movie that you might want to see it again. I particularly liked it, the last way. I did not see the end coming, but when the law was not blown out for the first time, a suspect would come back again. <br /> <br /> The story may be sticky and more emotional, but I understand that the story needs to be kept in viewers and the move was necessary for that. <br /> <br /> Michael Jr. was hard to believe, could be visibly disrespectful to blow his younger brother and mother. But, I can act in the scene, I could not really pay attention because it was a big story. <br /> <br /> Someone complained to Hongs as a gangster. I believe I'm not trustworthy. If his character is more difficult, then he does not care if his son does not drag any trigger. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was released in 2002 but I saw it for the first time on DVD yesterday.
