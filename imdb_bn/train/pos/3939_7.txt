According to John Ford's great shot, according to the legendary biology of Abraham Lincoln's life, his greatest mistake was the ability to drool and dancing on "the worst way." Ford's camera simply praised the publication of Lincoln's early life. But for the lack of complexity of film character, it creates beauty and depth of beauty. Unusually beautiful compositions of early films, superb can still be a series of frames, there is a unique look for a story from Ford. The song sings the hopeful young man's life. Henry Fonda is an impressive and spontaneous one, who is one of the finest actors in Lincoln. <br /> <br /> There are concerns about the trial of the murder of two young brothers, brothers, both of which claim are claimed. In the style of the classic angry rush, the city decides to take justice on their own hands and pairs them together, until the teammaker Abe is strayed. He laughed with their humor and said that it does not hide their first big case and it is better to compare them with them as a boy's lawyer. The next court-killing dramas seem to have been outlined, as if Abi Chuppach witnessed the judge, the jury and the city happily and laughing, he leaned on missing links. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> In spite of the feeling of 'Hollywood' film and the patriotic banner attracted to the future President of Lincoln, the film is completely enjoyable and enjoyably well-made, if you can take saline grains in your drama.
