It's a fine film about finding some happiness in everyday life. Pacing, camera work, passion, hunting musical scores and the perfect charm of this photo must be seen. It is not easily appreciated by imperfect or mentally stunted. The only flaw I can see about this movie is that it is not technically considered in the best film format. It also has Tod's, Technikolor and very good sound formats. (An intimate film can be made between seventy millimeters.) The effect of the fantastic Italian villas on its residents will be presented more humblely and the smaller beautiful moments will be even more beautiful to be seen and heard. As it is, it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film. I can not stop myself while watching this satellite every time. Free, transcendent and unbelievable characters always show a joy and I really should recommend it more often. <br /> <br /> Welding is perfect, mood is perfect, acting is on humiliation. It's a movie about the midway and human choices. It is deep and thoughtful without spectacular viewers. See it in one sitting and it has an impact on you. If you do not find it, you probably did not live enough, or something wrong with you.
