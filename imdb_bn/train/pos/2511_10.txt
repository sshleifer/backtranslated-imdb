I'm usually looking for this movie in fan obsession. I just wanted to check it. I did not expect anything. After all, a musician, an actor and a screenwriter? It is not possible for so much talent to live within a person. Right ?? <br /> <br /> Wrong! On one side of the perspective, it quickly became my favorite one! Story lines and characters are generally not hyped up to lose hyped special effects. The story plucks at your passion and pulls you along. As the roll by credit, you suddenly realize you were finally glued. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, acting seems a little over. However, I believe it is a very funny motive and very good character. Otherwise, I did not expect the witness level to be played. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing more than once. I lost consciously to myself or something unexpectedly that I lost or forgot for the first time. <br /> <br /> I completely recommend this movie. Feel free to go with your suspicions, but I'm sure it will find a place for your shelf.
