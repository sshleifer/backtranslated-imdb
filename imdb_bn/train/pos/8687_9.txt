This was the second entry in the regular Colombo series, and it remains good till today. I am now able to see it in DVD closely and see how it is made, I am in Bernard L. See how the killer post-killing activity was shown on the split-screen effect of two glasses, see how the murder itself is shown in Montage Fashion, point-of-view from the point of view of the corpse. See the shot. Also, the famous Jeffman Gil Milele's wild but impressive assent-guard musical score was incredible and helped to create the atmosphere. And the performance supported by Brett Hailey as a Golf Pro was amazing - a role and complexity that would be nine times nine to one-dimensional cutout. "This formula" has not yet been set when this episode was painted, so there are still some surprises in the Colombo method. Of course, Falc, Robert Kulp and Ray Milland are delighted to see the highest quality actors and their work - though all men are known from many other roles but still lose themselves in their characters. Above all, this entry in the Colombo series - and many more - very good features have been made as well as movies.
