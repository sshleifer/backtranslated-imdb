It starts with a series of apparently relative theft of the hostel for the students of Hikri Road in London. Mrs. Lemon questions her sister, asking Herakul Piret to see this matter. She agrees, but soon admits that girls are found guilty, she is not responsible for most theft, she is murdered. <br /> <br /> "Hickory decree dock" is a solid brain exercise, being as mind-numbingly complex as "one, two, my bucket bubble" Murder, theft and diamond smuggling involved crime, and the final bend that all relationships together are only expressed in the last 2 minutes! Characters are interesting, especially the Colin McNab of the Department of Psychology and mysterious American girl Sally Finch, Inspector Jap has made her funny moment (perhaps the closest "toilet humor" in this series) and Miss Lemon is an integral part. The story than usual (***)
