This very strange movie has made anything in the West. With its unhappy passion and visions, dreams, and the spectacular image net, its effect is both beautiful and unsettling. Actors are more dancers like dance than acting. This is the only dream sequence that I know is actually a real nightmare (sorry, Dali fans).
