This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid is running and convincing for a person who gave up his dream of baseball Pachter while leaving his hand on it. As a high school trainer, if he tells his players to win the departmental championship they will try for the baseball team. They win (partly because of batting practice they take a coach who can spend 90 miles per hour), and he is in favor of his contract - and is signed! <br /> <br /> If you ever try to do something new and awesome as an adult, then Jim Morris's story will be related to you. It's moving and inspirational, and the true ring of human relationships. <br /> <br /> The inspiration is the only reason I did not rent this though. This part of Dennis Kayyad is just neutral purdy, and the change of a diaphragm in a baseball movie with a handsome man is my heaven's idea. Ladies, if I feel your opinion, then check it out.
