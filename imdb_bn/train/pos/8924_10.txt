This movie is amazing. What is different from the other 50's science-fi is that the tribe has no characteristics, face, eyes, nothing, yet it can not be killed. I especially like the idea that this film does not take place within a few days, it is held one night, which lasted last night. It's also frightening that once Blob comes on you, you can not stop it. You're stuck on it, because it dissolves your body and gradually consume your body. My best-ever 50-plus science fiction film, and sometimes consensus is considered one. I can see why this rocketed Steve McQueen starred. All this and an interesting theme song! How can you make a mistake?
