This stupendous country's task was the original version of the 1914 edition (The Performance of Mary Pikeford), perhaps I could have rated it a lot, because such extreme melodrama and sensitivity were teenagers. However, by 1922, this image has already started showing her age. And m Compared to other Piccard movies (such as Daddy Langley's, Sparrows, My Best Girl and SUDS), TESS comes in for a short time - and each Picford movie is not more than 10 (even if she is "Sweetheart of America"). It does not have to be bad film - it's not. But, I can not see how many people have given this image 10. <br /> <br /> The film is very long and complex plot - especially Because most of the films of this era were small, a palace built on the top of the hill near a rich old crank river, and some dirty squatters who he hates under the mountain but he can not be deported, so he tries to come off the land in different ways. It was over when his daughter's drunken husband was killed in a quarrel with P.O. The son of my dear Mary, though she is innocent, to make things worse, the only witness to the actual murder will not speak and the dead man got her drunk pregnant! So, at this time, one of our innocent people, who is waiting for the death penalty and a pregnant lady is her "father -Mother on the road "fearing to tell his holy Father. There are tons more in the picture, as Crank's son is in love with Mary, but it's the best for you. You can only watch this movie for yourself. <br /> <br /> The image is excellent in some ways. The plot, while very complicated, is rather attractive and cinematography top notch. The very final scene is very beautiful. However, there is a lot of sensitivity that you can effectively operate with a knife. Mary is so good and so sweet and so lucky, sometimes visitors may find it a little difficult to take. Although it did great work in 1922 (making the world's biggest star), it is very date-wise. This is not true of all his movies, but it is definitely one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The age of film is very surprising. Also, the only included is a short photographer.
