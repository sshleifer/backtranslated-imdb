Five deadly genomes are not bloody and violent, like Ricky or Super Nijaz's story, but it has some series of fighting qualities from Hong Kong's best film history. Director Chang Che is considered to be one of his best works. This movie started five men's career in a poisonous game. Meng Lo still plays another bad ass. He will go to be Super Ninjas. Kui Chui who will take Philip Kovak into the story of Ricky and Hard Bailde. No chop socky fan can do this nasty. But I still do not think of Super Ninjas (made by Chang Che) as well. But all the chopsticks are good and this is one of the very best.
