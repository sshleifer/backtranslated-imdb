Reputation is not perfect between Facebook Friend Lawyer Adu L'Amy / Thief, but it is a handsome and entertaining romantic thriller French Algerian war veteran Allen Dellon and Charles Bonson have been trapped in the same basement vault, to return the stolen bonds. Clearing out two million in wages to sit on the other Christmas weekends. Naturally they are not quite easy even after opening the vault, leading some obvious twists and turns. On the side of the debit, there is a very wicked striptease scene in a car park, Branson used the most annoying phoenix-like cafferez using the Bridgish Fossi in most unexpected moments, which is probably the most secret of the art of the 1960s (it's like a warm woman) The wig is blown back on top of its head by a high wind), something of a liability ?? Her "I cook spaghetti! I will learn to learn love! I will read Shakespeare!" Is lecture hysterical in all the wrong ways ?? And this is shameful about the terrible end lines / shots, but otherwise it's a wonderful, entertaining and neutral number that's valuable to verify if you can get valuable prints. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack by movie-making UK DVD only offers English, but since Dellon herself and other casts are fairly well dubbed that it is not a great problem, especially since the widescreen transfers are quite good quality.
