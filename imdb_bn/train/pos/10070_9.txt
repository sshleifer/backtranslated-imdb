I was watching this movie in the video last night, I got this tingle which told me that it will tolerate. I have a feeling that I will meet this repeatedly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a story / movie that you might want to have all the uninterrupted attributes. And although some cultural references are unclear for me, a Western audience, at the core it's a universal story.
