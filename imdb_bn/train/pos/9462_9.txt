Clean family based movies. I laughed, I shouted ... I like it. I was worried that Steve Carroll did not see some drunk Michael from the office. Boy, I was wrong. He will win an Oscar for his performance. I would definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoys it and he is not in this "type" movie. I have seen this with two couples of the 30-year-old range and we all agree that we have seen it in a long film and it is obviously clear. Just 1 word! It's not sure why it was even PG13. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!
