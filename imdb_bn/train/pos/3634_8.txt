I was expecting less for this movie, but I was going to stand out in the evening. I went completely out of the theater and was completely amazed. This is a very fine baseball tribute film, and a wonderful lesson about following your dreams. Dennis Kayad did an excellent job about his role, and I was touched by his performance. Of course a full price ticket and a couple hours worth of your time!
