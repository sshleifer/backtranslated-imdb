This show is awesome! I was a fan since it's premiere, and it keeps me watching only ... I've seen some terrible things here that I do not want, but it actually shows you how addiction affects all involved, just addicted. You can look at addiction, shopping addiction, or addiction to various addictions, drugs and alcohol. And indeed, it is really tragic that some famous faces have seen. We have seen successful musicians, an NBA player and even young people who really need help. And since they started showing some follow-up, this is also awesome. Now, you can see how long they can see after they broadcast their ep. If you do not check out this one, please. It's an e, and it's awesome! New eps on Sunday night at 10PM EST, if I remember correctly ... so set up your TiVo!
