Only after thirty years of watching this movie again I was 11 years old and caught the flicker on South Beach at the Washington Avenue long-distance movie theater. In 1969, I thought where it was! There was a very good movie. Now, about forty years later, it was not as good. Times have changed, and this movie now has a tired old re-hash of war between generations. However, it is only a memorial that holds a place during the time. It's really interesting to see Mode Fashion, Old Vegas, a Slim Don Rix, chain smoking, and a hip opening song. Acting was honest, the script had some dates, but the memories were still fresh. Where it is, it may not be there for you, but for me it was still a nice and entertaining trip under the memory lane.
