There was a touch of Neil Simone's dialogue, and it is not clear from the lines that Walters Matthew and Jack Layman give in contrast to Old Coupons - a combination of humor and sadness that is entirely based on the belief that sharing these two friends is an apartment. <br /> <br /> Lemon agreed with Neutanic FÃ©lix Anger for suicide after divorce from his wife, and unexpectedly, with some harmful results of sharing an apartment with Oscars Madison (Matthew). It seems that everything is Felix and Oscar is on the wall and no one else can stand up to it, the Oscar's most tragic man is imaginative and contrary to Felix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The kabuton sisters in the upper apartment meet them for the date of dinner. Enormous contact between Lemon, Matthew and Carole Shellies and Monica Evans is enough to draw on to you. Gifted kabbant sisters voiced voice for the ghouls, in Disney's The Aristocats, and here - their comic timing at the top of the tragic story of Lemon's disappointment - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Matthu and Lemon have completely cast (although they considered the role of exchange before the film began), and of course, why it is a top Tayukta TV show has become so easy. <br /> <br /> Front: Simon Comedy at the top, do not miss.
