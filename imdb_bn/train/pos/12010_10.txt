Warning: Light spoilers. <br /> <br /> The history of American history and world religious history - Joseph Smith's story stands as a wonderful even even moving - episode. This film describes events in Joseph Smith's life, whom Mormons honor as the prophet of the restoration of the true church of Jesus Christ on earth. I have seen the movie twice in the first month of public release. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith's first three brothers (Alvin, Hurum and Joseph) who show at the youngest age. Very young, need an operation. The operation was complete, bloody and difficult without our modern facilities. The scene helped to reconcile the relationship between Smith's family and brother and the relationship between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent prayer which Mormon called the first aspect was strikingly illustrated. . The face of Jesus has never been shown, but you see the unreasonable nail sign in his hand. Many of the Religious Leader and her younger New York community have refused, at least a little bit, to marry Joseph's Emma. <br /> <br /> This movie does not clearly map events in the history of Mormon church, scene scene. This is not a criticism - just a note about the style. <br /> <br /> Long and flirty practice has been shown, and especially dramatic and running when Joseph delivered a speech about the love of Savior by the rescue victim, recently being attacked from the attack. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br/> <br /> This picture shows many scenes from Joseph's life, including some beautiful moments of his relationship with Emma. An attempt has been made to show Joseph the depth and complexity of his life, including his love for his wife, his intimate love for children, his intelligence, dirty and dangerous disputes, his religious feelings, and his courage in his compassion. <br /> <br /> Joseph and Huram traveled to Carthage, never returned alive, Joseph's life was touched by Joseph throughout the character of the film, the path shown, helped to strengthen what was already seen, but the final Set up to be more powerful in the scene Finally, martyrs of Joseph and Humor were portrayed, and the filmmakers were left to consider the events they saw. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the film, I think it was presented by the church to non-member Joseph Smith. I do not think so, though I hope the movie can do that. As an internal, I found that this film is celebrated by Joseph and we make the good things we already know about him. I'm curious to see how outsiders can see the movie - they can only see it as an epic story of America's religious man, or something else. <br /> <br /> This image is beautifully shot, family friendly, moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. These events in the United States of America have really happened, which are interesting to consider in the light of many aspects of our culture - there is freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) there is freedom for the law - we grant modern.
