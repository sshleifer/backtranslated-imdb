At the beginning of the twelve monkeys there is a story (probably apocryphal) about a exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam. Jilliam (Complaint) made a long list (think about the plane from the fifth element) and handed it to Bruce Bruce. It was titled "Title Bruce Willis Works While He Works". It ended with a simple message: "Please do not do any of the above in my movie". <br /> <br /> This film is sure about (true). Gilliam did not have a hand in writing. <br /> <br /> I would say that these two reasons are extraordinary (if not commercial) play a big role in achieving success. <br /> Apparently, twelve monkeys that we hope to come from the gilium film. This is Gilliam's supernaturalism and general (but superb) curiosity. Gilliam delights in his audience's wrong footing. No one has ever arrived before the end of twelve monkeys, but Gillam is taking huge amounts of credit from Kafka in the clock, bureaucratic movements of letters attracted to their fate. It is this journey, and the development of character that they bear, which is uncertain. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam films (especially Brazil). But they all tend to suffer from the same weaknesses. He has many ideas, and feels so enthusiastic that his films are often ended up as a garland (especially Brazil). I still maintain Brazil's tour de force of gilium, but twelve monkeys in the title planking section have a new air breath. Style, material and form are generally combined in a way that is not seen from pre-python. <br /> <br /> Whatever rumors spread over, gilium also manages to get the first rate (and very unusual) performance. Cold one out Bruce is excellent in this film, as well as all cast, especially a conveniently bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> This picture has been for more than a decade to be released. I saw it again, I realized that it was not really old. I have certainly changed. And this lets me look at the film with new eyes. It seems to me a worthy tribute to a movie that at least, a reflection of a mirror through at least the mirrors, the reflection of the changes, the change in attitude and the time we create. A first rate film. 8/10.
