In 1985 (my birth year) Steven Spielberg ordered a passionate and unforgettable story of a young African-American girl, Seli (the first role of Hypie Goldberg), whose life was followed most of the time. The story begins from 1909 when Selly is only 14 years old. He gave birth to two children for his father. Celie is a small sister Nettie with whom she is integral. A widow keeps her eyes on the leader but her father gives her a call. It started an era of horrific abuse and constant control. Females are less than men and especially African-American women have less right than their zero. The story of Celie's story is a true survival story. <br /> <br /> "Color Purple" is a master piece and underestimated film of Spielberg. He will also create more dramas that are a good idea of ​​"color purple" and "scandalers". <br /> <br /> Cast is excellent. Huley Goldberg is well-known as a sunny humorist but the role of role as Selly is an extraordinary sound that he can pull a really heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly nasty "Mr.". I have never seen such a bad role in him. Talk Show Icon Oprah Winfrey is a powerful deliberate bright as Sophia. <br /> <br /> WARNING! While watching this picture you are ready to make several tissues with you. You can really connect to the story of strong sisterhood. Especially if I have a close relationship with your siblings, please contact me with my sister. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
