The film went ahead to the story of the Cinderella in the early 1950's and was fantastic, if using the Isle of Man as the background. Ugly sisters have become upper-class English girls, and together with Catholin Turner's classmates, they wander in various wonderful clothes. The story has been revised slightly from the traditional version: Initially, it was combined with the "King Lear" plot, and Cinderella was strengthened further than usual. It looks gorgeous and works quite well throughout the whole, but go to the top at the time.
