This Columba episode is probably notable as Steven Spielberg's director as one of his early films. The role of Jack Cassidy should be considered as a murderer, who killed his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy will be in Colombo later. Finally, fill out the match with the character of Colombo Jack Cashier. He is a mystery writer who plots to perform the perfect murder. After her first assassination, her next victim will be the owner / widow of the annoying General Store who blackmail her for money. Instead of losing more money, he killed him. It's always very entertaining to watch Cassidy and Falk as always. Seeing this episode such as Colombo, Fakk can see this episode repeatedly. How to forget the television in today's years is people want to watch the show again if they like the character. Who is it, why and why, it is the identity of Columbus and its opinion that does not score high with the audience like me.
