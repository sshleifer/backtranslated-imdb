James Cagnani's kiss and energy or face - it is difficult to say that it is hard to stop, barclays Berkeley's three grand showpiece closes. I type it a tie, the funniest and fastest of the first 30th musical instruments of the football parade. Although the film is clearly involved in Cagan, Juan Blondell added the story of good nature. <br /> <br /> What is the line of the story? It's about Chester Kennett (Cigoni) who made a musical instrument and is now out of business while taking the tableaux. He started temptation, music music entertainment on stage before the start of a movie. He gets bigger ideas and the idea to move around them, more countries around them. He needs a sense of fire and ideas, and all the ideas that he can continuously get to keep productive of these things. But a rival is spying on her and her ideas are stolen; Nan Presskote (Blondel), his knowledgeable cracking secretary, loved him but he was very busy; The Black Remembered Officer's daughter, round glasses (Ruby Keller) wants a chance to dance; His wife said, she is not divorcing her after all; A blonde gold digger is putting her hook in her; His companion is cheating him ... my lord, what's next? All these can be very digestive words, but everything can happen quickly, such as Cagan jumping, strutting, striding, finger-snapping, annoying orders and occasionally - until he finally sings and dances out all - doing a step Or two to show exactly how it is. Instead of "<br /> <br />" let's have a show, gang ", we have to create three shows in three days, so close the door and start the game again. "These three super progloos will show 40 Korean, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract with 40 Kent Units in the room ... the entire Apollo Film circuit! Fatigue reduces fatigue, foot pain, but all of the sophisticated chorium Anne Sotheby's and Dorothy Lemo are included); You can find the quickest but Lamo ur can be more generic) Surely, watching dancing, screaming and shiny and extraordinary disgust in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Then the screen gets up, each temptation is presented in separate movie houses, one on one, Apollo circuits Owner determines that night he will save Chester's skin or not. <br /> <br /> "honeymoon hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keller for the first time is 9-minute production. There are many beautiful sex, brides and girls (some may be married), bedroom and beds, and the door "Do not disturb" signs. <br /> <br /> then in the next theater and 11 minutes "by Waterfall" Warner Bros.'s accountants are concerned about bankruptcy. This number is so much - Swimmer girls, trees, fountains, a huge groeto with a search of water, a giant pool - you never thought there was any depression. Berkeley preserves all his strategies - synchronization, human traits, legs and arms make perfect things of all kinds - and he does it in water, looking for plenty of water photography. Girls sure to play They smile with their eyes in the water and still hit their mark. The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and tedious. Ruby Career, who has kept a few quick shots in the water, is considered to be the only caution. <br /> <br /> Finally, the debris ends ... 11 minutes by singing the Ciguni dance and singing "Shanghai Lil" with the carer, with all bar girls and their customers, nations that are unnaturally mingled. Dancing on the cage and cavern bar, dancing on a table, Cagney War. Fifty or sixty March marine looks like, leaping behind, rifles burst and caught. Then ... that's true ... Franklin Roosevelt and NRA Eagle are a human image. It is the only musical production in Hollywood which is sometimes featured by Roosevelt, a large federal agency and a ghost of sexy Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It's entertainment, folks. It's awesome! <br /> <br /> Of course, Chester's delights get a big deal and nan chest gets. The movie is full of juicy clich√©s that makes us smile. Ruby Career is so respected that she spread her hat with her weapon so that you want to help her. Joan Blondel has forgotten about many of our Hollywood women who became more beautiful but who had a lot of intelligence and personality. The film, however, is related to Cognizant, who holds it down and reduces it, and Berkeley, for which there was never too much.
