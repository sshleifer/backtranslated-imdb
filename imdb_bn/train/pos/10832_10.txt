If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy this great movie about Stephen Rey's main role. This story is about the most famous rock group of the 70's, weird fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there's going to be many problems during their concert. Jimmy Neale and Bill Nigi are excellent, and the songs "The Barnes on the Flame" are perfect. You have to watch it.
