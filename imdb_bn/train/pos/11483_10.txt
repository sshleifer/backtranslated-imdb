This film makes it so scary that it portrays Andrey and Calvin (relatively) as normal boy. These are not those who roam around the camera, forget the scripted lines, etc. They are making videos just as a diary for 'living people' to make their lives look normal. Their parents just think that friends family are filming for a family video. Andres and Calvins (usually a stupid 'This Old House') can see the video, learn how to learn what else Andrea and Calvin can learn and how they can create other children by attacking other children in their school, getting bombs, arms, And zero days (attack day) not caught before.
