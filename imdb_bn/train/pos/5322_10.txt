A true dark silent film and a very graphic film, a fairytale folks who have been too late. Stylish surprises are some really nice scenes as can apparently be done with a minimal budget. Gareth Maxwell Roberts and the team's full marks, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, although it is hoped that more British actors will be great. Lisa Ray did not meet her before and hope to see him again in the future. The subject of all interesting sex, drugs and violence. Bring it. I would definitely say to rent this one and if you check it out in the mood for a semi-moody look.
