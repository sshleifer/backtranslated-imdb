"Guy Guy" may not be classic, but it sure is a good, funny comedy. This plot is Paul (Jason Lee), who woke up early in the morning without any memory, and Beki (Julia Style) was lying naked in his bed. Before he could understand what had happened before, he drove Baker out of his apartment because his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) was coming. Then, as you can imagine, chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> "A Guy Thing" almost laughs loudly every single scene distributed. The most fun moments have come from when you imagined what could happen when Paul told Kerane. Selma Blair is truly talented comedian, and the worst thing about this movie is that she is unused. Although, he has become more fun than Styles, it's not really interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "a geek thing" is not a classic, but it's not bad, 7/10.
