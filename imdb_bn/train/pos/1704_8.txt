"I moved here to get away from such things!" Small town Sheriff Lammants <br /> <br /> "A lot happened in Chicago?" Her deputy asks. <br /> <br /> Not right, no. The plot is a group of martians, a Halloween rebellant in Osaron Welles, a World War, mistakes the real Martian attack, and they need to reach their footsteps! There is a bunch of miscreants involved in Martian's attempt to win the "Big Bean, Ile" town. All of us say that without wearing a baby in a duck case, except for the kids, Sheriff's daughter and her friend, they are really good clothes. <br /> <br /> Martins are ridiculous to themselves, and you think that they have no threat to anyone but the superb first on themselves. This is a fun family movie.
