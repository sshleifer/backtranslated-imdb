........... when I watched this movie) I will not watch this movie again because it is not a bad movie, but it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 years old when my English teacher decided to show it to me; The reason is that we read a quote from the book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We have something terrible that We were scared when Kid found a toy soldier under his pillow, and he heard a child's voice, "It's for you". This scene still threatens me this day, after about seven years I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> Skip this photo if you are easily scared !!!!!!!!
