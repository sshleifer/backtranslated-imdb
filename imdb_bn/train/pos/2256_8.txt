Van Damme's partner and friend / trainer / and most of his films did not know what to expect from the Warrior Corps. It was very nice to play "Tong Poe" in "Kickboxer and other Van Damage Films". Now he's own He and his wife have created a wonderful team. This one was led by QiCi director and bad guy, and he really meant that, most of his scenes were not needed for his wife writer, producer and management, which did not require action. He also did a good job editing the film. Together they did very well. The story was understood, the war scenes were well educated, the Leads were real fighters and well looked together - the story came together well, and if you can make it shameless ... no bad language, no gender, just steps A new one on me Check it out !!!
