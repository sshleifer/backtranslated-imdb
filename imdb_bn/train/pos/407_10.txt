O my lord ... just let me breathe a minute. This movie takes you on a great ride and lets you go until the end of your face. Movies for these stereoids and such fans. Zu's legend was made nicely, although I did not like some things, they used to use stand-ins. I wanted to watch the real man fight but, oh well ... some were frustrating a little, and I did not see it again until I saw it again, when you understand it more then it takes ** ** completely! To see this movie, I encourage anyone who wanted to see the real Asian film. I will give one of my highest ratings to this movie. Go and see it when it comes to America !!!
