I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I have not seen it yet, but really anyone who gave me money to show me drunk. Especially what we consider that year. The thing is probably they are on editing it. Especially in that scene where my roommate was snorting a Mexican prostitute's coke, (perhaps they should almost follow her). We come in a few and present, but I can not remember anything other than that. I was MC in some scenes (from what I said.) I can tell you that everyone avoids the camera crew because he wants to remember the person who has thrown him, who showed his tits to the world (or the girl who lost her virginity) The trip itself was crazy overall but the camera once worked on them.
