"If I sit and I will never stand again", the mother (one of the title) tells her son that she will take some rest (she is only a widow). That means, the rest should be a woman of her age and in her condition: to remain in peace, to neglect herself. But he still does not have the mood for "rest". She also has a daughter who condemned her for every disaster in her life ... Suddenly this revelation occurs: More than 30 years of a muscular curcourt sex and emotion (Daniel Craig, brand new James Bond) when he thought "Someone touched him again Will not " This is a story that reflects on a number of topics, especially a woman of 60 what should she do with her life if her husband dies. It does not look that we developed such aspects as that. I mean, some would not be surprised when San Connie has a love relationship with Catherine Jetto Jones in a movie ... but if you think otherwise, what do you think? An old woman, a young man ... no, you are not ready for him, <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie has incoming tones along the length of the story, but without breaks of 2 or 3, the tone breaks and Out comes in some obvious and messy mouthed dialogs. That rude touches and the boy and girl find their mother's love relationship (pretty strange - what can I mean when you see it?) "Mother" is the only contradiction element. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
