I enjoyed this picture, probably because I did not see any reviews, etc. It was delightful and a 'roop' I do not know why it does more than splash. As far as the story goes away, I used to be concerned about some aspects of Paul Reiar's character, and I can "see my father" in the character of fakk. I remember a lot of times when I was a small child and my grandfather was very listening. If you enjoy movies like the Gucci Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. A "sleeping", my opinion, and those who are good-looking stories Peter Fock and Paul Reusser had very nice oral tissues, but nothing was finished. I would say it at least an 8, probably high rate.
