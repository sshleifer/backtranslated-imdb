The film was a cause for my interest, mainly Diane Keaton is my favorite actress. I do not agree with some other posts because the plot is not contracted. I did not have any problems following it (probably some humans had night eggnog too early). The movie was very sad and touched as well. What else do you want to do? Alexa Davalos is a fine new talent (very nice), and Tom Everett works well with Scott as well as his part. The relationship between mother and daughter was a bit unrealistic, but the youth of the movie did not have the behavior. It was tragic but sad. This TV show ensures the beat of other shows in New Year's Eve
