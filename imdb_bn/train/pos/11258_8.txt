Spoilers! Classic 70's Sex Trash! The Swedish gallery (Helga) made this movie so great. She was beautiful, but she really did not know how she was having sex. She exuded a huge amount of sex throughout the film throughout. Her best view was when she, er, excited herself. Whenever he was on the screen, I became a transfix. <br /> <br /> Also, the doctor Julia (mother of the iconic male focus) was very funny. Although most 12 year old girls have big breasts than Julia, they knew how to use a little part of it and its scenes (especially silk blouse and black skirt scenes) steadfastly captured my attention. You will love the main hoaky scene where the bat robs its Nickid; I do not know whether I've seen some more ridiculous yet sexy at the same time. Classic stuff!
