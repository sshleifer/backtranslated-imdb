I was a child .. mad about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance .. He was and the greatest of all times. A few days ago a friend gave me a gift ... "Munwalkar" DVD .. I could not believe it! So I took my time and saw the movie again. After many years, and it kicked me back in time. I cried almost. Not because of Michael Jackson, but when I went to his concert in the old old bars, I was more than remembering music and dance. The film gave me more perspective than ever before, when I was a child. You can really see Michael that parody went through his life. Thank you for the return of Michael Jackson to that great time, for your great music and dance. It's embarrassing that people have forgotten you .. I did not because you gave me a great moment with your music .. the best of you for the best where you are there ..
