First of all, I'm not just a Justin Timberlake Fangil, he's involved in looking good, I'm not even a huge Justin fan, but I like this movie. <br /> <br /> I work in a video shop and when I saw this movie with his huge cast which I never heard of, I saw what it was about. I did not find Justin's bad acting, it was the worst side of the group, but it was a fantastic fascinating group, Curie Elves and Dylan McDermott were two names that were not even on the first credit list. The story is original, a journalist uncovered by corrupt police, but I found it to be a good work. The character of El El Coolhey was obviously contradictory, but I could not really tell what he did. Morgan Freeman is always there, he has done so well with a wise counselor, and as much as I love Kevin Spacy, he was right there. The character of Hijar was not a lot of substance, but it was Kevin Spacey, he could not make any mistake. <br /> <br /> I wonder, Dylan McDermat has given the best performance as a Homesidal Police. Really credible and in character, he freaked out a few times to me. <br /> <br /> I was really hoping to be honest enough to cheesiness. Awesome catchphrases, order of irrational action, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and I did not find any. Each shooting was a dot, it was not clich√©d, it is really hard to hard. <br /> <br /> Overall, amazing cast, decent story that interests me and keeps me going a long way to jump. I do not know why it did not appear in the theater, it is better than some garbage seen on the big screen. I would say value to see it.
