Set in 2017 (although it can easily be forgotten for 1987, but it is judged by hairstyles and clothing), The Running Man is the All-round good guy Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger) who made it for the crime he did not do. After a brave prison break, he was captured and entered into a brutal TV show show The Running Man, some fellow feathers, and a fantastic token woman, Amber (Maria Koncta Alonso). <br /> <br /> used by the proletariat as a way of controlling the public, the colorful (and often a few camps) rival opponents, is guilty of style of each unique carnage: Dynamo flows electricity from a special case, Buzso Using Censo, the sub zero has a razor ice hockey stick, and a fireball broker Lamatharara like. But these killers are not a match for Ben Richards, who arbitrarily dispute (according to each compulsory diversification). <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Ben joined a group of freedom fighters. A fight against the authorities, and the show's nasty host, gets right revenge on Killian. <br /> <br /> Twenty years ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger's work-universe ruled the universe and, his soldiers, fans could not make mistakes. Austrian Biffhek was a successful formula that almost guarantees box office success for his movies: comic book violence plus logic-free plot plus beautiful woman sideklick plus wi one-liner, minus playing ability is equal to massive profit. The Running Man has followed the blockbuster recipe of a blog faithfully and Arnie (most male teenage) audience uploaded it (including myself). Now, two decades later, and for the first time in a year after the film is over again, I found it a weird movie: apart from a completely technical qualification, decent acting, and convincing effects, it is absolutely complete entertainment. Adapted from Paul Michael Glazer's directive (known as the 70th cop show, Starceki and Hutch Ditt. Best known as Dave Starceki) and short story from Stephen King (written under nomination papers, Richard Bachman), The Running Man Chess 80 is an incredibly cheap and very date-oriented Both are seen, but despite the image's badness (or maybe because of it), it is a special charm that describes Difficult. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to create realistic near-future settings, the film offers lots of strangers and giggles. Look at the scene that discovers Amber's secret cache of ben banned cassette tapes (!)! Curiosity used on advertising billboards and running man board games (as a graphic designer, I found this particularly fun) is wonderful in shit 'future' graphics. Be surprised to see the spontaneous lack of technical progress. <br /> <br /> The Running Man can be completely rubbish, but it does not hesitate to suggest support from Annie and Sci-Fi Action. In general.
