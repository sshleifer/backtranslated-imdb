I and my girlfriend, Anat, saw this together and we both will comment. <br /> <br /> Although we had some freedom with Dicken's work, we both loved it. Many of Dicken's works are somewhat dark and great (including the Oliver Twist), but this movie has changed it all. It was funny, colorful (both apparently and musical), and the letters are more light. Tvs: Generally, I do not care too much for musical and dance movies, but the tunes of these productions are interesting and vivid, and the dances were excellent. <br /> <br /> <br /> Enayet: Truly many coming from trussies. I can not emphasize enough how the number of dance was really good. For example, you can say that these guys really worked routinely for free. <br /> <br /> Tragedies: Three actors really came out of IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reid), and Artful Dosage (Jack Wild). Man, that Oliver Reid can really make a good villain. One of the scenes where you saw his eyes, the mail slot cooled me back ... pretty. And that baby Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when she died). She could sing! There is welding section Kudos on their choice. I hate the boy Oliver Twist. She was very whiny and wimpy for my taste. (I put him in the mud of Bill Sixt's wishful chase scene.) And they too could not sing him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actually it was fantastic. In addition to the three stars of the trips, I think Ron Moody (Fagin) did a great job. He was very funny, and at the same time very light sinister. Supporting actors were very great. Harry Secombe carried out very well in his Mr. Bumble role. And he has a wonderful singer voice. I am Sekemeb played in another film titled "Davey" where he played an opera singer with delightful results. Gifted Harry should have been in a lot more movies. <br /> <br /> Trevise: As I mentioned earlier, the book is not true for the book, but IMO was even stronger. This movie was not boring, as it seems to be some musical instruments. And the continuity you keep with the characters move right along. The tunes are not deterred from intrigue or too much sleep. <br /> <br /> Anonym: Travis is absolutely rare to see any musical movie. And this one really is a rare find. This is a very easy-to-use watch which carries the audience easily and enjoyably to the end. It was a refreshing interview when one day when the films seem to have a harmonious effect. <br /> <br /> Our combined rating for this was 8.5 out of 8.5 (we will round up to 9 in this case.) <br /> <br /> I rated it 7 because the main ovulate twist ( Mark L.) teased me, and his songs tortured me with extra sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an outstanding movie. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is 10. No better movie is available. And everybody involved in this product can tell what it was ... it's a wonderful composition. <br /> <br /> Please do not miss it ... even if you do not usually like music. It's really a rare behavior.
