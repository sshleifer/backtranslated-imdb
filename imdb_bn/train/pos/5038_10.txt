What a real behavior and quite unexpected. This is all about what a real thriller movie is about. I entered the video store, grabbed the movie after reading the entire blog block and hoped for the best. I was completely amazed and delighted. I really enjoyed the actors and their character. I gave them all a great performance and made their characters realistic. The plot is well thought out, well written and directed. It is interesting to get you started from the beginning and never gets annoyed for a minute. <br /> <br /> I especially recommend this movie as thrillers, especially thriller thrillers that you feel good and who keep your attention. Of course, 10 to 10
