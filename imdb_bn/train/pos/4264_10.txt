I got to see this image twice or more and it's well made! WWII ended abruptly and is going to start the so-called "rock war". Therefore, this movie can be made as one of the best "campaigns", patriotic films, and secondly, the "Western NATO Block" will be formed to face the next generation. This film celebrates America's power through the centuries, which later came forward to the present war, which ended. Excellent and ridiculous way to discover the American continent of Columbus and buy "Espysod" from Sunder Amsterdam and purchase of Matl√°n from local Indians. It must be seen (at least once, promoting through time for fashion curiosity)! :)
