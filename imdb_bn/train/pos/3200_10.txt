This is a great Canadian comedy series. How the movie is played by Jean-Paul Trumple- (Julian) and the main author of the show and how Ricky and Bubbub stars starred in true life trailer parks as the true satirical look and at the top of the trashy hoods' designs. The film will tell you why Ricky and Julian are starting their better program in the crime world. Why and behind everything will be a spoiler so I will not give them the real reason behind the more brilliant escapades. Their friends and past partners (bubbles) are a brilliant character. You will not go to see a bit of seat-less for the whole event, and the missing movie. It's a brilliant irony on a capital city and an imaginative trailer park with small time crooks while living and small but in a big time dream. If you ever have an opportunity to watch - Buy - steal this program. You will be happy to do this. And my American friends --- it will break you up. 9. Out of 10 How to tv tv
