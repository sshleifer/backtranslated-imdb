This film was really eye opening. I saw this image several times. First, when I was four years old and then I really thought and at the age of 12, I thought. The message that the director is sending is the wrong or wrong way to wake up and leave God out of our daily life. Extra mile to insult him <br /> <br /> A great movie for non-believers and believers!
