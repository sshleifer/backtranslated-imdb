Although the central side of the story, Gardania and Dukakis are good opponents for them - here in Lorenzo and Ronnie will be there in 50 years - still love. The whole cast Aiello does an excellent job to John Mahoney - it shows a real slice of life. Although I've seen this long ago - I'm glad that he surrounded Cage for the transplantation where he was recognized for his talent in Hollywood. From concerts to opera to kitchen table arguments - this is a very entertaining movie.
