How nice! <br /> <br /> This movie is the best living rule, I think, what happened in New York on 9-11-01, showed anything by the main media outlets. <br /> <br /> Those outlets can only show you what happened outside. This image shows what happened inside of you. <br /> <br /> It starts with the fireman's focus in New York, the wait for the first big fire to start waiting. The items suddenly hit the towers for the first time. Then you are given a front row seat as racing in the Tower One's lobby, in front of the firefighters scene. <br /> <br /> Before the second plane crash and before the towers fall, you respond to the boring word of the people coming to the lobby. This is a scene that you will not forget soon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best documentary film ever made. <br /> <br /> We must not forget <br /> <br />
