"Curious Couple" is a movie that has exceeded its fame. Everyone knows that they play the theme song, they complain of living with a vague "Oscar" or a weak "Felix" ... but they do not know the film selling it. It is not only a handsome person living with a cunning man; It is a portrait of two friends who help each other through divorce trials. It is impossible to start from the beginning, but it is a comedy that is realistic, stressful, and usually only comes from the awful situation. So, some viewers actually thought the film was somewhat uncomfortable, but I think its width is its strength. Mouthful buldog face looking at me! My favorite comedy, by a country mile.
