Plots are never a strong point in the film of Fred Astyar and Zinger Rogers, but the play of "Follow the Fleet" is exceptionally moderate. Fred and Ginger are all right - they are "Beck" Bakar and Sherry Martin, a dancer whose personal and professional partnership ends with joining the Navy. When they meet again, their love-hate relationship creates some recreational trick moments. But for most of the movies, they took Sherry's sister Connie (Harriet Hillerd), a relation with Smith at the navigator (Randolph Scott), another woman in Bilej, and a busy bay for her love for an old schoolboy inherited from Connie. Father. Although Hillier is rather charming, the plot is reluctant. <br /> <br /> But at the same time, "Flow of the Fleet" is fortunate enough to score a Berliner score, which gives them plenty of opportunity to showcase their talents. . Astaire "we saw the sea" and "I'd rather lead a band" gets two good solos. He expressively songs and of course, electrifyingly dancing - and naval suits make him look a little more boy and athlete than usual. Rogers grabs the attractive "Let's Gear" song and later dances solo solo in the same melodrama. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The three simultaneous pictures have really been saved, though they have all been fooled into the plot. Fred and Gada won a dance competition by an energetic routine of "Let's Gou" another revival. Later, they sing and dance "I keep all my eggs in a basket" as if it were the first repeat of the number, humorous screenplay. In the end, the movie is finally portrayed as a romantic pair of evening dresses and ginger - it is part of show-in-the-show. The situation has been adopted, however, the song "Let's Fash the Music and Dance" is one of Berlin's most beautiful things (it is memorable of Cole Porter) and it combines dance.

But I could see the song over over.
