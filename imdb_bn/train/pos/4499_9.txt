This secret story of interdependent love, jealousy and revenge was more enjoyable in DVD years with more intense images and Krsna's words after its PBS broadcast. My only reservation is that the plot is a few unlikely moments and some strong Manchester manuscripts are sometimes difficult. Thankfully, even here a word is missing and fun will not be lost: the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Greene is a breakthrough smile, his role as a torn mood and a young surgeon brings to an athlete physicality, who was frustrated with his boss's wife at the hospital where he started work. Franciska Annis is the most fantastic 50-ech woman fantasy; Her performance is rival of her beauty rival. (The love scenes between these two look better than the words of less than words!) Each helpful letter is drawn intensively and is illustrated exquisitely. Additional blend of Pithy dialogue and enthusiast makes this a delightful miniseries. Russell Baker mentions in his introduction that you can not improve morally by seeing "reckless" - but you will have lots of fun. (A part of the DVD box set, it provides a wild but satisfactory two hours of denudement. Do not miss it if you want to enjoy it.)
