George Lucas used to walk around the world with this young man when Saga was involved in the Chronicle of the young Luke Skywalker and the infamous Dithendar, but for 20 years I can still appreciate Lucas and the incredible talent. Imagine he was happy with. A New Hope in Lucas showed a new way to tell stories, as well as with our memorable characters like our lucky princess Lia, Ragish Han Solo and Prakriti Luke Svawalkar, along with famous villains Dart Warar introduced our memorable characters. Empire Strikes Back He went all out to show us the special effects can add a story and someone managed to have you managed to screen someone. He made a film with a certain end or start and it went down to a treat. Jedi's return is a Saga's appropriate fee. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And because the young man stopped from discovering a terrible truth about his father, we thought that things were getting worse and worse. The day began to win them. How did we ask the rebels to recover from this storm? In the stunning and impressive final chapter of Lucas we are placed on the edge of our seats, in response to Habe's death, the death of Luke and Oder from the brave rescue is hiding in Russia's final climatic war, because Louis and Jaddie and rebel fighters and he believes that he is good to resurrect Trying still in the spirit of his father. <br /> <br /> Reconciliation for a final fight to end all the war for a new war for old man Smooth Conversation Lendo Calicenan and Loving Forever Chubcacha forever! The dangerous enemy is raised as an emperor (Bright Yan played by McDermid, the mystery that how he missed the Oscars.) Frustrating to turn Luke into a dark side, even his apprentice betrayed Dirt Warren. The black, spooky white masked face and sinful smile with his red eyes, he is a fearsome addition to the real story and the master of the festive events, the master. His new and improved Death Star kept disaster for rebels, but the brave party carried out the last major attack to end the reign of imperialism. <br /> <br /> Lucas has been able to add three different stories at once and continue to act so that the action continues. Han and Lia Han and Liya tried to bring down the slope around the slope of the star around David Star with the help of EOKO on some grounds, such as with the help of some Evoque (I really do not believe in the movie.) Actually, I think they are at the helm of the war and Death Star. ) And interrupted by the StormTopers and Imperial Officers. We are shining on London and other pilots when they took the risk of destroying powerful empire fleet and risk life and limbs once and for all in the Dayton Star. And we look at the clock with breathlessness, like Vadar and Emperor Luke are trying to turn on the dark side, yet he is trying to get his father back. <br /> <br /> But the most difficult and still compulsory battles for me went to the dark hurdle. Emotions and feelings for ROTJ are a fight. His loyalty to Imran and Empire and Bhadra among his father's tendencies were caught. I do not think that a mask may appear emotionally, but how somebody might be hiding, but at the last moment, there is no pain and pain on Bhadra's face. I have more depth and passion than the villor, I believe Wilne, especially people on multiple machines, and I think that makes them accessible. He is in conflict. Apprentice as much as the master Villeen as Victim Ultimately, the ultimate view of Bhadra is the most impressive and surprising quarter of the quarter without destroying. <br /> <br /> So what can I say in the conclusion? George Lucas Master of the Sea. Star Wars is one of the most exciting and exciting SAGAS that I've seen for a long time and I still can not see it yet another Saga rival. Jedi has all the elements necessary to provide Lucas Masterpiece worthy of the back end. It rolls into action, mystery, romance, tragedy, release, joy, and its memorable characters, wonderful special effects and interesting music create a great movie in their own right, and ultimately Lucas can be proud of it.
