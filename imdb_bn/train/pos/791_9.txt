Before watching this on the Riyaton channel, I have seen this film as a lovely, talented and rich film. <br /> <br /> Welding was nice. I loved all the characters, they were a little exaggerated in place, (but this is a picture). How it looked and enjoyable journey, took the original character until it turned out badly, could do the real life and do it. Yes, I thought Andy McDowell was superb. After this movie was started once I was interested in watching this movie because people often used to have fun about their acting ability (I got this opinion because she is always a strong actress in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I like the bit. Finally, Andy's character said, "Sometimes I think she was never here" etc. It was completely in such a way that it is in such a situation (which I can personally identify) Then, that fantastic classical part of "Nokarne" I think Chopin, which was a great way to finish (finally the light comedy bar which was probably unnecessary). <br /> <br /> I said, "I've worked well" to filmmakers - I've seen 1,000 bad movies!
