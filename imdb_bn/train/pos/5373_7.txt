Perhaps the Hummer series is not the absolute greatest entry of the series, but it certainly won the award for the most innovative title episode! "The body that bled" ?? I could not scream this title throughout the day! And along with the extraordinary title, this small film also benefits from a firmly written play and a number of truly suspicious moments. It may need to be seen an extra before you fully understand the wonderful ending-up, but it is, of course, an original idea for a terrible lack. The story is open with an elderly couple in the middle of the tea house. The husband sadly killed his wife, and after a few years the "Cursed" house is still to be sold. A young couple and their grief-stricken daughter begin to move away and start recovering, but mysterious events occur and especially affect the young Sophie. His favorite cat was killed even when his birthday party was destroyed when home pipes suddenly hit all the guests (a particularly cool order, this one!). Old house is really frightened? Or perhaps the most helpful reason for the relatively friendly neighbors? The answers to this question are provided in original and fairly unpredictable climax and at the very end there is even room for a real shock. The tone is beautifully made and the famed room is filled with scary scenes like the tide of the husband used to kill his wife to kill his wife. Little warning, however, when you're an animal lover, the order of the cat is so hard to see. In conclusion, another winner of Hammer's short running TV series!
