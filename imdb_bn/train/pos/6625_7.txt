If you've ever seen the trailer for the film "The Recruit" with Colin Farell and Al Pesino, you will never have to see that movie. Sadly, the Renaissance has the same innovative trailer makers as well. <br /> <br /> The story of Renaissance is about the investigating detective of a young girl and a medical researcher. The setting features a future throughout Paris, and science fiction elements. Though special about revival, its visual style, and its story is not. Renaissance 3D computer animation, FINAL fantasy, but extremely sharp contrast with black and white style. The result looks stunning (although the problem of the 3D animation of the human body can be given a little more attention than tomatoes: little robotic movement, little wood face acting etc.), as a highly stylized, beautiful film Noor, the Renaissance makes the spectators look stunning, especially visually. The story and writing, though, is not the same level of quality as the visual. This is not a bad story (and probably, it was more exciting than me if you did not see the trailer). But it is a story which is not very original, and verges on the farm. Some lines of dialogue were painful, making the writer a word like the first initial attempt. <br /> <br /> I must recommend the renaissance to friends. It's unlike anything that I saw before, sight, and I believe its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience. It is a watchable story, even if it is not perfect.
