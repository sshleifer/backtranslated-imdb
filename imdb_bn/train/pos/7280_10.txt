This observer as a child. Although I would probably fear God very much, even though I was only seven or some, it was a diverse thing. I remember working on a Saturday afternoon when watching it, so I was not really paying much attention. However, the scene with the rolling stones has been burned in my mind. I've seen this glimpse but saw no benefit to many people. 12 years ago, a person mentioned that he probably saw it, but he only saw this dream; A fanciful PEOPLE like wind. It's a dream, my friend. I do not dream now. Again, I have not seen it since then, but I can not wait to find a copy and stuff it into my VCR. For 23 years there may be an embedded in my mind's eye which is worth 10.
