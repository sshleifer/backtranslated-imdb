This movie is my favorite one of all time. Kerry Grant, Victor McLaughlin, and Douglas Fairbank Junior ... What a Cast? There is no mention of sam jafir as Ganges Dina! Drama, action, adventure and comedy all rolled into one. Today, the final battle scene will calm me down and till the end my eyes always flow. If you have not seen it, I'd recommend it firmly.
