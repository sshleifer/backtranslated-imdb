Very Interesting There was not a big shock on big phones, they probably expected it and it was a very date but my mind was working. It really got me thinking about a world without plants or animals and I am much appreciated in the world to live. Charlton Hesson did a good job, all worked as supporter characters, and it was a wonderful realistic film which was wonderful. It lacked time direction and many settings and background needed to explain more but it was still a wonderful good and intelligent movie. The main culprit I found was that when I do not want to finish it, I want to see what I want to see later. <br /> <br /> 7/10
