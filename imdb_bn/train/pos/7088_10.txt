Terry Gilliam and David Peoples gathered together to create the most intelligent and creative science fiction film of the '90s. People proved to be a screenplay with fantastic ideas about generation twists and nature of time ?? I could not change a concept past especially; Is it a great time travel movie to say that's a nice counterpoint ?? Thin line between biological holocausts and sanity and insanity. Gileam has visualized his ideas about unique curiosity, perfection and basicity. <br /> <br /> The story itself is involved. One person, James Cole (played by Bruce Willis & # 39; s heart-warming performance), retrieves information about a virus that traveled over the past decades that destroyed humanity and left some living surviving living survivors: With the collection of information, scientists find healing. Hope everyone can return to the page in the future. But their time-travel technology is not perfect, because they are sent to various other steps and sent to complex issues. And from which an extraordinary science fiction thriller film, with the shadows of Noar, leads to the film, because several pieces of huge jagas started to create a great detail together with animal rights activists, Millennial Paranoia, biological weapon, realization of reality, and sanity definition. It was easy with a complex film for gilliams and peoples, but twelve monkeys instead of a thought-provoking story that they liked to challenge and patiently realized some insane ideas. <br /> I saw this movie about 10 years ago. It marked me a lot: I think there are still days after the ward; It was quite bad for my young mind and it was one of the first films to compliment me as serious and important to the movie. I saw this movie again on DVD a few days ago and it's better than to remember me. Brad Pitt is playing Jeffrey Guineas, is he stole all the scenes? Fight Club's Tyler Darden is almost a rage? According to some anarchist / non-conformist ideas, children who are lazy and co-op, are probably responsible for the virus. The pictures of Madheus Jeffrey and Cole are between Piotr's eyes, voice and qui system, firmly believe that he is really a crazy person who is only locked in a logical list. Piece Oscar nomination was good! Wonderful was the performance of Bruce Willis: it did not look very good, but it is beautiful and full of sensitivity; He is a man who has spent most of his life underground, and when he comes in the past, you will share his childhood estuarine with fresh breath in the morning or something like the sun rising above the sun. Cole is a rather vague character, People tried to shoot some of them in the dark, and he did other bizarre things with other people and himself: The scene where he had removed his teeth revealed how unknown his dementia was. The corp has not started as a crazy character, but when he starts warning about the end of the world, he thinks he is crazy and everything in his mind is convincing, until he reaches a level when he can not make the difference in the future, from the imagination Reality Willis spends a lot of time confusing and unsafe, and it works perfectly. The collapse of the collar, Dr. Catherine Rail, one of the fun pains in the story, has really found the true evidence from the future, and now she has to satisfy her mission again to save the world. This image is full with curious twists and it keeps the movie at a fast speed. Their relationship is also well-handed, although probably compressed for some time. But I tried to escape from the future's authority to fall in love with lore and rail and to live a peaceful life in the past. But then things end in a sad / discreet climax at an airport, wrapping all the pieces together, which throws away many minds. Two great finishes in this movie, this means a Seawane Se7en or Fight Club, and more closely ending where the railway is crossing the Colly side, she was shot dead and James is looking around her for the lounge. , Who witnesses the self-death of the future. The two shares a brief look, and he smiles her. Twist is bright, but I like this end for emotional impact. Madeleine Stove Rayleigh is playing very well, he has made many different emotions from me in his performance. This movie is filled with lethality that can change in the past: The movie looks horrific. It reminds me of Chinatown, which Jack Pitts objected to as often as he tried to help. Railly's character that shared fatalism, he tried to help Cole ?? Then his help with his 'madness' after his behavior ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A great movie to see if twelve monkeys want a recreation; It is not supposed to be an art, although it is more artists than many artists. It was a neutral film where the elements of music from clothing to clothing, etc., were merged together to create a modern cinematic excellence.
