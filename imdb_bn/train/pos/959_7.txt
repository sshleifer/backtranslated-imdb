Many police round the rounds. I'm not sure why. It could possibly work with the old fundamental theme of the better versus temple. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to glamorize the police! They are perfect, inferior and dissonant on the earth, on the other hand, Anne is a soft heart probably a little more understanding about the human condition. Against all the rules he occasionally returned irriminating information found in his strip search and other investigations found. <br /> <br /> This is not a pleasant film. One does not relax you There is not much hope in this optimism. The police seem to be involved in a losing war. Tomorrow more bashings, more murders, more family breaks up, and more distressed children will remain. Let's tackle it. We live in this world <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anne has been involved with the police for a long time and has been involved in the family, they are investigating. The only real warmth in the film is available by a 12-year-old Ben character from a broken family. Anne has her own way of patching things up. He turned blind eyes from Beni's shop and tried to help him as much as possible for him. I was surprised that he went so far to persuade Beni's father. Wonderful set of me whether it is considering parents or their own needs Finally, the film makes it clear that she was very cruel to the needs of a partner and loving child. <br /> <br /> Looks good but I'm not sure about the evening entertainment,
