This Denzel Washington Thriller theme that offers revenge, greatness, murder and grisly vampire share its share. Destruction of the mission as a bodyguard essential and its charge, the young Dakota Fanning, is abducted from the school, exactly what was exactly to prevent Washington. As the MACO City locations are unwanted, the story continues in the straight path towards its expected, violent conclusion. A former drinker problem in Washington, CIA, gets a good reference from a former fellow agent who puts the plot outline at a speed. There is a great chemistry between Washington and Fanning, and after a rare start, the bodyguard and its charge have become the best of friendship. Christopher Wachen, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Zycarcarlo Jiannini and Mickey Roar have performed well in supporting two stars.
