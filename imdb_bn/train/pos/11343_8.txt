I remember this on TV in the late 70's - and it was with me! It's charming, loud, colorful - a great kids film. I recently kept it for some friends at a party - and naturally they thought I was crazy and I was hoping to get sick with dolls, "fill feebles" but not - its deliciously fun fun. <br /> <br /> Jack is wild beautiful, such as a parent's cache, and in some way is interesting. <br /> <br /> If you like to split the bananas and you rebuild this very early on Saturday morning at the age of 30, <br /> <br /> If I realized that, Puff himself became a little sticky - as soon as possible he was captured and fled! Quality TV Movie - If like me, you are the metal of death - you love it!
