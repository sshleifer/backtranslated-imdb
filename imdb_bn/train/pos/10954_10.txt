Sarah Silverman is perfectly like Manic Jewelery Deschanel and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you love Jesus, magician, you love it. If not you, what's wrong with you? Comedy Channel Kudos for shoving this in my face. My life has finally got the meaning, and "smell like your car's distant" my humor. I am a happy guy The first episode lied me violently and I was hungry waiting for the next week. This meets the South Park like Grease. Completely abusive. Sarah Silverman is someone I can read in the phone book. Her delivery is precise and oh so funny. She skips a beat. When it comes to thinking, it's not so much of her choice on the material. By which way some really good things, it's the way to choose it to choose. Thanks, Sir Silverman! Thanks, comedy channel!
