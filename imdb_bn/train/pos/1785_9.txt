You can not enjoy a chick flick, stop at this moment. However, if you enjoy complex movies that portray complex characters and give great acting, then read it. <br /> <br /> Anne Grant Lord is going to die. Her two daughters reach at her bedside. Ann starts talking about unknowns about girls from whom they are unknown, and they question whether this missing identity is real or fantastic. They realize that these people are actually real from their mother's past. <br /> <br /> The story is, in fact, between 1953 and 2000, and within a few years some of the lives of Anne's life. In 1953, Anne fulfilled the love of her life and enjoyed the greatest tragedy of her life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Anne is one of the best friends, Lily's brother, Body. Lilah and Body are children of a rich newport family, and a cabet singer living in Ann Greenwich Village who wants to be a free soul, but still many of the 1950's sessions are bound by her. <br /> <br /> Anne, who came to be the slave of honor in Lilar's marriage, met the person who would become the main character of three lives - Harris. He was an elderly son of a former slave of the family who grew up with Lila and Body and became a medical doctor in New England City. Anne is going to be adding a complexity that has always been in love with Harris and Lila which becomes enamored by Harris. Bodeo fell in love with Harris, but in 1953, he redirected Harise to his good friend, Anne, to rediscover the desire of homosexuals, because he could not acknowledge himself that he had sexual desire for another person. Buddy brings her drunkenness out of the outside as a drunk, intelligent-cracking bad boy - with her very right and tall parents. <br /> <br /> It is not saying that all these expressing and suppressing emotions lead to tragedy - after all these a chick flick. <br /> <br /> Now, Ann's daughter is away from their mother and is experiencing the perception and doubt of their own life. Constance is working with mental fatigue trying to keep her roll up as the perfect mother and wife. Nina, always feeling inferior, can not maintain relations. <br /> <br /> Spread all these relationships in fifty years, and you get an interesting look about society, its quality, and its effects on personality. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ann played, and he works through a style that clearly shows the intelligent woman who opposes what she wants to do, what she wants to do. His performance can not be easily forgotten. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave dies, whose mind changes from the past to the fantastic airplanes, and of course, with the RedGrav sterling style it closes. <br /> <br /> <br /> Anthony Richardson plays Anne's daughter Constance in the film - the real daughter of Redgrave Richardson. Scenes of this real life are an insightful treatment of fantasy mothers and girls. <br /> <br /> Tony Colette Ann plays another girl Nina. Nina feels sad for herself and apologizes for her while closing a good man who loves her mom and her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for such a part, but I have never seen any bad or unbelievable performance in her, in which part she does not play. <br /> <br /> Mammy played Lilla in the 1950's and showed us more conflicts with another woman. Her best friend, the expected role of her life than Ann. He is very good <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marily Strip - Gammer's mother - Lilah's day today <br/> <br /> Director Lazio Caltey told DVD Extras that he found Glenn Close to play a relatively small part of Lily's mother. Because she felt she was the only actress and she could think of playing a scene in the film. He was definitely right, and the close performance of a scene was drawn into your mind. Very suitable mother of saliva, which is in all other scenes, and you will get performance in the other step. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in this picture, which match the above described closing. Watching movies full movie On the wedding day of Lilar, Anne came to her house and married her friend Lilah lying on the bed to know clearly about her upcoming marriage, which she does not explicitly love. This scene is repeated fifty years later when Lilaya arrives and she lives in bed with her dead friend Anne. In this next scene, Strip and Redgrag are enthralling. <br /> <br /> Another memorable scene - at least me - when Body Ann announces his love for it. As Body, Hugh Dancy gives us a dysfunctional performance, which is disconnected by his diabolical sexual feelings. Its performance is superior. <br /> <br /> Chick flick? Yes A very special film with incredible acting, direction, and scenery? Clearly. I can not recommend too much in the evening.
