What else can be said? I did not impress this actress since the explosion of Cate Blanche 10 years ago on the scene. And though Blanchett and Blunt both acted in Queens (seems to be a benchmark for ups and upcoming actresses), the roles are completely opposite to the smoker. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for high passion, engaging drama, and machiavellian conspiracy, this is not the movie for you. The script was not bad, it is not just that the film did not bring much dramatic life compared to other notable Royals like Elizabeth I, Anne Bailen, Henry VIII, Henry VI, Henry II. And Acquitane's Elainor These folks whose life was made as a good soap opera and whose policy and decision changed the British course, and in most cases, world history. On the contrary, Victoria ascended the throne without any incident, she ruled a country which was rapidly becoming a global power due to industrialization and the emergence of the navy, there was a stable government under the leadership of capable and dynamic politicians in her state, and she was married. The young had a harmonious family life. The events of his life are not made as strong plays like Storm OD Drugs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of one of the really frustrating and surprising about his kingdom - a love story Although there is no space for world-wide awareness of marriage due to financial or political reasons, Victoria will be remembered in history as a permanent Patron Saint's marital fidelity, happiness and ideal family life. In this way, the center of the film is the emerging love of Victoria and her prince Albert. I paid a lot of attention to the character of Robert Friend Albert, whom he portrayed as a patient, patient, somewhat hearty and possibly touching young man looking to "make the world better and help". In short, he is not a very good person with a good heart, the most dynamic person to build the foundation, but it is not the point of the story, it is not a matter. The character's heart shines through the friend's different but still hearty performance thanks. <br /> <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is nice. Her beauty can not be denied, but she is more than anything beautiful to look at; His face like the quicksilver due to his expressiveness. The eyebrows of eyebrows, or eyelashes, or a little wry smile distributed so much. Again, these heavy speeches and emotional applications are not a bomber performance, it's not a movie. But how Mrs. Blant plays the role is the general humanity of the character of an impressive character. <br /> <br /> For example, we saw Joey di Vivro in Victory's mother (Mirinda Richardson) and her skimming counselor / boyfriend Connie, in simple things to try to sketch his dog. In Albert's first interview we saw his joy and attraction, his eyes constantly drawing to him. When we spoke in the parliament, we saw his nervous and overwhelming. And my movie is all about my favorite scene - we see her nervous, happy and hopeful because she does not have to do what she wants in her life - ask the person who wants to marry her, the offer is so ridiculous for that time (and some Now, will say) that Victoria's nervous smile would end before even "marrying me". Again, this is not a movie for the tops than the expressions of this life, but rather to study more in subtleties of a character and speak a lot of little things. So, overall, I tried the judgment film and what it tried to do and how I gave it 7. I felt that some politics could be better explained and some excellent actors were lost due to the development of small and small characters, such as Miranda Richard's Kent Duchess, and Conroy and Lord Peal characters. Again, these characters did not need to spend a lot of time in the film, but a few more statements helped explain the political environment. Victoria and Albert also liked watching the combination of married life more, but it could only be my greed for more scenes between friends and bellants. <br /> <br /> In short, do not look at this movie in terms of historical drama, but what it really is, is a love story in two letters which can be historical figures. I give this movie a tough 7 for the wonderful lead performance, the brilliant costumes and scenery and Emily Blunt's fantastic Victoria. And anyone who has left any clips of romance, you can touch the end of this movie. God protect the queen.
