"Mask" is an ongoing film that works on many levels. Easily, it is a street actor's hunting story that tries to pass along to his creative industry (mask) to the next generation with a small child bond. Although sometimes the story transforms an old man into a job, it is very well made (written, played, operated, wonderful production standard), it is easy to move beyond its adversity. And, if you quarrel with it, the film is very sweet and lifting. Kudos all around This is a wonderful film for adults as well as adults. Curious Americans who do not like to see foreign language films!
