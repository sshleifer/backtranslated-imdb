I like this movie from the beginning to the opening sequence from the beginning to the end. I found the style of addressing direct / listeners directly to the director / actor's style. <br /> <br /> I ignored this movie about the most exciting and refreshing - and this is challenging - stereotype of gender and class. Character idols are identified as power and absence of judgment - and the characters are able to embrace them and drag themselves into their world - the acceptance of their own and each other. Without promotion, and with intelligence and modest and loving humor, this film has the ability to open up to our new possibilities, and expresses hope in a world where people accept and accept each other as each other and unique and valuable person. I look forward to more dedication from these creative and talented directors.
