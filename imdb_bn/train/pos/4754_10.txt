One of my favorite twilight zone episodes. And the next day we were at the supermarket in Hollywood Blvd. And La Bra, my father and I, and guess who was coming to us! Barney Phillips, but there is no hat - at least, I do not think there was a hat on it. <br /> <br /> We asked him about his third eye, and he said something, and on that day he asked him about the person he met. <br /> <br /> Friendly guy. <br /> <br /> <br /> I was a teenager, and it took me a long time to get "three hands" in another park! <br /> <br /> <br /> Robin Fresh O'Neal <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
