This is a unique and bold film. It's energetic, with extremely advanced characters. Very good performance <br /> <br /> I love the director who is not afraid to listen to the listeners <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By the nature of the film, it is actually demanding the audience as well as internal appearance. You can take some courage to do this. I can see how some close psychological people might find this annoying. However, I found it much more entertaining than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I wanted to know what he would do? <br /> <br /> Look at him.
