Again, a wonderful movie about the 11th World War trials and tribulations. This film makes it so good that it touches the human element. This film must have "Mrs. Minivar" and "Hope and glory" such as the British line classic tradition. In the case of this picture, we see people's frustration during the war. <br /> <br /> Performed by John John Tha in particular, it is extraordinary, which has been dismissed from the child. London bombings. <br /> <br /> We soon see why this child blows his bed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the child comes back to his mother, the old man goes to London and finds him in search of tragedy. He literally kidnapped the boy and was able to convey a height that would be better than the boy's house. <br /> <br /> The picture is so good because it works and creates related relationships.
