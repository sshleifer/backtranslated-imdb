The beauty of the beautiful film directed by Itan Fox is another beauty. The film presents the story of modern-day Tel Aviv's star-crossed lovers (an Israeli, a Palestinian). The effectiveness of film does not come only from illustration of cross-national conflict, but it also comes with personal and political conflicts between ethnic groups. For example, there is a fantastic moment when one of the minor characters, open gay, is visited by her boyfriend in hospital, who brings flowers to her and tries to kiss her in front of the family, and suddenly we feel uncomfortable. Wash through the room. Obviously the young man does not feel as if he is not open, and the family does not want to accept him, when the boyfriend is confused and rejected. Complications are packed at a fleeting moment of a good deal. We know from Josi and Jagger, Fox is a master of packing in a short form of psychological and mental complexity. The picture represents mutual cruelty that Israel and the Palestinians attack each other, even for handover. If you are not heartless, you'll cry by the last third of the movie. Although this plot is malodramatic, it has written and acted so intelligently that it reminds us how well the good melodrama can be.
