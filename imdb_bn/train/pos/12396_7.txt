This is the second part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of animated short films that tell us more about 'Matrix'. In this case we can learn how men and machines do not work and live together. It's a little history lesson in the world of 'matrix'. The first part is not as good as the 'final flight of Oscars', but it's still pretty cool.
