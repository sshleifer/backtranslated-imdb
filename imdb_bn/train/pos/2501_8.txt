I am a fan of actor / singer, especially Gak and when I first discovered this movie and saw the trailer I think it is a fool After waiting a long time, I finally saw it and here is my comment. <br /> <br /> I understand all about the story and are not going to mention it, instead my first congratulations, usually Japanese movies are bright and Does not act. But the cast of the moon child is easily amazing and it includes, especially, Gact changes its character's emotions very well and makes a lot of changes, I like both of her scenes, both hyadabad and humorous, her performance is good, but she deliberately lived in the background as an actor; As the creator, his film covers. I do not like some cinematography, especially due to the light and some colors but small budgets, it's still a great moment, but the real jewelry story of the film. It has some fascinating moments, but it's okay for me, and the movie friendship theme is really well-developed and sometimes touching, on the other hand the story refers to a cruel world that does not guarantee a life, and with some memorable death scenes, this theme reflects the visual Do it. An interesting note, this film has some similarity with an excellent vampire film interview with Vampires, which is actually played by the most beautiful (beautiful, beautiful) actors of American film, in fact the moon child can be seen as a brother with an interwife, but it is essentially its original name. Only Muncheld is a problem sometimes, a little slowly, I am a Japanese film fan and I use it but it does not change. Munchild has some neutral scenes or characters. But in the end; This film is sometimes really good for the actor / singer tide and very emotional. Hope to see their other movies in the future, and I recommend all those who like vampire-action-science-fantasy and romance movies like 8/10
