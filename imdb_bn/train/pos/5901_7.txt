This is the re-establishment of most recent movies, only fewer stars, less complexity, and more obscure feelings. Abhayya and Rishika (directed by Fardeen Khan and Isha Deol) are seen in a friend's marriage respectively, where the process of arranging their own marriage (revealed to them) begins. At some time, two strangers are not married and sent to their lunch camp where they meet other couples and move on like theirs. They spend time together, reveal secret information, heart breaks and / or mix and love flowers. <br /> <br /> If you have seen Hanimun Private Limited and / or Salam-e-Ishq, you have seen this picture. Plot twists are the same, there is no element of surprise in the whole half-hour of the film. Everything is predictable. I enjoyed it because I saw Darling (played Lead Deol and Khan) and enjoyed his chemistry on that day, so I said "why not" when my sister said that we only pay 'married'. See this: Because Kiran Khe's co-star and her usual favorite soul in it. Avoid it <br /> <br /> Because this couple-festival was fair enough! <br /> <br />
