When I think about chessist's funny-type films, I think the first is' 80's Slashy Flicks. Really bad slasher flicks The origin of the movie, where a script was needed to create 2 parts blood and many parts of nudity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Slashdie's flick was revived successfully with the "screw" of 1996. As of the 80's, these films were French, facing the lack of motivation by labeling themselves as "hip, tongue-in-goal parody" of original slash speakers. Neo-slasher flicks, low-budget, direct-to-video "cuts" are among the only recent mix of "hip parody". <br /> <br /> Like other, "new" slash flicks, "cut" relies on the production of a slash flick, in this case, to create a commentary on the 1985 film "Hot Blended" genre. "Hot Blooded" has never finished production, due to the murder of some of the killers, wearing the film's killer's face, scanners, dark pictures with his face, close and dark, little student eyes Now, 12 years later, a group of filmmakers, who were involved in professors, decided to tap the surviving actress and finish the film. But every time the movie is shown or shot a scene, earning "scanners" and someone dies. To quote the tagline, how do they finish the film before it ends? <br /> <br /> They seem really bad and it's a degree (really, a thing like a good slasher flick?). No character development ("new" director has been released as the main director of "Hot Blended", whose life was apparently destroyed after the production was canceled; this plot could be completed fully, yet it has never been mentioned) and , All other slashes, like Flickr, have many organizations to care for. Actors are not good at standard video quality, but most of them are kidding with their characters (and who are not acting, they do not want to work in any film because they are "hot blooded"), especially anyone who is lucky to play Skman Was there. Climax "Cut" enhances "Big No" face-to-face assassin like "Scream" movies. This is not a shocking murder of "urban legend". This is a real and interesting concept that "sells it if we can write a single cacail" but it's finished. But for that course is equal. <br /> <br /> With an intelligent viewing quality, this is a horrible movie that should be avoided, but this "quality" that makes its sequences true in slash style and this makes it more enjoyable than any other neo-slasher flicks Makes
