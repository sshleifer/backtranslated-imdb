I think this movie is best about Mike Hammer, with Biff Elliott's acting precise Mike Hammer. The script of Harry Essex is excellent and there are many improvements in Mickey Spillan's novel. His direction is strong and fantastic, and he uses the light and shadow fine. As the score by John Allan is peak-authentic in camera work, by Franz Waxman. Cast Charlotte included many experienced players in his memorable performance as Manning, as well as Peggie Castle. Above all, it is one of the best personal eye films ever made. Biff Eliot and Harry S. Sex got more opportunities. I have always treasured this film.
