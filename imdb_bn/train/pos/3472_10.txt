Very little spieler <br /> <br /> This movie (despite on TV) is absolutely nice. I really do not pay attention to the differences in appearance or pronunciation, so I can not really comment on that. This act was so good that I had to kiss myself and said, "Remember, this is just a movie, this day did not really happen". When I was sitting and hearing about Harris and Quinn talk, I knew that John and Paul were actually talking about this meeting. Commentary and burnings condemned by the public were correct (especially in the restaurant!) With his character, his sadness was that while Paul was moving very easily and going back. Both actors and excellent work and I was excited to see this movie has been seen. This is a bad experience for a Beatles fan. And ready for a few surprises!
