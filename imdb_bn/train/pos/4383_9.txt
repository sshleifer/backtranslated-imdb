** Attention Spoolers ** <br /> <br /> First of all, tell me that one of the best movies of Rob Roy 90. This is an extraordinary achievement for everyone involved, especially Liam Nisson, Jessica Lange, John Hart, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones draws an excellent portrait of honor and humiliation that men can represent themselves. But lazy ... <br /> <br /> It's consistent, and accurately compared to "brahhart". These two completely different films, probably the Scottish Scotland's, are both similar in nature. Yet, this comparison often disturbs me because I think it's often a "barbarous" film better than "Rob Roy". I like many "browworts", but the idea of ​​comparing it with "Rob Roy" is a shame to me. To say quite simply, I love "Bravo", but how much I love "Rob Roy" is a pale shadow. Here are my special reasons ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is the real man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is a legend, a martyr, bigger than the figure of life. Due to this screenplay, he is also a perfect person, is never mistaken and basically show his Scots countrymen on the promised land. If he finally fails, it is not his fault. Like Jesus, he betrayed the most believing people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But it really does not inspire me or plot. I find people obscure a lot more than man's perfection. That's why "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a better film than "King of Kings", and why I think "Rob Roy" is better than "Brahher". Rob Roy may be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. She liked much that influenced her many loved ones. Now sure, Arzill was a job of courage and courage not to carry a false claim against the Duke, but it was a job of arrogance and self-centeredness. Let us not forget that because of this law, the relatives who claimed to be protected from the end of the film had become homeless. But the rob could do the best, and everything you could ask for was all there. <br /> <br /> Rob's wife Mary, it's a normal, extraordinary person. Let's start, how he looks in this picture. Sure, he is beautiful, but he does not wear makeup and he can basically show his natural beauty. Compare this with two love (or depending on your view) in William Wallace's "BravoEvirt". Now these two ladies are hot, but the signs of how women looked at that time are very few signals. (Especially people). Probably not a fair comparison, but another example of how Rob Ryan can be tried for correctness is more effective. <br /> <br />, "Rob Roy", Mary will be brutally committed to adultery, Cunningham, with her rape rape. . He is obliged to tell the Lord of his struggle, but he does not know that Rab should take revenge for his rape. Such revenge meant the death of Rob, and Mary was not ready for this kind of sacrifice. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" volumes are equally equal. Though "Brevevart" enemies are well written, they are rarely rooted. Robert the Bruce, both courageous and courageous, is influenced by moral decisions that are the best of all time in the fabulous kingdom. Should his claim as king of Scotland be accepted, or should his family name betray Wallace for safety? Bruce is the most characteristic character of "Bravo", but from "Julius Caesar" to Brodas, "The Godfather Part II" to Fredo, these characters are rarely the original. Longshanks, although his own right is a compulsory villain, very dimensional. He is the epidemic of evil, and his bitter way is directly opposite of Wallace's heroism. <br /> <br /> There are three villains, "Rob Roy", their shiny wonders. After all, let's start with the Marquis of Montros. He is a man who was so obsessed with his autobiography that he was willing to give up an innocent man with grief for him. "See what I'm not joking," his favorite word is his "factor". He is a man obsessed with power, then angry that a noble born as Argyll's duke can be considered a man more than the provider. She is shy self-obsessed and insecure. He is an evil aristocrat, but the way that makes him unique. <br /> <br /> There are conspiracies in Cunningham and Caller "Rob Roy", and are the direct assailants of the verdict. The collar is so stupid because of his tirade that he is almost ridiculous. He will do something to maintain Marquis's best wishes, which include backstabbing and trickery. Cunningham is an attractive character that he feels encouraged to do in order to achieve dignity and gain dignity. He needs a father, he knows that Marquis is his real father. Therefore, when the opportunity to acquire wealth comes from Kolar, he even retains it without being questioned. He is much like the modern man's temple, so confident and vain that he does not think about the consequences of his actions on others. Many people criticized the role of Tim Roth in this movie. I said Hogwash. It is clear that Cunningham is not only bad on cinematic but cyclopathy. In a world where a man and his child can go around random shooting for captivating people, Cunningham is too much of an incredible character? We live in a society where people seem to reduce the cost of living. "Rob Roy" only teaches us that the dimensions of these reduced values ​​have changed. It is a problem across human history that does not give the power of grief to the horror of human heart. Rob Roy and Mary, we hope that righteousness will succeed, but the snake will always exist. <br /> <br /> Another character that I think is interesting, Duke of Orgel. He is a true nobleman, and his standard of honesty and courtesy is directly against Marquis. He praised Rob Roy and Mary Saha, and has direct concerns for Marquis and his factor. He gives the world hope for power people. I hope people like Marqués have no exceptions and rules. <br /> <br /> - Final confrontation of "Rob Roy" is more exciting than 10 fight scenes of "Brahher". <br /> <br> One thing I'm tired of, people tell me that "Bravo" is a good movie because of the war scene. After all, the battle scenes are rarely the original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", there is a long tradition of Hollywood's historic European war scene. "Blavier" is sometimes in the best fighting scene, but they are suffering from an important problem. The freedom of these war scenes is no longer in the context of war. <br /> <br /> Now, do not make me wrong, both of them are very basic. In fact, there are many movies with the battlefield probably ten times. But it is nice to see the context of the conflict between Cunningham and Rob Roy. This is one of the greatest scenes in film history. Explain why <br /> <br /> <br /> First of all, the fighting style of this conflict and the character of two characters are fully described. Cunningham is awesome and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and brave. Rob uses a broadsword when Cunningham uses a fence sword. Cunningham quickly fights with the clever movements, Ray's fighting style is even more evident. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is clear that the Lord must destroy this cosmic evil that has hit his whole world. Rob finally gets up (literally and figuratively) when it is one of the greatest moments in film history. Rob won because he has more to do, and his respect is more powerful than 10 confectioners. Music usage is absolutely cool in this scenario. Better prevailing against a real evil than a dude gets disemboweled more than just for me, so he can "shout freedom!". But hey, it's just me <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "brhorhart" <br /> <br /> I do not know the historians or people of Scotsman talk about "Rob Roy" people, but I think it's obviously An attempt to capture their speeches. I think many people are bored by "Rob Roy" because they do not understand what the characters are saying. If in this case, read some Shakespeare, or captioning off. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90's. Many dialogues in this movie are tricky, but you may need to watch the movie several times to understand it. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the dialogue of "Brevevert" is not very interesting. Of course, what character do you expect the character of the Australian player with the main character? It was a legend, and apparently not trying to capture time speeches. This film was held several centuries before "Rob Roy", and yet they still talk to people like today. This is why many people like it. The audience has become increasingly lazy today, and they do not want to take the time or patience to understand complex issues. Therefore, with many epic films, they expect Vilanos to have an accented English accent, when the heroes do not speak a native language far away from our American language. Of course, Wallace is Scottish, but sounds like Scotty from Star Trek, and in addition to some of the words "I" for recognition, Scottish films fit the tradition of Hollywood, which we will call Scott. "<br /> So, these descriptions prove that" Rob Roy "is a better film than" Brahheart ". Hardly, but if it proves to be a matter, it shows that" Braveyart "is a better film than" Robber Ray " Simply put, "Rob Roy" is a movie that is very popular in today's world. "Bravo" is a legend which is an inspirational but rarely realistic film about If you think that you can decide on the grade ... <br /> <br /> - a score - 9
