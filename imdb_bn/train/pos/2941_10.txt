This is the final one-man show which is very good for Eddie Murphy. Just forget the naughty professors and renowned Gentlemen, this is the real Eddie Murphy. Mr. T's imitation (he claims to be gay), Michael Jackson and other artist killers I think it's very brave for the artists to make fun, who are really popular at that time. My favorite job is to bring her family to her annual biqueak and where her drunken father and aunt Bani come down from the ladder. <br /> <br /> The best medicine when you think of this show! Do not be frustrated if you see a sigell 'judgment'. It's very good but does not match 'Delirious'.
