This is a film that does not require a brain or thinking, it's a very interesting time to pass, which you forgot in the next hour or so. I was really amazed by John Abraham's performance, he usually played a character like a gangster with a helpless face, so it was successfully completed by playing the full difference from him and managing the stirring comic titles like Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. I was very surprised with the 3 girls of Akshay because there was no need for roles in the role, but in most cases I was surprised by Akshay's displeasure (to other girls), because they were established and acted as real personalities and you can make a difference between them. Things, the song is mostly good, it's a boring Sunday evening Nina and fun so be sure to light your mood.
