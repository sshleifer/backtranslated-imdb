Gordon Parks, the photographer of Prafulla Black Life Magazine, has created a real-time movie-time movie here - which is not circling around! Based on the real story of two NYC police - Batman and Robin are given the opinion of W.W. W.K. W.. Flashing the light, there is not an essential touches view. <br /> <br /> Man, the look of the film '70's, and the "Serpico" would be a terrible place as a police officer.

They must immediately navigate a mine field of police and legal corruption, their work on the streets on the streets, ruthless drug legend, and a nasty ghetto are meant to deprive them of the neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Both David Selby and Ron Lehmann are fantastic; The entertaining part of Leibman's eyes became crazy in every scene of a visible comic performance and the performances of the saleswoman were low-key and surprising. Creates the comic aspects of these two stories - demonstrating an uninterrupted frustration that matches with very strong determination. Director Parks, who was already known for his coverage of controversial topics in his photography, would not move away from the intensity of the story.

Being associated with this reality, Actor Hunts and Greenberg worked as a technical advisor for the film, and even performed two comedic officers in the role of supermodel Camio, who ridicule the titles. This is a real tribute to the effect of Park's direction, which he led to manage this glamorous comedy with a balanced play. <br /> <br /> Why is MGM / UA sitting in the shelf for 30 years? Is it a home video or DVD release in the US? This is a minor essay in the 1970s.
