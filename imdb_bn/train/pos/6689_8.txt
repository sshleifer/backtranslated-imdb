As a comic book reader, that still looks at herself as a total child in the heart, I admit I can be a little favorable towards this movie. I mean, there is not a good superhero movie for some time (Note: Batman was not always a superhero movie) I really wanted to make this movie better, and unlike my recent tours, I was not disappointed in most movies (read Blair Witch Project). <br /> <br /> The mystery male certainly flick the full effect of high impact, tension, it was a comedy. And on that basis, it was a success. Everyone laughed at the small theater, and ridiculed and smiled through the final scene. Stylor and garofolos are always sunny together, as always, and AZRia simply adds the right touch of craziness. William H. Messi played a great straight man, while Kyle Mitchell and Fert-powered Paul Rubens were added just to keep Quiddie happy. <br /> <br /> Although the sets are seamless (and sometimes seem like a Riff) both Batman and Blade Runner), and some jokes are clear, it's still just fun. There are some lines that will catch off-rides even the most awkward viewers and tears from those who are beaten among us. <br /> <br /> I certainly recommend this movie. Though not all-time classic, it's doubly interesting as the latest version of Austin Powers. Well written, and cast is great. If you are worried, plan a matinee and pay less, but you will be happy in some other way. I mean, who among us keeps bread in a while for the victims?
