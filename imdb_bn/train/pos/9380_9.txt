Alfred Hittak and David Lynch are coming out of the cross like a beautiful old thriller, "Red Rock West" injured unemployed unemployed vendor oil worker Mr. N. Cage follows the misfortune, because after the fate of his fate becomes bad and bad. The empty gas tank and behind the cross, one account is very low money for a cup of coffee in the city. It may have been properly established since Mr. Cage Down, but he is not outside, and he can break, but he will not steal even in the stolen state. Yet when he was Mr. J. Walsh accused him of commissioning him to kill his wife, Mr. Cage called the wife to warn her about her husband's wishes. Then he paid more to kill the Miss LFB man to kill Miss Walsh. Mr. He decided to leave the cage even though he was in front, but he hit a man in the street on the way out of town. He was tried to run, he took the man to the hospital, where he was shot dead. Mr. Cage was arrested by the deputy who called Sheriff to Mr. J. T. Walsh. The events take a more complex change when fleeing from Hefazat, Mr. Cage is narrowly avoided by being driven by real Hit-Man on the way to fulfill his commission. Right now you may be forgiven for thinking "enough", but it seems to be a complete logical turn of events on the screen, at this time the descriptive stream of film seems unnecessary. Mr. D. Hopper was murdered like a tenant murderer, as Mr. Cage is a USMC senior. This little streamed section considers Mr. Cage long to be alive and survives to survive, a little more deadly but still inactive. It is a tribute to everyone involved in what is said on the paper like a piece of vague, actually creating an exciting good picture with all the spin-off acting. "Red Rock West" is a movie - Lover's movie. In five minutes you know that you are going somewhere, you are already in many shows, but you will be very happy to travel.
