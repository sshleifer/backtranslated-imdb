I just got hit on this image on TV one day. It was broadcast in the middle of the day in a channel which is not quite famous for maintaining good films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In October, the real story of a boy, Humor Hickam, inspired by rocket scientists in October, Sky Sky. She and her friends started building rockets. His father is not happy with the new hobby of his boys, but rather sees him as a coal excavator or goes to college with his brother-in-law football scholarship. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. It may be somewhat predictable, but that's because it does not pay too much attention to those parts of the story. This is an important part, but where the internal action is clear, the function is focused in character. The story is good. It has some clich√©s, but that's OK. This is based on the actual event so you can not simply exclude these clinics. Characters are really good. The characters are picked up where the story is encouraged and managed to manage the film's higher verbs and quality. You know these characters and you get sympathy for them. They are good writing and reliable. <br /> <br /> This is a good looking movie. Set and 50's style are well-composed and the images are well-composed and are well lit up. All this is very good set of film moods. <br /> <br /> acting is really good. Jacques Gilillah has given a great performance like home hicam and Chris Cooper, John Hickham. They are very good for the rest. This all makes a pretty strong cast out together. <br /> <br /> I am glad I grabbed this movie. It was the first after watching I learned it based on true facts. If I saw it, it was probably known that it could be even more interesting. Sky Sky is a good and interesting movie. This is a movie that I believe everyone can enjoy. This is a feeling-good movie type. Not bad at all!
