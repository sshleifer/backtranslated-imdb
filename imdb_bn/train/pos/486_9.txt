The movie 'Luzin Defense' is eligible at any time. It's a brooding, intense film, and keep my attention in full-time. John Tarturo is a devoted, brilliant cassette mastermastress, which is absolutely stunning, and Emily Watson spellbinding as a gentle but rebellious daughter of the highly respected Russian family. Chemistry between Watson and Turingurou is clear from the moment of seeing their characters in the story. Above all, this film is one of the best depths of the life of a chess grandmother, and Tarturo and Watson add a complete non-mainstream, unclear feeling to the film. Most people will come out of the theater thinking, and feel the touch of love in the most unlikely spectacular face of the story.
