It's not bright, ground breaking or innovative, but 'dog day' is a very impressive character research for some reason. It's like CRASH trips in the worst dosage of heroin, but not true. This is a series of depressing, humiliating and annoying people and Austrian film after their misuse. It's annoying, yet very well played and interesting to see what these characters crazy little things. Surely not for a weak heart, this very unconditional movie does not ultimately offer any conclusions or expressions, we only see the life of these honest people in just two days. Grade: b
