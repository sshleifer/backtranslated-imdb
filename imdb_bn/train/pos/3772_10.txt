Billy and Ted's bogus journey is the best movie I've ever seen. Acting and visible etc poor, care though. The story lines are bright and they come with the joke and the sound is the most wonderful, the idea is as good as well. I recommend someone to see this classic The best part was obviously when they 'melvin' died, I had cracked for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film. This was then good at first, which was good. Probably all the time funny pictures !!!!! But the best part of the film is that, when Bill and Tede sneak nicely and played guitar solo, it was fun. Bill on Rock, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, bring a 3rd film !!
