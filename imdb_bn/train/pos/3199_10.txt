OK, I do not really think the trailer park boys have bad story lines, because they kick the ass. They're just ... conflict with each other. For example: at the end of the film, it's called Ricky and Julian "Patrick Lewis" to bring the dog down. Then to the end, Ricky and Julian told that they were in jail for two years. In the TV series pilot, they show the first clip screams in Ricky and Julian's same clip "Patrick Lewis". But in the TV series, they are in jail for 18 months. <br /> <br /> Also, they give us an impression that the story line of the movie and the story line of the TV series are connected to the yelling scene in boys). But some actors portrayed completely different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach played "Patrick Lewis" in this film, but he played Randy in the series. Sam Tarasco is a player who pays to eliminate Ricky and then he plays losco in the series. <br /> <br /> also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), In movies, boys smoke smoking instead of coke snort. The thing is, they do not really make sure that the two story lines are connected to the scene anyway. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
