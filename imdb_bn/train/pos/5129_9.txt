I can see why this image was nominated for Best Live Action Short of Oscars because it was nicely designed. Even if you do not particularly like blues (although it makes more sounds like jazz to me), you can easily appreciate this movie. It is very easy to create, though, for my life, I can not see why director Gajan Mili has to manage only one film. In other words, the film has been nominated and yet the director has not improved any kind of career. As a black actor, I realize that their profession can not shift to high gear, because unfortunately white society is mostly black or indifference (or worse) for "such music" <br /> <br /> If you look at this movie you do not particularly enjoy the previous section but proceed to the 5:50 mark - where it is significantly increased. When the lady stops singing and the actors begin to progress, the speed increases slightly.
