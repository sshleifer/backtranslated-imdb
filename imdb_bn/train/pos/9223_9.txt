Ashanti is a 70-odd decorated picture (1979, to be precise). It reminds me of Wild Gace (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore in a mission in Africa). This is a very good movie and I enjoyed it a lot. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Kane) is a doctor working in Africa and he has married a beautiful Ashanti woman named Oscar (Beverly Johnson), a trained American medicine and a doctor. When doctors were doctors, one day he was hijacked by a slaves known as a slave girl Sulaiman (everyone played perfectly with Peter Ustinov). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But rather hopeless with a gun and action element. He first helped campaign against a slave of the English who did not accept that Reis Harrison! Then helicopter pilot (William Holden) and then the Arab named Kabir (Kabir Bedi). The owner has a score to sit with Suleiman (he's very impressive, very compelling character), and so he invents David to find out and get back to Anja - it involves an amazing scenario, which David unfortunately fails to get on top of his camel. /> <br /> There are so many courage. Morality has many questions. The progress of the story is a little predictable from this point, and there are some freedom to move things with some quick independence, but it is all very forgiving. The question is, before Peter Ustinov sold him to Omar Sharif, David would take Anasah (yes, of course, Omar Sharif is in it!)?
