The main character of this movie falls into two categories: Smart and Fool <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Without Monderes, Studa can go through life by achieving some general degree. Life will never be annoying with the Ondraj, but without the headache! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <ref Try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek and his henchmen Zdenek's secret safe. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of the Czech film. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic must have produced more than its share of excellent entertainment. The best check movies I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? Who and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Volunteer (Dark Blue World). If you see these two films, you must have seen the best of Czech cinema.
