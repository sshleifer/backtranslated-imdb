A beautiful new print of "Jabersky Point" seems to be running in Paris and works well in the Latin quarter. It is a full evaluation film time. Hopefully the new print means a DVD with somewhat insightful "extra" will be out in the near future. <br /> <br /> It seems like seeing JDP, it was a crushing bare. This time I was almost completely awed and classified as a "near-miss" masterpiece. The first part of the film was a time capsule of the last 60's in Los Angeles, then I was there, and Antonioi acquired the essence of the place's retention. The producer pleased Dean Tevolaris, who found some incredible position and did great work. <br /> <br /> I ran 1 hour and 50 minutes for the print that I saw. It is forbidden to under 16 (or 18, I can think). I suspect there are several of these footage restored to print. Spinner - I'm surprised how much the desert sex scene was originally cut. What it shows today is changed according to the current values. <br /> <br /> The picture does not have soundtrack music up to about 1 hour. Before listening to external sounds like radio broadcasts, Antonyoni was brave to do this. I think the absence of non-acting skills was made by how much actor Frank Frey and Daria Halfrin. This time Frey did not bother me. Halpin is weak but gradually improves with the image running. <br /> <br /> Most student riot footage looks like stock footage to me. One shot is distorted by a different aspect ratio and wide screen. Of course, there are actual stage footage, but not so much. <br /> <br /> How do I still try to recognize some of the flying frights in the flying airtight aircraft? It looks like he did something really flying - there's no blue screen or some shots do not have twice. <br /> <br /> I would like to see the second time again. All Antononii fans highly recommend.
