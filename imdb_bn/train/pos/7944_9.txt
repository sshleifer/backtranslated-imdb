Have you ever, or have you, a pet who has been with you through thick and thin, without you going to lose, and no matter how much you love? Never thought that they were similar to you! <br /> <br /> Wonderful, wonderful family movie. If you have a soft spot for animals, you are guaranteed to cry for your age. When I was a boy, I used to always watch this movie, and now I have found it at the age of 16, then I love as much as I did. I could not decide on any favorite character, and I still can not remember! I love all three creatures. Dialogue seems very good and comfortable, like a loving, but deadly family. I love the love, and in the end he said that he eventually has a family. Chess, yes, but remember that this is meant to be a family film, and it plays that role perfectly. Sassie just got the perfect level of "tranquility" and Shadow young, brave Chancellor is the perfect leader / role model. <br /> <br /> The way of animals expels people, but most lively moments of course have had an interaction time with them (ie Molly, and the last recovered). Unbelievable soundtracks are not to mention that every moment even more emotions, and an accompanying heart rate feeling. I give this 9/10. Compare (and even better than) cats and dogs and babies.
