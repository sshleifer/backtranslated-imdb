I'm no fan of the new movie, but there was a real pleasure to see this one. Adults and children can see it together - how unusual! I liked my auntie. It is laugh, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking tug. This reminds me of a favorite, Wizard of Oz. Hero, Polly, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his family and family, and he goes through many friendships, temptations and despair, always remembers his resolution to find his friend Marie. Highly recommended.
