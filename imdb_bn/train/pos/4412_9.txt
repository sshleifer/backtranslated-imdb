I have seen this movie twice in DVD and it has failed to affect me both with my unique neutral attitude. This is just like the real picture of one of Hollywood's rent, especially one that is still discussed. Although it is closely intertwined with the South approach, it fails to question, and in the end only the sentence is passed that the war is lost, no matter, and cruelty is a common contradiction. <br /> <br /> What really denies the outstanding drama drama of this movie. The mainstream rent is enjoyable (if you do not have high expectations) really good movies (briefly) few and far away, but very commercially encouraged. I think this movie really comes as a good movie (not composing best), because it takes itself, and lets viewers see it and analyze it and give it an opportunity to see and analyze instead of bombarding it. Intelligence This movie is quiet, observant, and usually handed down lightly in its judgment, which is good. <br /> <br /> The errors of the story, especially the gem character, were suspiciously closed, but then again the situation was so disorganized, that for a young widow, it can be even logical to get back to normal life, even after every next person . He still does not come as weak, actually I think he is one of the strongest characters, he is always in control of the relationship, only tagging men. And I am very grateful that he is not a weeping widow. I believe in the 19th century that the death of a loved one is now very normal. Even you can die even small illnesses and injuries so easily, the expectation of someone's death at the time of death does not hurt people like this now. People do not seem to like them building temples like lost people like them, and I like that attitude. <br /> <br /> My recommendation is to watch this movie for cute people, if they think something different than normal Hollywood fares. Do not watch if you want non-stop action or passion to hire the heart.
