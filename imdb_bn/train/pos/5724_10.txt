Multiple spots on the back of the spine! I'm surprised, there are people who do not like it! At around 10:30 am I was still scared! And I've seen hundreds of thriller / horror movies! Aloud, I'm 22! I mean, okay, voice acting, not particularly good, maybe even B-Movie-Isha. But the real face of terrorism, the word impact, the flow! Very early, steady, apologize, you hit again and again with the terrorist scene! No one is still surprised by the clich√©! You know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, Bu! And you still jumped off the chair. Capture a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend and do not watch it at night! Japanese hats off!
