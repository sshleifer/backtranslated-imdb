This wonderful little movie has all the elements that make Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: Great music (only if female musician is not the only one to work in the new Orlando), omission of action sequences (and very sad for days!), And Beautiful scenery and set (all Almeria, Spain, of course). It has a very good story with a nice sad romance edge. Actors do extraordinary work - Lawrence Dabinin and Rosalba Neri (Real Waste Upon at Time in the West "), as well as Cardinal's most important role for Spaghetti Western soil. Without posting any spoilers, I have just seen that this movie is that The best end of any film is included!
