At first it looked like a bizarre comedy like a strange couple, but when I came to it, it turned out to be a really funny movie. Originally forgotten former former comedian Willie Clark (Golden Globe winner, and Oscar and BAFTA Walter Matthew nominated) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner and George Globe nominated George Burns) was a great comedy couple and their hospital sketch was brought back together for recovery. For a TV show. Willie's nephew Ben Clarke (Golden Globe winner Richard Benjamin) is confident that they can be reunited without any strong feelings for each other, how wrong he is They can not get at all, they are both forgotten, especially during the conversation, but they eventually do it. Also, Lee Meredith has scratched nurses (Miss McNantos), Carol Dillies Mrs. Doris Green, Als Dary, Rossetta Lenia Odessa, Vley Nurse and Space F. Muppets. Murray Ibrahim as mechanic I think the best line in this movie is Bernes, which mentions that Matthu called him "the son of a bitch." It was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Composition, Scrapple from other material, Oscar was nominated, BAFTA was nominated for Best Screenplay and it won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Music / Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. very good!
