I accidentally found this movie, but I found what I liked. Kenneth Branagh's performance came from Helena Bonham Carter's theft theft, but their firm chemistry was together for more enjoyable films. This movie reminds me of the excellent films made with Bramhama Emma Thompson. Carter's star turned around as a disabled young woman who wanted to complete herself, as I have seen for a long time from the female leadership. It is difficult to portray an impaired person, but basically only to show his pain in his eyes for his condition, he makes it so credible. If this movie comes out of the current wave of the movie "Running" for their roles (Wrlz Theron, Hell Berry), I'm sure that Carter could have firmly considered for Oscars. If you run the movie on the cable at night, believe me, it is worth the lost sleep.
