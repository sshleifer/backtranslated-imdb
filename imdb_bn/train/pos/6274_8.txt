I went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night. I do not really hear a lot about it. So I did not expect anything. But after I see it, I really like it. Nicholas Cage and the rest cast was very good. But I do not need to say that Geovani Ribi's acting performances should be of little interest. But such a small error, it can be overrided. <br /> <br /> About a retired car retired in 60 seconds who would have been encouraged to save up to 60 viruses and an external vehicle to save his brother's life. Movies are predictable in any way. So the end should be a suprise. It seems that this is just another, fast car driving movie? Well you're partially right. It has a lot more. Everyone has to take a look at this movie.
