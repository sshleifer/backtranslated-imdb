Plans were a little dust, but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to see. Because I call it the most realistic reality show because I'm not surprised, Charlie has been racing out relatively quickly. Her hand was unfortunate, I expected normal miracles and then a miracle fix, but instead she actually left the race. The most worrying moments of the show were to trap McKay with water or food in the desert! The last was great and the team was very happy to see at least one person. Overall, Long Way is not big like rounds, but it's definitely an interesting watch, since one keeps an eye on the most challenging nation in the world.
