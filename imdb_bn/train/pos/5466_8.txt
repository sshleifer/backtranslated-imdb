Excellent, time-honored, pre-code amorial story with Stanwick, its inspiration and its new inspiration to use! The German philosopher is not fair but interesting that this year Hitler came to power. Even Stanwick did not do much for me even in this young version, but he must have done well here, taking the film forward and himself. As much as the meat does not show up here, it can be expected, but there is plenty of great conditions and wonderful quips and exploration. Great fun, if men are not particularly attractive presentations and I honestly do not assume that the excitement of gold digging is a very interesting scene of the woman. Still, that life!
