This is a slow movie, gradually starting a new family life with a complete stranger who build stories of a former stripper. Visitors slowly think that there is something wrong ... <br /> <br /> I really like this movie though it eventually leaves a little nasty taste. It's cute, well-paced and very well played. Both Philip Toroton and Emmel Signer are deeply in their character. <br /> <br /> Little boy "Pierat" is very sensitive. <br /> <br /> A thriller that does not seem to be A very incomplete film, very special atmosphere across the whole film, though you may feel strange with some scenes several times. <br /> <br /> I will give it 8/10 !!
