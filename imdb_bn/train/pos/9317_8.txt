I've criticized this movie with the statement, "If you can overcome morality ..." which misses the point. Moralizing was in the observer's conscience, as was the case. This is a decent film with an ideal killup mystery, but a unique twist on the upper surface of the middle surface. The offer surprises the viewer, "What do I do in this position?" And I must believe that the filmmaker is exactly what he did. To the end, and at the end of entertaining listeners, the film is successful. I like that violence does not occur gradually, only camera shutdown We know what happened; It is not just served in front of us, then wrapped in our mouth, it will be today with contemporary blood and gore dress. Besides, not the point of violence. The point is dramatic, moral conflict, which is cleverly, although dangerously, resolved.
