Hi I'm from Taft California and I like this movie because it shows how our small football games love our sports football, the main theme of Taft and this film shows that I personally think they should be someone else but instead the actors Games to play the game using kids, you better see our determination à¦¼. For the last 6 years we have defeated Bakesfield every player and I am senior next year, this is my last chance and after college we were lagging behind. If I want to know you, I am Kyle Taylor and I carry seven to eight yards away and play around 75 times playing around five times or playing around five times around it so that our website test us and leave our sports page Go
