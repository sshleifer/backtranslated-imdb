The movie celebrates life. <br /> <br /> Being established for the world's innocent and pure soul, and everything is "Happy Ending", like the last scene of the movie. <br /> <br />> The wonderful soundtrack of the movie, Serbian Neopoulos, Gypsy Music and Jazz Blend <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am sucked in another colorful, romantic and sometimes rough world. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kusturica should be like movies.
