The man never heard of the moon until this HDTV channel was seen last evening. Look, my taste is like another, eclectic From my favorite Blue Velvet to Dr. Strangelvoo, The Ghost and Mrs Muir Threes the Wizard of Oz and The Loved One, Arshedhed, Repo Man, and The Spy In. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is created nicely, a gentle, heartfelt, pleasant and tragic film, beautifully portrayed, in which actors live in the moment rather than actually acting. This sweet story will soon be our private library. In this long time in rural Louisiana, this beautiful story of life has literally shifted you to its municipality settings. <br /> <br /> Stoeck is hard at the end of the movie, especially when the young woman feels her pain in private pain and pardons. <br /> <br /> Rather than being pleased with this unhappiness or in my neutral prose, you will end this offer who enjoys the film that we are talking about from the heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> If you buy any other movie, please buy the man in the moon. One of these moving stories you will enjoy reliving again and again. It is a joy and a jewel, a harsh heart a film in this world. <br /> <br /> A delight to see the simple qualities shown in humans in the moon. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Monsanto Key, Florida <br /> <br /> 05 April 2009
