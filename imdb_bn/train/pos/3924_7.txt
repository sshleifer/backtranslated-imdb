The 1939 film director John Ford and author of Abraham Lincoln, the young lawyer of the writer Lama Trotty, tells a story of his trial (literally) and his plight. This is a passionate movie, reasonably well made but rarely exciting. Henry Finder's castings like Lincoln seem to be a mistake, because the actor had the right to blame, even with a few inches of makeup and false nock, he is a supernatural Abe, who is very nice for the famous Homio. It's a good effort from Fonda, who is not sincere but nothing, but his wrong idea closes the whole film. The helpful cast is nice, though, and includes Alice Brady, Word Bond and Donald Make. But Ford is very respected in its link-making treatment, which is presented as a shy of a saint and goes to the top of the film in the final scene.
