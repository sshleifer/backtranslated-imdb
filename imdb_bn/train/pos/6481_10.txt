When I was young, I saw this series and loved the details and never forgot. I finally bought the DVD collection and just how I think. This is exactly how a doco should be, regardless and practical. Film footage is incredible and fantastic to interview. <br /> <br /> If I just see Hollywood sit down and want to watch this series, then they can create some great war movies. <Br /> <br /> Note. Brothers of Band, Private Ryan Reservations, e-zo Jim's Letter, Our Father's Flag and When Some of the Trumpet Fade I Recommend
