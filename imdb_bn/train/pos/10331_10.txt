QUARTET made after, short story by TRIO Maugham continues the quality of the film version. Here are three stories VERGER, Mr. Known-IT-O, and Sanitaryum As the first two comics (Borger long joke, but with a good salary), and the last serious (involving health problems) Again the author introduces pictures and stories. <br /> <br /> James Hector, soon has his signature role as Samuel Pique, the hero in Vergara. He holds this small custodial-type job in a church, but the new Vicar (Michael Hordern) is an intellectual snob. When he heard that Hayter did not have any school, he shot him. Heeter has saved some money, so he tells his wife (Kathleen Harrison) that he is buying a small news and tobacco shop. She has a good eye, and thrives in her shop. Soon he has a complete chain of stores. His grandfather was named by Horden, later surprised to see how his former Verger was rich. Bank manager Felix Alem√©r met Heeter on the diversity of his investment when he made a profit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> m. KNOW-IT-ALL Kelada is a splashy, friendly, and slightly stronger type from the Middle East, which is a business trip through jewelry (jewelry). His Prince companion Mr. Gray (forever cool and precise Wilfried Hyde-White) who is a little silly McCay's insulting. Mac likes to make things breathtaking, and is soon involved in the pleasure of the ship. At this moment the story is actually similar to the non-fiction story and the film is part of the plot of China SEAS (1935), as Mac makes a fake that he can tell a real part of the jewelry from the fake (he is real to show). Max will not describe how this program has grown. <br /> <br /> The longest segment of sanitaryram. Roland Calvar "Ashenen" (Fascination of the Mushroom - ego) - a writer like Secret Agent of Hitcoak and one time spy). Here he has to use a sanatorium for a few months for his health. He was a wonderful but beautiful young woman with Gene Simmons, Finlay Curie, who, as a scandalous Scottishman, found John Lorry as a quiet patient in the "war" with Kerry as the second quarter Scottishman, Raymond Huntley, as a cool patient. When his wife shows her wife, she shows her inner anger, and Michael Rene is a serious life-threatening illness as a young man. Like three stories in these characters, cooler watches play with their decision. Finishing, Dealing with Simmons and Renny, Maritime but deeply moving <br /> <br /> This was a painful follow-up of the previous QUARTET and it was good to see.
