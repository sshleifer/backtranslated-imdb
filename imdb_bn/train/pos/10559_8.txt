I have not written a review for IMDB for a long time, but I forced myself to write this down! Seeing this movie, I get a special review, which requests the public to not see the film. Do not pay attention to this unconscious person! Nothing is full of a fantastic film, smile and above all ... imagine! Are you sick and tired to supply the old cycle of bubble-gum trash movies? Sometimes a movie that does not come up and gives you something you have never seen before. If I dislike the movie (even hating), I do not have any difference. IMDB has a respectable effect and should not deny the film as a negative review. Just say why you hate it and why you hate it ... but people do not try to say it will not. We have our own mind and thank our own mind. <br /> <br /> If my judgment is good, then I would say that more people will enjoy this movie to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not seeing anything!
