Bell Book and Candle were released in December 1958 and released the features of James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemon. And Arnie Kovaks. The film was on the second screen, after James Stewart and Kim Novak (after Alfred Hitchcock's classic Vertigo released later this year). Stuart's last film was a romantic lead, because at age 50, he seemed to be more and more young. The film is about a witch directed by Kim Novak, who has attracted a mortal, led by James Stewart. She kept a spell on her and she fell head on her with love heels. I enjoyed the movie and its cast. This film was a moderate success which was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Movie Comedy.
