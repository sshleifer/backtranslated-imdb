I recently saw this movie in my international business class. I was not thinking of any other annoying documentary (I do not want to say that I do not like the documentary which I got a bad fortune with movies in the class) Imagine my surprise when this movie was actually a movie. <br /> <br /> This picture says all the cultural differences in the workplace and the need to go anywhere elsewhere. The clash of culture shows how different the world is and how we can understand each other separately and let us wake up. Yes it is fun because I would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or just want a smile. <br /> <br /> All right! Cheers
