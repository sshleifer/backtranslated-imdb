I'm in "Christopher River Generation", not saying that he was the best actor of the superstar, but I do not prevent him from enjoying other actors in this role, and George Reeves bids well for disappointment. Chris is upstairs, though he rarely falls. It does not prevent me from enjoying this movie, much is going on for it. It requires a movie, a plot with the beginning, the middle, and the end, plus all that part is written intelligently. The film is both mad in acting and story, with some film-silent but tighter clothes. The story is both exciting and meaningful, this is a movie which is not very public in a message. I am still surprised, this has shot fame for 12 days in Hollywood's glorious days, when no waiting for 5 years, when it will be seen that the film will be suddenly upgraded to hell ... the image is made smoothly and efficiently, operated by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, well-known for both speed and skill guidance. It does not slow the limitations of technology, in fact, do some creative work to create the impact of the flight, such as putting a camera on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to see it, which we see is Superman's perspective. From, some works off of George's work and long shot of an animated superman. <br /> <br /> It is now available in DVD as the additional feature of the first season of the George Reve television series. A DVD owned by its own DVD, incorporating the film into its original, covered on a cake. <br /> <br /> Give blood today!
