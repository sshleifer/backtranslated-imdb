I used to watch this event as a child, and I liked it! When I saw it in Taiwan years ago ... Shise, I'm so old! When I was 13 or 14 years old, of course ... but anyway, it was a great plot line, and I was one of the girls who saw the silmoon (and adored), and I enjoyed it. The animation was not the best .... In fact, it was very fun in some parts, and the voice was very long at the beginning of the acting, but it was a good watch and I sucked myself day after day. </ br> <br /> Samurai Trupper / Ranin Warriors is a classic and the best of my favors of all time. Go rai !!!!
