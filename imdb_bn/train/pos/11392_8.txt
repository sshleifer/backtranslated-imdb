Paris is the place to enjoy beautiful art and music, and the place to fall in love - for example in this movie. The boy fills the girl, they fall in love, but there is something in their infinite happiness, the classic story. <br /> <br /> The amazing music of Georges Garcin is done by Jean Kelly and Leslie Kerron's wonderful dance. "An American in Paris" is a nice, light-hearted, loving movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br />
