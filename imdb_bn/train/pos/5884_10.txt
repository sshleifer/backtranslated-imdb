Really, I liked it. The compound was good, the story where both the series were closed and my favorite part was here. Mary and Valerie do not bitter! They are not like the others who became synonymous with a particular series, and then refuse to talk about it, or possible reunions (a major example is Susan Day, "The Parties Family"). Actually, Valerie says that she will be thrilled to do another movie, and then Mario said the same thing later, so I used to look at someone else ... but if it does not work well then they can run this one again.
