The five deadly genome is a great Kung Fu action movie that covers the mystery of Hoodunnit. There are all the usual statement signs of Kung-Fu Fic: great dancing, horror dubbing, various "styles" of war and widely overwrought, often human-emotional cheese. But the plot is better than the average of the game. It holds your attention across the striking and non-combat wars. Occasionally it can burn audiences, such as when the X-letter gets terrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I love about five serious genomes is the morality of the movie and the beautiful simplicity of the themes. Everyone gets what they are coming about. Lose nasty, greedy, and corrupt. Bad people eaten by selfish greed, are ultimately destroyed by their own betrayal and backstabbing. Good guys overcome the views and come out on top to use teamwork, plans, and honesty. <br /> <br /> Toxic Clan Stones!
