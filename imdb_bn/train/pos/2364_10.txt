I will be obliged to accept the story of the original M. James James, although I have read many of his other supernatural stories. I have seen most of the previous BBC Christmas Ghost Stories and in this opinion, in my opinion, most of them pass, just like signals. <br /> <br /> I really can not make a scene wrong from the mountains - direction and 'mood' is perfect, acting, light and, of course, stories and writing. I enjoyed it thoroughly and could expect more of this quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC plans to do more (not necessarily based on the story of the M.R. James) so that it is committed. <br /> <br /> 10/10
