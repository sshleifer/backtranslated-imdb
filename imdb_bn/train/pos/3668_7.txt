I recently saw this picture and enjoyed it a lot. It gives insight into indie cinema and if you have a low budget, at least how much work is involved, yet to get an actor / actress man, a person can see it and expose the film exposure. Bobby Myers, directed by Mdina and her partner Saul, created a nice combination to discover Paul Linder Elcantry Mitchell Betts, a "NAME" actor directed by Alan Bates, and a perfect casting decision for the film. My favorite cast member was Sandy Ryan, who played an impressive and poor debut with his own special performance in the film. Seeing the comedy you enjoy the idea but it's for you. Low budget meeting low budget with high laughter content.
