Anyone who has watched the movie and critically reviewed this, I'll review this movie by Roger Ebert. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry, and he gave it 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It can not be perfect, or spectacular, but I enjoy it. A chorus line is not so much stories, it is a group of broadway optimistic life stories. I read the reviews where people said that too much time was lost in romance between Jake and Casey. See that a mistake. It is another story along with other stories that Broadway hopes are said about each other. People who fail to understand that the dancers for Broadway shows go through the same thing to go through ordinary people. And that's what I really think is the whole show point. This is not just the genius of these particular dancers, but to show us some tragic things about ordinary life. It is a study of life as a broadway star. Seeing the dream of being a Broadway star, anyone who sees this film a great feeling of relation because they have crossed the characters. <br /> <br /> This is a great musical instrument. Slowly slowly, and some of the story lines are confusing to the pacing, but above all, I enjoyed it completely. Keep an eye on the film more closely and then you will understand what I am saying.
