<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Excruciatingly Bad (Downs-Syndrome!) Actors. Horrible heavy self important dialog The scene that is supposed to shock but fallen is falling. Jarring Edit Pointless plot point. A kind of reverentic sunny type covering the audience and unclear mind-drill. <br /> <br /> It is exactly how it was designed. An absurd mockery of these bitter movies created by unfortunate teenage trust-funders, when they ask their parents what they are doing in the past two years! "what is this?" Received his ear prize, the presenter Warner Heerzag was threatened to be part of his own film, actually a blast! He blew at the supposed data Today, he declined to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> However, look and smile, for many years this humor will be a classic.
