For more than 40 years, I had an attractive attraction with the tornado, because my 5th grade teacher, a local Texan, told the story that she saw her young man. Thankfully, I spent my entire life in medieval Atlantic, where tornadoes are rare and not usually violent like Midwest, but I have two close encounters, one PA and the other NJ, in the last decade. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed family scenes, especially the conflict between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was closed, Dan knew most of what he had to do, and perhaps he learned it at school because I know that tornado safety is important in some parts of the United States where these storms are more frequent. However, the character of the movie has done two things that some people think or feel safe in tornado, but it is generally not supposed to be done or is unsafe. <br /> <br /> When Siron made the first word, Dan and Arthur opened the window through the house. For years, this work is what people are called, but the tornado security web site is now advised against this work. Also, people are shown hidden in a highway underpass. During this relatively low vulnerability to cancer, this method was popularized by TVV crew in the early 1990's. However, among the most severe tornadoes, people can be sucked from these underpasses. It happened during the May 1, 1999 Oklahoma outbreak. <br /> <br /> The movie's tornado collapsed, which is not a common time for them. (Then again, one of my closest encounters happens in the last September.) Also, they travel southeast from the northwest, when such storms in the Northern Hemisphere go from the northeast to the southwest. However, all of this is not that unusual. A famous tornado that hit Joliet, IL in the early 1990s traveled in that direction (like I was involved in a close meeting). <br /> <br /> I think the film should have been set in spring. This film was based on a book based on a real event that happened on June 3, 1980. But it was still an engaging story.
