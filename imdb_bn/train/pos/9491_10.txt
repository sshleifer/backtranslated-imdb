Henry Verneel's film Parlox View can not be as famous as Condor or JF for 3 days but it is certainly not bad and sometimes better than these classic representatives. The action takes place in the fictional Western state where the fabled President has been killed. A few years after the investigation, the special government commission decided that the president was murdered only by a gunman. But a person - a lawyer played by Evas Montand - thinks there are more investigations and so the film starts. This film does not deal with any specific theories, but it embraces the entire structure of relationships between the government and society of today's world. This type of film can only be made in the 1970s but it will never lose its reality. In addition, it's even a terrifying how accurate it is literally. 10 out of 10
