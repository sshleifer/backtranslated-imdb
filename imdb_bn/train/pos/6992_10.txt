I would not say it's a bad movie; Actually this is the type of liberation war type at the "Type Poverty Row" studio. As a respected member of the Lagosi Community, illustrated for monogramme, it is very effective in introducing itself as some harmful doctor-scientist. In this movie, Bella and her pregnant women have used rude behavior to steal young couples, and after their death, the boy's wife was injected with serum from her body to keep her in her youth. Logosi is much more than the creation of this enjoyable movie, but the film is suffering from the super-wooded role of co-star Luna Walter and the Trustworthy Coffin. Coffin (a terrific flick is an excellent name for a man) is particularly bad in this case. I saw him in many movies and TV shows and he is always the same; Hard, woody and totally frank. Miss Walters is just a little good, but she lacks acting talent to make her role credible. Yet visitors can enjoy the performance of the last lugosi, which will end in the end! Despite some poor performance, "Corps Vanishes" is all about an enjoyable movie.
