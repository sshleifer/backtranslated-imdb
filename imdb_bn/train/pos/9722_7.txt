Simon Peg, a young entertainment writer who started the beginning of career writing for a grassroot paper, shared it, which made the ruthlessness and authority of the wealthy and famous person worse. Although she has a great desire to be a celebrity herself, lamps are doing a job outside celebrities. This film was based on Toby Young's extremely bizarre career, who ran a small British newspaper named Morton Review, which offers tremendous criticism about many of the fantasies, until she closes the magazine on her partner oral oral bullets. Bhadralova went on to star in Fairly Fair as the author of Fairway, which said most of her life in this movie. <br /> <br /> He was thrilled to work on the first major publication (called Sharp's Magazine of Film) and despite his active nerves, he was positively humble in the first day. He met the Chief Editor, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges), who is as nail-hard, but to be employed in the magazine, he needs to be the kind of editor for hijacking like a young man. He offers small offers in the form of immediate recognition of young people, but also those that can be described as liberal tolerance of the wall of the wall and the inappropriate behavior of the wall. <br /> <br /> Most of the comedy is generally acceptable code of public behavior and is derived from the rationality or apathy of the extraordinary etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous person. But to play Sidney's strange way and the reasons for an out-of-the-way objectionable interview because she believes she is protesting the entire celebrity culture and it seems that she believes old age of that age? 'If you can not kill, then' ma ?? 'And then' bit '. <br /> <br /> There are two different women complaining about. There is a charming, regular girl in the magazine named Ellison. Olsen (Kirsten Donst) who is first concerned about Sydney's obvious arrogant and nervous system, and a stunning model called Sophie (Megan Fox), who represents celebrity culture. Noting that Sidney's patronage and endless attack of the stardom is a sponsor's wish, Sophie, one with a star look. <br /> <br /> Sophie is stunning beautiful, it comes true, but there is not a thought of rattling around her head. Ellison is a regular girl, not very attractive, but Donst's performance makes him a real person. The relationship with her will be the reality of a Britney Spear wedding, and still the film maintains some credibility, despite how clear it is, we also feel Sydney's pain does not follow her (I feel it, anyway). <br /> <br /> There is a strange interest in losing friends and isolated people and it is full of honest, satisfying performance, and it will be your ideal romantic comedy with third quality but it has different types of advanced and attractive characters. For example, Danny Houston has given us a great performance for Alison's other love interest, who respected his current favorite White Russian, B Big Lebowski (performing bridges) with my current favorite White Russia. Perfect in China and Kahlua is almost equal to 350 US dollars, but my kitchen is never without them. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for the day when Simon Peg will run a little, because I love his films but I'm totally uncertain about his scope. He played a serious character in Hot Faj, but he was just serious with the atrocities around him, and finally he took himself back to himself, which he did a lot, dead, run, fat boy, run and now Shauhan. How to lose friends She is a rising star, she will be interesting to see what she can do.
