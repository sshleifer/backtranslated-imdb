I've been fascinated by Chavez's position on globalization for a while now, but I do not see this movie at Amsterdam's Documentary International Film Festival until I understand what he actually achieved. This picture tells the story of coup / conspiracy to remove the democratically elected President Chavez by Venezuelan elite, oil company and oil-loving corrupt Western governments, and send Venezuela back to brutal dictatorship. Anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and this is a lesson for the rest of the world! I commend the Venezuelan people for their hand and protect their country from the likes of Halberton and Bush.
