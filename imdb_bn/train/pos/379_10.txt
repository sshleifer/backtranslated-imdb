1985 was a good year for the film - perhaps even superb - but it was a long way to convince fans who did not want this song to be a hood ornament for Ol Oskar's good party members. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not a single title: This was one of the best directors of the Academy. And anyone who wanted to wait for the previous 8 years, had already prevented him from transferring the statue, so that he could be given 7 for the list of skinlars, which is not reasonable, and not good (and I'm semi-Polish). <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong, Skinner was a classic. And I'm not spoiling 'Out of Africa' (which won that year); But in my mind it was one class after another: an epic story of sorrow and hope that brings me to tears - and I am not a great singer. Maybe it was music (fantastic), or cinematography (rich), but maybe probably Huopi, who proved to us all that he was much more than just a comic. Danny Glover, I've never heard before; And, of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history; But at that time, who knew?
