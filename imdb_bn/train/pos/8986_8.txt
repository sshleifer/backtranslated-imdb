Anton Newcomb created the film and he is the main subject. The whole song shows the person as a genuine talent if he sees him, if he refuses the song. He thinks he is God, but he is very indifferent and funny. DW is not that interesting in comparison to music or otherwise. "Hey, do you license a driver?" Anton said to the cameraman, "Let's get this giver in!" Great use of archive / home video elements Stone docs still look great to be made. A cool dock about the creative process. If you want to go this go see the intimacy live! Tonight! Sold out! On the DVD A good experience Anton this picture. 10 out 8
