The film's strong scene is quite long (Oli is called "shingfobabiya"), the film is a clear and enjoyable little flick. It's a great deal more than the movies made after it - probably the last of Hal-Roach-produced Lorele and Hardy's films. In fact, it would not be a bad idea to see a movie next to them, because the complete chemistry is lost in this film and the boys absolutely play their parts for the pasos - will never make real Laurel and Hardy movies. There was a bit of their next generation lacking. <br /> <br /> Stann and Wali Horn work in the factory. It seems pretty funny, but it's not. Not surprisingly with all the rockets, Oli has a nervous breakdown and will take some time off to work. Doctor (James Finsonon - his last film with the team) recommends an ocean trip However, they do not like sailing and there is the idea of ​​renting a boat tied with Stanka Dock - then they do not want all the ocean winds apart! Once they go to the boat, they manage a dangerously escaped criminal boat, and they all move towards the sea. Thankfully, this part of the film was really good and bad and the very last thing worked very well. <br /> <br /> Although Laurel and Hardy did not have the full length of the film, it was much better than many. This is no annoying and confusing musical numbers (like the children in the Devil's brother or toilet). In addition, there is still a modest amount of physical comedy - you will not see anyone after this film. This was due to the decreasing health of the boys (and Olei's growing) and the subsequent sections were due to the overall ambiguity of the following films.
