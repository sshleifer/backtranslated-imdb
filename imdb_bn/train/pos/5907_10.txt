This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. My parents came from rural India and some people saw the lives of villagers. People are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The movie is reflected in the same way. Director and actor full credits. They did a great job. I'm just surprised, like a hook and a tiger, how can a movie go for the Oscars, not Dogie. I do not understand the benchmark that criteria are selected. It makes a distinction by making money or having some big names in the film. <br /> <br /> I hope to see more movies in the future.
