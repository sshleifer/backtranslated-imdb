This movie is not historically correct, but it is great entertainment. Most of the demil photos, especially the next epics, are slowly and pladding, but here comes a clip action. The story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments. The action takes us from an Indian raid to the cabin; One of the best parts of the film while trying to make the natives happy with the war with Gene Arthur. Then he and Cooper were taken to the camp and tortured. Afterwards came a long fight with Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from the beginning to the end. Gene Arthur is the best actress of this era and she shines here
