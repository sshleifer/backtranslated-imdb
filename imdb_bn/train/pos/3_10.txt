"It's a stage in all the world and its people it's actors" - or something like that. Who said that the theater has been stopped at Arestra Pitt - or not at the theater door? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We sometimes take the story to you, sometimes you go to the story Will be. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
