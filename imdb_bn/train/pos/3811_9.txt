For a long time I have not seen such beautiful animated features. Pixar's good respect, I must say that Rattatoli or any other movie can not be compared to it. Animators have made an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are amazing, the background is mind-blowing around, almost every frame of every frame is drawn perfectly. Sometimes I felt tingles down my spine - so I liked so much that I saw it. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely romantic. An animated film as romantic could possibly be the plot. The character is lovable, especially hectares, blue rabbits, he owns, pawns, rocks and rules! Other households are very nice. Humor is the highest. <br /> <br /> It is generally thought that the manufacturers did not invest in such many efforts. I think it does not make much difference to Pixar and DreamWorks, who try every time to think about something new. And I am very happy that a product of European Animation Studios has grown so big. They made a fantastic, touchy movie, a candy for the eyes and heart. <br /> <br /> The only subtraction is the start of stupor and hence it is 9 ft 10 not 10/10
