A number of news agencies have been told and reported about the hidden Frontier aiming to produce the best Star Trek stories and to provide a long-term example of Gene Rondenbery's mission. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war, and acceptance of different nations is equal or more than other Trek series and movies. Production prices started as small and eroded, but during the production, performance has improved for more than 7 years, stories are more complex, and visual graphics have become more smooth and more efficient. Season 1 episode 1, Countermasters, one of the biggest space wars in the history of Trek history. Ships are well render and space war is impressive and exciting. Frontier's original draw is not the ship or the background, but it's the interplay and growth of individuals and characters. There are other trek series and nods with movies and places and characters we all know. I recommend no trek fan to check out countermeasures and you will be hooked!
