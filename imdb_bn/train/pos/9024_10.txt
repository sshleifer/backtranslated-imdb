Five years away from the survivors of Teno, and "Well that" from the bay of Marine <br /> <br /> Now it's 1950: Reunion time. All of the gang's here are: Merion, Bia, Ulric, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica, and Maggy and Elise's late. The story that is unveiled is a beauty: writing and acting perfectly, and as the original series is thought-provoking and ongoing. <br /> <br /> All the questions hanging at the end of the series are clearly answered here. From the Marine family to Joss's health center, everything has changed within five years, and everything has not changed well. <br /> <br /> A trip to Dominica plantation came in large amounts of shocks and some real ends. Tighten the seats. In this case there is a real concept of tragedy and disaster, again the fate comes down and women struggle for their life. Dominica finally shows her true colors, and plays some dramatic plays. <br /> <br /> Filing lash location in Singapore, and the opportunity to meet a group who feel they are friends. It's so shame that it's really the end. I could see it all again. Perfection
