When I was 7 years old, I saw this movie; And at that time it disappointed me. I have seen a violent movie before, but I've never seen a movie about the consequences of violence and reality. This movie just does not show up, but it also shows how people can change their life and choose happiness. What is this movie and fails to crash is to be truthful. How the crash tried to make racialism worse (and the crash was indeed a built-in anti-Asia bias) and brought it morally to a higher position. The Grand Canyon came at things like a raw and real perspective that it actually ended up on a high ground than the catastrophe. Especially when you compare the end. The end of the crash is up to everything that is supposedly up to this infinitely obvious little end. The Grand Canyon just ends up in a silent note, where you know something about the character's life will not change, but life can be fixed because there is no end to it. No matter how good ... bad you There is no end to end another chapter.
