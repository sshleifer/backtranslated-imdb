I do not understand the rating of less than 5.7 of this picture. It's a delight for a delightful plot and those who like dark atmosphere. Lunchell (Savanah) under the temple of Lord Vishnu is remembered and in the temple. Acting firm, and I was surprised to hear the southern part of Kenneth Brangh. Famke Janansen is great, a small part of Robert Duval is effective, and Embeth Davitz is in BOMB. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
