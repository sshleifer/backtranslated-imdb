I like it, after being a fan of the original series, I've always wondered what the story will be - it did not fail to make me happy. I also love that besides Eric Stoltz, I did not recognize a person - it's refreshing, much like BGG. This introduces me a whole new talent - the series can not wait to start wind. Good ronald d. Finished with Moore and the team - Excellent work. Special effects, dialogue and acting were all spots, and I felt emotionally bound in the story. I know that there is pureness that would probably disagree with my assessment, but I think that the majority of Syafai's content produced in the last decade was far better than the map.
