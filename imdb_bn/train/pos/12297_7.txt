Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> This version of Garbo's Anna Christian shot on a completely new cast in Germany a year later, only pulled down and enough refined version to work well from English (Both American MGM are produced). Garbo is more commanding (or better as the appearance of the screen) and its role is further controlled. And perhaps for most reasons, he thinks more about ease, but we can imagine that he is not making his first conversation, so quickly he adjusts it. <br /> <br /> Another always compares to a picture, this brought Christine O'Neill the same game with much more noise. Here's a theme here for her love for losing her independence, but since it comes out in a strange way. Some scenes are missing - The Connie Island section has been shortened and is not good - but overall it is a direct image of the first movie. The director, Jacks Feder (Belgian-French), which was only done already, is being repaired, which I guess is a disappointing experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see both films as inherited because they are properly blocked in the same way (not only set, but also similar to shots). A timeless scene has been presented from the previous movie - some storms, loads, but a short scene where Mary Dresler (from the English language version) walks with a friend on a canal with her friend, may be drunk. But they are simply free, and the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actor taking their part. Definitely, there is no substitute for Dresler, but German father for me is more credible and honest about his performance. <br /> <br /> Clearly the theme - migration, pedestrian father, daughters are turning to prostitution, and in search of real love of pain - especially European threads (Garbo, who plays Swedish girl correctly) have strong streams.
