The straightforward but good nature's drive-in movie, which is a general psychoanalytic but beautiful degree of high school graduation, who has dreamed of being the owner of the best custom van in the world as its "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Bobby, our protagonist, spent his whole savings to earn his dream car. Jupiter sharing and a fast-moving girl Bobby has emerged from the local Pijar Parlor, but she finds many responsibilities, dangers and heartwarming as she is the owner of a mechanical miracle owner. <br /> <br /> Mine is a guilty pleasure. It has left the 70-minute mood behind and it has enough funny humor to put it into "so bad it's good" section.
