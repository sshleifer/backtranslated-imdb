Shower keeps itself in so many ways. Almost all the movies are used in the old Barnouse, where Deinjins provide humor, deviation and emotional touch. Love and friendship between the owner and his disabled son is deep and moving. The big brother is the way to drag in this tiny world and seems seduced. The plot is awful, full of surprises and ironies, and a relationship between relationships and the neighbors in the opponents will make an overall touch by a sense of what is to be done. I want to believe in the world again when it pulls out of a film.
