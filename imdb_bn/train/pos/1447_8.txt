I went ahead to read this negative picture and read negative comments, moving forward. I acknowledge that the film was incredibly complex, involved and had to be reviewed several times as detailed details. This is a good thing, however, that this movement and the characteristic development of character is quite unexpected in this culture of violence, explosion, unused sex and general violence. Indeed, what a welcome exit, I used to do, I do not pay much attention to what I watch. <br /> <br /> This image is full of character development and plot line! That kind of used to analyze when we are in high school. It requires real emotional participation in the audience segment. What a nice change. In terms of generic content, I will compare it to the 'President's Chief'. That is, it is a mystery on the part of the aggressive behavior of officials on the part of the officials and necessary effectiveness of their own 'self' on their own. <br /> <br /> In contrast to 'All the President's Men', this film tries to give some characters of genuine personality. In this sense, the film is critically acclaimed as 'The Negociariur' and with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Speacy. In that movie, their character is the city employee and plot very intense. Yet, this plot is dependent on the power of their characters, to cooperate with each other, to believe in it and ultimately to unite against the corrupt police department. This picture is more like a firearm and a specific plot, but there are many similarities in the general. <br /> <br /> I would say that City Hall needs more concentration. In fact, when I went back to Watergate in my life, I was paranoid to present political stigmas and present. The thing is, people know that something is wrong, sure! But it is difficult to follow the details. This movie is not as complex as real life, but it is actually realistic in case of complexity. I think previous posters criticized the film because one of the reasons: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If someone looks at this intelligence and is in the experience, it is really nice! I saw it in queue 3 times! The acting is fantastic and the instructions are faulty. The weakest link is the pronunciation of John Cusack.
