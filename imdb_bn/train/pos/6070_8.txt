Yes, Shakespeare will be really proud. Lawrence Fisborne was his best but certainly not bad. On the other hand Kenneth Brannag was bright. His scheming was spectacular with the audience. Very nice job <br /> <br /> Sometimes there were very few plays where there was more expected. For example, Casey's assassination was a bit clouded by a lot of events, dragging his head to drag his head to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Malani? Radar Girgo was insignificant in his craziness; Even annoying <br /> <br /> See if you have not seen Othello before. If you do not read Othello, check it out. If you have not heard Othello see it. On the other hand, you do yourself good to read it yourself, have seen that it played on stage and it is in favor of listening.
