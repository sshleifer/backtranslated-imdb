How nice. I love the whole series, and who commented that they ended up badly and commented. Perhaps it's been a bit worse in the 4th and 5th seasons, and better than any other on television. But 6 and especially 6b more muscles were growing on the better theme in the first three seasons. <br /> <br /> <br /> A psychological mood and the family of Janice started with intense insights, just as Tony had forgotten about the destructive line of fantasy intelligence for the 6th B spring and sightseeing. Nobody knows that Tony missed the impact of that series for anyone. Malifi's discomfort on psychological research and the differences in the self-degraded feeling of pandemics for pets and animals goes back to the first episode of the series, not to say that the Tony Panic attack leaves his pond and fills the "Wave bye-Bye" coup (final episode) Chase does not get dark humor) Before his grandfather's line. <br /> <br /> I could go, but I would add that I was thinking the final event - starting with the open strains of Vanilla Fazze, the ferrous predicted ("You Can Hang me On") Terminal moment where Tony is with his family With the return of the crying or the explosion, the head of the SUV or Phil's head was completely, completely accurate. The best TV ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Mr. Chase is a tip of pork pie.
