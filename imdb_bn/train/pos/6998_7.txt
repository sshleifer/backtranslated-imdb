I did not know what I was going to see seven pounds, and it certainly did not get it because I could understand what the movie really was. So within the first 20 minutes or you have completely lost the plot, there is no idea and you think the team, who Ben claimed, is just a big ass. When all of this is finished "Twist", so to speak, it is revealed at the last minute of the movie. In fact, Tim (Smith) was frustrated and he was frightened by a major accident after the death of seven people. Through this, he decides to help seven new people who feel badly needed help. She <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> part seems like she is impressed. Rosario Dawson, to me, it is one of his best movies, the eagle away from the eye which I think there are. He has done some good things but he is giving this film. Other actors, such as Lady Harrison, have a very small role, and this is not a big role to realize the character. Although film castings were still good. <br /> <br /> This movie was not what I expected and certainly I hope it is very slow. Movies, however, were still quite good. The film does not appear until the last 5 minutes and everything is there. Until then it seems like a timeless love story. The final thought is seven pounds = seven stars.
