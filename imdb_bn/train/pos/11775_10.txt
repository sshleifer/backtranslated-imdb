Along with this "Honey Tonic", one of the best bug cartoons, is one of the really best bugs. What are the bugs on these cartoons that have some comments about "basic", which means I'm still not fully developed. I actually liked this "basic" version (Chuck Jones' best version) in the mid-40s, which is actually much more fun than the size of the rabbit and the last longer leg version, Jonatem Sam and Duffy answer on the duck. The next day the bugs were very desired and came to be sophisticated for my favorites. Also see "Hair Rising Heer" (1946) and "Robit Punch" (1948) for classic examples of classic bugs and classic Chuck Jones.
