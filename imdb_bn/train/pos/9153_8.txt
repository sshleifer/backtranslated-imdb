I finally got to see this after hearing great things about it. It actually exceeds my expectations. Considering the budget involved this was an amazingly capable and well-built film. The lack of money actually helped the film in various ways, especially the plot was given. Similar to The Blair Witch Project, this film was even better to shoot in video instead of film. Another bonus: Although the worst budget horror films (even the best of the best) are facing moderately-to-unknown violent performances, this film actually had a talented cast (save one or two letters), especially two leads. The only thing missing from the film was a key tale. It takes a lot of money from famous movies like "Delivery" and "Wrong Turn", but if you're like me, these types of movies can never be horrific. Plus, the director keeps the life span. I'm interested to see what the director will do with a very big budget and I think it will be a matter of time before our time ...
