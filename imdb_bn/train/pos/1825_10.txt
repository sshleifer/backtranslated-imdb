I watched this movie when I was younger, and I think it was one of the first films I really liked that it was not an action movie or comedy. So, in my next years, I decided to watch it again and it was only Nostalgia or it was really something in the movie. My surprise, the movie held expectations towards me. This is a great movie. The right amount of emotional, some joke, nice songs (though not great, and actually explains why I do not think it was a musical) and always used to be wonderful for all my time. I am surprised because I revisited the last films of my childhood and did not pass even the minimal demands of my film, and yet this movie, which I saw in the first grade, has cried to me today, as I cried. Perhaps because my dog ​​has recently and probably not died, the important thing is that I feel, and that's why filmmakers make movies (of course and of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, there are script holes, but it does not matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So do not be fooled by cruel people, who always look for bad things in life, because nothing is perfect and this movie gets 10 because it is perfect. It seems to me because it gets 10.
