The first film in the film shows a mountain bottom in the autumn fog and I thought: "It is very beautiful." And it's going on: The image of landscape and animals that look like a series of romantic images, everyone is perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. It may seem old and seductive, but it is a story that matches slower beauty, between the life and fairy tales, in the border, between Dian Fossas and Le Pett Prince. I enjoyed it every minute. The film's tremendous betrayal, a simple, slow story, is simply an actor and rarely produces a special effect, a strong magic. So, in the past two minutes I gave up this mischief, it seems frustrating, when suddenly two additional actors (as a big girl and her son, her son) were introduced. Another disappointment is music, which is often like Hollywood, and sometimes inappropriate: I could not bring English pop songs with the glory of the French hills. I went to film together with my two little girls, but I also recommend it to adults, because they appreciate such a movie. Of course, not everyone.
