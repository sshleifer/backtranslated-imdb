Disney did it again. Timon and Pubba were brought back to life again and how they came to tell us and when Symbar needed them they had to help. I love this picture and watch it over again It shows how Timon lived with his family and fellow girlfriends before finding his dream home and adventure. Then he met Pumbaa and changed the thing. Together, they searched for Timon's house and failed repeatedly, Timon became more crazy, which is funny. Then, Simba returned and we saw her earlier childhood than we did in the previous 2 films. The rest, you already know.
