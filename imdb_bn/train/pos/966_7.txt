2005 Toronto Film Festival Report Official; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " . <br /> <br /> Colin Zades, this fearless programmer says that this film is mainly interested in children in Japan. Think of "Ring Lord of" or "New Equending Story" for Japan. After screening, I realized where they were going, but after all it was "Takashi Mike". While administering the 2012 film "Ichi The Killer", he handed the exhibition Barf's bags to screenings. <br /> <br /> Plot Summary: A little boy becomes "elected" about the life of a boring home and he falls in the midst of a great soul war, where he meets the friendly spirits who join him through his journey . <br /> <br /> This is not really 'young', not really for kids. Of course, their spirits (even more friendly ones) became obscured with the display. Unlike what I saw in this movie theater. An imagination is naturally, some very interesting (but dark) elements. You will not be bothered that can guarantee Will this ever hit North America? Suspect <br /> <br /> My rating = B
