Allan Rudolph's "Champions of the Champions" slides on the slide in the theater on the slide and because of many mockery, Keith Gordon's "Mother Night" came out in 1996. Now for all the conversations of Cartwong's "Unbroken" it is amazing that he got two great cinematic treatments (the other is "Slaughter-house Five"). "Mother Night" is one of the most astonishing movies of the decade and I do not understand why. It's brilliant! It is almost entirely faithful to Vonnegut's book (except for uninterrupted or too much literary) and it is a poem that purely incorporates the cinema. How many film writers can claim the adaptation of the work? Vongut itself also takes a low form at the end of the movie, and can you ask for better approval? This is not just a beautiful movie, it's a beautifully played, written and directed film and it's one of my favorites for the top five American films of the 1990s. It is a sad, inspired, spiritual composition that is not worthy of being ignored. I would sincerely encourage anyone to see "Mother Night" - it does not recognize Vanguard's work as a whole to be fully appreciated (like "Slaughter-house Five" sometimes). It is a powerful, influenced cinema piece.
