I saw this movie and the series, but now I am refreshing my memory! This was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Noxville and San William Scott together with Sunny Bose and Luke Dook assisted General Lee's Oscar Jesse Run Munsin. When Bose Hogg hangs Duke from his farm, Bo and Luke hog around the local construction site and find out the samples of coal. They soon realized that Hogg's Hogger County would leak out until the duck could stop him, with the help of his beautiful cousin, Daisy. I had two problems in the film that Booney Reynolds was not right for Bos Hogg and Sheriff Rozko P. Coleton was very serious. Since the other, I highly recommend DUKES of HAZZARD !!!
