I have seen a long period of time coming out of the movie, I thought the film had a good soldier's view, it gave a realistic account, the men in the war The story moves at a great speed, shows a group of men behind the enemy line and tries to return the enemy prisoners to their own lines. Characters are well developed, and reliable. <br /> <br /> David Hemming plays a key role in a good actor and firmly, for example, Alan Dobie (as a German helmet) I was surprised that I was unable to find VHS or DVD, and I think it The forgotten movie has gone, which is tragic, because I've seen it as the best of all the other war movies.
