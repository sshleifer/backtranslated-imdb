I saw this movie, and I started to see her character development, I can remember it would be a nice picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie actually meets those expectations, the experience is rare. I had that feeling very much throughout this movie. Robert Deanaro and Cuba Gooding Jr. both played riveting and surprisingly powerful parts which were both worthy of Oscar. The supporting cast creates a winning foundation to be increasingly firmly represented. I can say without any hesitation, watch this movie it will not be disappointing.
