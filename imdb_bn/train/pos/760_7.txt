Since the end of the 80's, I have not seen this film and decided to opt for its VHS version. The plot is very slow, and the actor seems almost robotics in this break flock. Music, hip hop / freestyle artists and breakdancing scenes make this film special. BreakingDesign is really good compared to "breaking", but I should say that the "Breaking 1 and 2" screen has a lot of energy and excitement, This is a movie that I will put in my library, but it is not a movie that I can see repeatedly, once in the blue moon.
