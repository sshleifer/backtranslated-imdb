One of Ireland's first animated feature film is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. This is a real fight and other stories that no other Oscar is nominated and in contrast to any other movie of this year. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film is Kells's Abbott of Kells. Ireland builds a wall around the city to prevent the city from being destroyed. His nephew Brendan, a young monk who did his best work but did his own catechism work with his uncle. When a legend illuminating Eid came from a debris monastery, Brendon looked at him and his warm personality. Teach the Brendan to illuminate a lot with his uncle's rebellious ideen. Edon went to the forest to collect material for the construction of his great book, Brendan ink, protected from his ruins, to help in the work of his works. On the outside of the wall, he meets Ashley, a forest soul with which he develops a friendship. Unfortunately, Abbott found out that he went out of the wall and there was a hell to pay. But it is hidden in the distance that vikatite ... <br /> <br /> Forget about what you think about this picture, you are wrong. Even I have not explained the film as well. It's a simple story with a lot going on. Trying to find your way around this world, trying to find the world's beauty outside the monsters and walls. (The film says that the world is a dangerous place and you do not even close the wall, but it is closed). <br /> <br /> is a movie that studies viewers as adult and related to their life. Dark. There is death and destruction and joy and happiness. Do not coat her sugar. People die Hide monsters. (It freaked out some of the kids), but there is hope in the end. Indeed, the dark of this film is quite different from a recent American film. For the Pixar picture forget the "sadness", this is the real thing and its refreshing, and it shows how the pixar has become. <br /> <br /> This is a Gender Tartakovsky-Esquiera (Samurai Jack) animated film look, actually based on Kalit's art of Kal. It is a film showing unlike any other. Here again another film that takes film frames and potentially uses it. The image is designed to fill the available space as much as possible. Often this film has been used to look like a page of the Kells legendary book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not say more than that . This is a wonderful composition. I find it one of the best animated films ever.
