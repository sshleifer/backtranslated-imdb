The Three Stugges I always liked that many actors. I love every one of the shorts that I just love about. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shang, More, Larry, Joe, and Carlie Joe)! Shorts were all colorful and also many other great actors and actresses star in which they were shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stoges is the greatest actor of all time and the most fun comedy team ever! <br /> <br /> This is a good three stogies short. It's fun and his cast includes Christine McIntyre, Simona Boniface, Gino Corpodo, Fred Kells, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lourch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Terrell, Heine Conclin and Base Flower. Stooges performed this short very well! I recommend this one!
