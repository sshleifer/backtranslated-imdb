This is the story of the people of Siberian village, from the beginning of the 20th century to 60th. It is about emotions and feelings, about the Russian spirit, and very romantic. The action of this movie is not packed, it flows slowly. The second part could find a great song - Russian romance. It's much better than the doctor Zhivago. The director of this film went to America and for example built a runway train.
