This film has more steps before opening credits than these full Hollywood movies. This image is produced by Sui Harke and Jet Li stars. This team has brought you the most successful Hong Kong film producer, among which Win Upon is a Time in China series. The action was fast and furious with amazing wire work. I only saw the cable in two shots. In addition to the action, the story itself was strong and was not used as a filling only. To find another movie to compete in it, you need to find a Hong Kong movie outlet in your area. They really worth checking out and usually do not get frustrated.
