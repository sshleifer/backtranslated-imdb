I can not go so far to recommend this movie, since I have only problems due to an overpopus of plots used in the film - it is a common thing that every child ever feels like a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its time is limited, but it looks like To make the decision these boys 'had the wisdom to say hey, can you have a little more smell?' Every time it's helplessly drooling. The movie does not save, but you can say 'there was at least one direction where I could not laugh. And of course, apparently it will not be disappointing, but with almost a pixar flicks offered. All of them are components, I will put this on the bottom ... but that's not bad at all.
