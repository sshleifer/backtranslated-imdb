Jake Rondel (Tobi Maguire) is trying to establish sympathy for the audience, filmmakers have accused the North and Joyakkar. Missouri Union did not withdraw from the union and the army was not an attacking force. Southerners fought for the rights of the state: the rights of slaves, elections of infamous legislatures and judges, and the involvement of a political plunder. There is nothing noble in that. The Egyptians could easily travel east and join the Confederate army. <br /> <br /> I think there is nothing to do with this film's ambiguity. When Jack released Bushwalkar, he did not see the wrong way, he must not surrender himself to the cause of extinction.
