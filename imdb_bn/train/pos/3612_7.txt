Michelle Rodriguez is a well-built high school senior who has discovered that she has a strong fist and starts amateur training with Brooklyn Jim. Santiago Douglas is a handsome young man, older than him who trains there. They meet after classes, so to speak, and feel attracted to each other. There is no sex. Santiago was instructed to save it for his next message. <br /> <br /> Both of them participate in "gender-blind" athletic program which does not make any difference between men and women, attempts to confuse levels of athletic playground <br /> <br /> A conservative radio commentator recently announced - And I swear I'm not making it - "Let's face it, the President is black." I have come here to observe observation equally - "men and women are different." Now 99 out of 100 cases do not have any difference in physical performance. But the top one percent - trained athletes whose skills have been honored on the fine edge - men usually have the advantage. With their narrow hips they can run fast. And they have larger muscle mass and upper wash strength. These differences in the body make it possible for women to be born and for children and children to catch and kill food for them. This sexual split is the result of the natural process of natural selection. Without it, there can be no man. And that, boys and girls, why they have men events and women events in the Olympics. I speak to you as your anthropologist. That's ten cents, PayPal is customary. <br /> <br /> So I misled this gender-blind program. As a gifted boxer, as Rodriguez, he reached the final stage of the game, and eventually he lost a man. <br /> <br /> There is a complexity in this movie. Rodrigues finally matches against Douglas, his son's friend. Randhouse does not want to be angry with others by not mentioning rights, but both of them take pride and pride, both personal and gender related. Douglas Ring refused to fight a woman. And Rodriguez is offended by what he sees as his sponsor attitude. It ends happily. <br /> <br /> I'm not really expecting much from the film. I'll stop Clint Eastwood's "million dollar baby" a ripe until I discovered that it was released a few years ago. And I have never heard of a director or an actor. Such obscenity usually sings for the ill-televised television and declares it. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the surprise and surprised. The total absence of the bathroom kept me in the open headbas. The minimum use of boxing clips - Freud rope, blood, swollen eyes, harmful post-mouth face, face and sweat, "Kill him!" Nose, sweat spray from head head, long-awaited apotheosis signal to the heroic music winner. Nobody here - well, almost anyone. The whole plot formula can be considered. Finds strong baby rings, etc. outlets. <br /> <br /> The feeling you left behind is probably more like this amateur competition, perhaps more likely. We are different from those who watch TV and general movies. No bell rings, for example, instead of a dance and watching the referee yells "stop!" And "box!" The competitors wear head gear. Jim is not populated by crowds of public audiences, but only a few people who show some special interest. This is a clear film, but rather in spite of poor setting and unhappy family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez can see a beautiful look, her musky bulb and her eyes are shaking her down, but you can use it once the idea that this girl can kill you with a torch at any time, and once When you hear the image of her superhero woman, she does not get bad. (The scene that he fought with his father on the floor was too much.) Douglas' tone was difficult to understand when Rodriguez crawled all over her bed. Director, Karin Kusma, carefully selected his talent. <br /> <br /> shows what you can do with some talent, imagination and trades. It will be more like a movie. Accept one of the many billion dollar blockbusters within the dinosaurs or aerospace ship and spread the near-near goodness.
