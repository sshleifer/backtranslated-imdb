I started riding roughly on the horse, and anyone who ever woke up should know, I love horses and their world. I rented the soul, trying to fill as much of the horses as possible in my life, and I was surprised to see the results. <br /> <br /> What I hoped was the Disneyink movie <br /> <br /> What I got was a beautiful scene and an amazing movie full of animation, and an amazing story that has the power to warm the heart. <br /> <br /> The soul is a wild mosquito in the Old West, whose whole world revolves around it when he gradually acquires his homeland and inventes humans. The story is a wide-ranging character, some people, some animals, all good writing and beautiful for watching on the screen. This photo is beautiful to watch on screen. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good stories, and who have stories for history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but I think it is important, the creatures of this photo do not speak. It was really a nice holiday from Lady and Tram animated movies that everyone is used today.
