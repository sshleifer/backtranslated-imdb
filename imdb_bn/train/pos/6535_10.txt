It was a great movie! Although there were about 15 people with me it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mom even enjoyed it There were two middle-aged women there and they were enjoying there in the middle of the 20 years. I love both Kourki and Nedi, like Nancy and loves stuffing where her cute lol is stuffing. And when she gets in her street and there's Ned. Yes it was a great movie, even people thought it would reduce it. Go see this I'll enjoy it! I really enjoyed it and so did my friend. <br /> <br /> The people in this movie were so hard and they did not even look at it. The next time they will give movies and actors the opportunity. They did a great job in my opinion. But if you are young kids it is still suitable. I would probably take my 7-year-old nephew to see it.
