An exchange student of Japan, Karen (Sarah Michelle Gallery), who was sent to help an old semi-kennel, Emma (Grace Jabrisky), after the former caretaker, Yoko (Yoko Machi). Can not be seen He soon learned that nothing is right in Emma's house, and he tries to see the depth of "the holes of the rabbit deep." <br /> <br /> maybe M. It has been delayed due to the success of the films of Night Shyamonan. Slow-graduate, a recent trend of understated horror films. In some cases such as Hide and Seek (2005), this method works exceptionally well and among others like White Knows (2005), the pissing film is going to kill. I do not like mercy as I hide and seek, but it is still a very good movie - it earns 9 out of 10 out of me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From that of other recent examples of that tendency, however. First, it is well-known that it was a series of Japanese films that began with JU-ON (2000) (this is especially close to the first half of the Zu-on: The Grud, Uk Ju-On 3, 2003). Two, two like Japan's horror films, the slower place here is not so realistic as the real drama reality. In addition to a large percentage of European horror, The Grade should be shown more like a pictorial nightmare. <br /> <br /> Director Mr. Taqi Shimizu, five Japanese entry director of JU-ON. Series to date (fifthly presently produced), and author Stefan Susco is basically distributed with linearity and is not overly anxious with the logic or plot holes behind the story. Instead, the idea is to present a visual vision of dreams with a sign of dreams, where the focus is for the atmosphere, void, weird, and for many visitors - fear Depending on how well the film will work for you, depending on how well you can adapt yourself to this different method of filmmaking and (though, some visible spaces are filled with previous entries of Ju). Traditionally, American listeners consider hanging "rules" for the "monster" and leaving the "rules" as flaws. More poetic, metaphorical, spiritual views of the film have not yet been accepted by the mainstream in the United States <br /> <br /> However, if you do not use it, then try to postpone your usual predictions and give a shot to the grade. This is a well-written, well-known and well-liked film filled with extraordinary features, such as the story "main character" (which is more well-done than Junk-June-3), better painting, fine-grained design design Check out Gammer's clothes, which match with the outer color and texture of the Emma room, when Glacier first arrives), and the nicely effective horoscope Dan. <br /> <br /> However, it is more slowly that your average horror film of the past, usually increases the intensity of pacing and there is no shortage of intrigue to entertain the horror fans. The film is absorbing the mysterious firmness and based on interviews with Shimizu on DVD, inspired me to focus more on Japanese beliefs and losses. Though perhaps the most interesting data will be raised with more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture, it is interesting to consider why so many Japanese horror movies look like horrific children and adults of scary children. <br /> <br /> I've subtracted one point for the film's clayed mystery / floating in the thriller territory a bit like "what happened here" with flashback, but it also got done well and otherwise it turned out to be 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> <br /> Now I have spoken all of the above, let me finish with a mini-rant: It is not that I am not an anti-remake, but it is the United States distributors and studios that make us feel foreign Suitable for the cost of rebuilding movies. The original versions of these movies are only being released in the United States theater only. There is no need to present almost identical films, but to replace white American actors for non-white or foreign actors. Yes, The Grace is a fine film, but eventually, I want to see something original using this genius, and should be treated with the latest foreign horror movies - not just Japanese, Indian, Spanish, Chinese etc. At my multiplex Someone can read this by studying in the studio, it is more expensive to do this, because (1) you can avoid full production costs and can only get domestic distribution contracts from which you get profits, and (2) you get money from fans like yourself Those who can make foreigners who are foreigners or even prefer foreign movies to DVDs in Bulgarian versions.
