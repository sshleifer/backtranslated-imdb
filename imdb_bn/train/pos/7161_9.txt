Love movie Love two families beyond the way in history. The only question is if Sam dies, how will his family line go? Should he mention the son of Madame Jeroeni and the Zero but any other child? Hmmmmmmmmm Before talking to her and never before talking to a teacher, did not mention any other child or wife? Before kayash sat kissing, had her child? Even with the movie mistakes Just like it. The acting was great. The story of Mr. Marian was in the end, with no story sure, but his character makes it more fun. Other "counselors" seem worried for the kids, but of course it's probably not so. When the poor warden grew up, he did not mean too much a child.
