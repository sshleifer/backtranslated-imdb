This image is a false description of a demonization and history of Catholics alone. This is not what the image is. <br /> <br /> This image is a comment on the abuse of the Church (although it can be replaced for a strong body), these abusive ways affect people and families and many people simply take part in the abuse without thinking for themselves and often choose to participate . The fact that what is wrong in the Catholic church is based on the nature of the true story based on the film. This label as a campaign against Catholics seems to miss missions about what the Catholic Church did at times; Its history is often not great and this highlight is something that movies like that and that need to be highlighted. Yes, we should comment on abuse by other organizations, but it is not for the reinstatement of this film. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary movie that shows me tears and looks good - 'If we do not study the past, we are bound to repeat it'
