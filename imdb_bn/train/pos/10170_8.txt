In contrast to the other review opinions, this film was actually surprisingly good! I went to see it unintentionally and would be annoyed by the clich√©, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which committed the trailer, expected. <br /> <br /> However, after 5 minutes I played really enjoying to smile and refresh myself. With only one 'toilet humor' Gog, actually brings real fun situations on his body, and without losing anything, the animals are happy for some moments. <br /> <br /> The main ingredients are all a good film; Compared to other recent efforts by script, director and actor and romantic comedy, this picture stands tall. <br /> <br /> Of course, you're not going to learn anything or wake up spiritually, but if you open the mind will probably be more than you have a good time!
