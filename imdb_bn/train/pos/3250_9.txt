Another for the crowd of bullets and bullets. I have seen the story that it is much stronger than any other song: Canons hide the missing legs of women and naturally put each other naturally, which comes close to intelligent comments, we can wait for the locals. More useful than contemporary 'drama' It is a hard detect with a woman, which puts a cannon up her pants - in leggage lue. If you consider the topic, it's pretty awesome. <br /> <br /> Although the cannon has highlighted 90% of the wonderful crazy things, how is it that a female who keeps a secret cannon / rocket-launcher on her feet (hence any group shower scene) in the lives of a group of yakus who follow this movie? Or lip), a hidden project-launcher that comes out behind the theater, probably not from somewhere, the dead of Maily or life T (1999), at the end of the original Tommy (2000), the torch out of thin air by the heroine or Sunny Gates Blue (1992), the scene of the Heroeing Shikha-Thrower, which testifies to the third world Kantinflas-Esquien, contemporary Japanese The effect of the film, which I am in loss to explain, but can not complain. <br /> <br /> You can not see the good quality film of this essay made in Hollywood, all of them are extinct and cheap cheaper, they are pumps for a cheap thrill, all ridiculous. This is a real movie, and it's perfectly cool, but the finishing is a brighter, if there is no laziness in the pictures of a particular Sergio Leone, where the footed bird is involved and it is definitely worth it!
