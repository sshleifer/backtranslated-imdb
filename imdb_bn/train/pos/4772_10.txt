This movie is probably one of the most sensitive and up-to-date I've seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes a great part of the industry like this movie can give me almost religious experience. One suddenly realized that the meaning of life really is. <br /> <br /> I must first acknowledge that when I heard about this movie I was skeptical. I thought the plot was fabulous and I was afraid that the story would be outstanding. But as a fan of David Lynch I let him go. I took about 30 minutes to fully capture the film, but then I was completely lost. There is so much knowledge and warmth in this movie! I gave up the feeling of cinema that I really learned valuable things about life. It is not a standard David Lynch movie, and in some ways it was surprising that after making such a film it should be done for many years the nature of the dark side of human nature. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he led to express deep emotions and deep insight because I also felt that he was very well-conducted in the elephant man. Lin Ch is one of the most gifted directors and I think Straight Story is still his best. 9.5 / 10
