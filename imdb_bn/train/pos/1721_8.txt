When this movie was made a few years later, I could give it a low score. However, for 1909 it's a painful little movie and still standing quite well. Do not try to compare this silent film with the next silence - the industry has changed so much that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century could not look like movies made in 1910 and beyond. <br /> <br /> This movie is 11 minutes long (then the average of the average for most movies) and it is the story of Edgar Allan Poe, Ammantilado's Case. Although many are familiar with the story, I will not be more amazed because I do not want to destroy this movie. Just saying that it is very unclear !!
