After I left it in 1994, I saw this movie and recently seen it and it is still funny. I do not know whether to understand hip-hop in the 90's, but if you do help it. When the NWA and public enemies were at the top of the 90's, internal conflicts between groups and members were when their separate ways (Ice Cube, Easy E etc.) Bonus, accessable ropes were also visible (Fidelity Williams etc. from Vanilla Ice, C and C Music Factory). This movie makes it fun that it is actually a real documentary. Cousin Lemons has played an interview which is a fantasy rap group named N.W.H. Team members of the Ice Code (Rusty Cond√© / Director), Delicious Taste (Larry B Scott / Nader Revenge, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence) are an up and coming rap group whose politics make them controversial. In the 80's, the hippah industry's script is so strong and they make fun of it, but if you know the 80's / 90's rap, then you can do this thing. Knowing the truth, still, without the knowledge of hip hop, it's still a fun movie, and for those who ask, yes the first thing came in the spring tap, but the spinal tap is not the first spy movie, it sounds better than the spinal tap. And better than a SPIPAL TAP, like a black planet has a spinal tap, the rap is a black planet's fear, and the songs are hooks. The DVD is also a full-fledged team to include music videos with additional videos, and NWH as a solo artist. Bright performance by Rusty Condieff and Larry B. Scott.
