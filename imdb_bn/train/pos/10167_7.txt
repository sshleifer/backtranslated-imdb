I did not have the pants to watch this movie, but when my GF called me and had a free advanced screening pass, I just tagged Tagged to watch Eva Laundry and laugh at Jason Biggues Antique. <br /> <br /> Overall it was really good, but I expected but not much. It was like a hybrid in 10 days to defeat a man and just like heaven. I guess an ideal romantic comedy with his moments. Although the movie was quite small (about 85 minutes) but to say the whole story, to develop some character and to end a happy happy ending was enough. The whole idea of ​​ghost was an interesting plot to follow his hunting with his former husband. Eva is quite annoying and Paul Rud, and another supporter cast (especially Jason Biggles) did a good job to laugh at a smooth pace. <br /> <br /> Overall, I just love the movie because I had a good amount of laugh to keep going otherwise, I would have given this movie a low rating. Hey, it's a chick flicker and I'm reviewing this movie firmly with a man, if the woman reviews this film and thinks about it, it would be a fair fight.
