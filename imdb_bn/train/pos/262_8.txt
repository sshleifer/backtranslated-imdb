*** SPEAKER *** *** SPOKHILLER *** <br /> <br /> This movie "Divers" is really interesting. I almost knew about it that it was Nazi history, water scenes and everyone would say Danish. But I decided to test it for one reason, this phenomenon was a development within the WWII German submarine. I got an idol for German membership, especially the ruins which can be dipped. So I was somewhat skeptical about the Danish party, but argued that the sub-section could increase weight. Nordic movies are not always good and I was not sure about the size of the budget, at least, it was known to be very suspicious. <br /> <br /> I was surprised ... I was surprised <br /> <br> I had some thoughts about the inadequacies of actors, especially a couple of young actors like how the two main actors are doing. It was not a problem, they both perform very well. Other actors, who are mostly among their 50's and above. It creates some interesting interaction between young and old, which is not often seen on screen. Whatever is unique, but somewhat rare. And it's all good. <br /> <br /> As the Danish language, it is almost impossible to understand. But it was not a problem, it was a subtitle. <br /> <br /> Another thing was that in submarine itself, I suspected internal shots and submarine shots. Decided that their budget was slim, I could have turned it well enough on the worst and downright terrible right at the worst. Again I was surprised, the exterior scenes of the ruins are beautiful and the indoor scenes are very realistic. Having an idol for German subscriptions, I knew what was inside, especially inside, and should be enjoyed. The team did some serious research. It's all good <br /> <br /> I suspect that more people than me can see just some sub-scenes view of this movie, so I think I have to issue a "caution". The movie is not a real model existing during the submarine war. It's a special purpose sub But to give an indication of what to expect, it is crossing between a type VII, Type IX and I-52 similar Japanese transport. It is a good design of God and a beautiful ruins. <br /> <br /> This setting is located on the Danish island or peninsula, I can not remember. The garden and two brothers travel to their grandfathers to celebrate the arrival of the summer. Their grandfather type is a mariner. Cinematography is quite beautiful, many summer scenes in island docks, some new teenage love, beautiful diving weather and general feeling of "perfect". Again, it's all good. <br /> <br /> The plot-to-island island has received a few viewers of a suspect generation, a boat with men, an old mineweaver and its crew. One of the viewers, he is 50 years old, behind him the German eagle and the soccer tattoo. Senior citizens of the island all remember when the German U-boat sank at the end of World War II and there was a rumor of Nazi gold in the depth. Shortly after the floating float in German body in 1945, Grandpa was one of the young men who searched the U-boat very soon. No submarine found. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The key ingredient is Nazi test, Nazi history, wealth, secrecy, competition, teen love, conspiracy, and ... a surprise. <br /> <br /> *** Alert - Speaker ***. <br /> <br /> I was not expecting some supernatural material presented in this film and it kept me from the watch. Not a big fan of the occult phenomena, nevertheless, the story looks good and there is no problem. It's not like "Doom Do Don", where everyone eventually becomes vampire. It's a bit more subtle <br /> <br /> Overall: Really good movie, I've given it an 8. For some reason this Hollywood movie is not endless. I later learned that it was a fair budget and some actors were rancid Danish veterans. But if it is a Hollywood production, I would give it a 7 or 8. Your time is certainly worth it. Yes, a child's story is a way, but then again a mature story. It is a great mystery of many mysteries and adventure, which I found very interesting. And, again, cinematography is really nice. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
