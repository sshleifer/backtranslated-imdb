This list is listed for IMDB 1972 for some reasons, but the other sources I saw with excellent program notes are marked as '68. In 2001, this abstract collage of film and video in 2001 (apparently one of the first artwork to combine the two) in the context of Star Gate Sequence is not very important to see it. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small quantities and super-synthetic optical printed colors and cyclic sensations of flowers in this series, rohorschach bloat, birds etc are quite attractive and quite beautiful. Certainly many other innovative video artists have definitely helped in the 70's, and they are very well-known.
