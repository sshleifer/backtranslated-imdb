When John Singlton launches, he * * *! And this is one of his best movies. Boyz-n-The-Hood is not quite tough as it is, but it's nearby (and mostly with the same stella cast). These pictures were very well written, put together very well, and very good shots. There is very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are simple (for example, what was the meaning of 6 years of college college and many expensive stuff? There is no mention of rich backgrounds ... and why the professor did not have an office? Will be ... and when we are with it, then for a engineering student, hik or not, Rami is a pretty fool character - I think he is a fundamental figure. Much more on the way of intelligence - he talks and works like a buffoon. <br /> <br /> But beside that, the film was very sharp, a good array of characters and point of view; and Singlton did not accept the story - most of the letters Disrespectful, and he did a good job of combining both the panthers and the snake charmers together for the folly of both sides. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fantastic Who I was; I especially like the scene where Kirsty Swanson has become close to Tyrine and Owen, and also the owner / deja scene also shoots well. <br/> <br/> Conversations were occasionally a little more; There was a tendency to get promotional time and it started reducing the points that were made on your head, when the points were with such helplessness A would be clear as well (we did not really need the US flag), typing with 'UNLEARN', giving some credit, we are not fake ...). And to stop it, though * most of the time * singlton uses melodrama very well, sometimes it gets * very * cheeky (like the death of a goddess, which is great, until she shouts 'why !!!', which is only completely The effects and the scene) <br /> <br /> But acting, in general, was the top of the line. Omar Apees (perhaps acting as a pretty one who saw what I saw), Kirsty Swanison (who knew Boffi ??), Michael Rapaport (after real romance and beautiful girls I was disappointed) though he was a role actor), and of course the Ice Cube and Lawrence Fishes * always * outstanding. <br /> <br /> down? Jennifer Connelly was flat; Although it is not entirely his fault: his role was stereotyptical and one-dimensional. Max Degree Generic And the Teera Bank, who had the role, was nothing terrible. He whined and whined and whined. However, one of the long-line model-actresses who unfortunately failed (though some of these rules proved to be proven exceptions). <br /> <br /> Finally, soundtrack! How nice! An amazing soundtrack (which is worth the purchase!) That fits a film like a glove. Each scene has a twin song (though Tori amos song * Really * finally bothers me ... its not the best work). Liege Fire, Rug Angest The Machine, Ice Cube ... How Can I Get Wrong? <br /> <br /> Everyone: Really a good watch, really strong cast, great script, great movie. 8/10.
