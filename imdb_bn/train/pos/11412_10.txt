Two young girls played Missy Barton as Frankie and Ingrid Uribe Hejel, who skillfully and cleverly played, although this plot is rather stretched of imagination. Running young girl for the girl came out of the place, be honest. <br /> <br /> Although the acting is done well, the film lacks the true atmosphere of the drama. Perhaps we expect the lively reality of the film, rather than how the Green Will is compared to my Valley than the Pallana! Remember, each of them is good in their own way. <br /> <br /> If I play the Joan Plathite, its role is somewhat diminished. The road entertainment is ideal for small audiences, and it's so beautiful to express with bitterly subtle classical music! <br /> <br /> I welcome this movie because it reflects peace. Thinking value for growing up year, and no violence kindly thanks. Enjoy a warm family film.
