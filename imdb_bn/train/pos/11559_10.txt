Kinky couple is a comic jewel. A fun script committed for celluloid - just over Stranglevoov, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! LeMon and Matthu best friends: unwanted compulsory FÃ©lix and Palli, irresponsible Oscars. It is impossible to live with him because of his ineffective attitude, because the Oscar's wife has already left him. Felix's wife left her at the beginning of the film, and after suicidal, she joined the pick-up friend Oscar. Thats when fun starts. <br /> <br /> The whole script is filled with bright and bright one liners. You are probably already "F.U." Familiar with the joke, but it still works brilliantly due to the ridiculous period of Matthu. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments when Lemon tries to remove the sincerity of his diner and the pigeon sisters are very gentle and treated with lamans, then their material is out completely. This one needs to see the repetition!
