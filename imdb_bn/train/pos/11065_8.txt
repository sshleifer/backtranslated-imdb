This comedy with many intrinsic pain and grief is successful where most other fail. There are so many movies in this genre that more prominent actors are trying to achieve this extraordinary mix that has not come anywhere close to the depth and theft. This is definitely guaranteed because exceptional cast with the amazing performance of Reggers Rogers and Ally Shade seems so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly keeps your interest and emotions and keeps them throughout the film. First, the action seems to be rather wall-like, but slowly but it gradually declares that these two rather sadly harmful people are frustrated and unwittingly trying to heal themselves, even if they are frustrated by each other. Rogers's heartfelt face touches the face and Shadow's angry explosion is so eloquent that anyone who feels that one of them sees him. You will enjoy these two choices but deeply and hope that they will succeed because it is suspicious and hanging on a tiny mental thread. Hopefully viewers can see more of Reg Rogers and Alley Shady because this film proves their ability as a very successful actor beyond doubt.
