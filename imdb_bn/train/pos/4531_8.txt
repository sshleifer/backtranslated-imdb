A cleaver film featuring love through this age. Keton is in this picture, to find a lady love in stone age, in ancient Rome and at present (in the 1920's). In three cases, he is the usual wimpy buster and he wars against Wallace Beery for his lady love. In three periods, I think Roman I liked well although I acknowledge that it can be very impressive. I actually liked the scenes with the lion, which was clearly a costume and a weird chariot race - but the one I enjoyed the most, saw Keiton's wonderful acrobatics. However, there were three fun and fun films of three periods, although not the best of them, yet an exceptional and enjoyable movie. Look at it!
