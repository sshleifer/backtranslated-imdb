This movie is light, funny, and beautifully illustrated. The power is pretty fantastic, and the color reminds strongly Verma painting. <br /> <br /> This is more than the American and French quality and it is reasonably well compared to English, its only charming comedy. <br /> <br /> Every character is touching, and the explanation is close to fulfillment. Isabelle Blace is excellent, Sylvie Morro is better than the Catherine series, Stefan Gagnon is impressive, Emmanuel Bilgau is also awesome in that strange role, and Genevieve Laroche is the best friend! <br /> <br /> Visit this movie a few hours before finding any negative comments, so give it a chance and add your own review.
