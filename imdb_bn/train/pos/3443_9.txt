A compulsory, honest, brave and unforgettable mental horror film covering the painful painful experience due to rape - "Descent" is a film that went under the raider due to lack of distribution, because the film is so cruel in its description that it was released on the theater. , It may perhaps fill yourself with some strong favorable hatred. <br /> <br /> The movie is not only for its dark themes, but also for its amazing aspects and authentic styles that can be invented for it - but most of all for its performance. Chad Fawest is absolutely stunning, has enough illness and significant weakness, which is not related to it, but this fractured person is not only a hateful view of his sexuality but also rape with women, but he understands deeply in himself. . It is a supplementary performance which is very complex, bold, and emotional in Faust's part. And it's hard to forget. <br /> <br /> However, Standout Out Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is a complete release. The real-world dramatic ticks can be a tour-de-force, and some fine, even mostly, higher-ups-like-performance performances. Dosne is seen in some of the best supporting performances in some extraordinary films, though he believes that he is here to give them some emotionally swimming and running performance. The best films of his year (and 2007 was a strong one) - this intuitive and intelligent film hit the release of the theater, I would appreciate it, as well as Dawson and Fawest. Too bad it was very cheaty for a wide application. This type of movie deserves well!
