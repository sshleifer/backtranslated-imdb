The first 10 out of 10 which I gave a movie. This movie has done so well for me? Constant action - no slow parts, great acting, smart writing. I like the filming style where connivance and different angles are only considered part of the scene. Finally, I can see an action movie that does not try to please all the public sectors (ie compulsory romance). <br /> <br /> I like the first two Bourne movies, but I like it. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, you'll be adrenaline full and want to calm down before driving your car !
