I was pleased with Cast of the respected players. The story stands for such a reason, even if you are at a personal risk to do this. In a time when violence and pain are often in front of the movie, this film keeps the old fashionable good cop. Although the same plot has been repeatedly, these guys pull it off well. Jump back and enjoy. Dennehy is a master in taking a movie.
