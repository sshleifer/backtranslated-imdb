This picture is threatened by IMDB in the face. Like many movies this is not shawkank. But it's a reasonable good, if predictable, dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to see a six-and-a-half-hour high hour for a female step dancer, I think you like it. <br /> <br /> Judging from the IMDb rating, I guess this movie was heading towards the top 250 and many movies had "vote bomb attacks", such as in many films, not special effects, or non-popular There are white or inefficient characters. <<br /> <br /> This is an American film, but it is not a US movie. Most set up in Toronto are fine, and some viewers feel that this is entirely set in the United States because the final competition is located in the city of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I like the music. I liked dance (but there is no guarantee of $ 50,000 ... but I know what). The letters were easy to eye. <br /> <br /> I agree with the title sucks. Anyone in the movie does not remember this word, and he should have a "shot". (No, it's not a foreign language). There is not much to hate about this image (and to be honest, 1 vote means you hate it) so I can only assume that it is a human kind of hatred, and it is sad.
