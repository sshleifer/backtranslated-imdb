I enjoyed this image very much. Toby Maguar gave a wonderful acting like Jake. He will be the best actor to watch. And I was surprised to have a lot of ridiculous lines throughout the film. Although he was very good at this time I have not seen providing a comic line before him. The film gets you involved with the character and really makes you wonder what all became of them. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance but I think he did well. Lots of exciting views A thoroughly well ride. I'm totally a fan of Maguire See Cedar House Rules. One of the greatest of all times.
