A strange picture of Matador. The main character Julian, played with an unusual combination of character and inequality by Brojan, is not your usual hero. Julian is a hit people who are facing a traumatic middle life crisis. Having spent 22 years in the cold blooded murder profession, he now feels himself alone and lonely. And so, at a time meeting with Danny (Greg Kieyner), he stopped and started a stutter, strange friendship. Danny, an impressive man, is working on some of his own life, and to be honest, one can also use a friend. Both create an unexpected connection, and almost jumped to hear the story of Danny Julian, even after the "unreasonable" truth about Julian's work <br /> <br /> <br /> Matadar brings such a thing Unless the film is completely ignored, heroes ('Assassins' and 'Grossas Point Black') come to mind. But Matador distinguishes several original ways. Above all, killing and gorage can be understood, but in reality it is not shown in any detail, that is, if you are the director of an action film, it looks for an adrenaline ray, but this film will probably disappoint you. And secondly, in contrast to most anti-hero movies, Motherardo does not make any effort to show remorse and ransom from his main character. Julian's work is simply presented as a 'what it's like'. It is unusual, that 99.99% will consider killing for our horror money. And yet, this obsolete approach probably makes the film feel pure. Although we do not like to acknowledge it, we would have been enough for many days, even after the killing, almost everything could become dumb. Julian's victims deserve to die? Who is killing people? Who knows The movie is not police with this question. Focus Julian and his stumbling shuffle is a real friendship. If you read someone like Julian at the papers, you thought that people like him should come out of a society like cancer, but his intense humanity was forced to see his life. Sympathy for the devil, I guess. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " He does not completely hide himself from James Bond, adding beautiful looks and smooth charm, rather rather adding boring stories to the mix. Sadly disappointing appeal for unusual change in moderate religious conversations and sudden change and recognition for child tyranny. It keeps you guessing about its perception of its nearness and those around it that will affect it. It's like listening to a piano player that he and sometimes unfortunately hits a wrong note, but it works. Films are not only about other major roles, like Danny, but almost fleshly. Kinnear turns a solid, if weird performance as a regular Joe with regular Joe's life and problems. <br /> <br /> The film does not really have any big shock or M-Night Shyamalan twists, but I guess the last was not able and it felt satisfactory. It has no deep philosophical or spiritual insight and yet it felt very human. And it does not challenge any heart or rush into a gun battle and I still think that the pacing was done well and I was never bothered. Perhaps the only real message here is to reach out to people and connect with each other and how these needs have no moral prerequisites. Even a murderer needs friends, even the good people can be friends with the bad guys. It's weird, random world we have a live comment A good film; Worth watching.
