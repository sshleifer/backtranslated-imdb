This comic book style movie is fun, well-illustrated, and it has a great future style. Writer Steven D. Shuja, who wrote the commando, after signing an agreement to Anne, has given a lot of lines to exclude "Send me a copy": to hijack the pen again to the lawyers; "Neck pain," after strangled subzero with tied wire; "He was divided," after breaking his body in his legs; And finally, since Kylian slammed through a billboard carrying her own face, Arne concluded, "Now the spot hit." Fairly enough, remembering some similarity, Schwarzenegger played another sci-fi flick.
