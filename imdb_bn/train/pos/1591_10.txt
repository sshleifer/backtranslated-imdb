My mom and I have recently been addicted to this show, our Butts smile off! I have seen about 10 episodes, and I'm disappointed that they did not pay attention to this delightful series before losing! The story lines are very funny, the characters have really great personality (or not so great, but they are still funny!). I'm about to take you to TiVO episode of the game. Amanda Binis and Jenny Garth, as well as all the cast, do not bother me while watching! There is some inappropriate language for children and some sexual content, but if you have a near parental help, you do not have too much problems. There are some friendships that attract me to this show. I really enjoyed it.
