My dog ​​had recently died, and it was a movie that I liked as a kid, so I had to try to make me happy. <br /> <br /> (Be careful from dogs, I'm Spiller.) This movie is just for kids and it is far from ordinary. It was established in New Orleans in 1939. First and foremost, the dog has not been portrayed as an additional family member of this film, but to work with his own complex life as an adult <br /> <br /> At the start, Charlie is her dishonest and cruel The business partner is not much different from the carriage. He ran away from money-driven, greedy, and death row, as he said at the beginning of the feature. The difference between Charlie and Corfaces is that Charlie can learn and willing to listen to others; Anne Mary and her sidekick, Ikea. Curfew fat, can not hear the ugly dog, who can be closest to big glasses. <br /> <br /> Trying to kill Corfaces Hero, because he wants 100% profit for his business and a very unusual way to die a German Shepherd Mix - will not be settled for only 50%. Also, being consumed by a prehistoric size brain that ends your life because you can sing, but it is unlikely that you might be a dog. This is a cartoon, and because of it it's logical. <br /> <br /> Revenge of Corfaces is through killing, and Charlie believes that success is the best revenge, financial success. After his death, he started a business by taking the source of the financial resources of the curfaces, a very talented girl who has the ability to communicate with animals. They won the whole race of races, and Charlie told him that he would pay the poor - hint indication: Charlie and Ichchi live in a junkyard, and that's why they are poor. He used money on his casino / bar / theater and the other is not "poor". Annie Mary has the ability to talk to animals because she condoles her and she is listening carefully. Charlie teaches ethics as pointing to his gambling, lying, and theft. Charlie tries to do this for buying her dresses. Charlie added the necessary morality of her business while managing, and arranged for the construction of Ivy. <br /> <br /> Carroll uses violence and property damage to break Charlie's business, which is vulnerable by the government. Charlie loses everything and what she left is this little girl. In the end, he had to choose between his life and himself. She first grabs the clock out of self-preservation, and when the girl starts to sink it sets down. Both the girl and the watch were drowned, and she had to choose which one, and she chose the girl. <br /> <br /> A large part of this movie, which focuses on the person's ability to learn from the wrong time. , And the ability of a child to cope with the natural occurrence of their pets death, it does not show anyone's death! The clock symbolizes its life, and the clock is submerged and shown off. All deaths were consulted, even for villains. I'm not crying during this movie yet, and I've got so much more than that, I had to write it and share it with you.
