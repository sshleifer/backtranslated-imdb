Chang Che's "Shaolin Template" may be the high water mark of the Shaw Brothers' martial arts film cycle. This enthusiastic Kung Fu epic possesses an amazing thrill - a veritable who is shoe stable Although the plot is fairly quality and the dancing industry of war is as spectacular as it is normal, it manages the subject matter which makes this movie extravagant and enjoyable. The sense of respect to the history and tradition of the Shawlin temple is obvious in each frame. In the "Long Gray Line" West Point, West Point is not against the same self-titled film or John Ford's salam William Kiegelier's piano. Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" is a lovingly decorated ode in the same style. <br /> <br /> I want to seduce cultural relations, compare the Shalolin temple with Almo. Seeing this movie you will be given the same complimentary and nostalgic feelings when you are experienced in the history of grade school many years ago about the courage and sacrifice of those devastating heroes of Alamo. At the end of the film, you may be tempted to call, remember the Shawlin Temple!
