"Grove Tube" is just one of the two Shapiro films, the other is equally "junior problem". This one TV is just a full scale. In addition to Shapiro - who did not do anything apparently after "modern problems" - the film also stars Chieve Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Belzer. Three cast members (plus some other people in small roles) appear in various skits. One of the most interesting is the guerrillas-spoofing commercial chase, in which he describes his medicine by straining his wife, and it ends with her hippings. There is a pornographic news program, an annoying cooking show and some drug dealer's epic stories. <br /> <br /> However, the whole thing is just a real hoot. In my opinion, this is the best TV-spoofing film, plus "TunnelVision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (though I can include "truman show"). Really funny <br /> <br /> I became the Cape Shapiro.
