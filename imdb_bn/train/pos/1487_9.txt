"Kosomai" is a great story that illustrates the story of a young couple through the wedding naughty water. The story is very trustworthy by telling others the strange scenes in isolation and continuous interference by others, which is fairly common in Italy (though these events may be different from somewhere else). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, and that's one of the strong points in the movie. Acting by Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volvo is quiet and gripping. And sympathetic pastor's picture is funny and well rounded. Above all, a truly worthy movie, probably one of the best Italian movies of the year.
