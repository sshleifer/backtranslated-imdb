All right, firstly I got this movie as Christmas gift so it was free! FIRST - This movie was meant to be stereoscopic 3D. This is mostly the case, but whenever the main character is in his car, the movie goes flat on 2D! What !!?!?! It's not that hard to film in a car !!! Second - the story is not very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie was sucked up !!! Watch it for a good smile, but do not waste time buying it. Just download it or something for cheap.
