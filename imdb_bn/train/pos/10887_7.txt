A horror movie is being shot and things are not going well. It's about a masked killer. The director said the cast and the crew front killer. He became mad and killed two. He does not kill himself and ends the film. Twelve years later the film decided to try and finish it in a bunch of students - but there is a curse. Those who try and finish themselves kill themselves. Ignore that student <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, it is made well with a young and fairly talented young cast. Nobody is great but no one is terrible. It avoids compulsory (and unreliable) female nude scenes. It's quick to move, elegantly beautiful and bloody and the script is not insulting your intelligence. Also during the time of his life Molly Ringwell played a wicked fade actress. <br /> <br /> No great shakes but bad. I give it a 7.
