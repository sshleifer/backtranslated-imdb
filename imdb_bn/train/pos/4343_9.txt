Peter Fawk and Paul Rezar have joined forces as an excellent loving film father and father. <br /> <br /> A father's wedding ceremony showed that after more than 40 years of marriage, the mother (Olympia Dukakis) gave up her. <Br> <br /> The rest of the picture portrays the father and son in the one-day trip to get parental thinking about what happened. Far away with them, the daughter could play the detective. <br /> <br /> The story shows the courage of the parents in discussing their lives, what should have been done, why did the mother discuss their complaint about their parents? Life. <br /> <br /> We saw an unexpected fishing trip and a pond game that walks around. Both men seem to break out of their daily life. <br /> <br /> The last moment we know why the mother suddenly went away. It is a human spirit story in the face of courage and human hostility. It's not too late to change.
