I saw this glimpse yesterday and I have been told that I'm sorry to be the worst movie I made for $ 36,000 (sorry steaklar) if you're a zombie fan then definitely the movie is worth finding. This movie reeks the soul and the atmosphere. Zombbs are some of the best committed to film shot. The very dreadful looking dusty webbed gradually shamble the victims of their screaming victims. Brrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hot Saggy Canadian women will keep you preoccupied before rears the head of the shaft of her exposed bodies with the sexy pronunciation of HORROR. This photo is from the beginning to the end of the entertainment. I could not ask for more than that. My only complaint was small.
