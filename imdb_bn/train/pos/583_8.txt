Two brothers grow up in a small town in Montana. One of them is Norman (Craig Schaffer), Paul Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father, Rev. MacLean, and they grew up with his lessons related to religion and learning to fly. In this picture, fly fishing represents a little bit of life. <br /> <br /> The story is good and keeps your attention, although for some moments you need a little step. Probably this moment has happened at the moment because it is not a case of incident, but about the message. Some things happen though. Go to dormmouth reading in Norman. Six years later he returned and was involved with a beautiful girl named Jesse (Emily Lloyd) and she was invited to study in Chicago. Paul became a journalist and is known as "fishing reporter". He is famous and seems to have found a beautiful life, but he drinks a little more and jubilee. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well managed, it's a great score and good for all actors. The most beautiful thing in this movie is cinematography. The hills, woods and rivers all look very nice. The movie was made for this thing only because it was good enough to see. Fortunately there are more.
