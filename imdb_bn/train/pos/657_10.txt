La Manman et la Putin will be seen as a movie that both are published (after 68) and in many cases eternal. True, the actors "do not work" ... true, they talk a lot ... but what they say only lives life ... or die. Francois Lebron's long-awaited single conversation is probably the most accurate and moving text that was written about femininity, manhood and love. Translation is not easy, though. This statement is a statement (or two women in this case) about being a man and a woman. And IMHO, Jean-Pierre Leod, the best French actor.
