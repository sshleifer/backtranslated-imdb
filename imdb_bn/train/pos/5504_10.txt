I saw this last night, it was aired in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionet I' series. It has recently been displayed at the Toronto International Film Festival and many others (September 2003). This is an extraordinary picture. The filmmakers were overwhelmed by Chavez for creating a documentary about himself. Instead, as a coup, they were united in the events between themselves. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, in most cases, let stories be revealed as it happens. Of course, there are their own ideological perspectives (which they make clear) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus on events, people, and background and background in the coup. As a film, it's not a ground-breaking style in a stylistic or aesthetic, and I think how it should be. What we can see is that what 'embedded' journalism really should be. What we can see is a wonderful account of a country struggling to achieve democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually thinks for his people ... stories about power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests. A democratically elected leader combines the leadership of a coup ... and it unfolds as an historic event's unprecedented access. <br /> <br />
