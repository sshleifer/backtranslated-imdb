I really like Star Trek's Hidden Frontier, it's a nice fan fiction movie series and I can not wait to wait any longer, I've just started watching this movie series last week and I'm not getting enough of it. I've already recommended other people to see it from the good price of the view too. I have seen many episodes already on many occasions and are waiting to see more episodes. I gave it ten rates but I think it's a wonderful job to get my congratulations to Star Trek's hidden Frontiers staff. If you like Star Trek, I highly recommend checking out this fan track Fan Fiction Film. The details related to this series are excellent, especially ships and planets are used on it
