I really like this movie! Although it was not like books, it is still the classic nancy draw style. I am seeing many ads for this movie and I was actually in Nancy Drew, I really had high expectations for this movie and they certainly fulfilled those expectations. Most of the letters were exactly the way I illustrated them from reading books. I'm really happy that I saw this movie. Actors and actresses really acted like book series. Since I saw this movie, I wanted to read every nancie drum there. All the actors and actresses really got into their character and were clearly shown when broadcasting this movie on the big screen. Actors and actresses really were in a position that I was sure to give 10 of the 10 films that were in the characters.
