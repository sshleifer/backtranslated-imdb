I liked this movie for the first time in 1981! I've lost countless times! It fails to make me laugh or feel me if I feel like Three Lead Superb and Infinite Scripts, plus How Do You Hear The Theme Song Nostalgic? I quote this movie without realizing it. I basically know the whole script, so when someone sees it for the first time, then I'll have to retain the next line as if it looks funny. Although I can not even shrink it, Sir John's character probably gets the most memorable ones. The famous "I will warn the media" when Arthur announced his intention to bathe is still priceless, but the list is really endless. This scene of Arthur soon screams from Phoenix's father's house, especially his interaction with Mujee. Make yourself a favor and watch this movie!
