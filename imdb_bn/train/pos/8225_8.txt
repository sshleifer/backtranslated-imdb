Kinky enough, all the previous comments only start the description and details left. I was sure that it was necessary to ensure a family work, because Marina Vlady was also Robert Hussain's wife, and - excellent - jazz music was written by director's father, Andr√©. In these circumstances, no surprise that it was a really good thriller, issued and immediately marked with music when viewed. Mystery was faulty, and up until the end of maintenance. One of the best European players, Robert Hussain, was able to impose himself as the leading screen and stage director. He is still seeing great stage shows, priority for religious matters.
