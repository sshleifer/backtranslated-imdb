This movie has been poorly reviewed and has been poorly reviewed. Rebecca West's book was published shortly after WWII in 1918, when there was no shell shock and trauma-inspired memorabilia, because critics later called it many books and movies. The time and the buses were hard to go back to, as the characters lived, the reality of that period: the first war experience to use lethal gas and the horrors of war, the British class system seemed to be the wife's most important, helpless spinster, and lovers from the past 20 years ago. Eyed as young and beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her marketing dream girl Margaret was not allowed to see, her character showed her character "from a far away drug addicts". To meet that performance, its family can feel strong romantic attachment not to live up to the expectations of families and society. Margaret said, "We quarreled, and when you turned away, you turned my face away from my mouth." So we know that the break was something that he provoked, it shamed him, but forgot Margarette's shame in the memory of his time. I have not seen all his pictures, but in what I have seen he has provided a strong manhood, which also plays this role as a helpless soldier. <br /> <br /> I even did not recognize Anne-Margaret at first and his performance was underlying. Do not read the book, I wondered whether Jenny and Chris died of the consequences of acting on the feelings of unlimited feelings, while Jenny said that she was "a cousin". The key is to keep Jenny in the nursery in the dry scene of the hair, which kitty says that she always dry her hair in her room, it seems to be more appealing to keep the chagrin warm than the room in the sun. , Or feeling lost about the lost child, and the statement that he had made, the need to preserve the room was not felt like Chris was alive, because the child was looking at the memory. Also, Jenny was shown to be living in the role of earning, because a high society society was involved with a fallen member. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Even after the resurrection, to experience her fearsome Vietnam and help her in marrying a girl on her My husband, like Margaret, was very intelligent, but the strain was very real, and the boyfriend finally managed to conform to his real-life situation with my fantasy of love. <br /> <br /> I thought that It was a good decision to show the recovery of the war experience very rarely, in the mind of Chris, I was a WWW soldier with Dr. W. I thought, who had played extremely violent and committed suicide in the fantasy of Margaret, and in contrast, "Mrs. Daloway" soldier's actions seem to be very much a famine. <br /> <br /> It shows that what is happening in Chris is very rare for psychologists Understand that what was a big problem faced by the entire team. Everyone seems to get their life back, but was it the right choice?
