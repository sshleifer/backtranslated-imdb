Greg Lombardo's most recent movie "Notes" (he also co-wrote and guided that feature) has been seen and liked, I decided to test his previous work, and this film was valuable for its efforts and for rent. Macbeth is a tongue cheek in Manhattan, Shakespeare's favorite is nicely taken, updated and moved to NYC. I was influenced by the script's underlying intelligence and intelligence, and the production story of film itself portrays the story itself - and very cleverly. In the trial and problems of Manhattan, many Shakespeare's game parallels, and Central Park is rarely better used than Macbeth's wood around the castle. Mr. Lord Corso certainly has a pleasant place in his heart for New York and New York stories (Nuts is a funny and warm sex comedy, which is located around a typical Brooklyn in around six thirty New Yorkers, Manhattan's offices and Downtown Lottings have been dropped for good measurements) and Shakespeare's plays Spent enough time around. The film is well illustrated and the story reflects deeper understanding of the plays necessary in Macbeth's main section. This reminds me of Al Pascino's "Richard's search" - another wonderful Shakespeare "play in a movie." I highly recommend checking out Macbeth in Manhattan.
