If you are a fan of Alman's big net, you'll be doubted as soon as being proved in movies like M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gossford Park and at least seen movies. The Health Health Convention presided around, where two women are running for the president, the 70th-time regular actor Paul Dolly (who helped compose the film), the new actors of top star Altman, like Carroll Barnett and Henry Gibson, and Lauren Baakal , James Garner and Glenda Jackson Most of the film's altitudes, like the movie, have many concerts, but it's almost impossible not to film like Nashville or AWedding, but it's more like a more centralized feeling like the MASH. Or at Gossford Park. The whole thing is a clear satire on health movement, which is surprised with Dick Cavet's guest stars. Underlining the entire selection process is extreme disappointment with Altman's politics and public appeal, but the most objectionable about this picture is that most people think it's pretty funny. It will be one of the last films of AltaMan!
