This picture may seem like today's date, but remember that it was made in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Starr, George Carlin was out of Hippie's DP Weatherman and beyond gentle humorous humor. These pictures are all their granddaddy. Enjoy its historical significance, as well as its powerful entertainment value.
