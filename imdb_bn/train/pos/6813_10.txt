Like many others, I have seen and researched most books and films about Clipper Chilling, in which the participants themselves included some dramatic works on the basis of the activities of the criminals, including the captain and the psycho-mythology. As with Capote, I could not deliberately miss Perry Smith's confession, intimcies and defense from defense advice and to forgive him for the sake of writing. I believe the truth and information capet "saved" for his "book", for which Captain's two convicted verdicts and executions were needed, successfully under futuristic defense for Perry Smith under the Old McCannon Rule. Kopot could not write another major literary work after "Cold Blood". Shame and crime In my opinion, he deliberately encouraged and planned a cruel death penalty for the spectacular completion of his book / drama. To him, both men died for his book to be successful. The book itself was justified by falsifying the horrors of the death penalty. Its actions and silence ensure the cold conclusion of ice. <br /> <br /> The book of the Capeton is not true. This is not realistic or journalistic. It is spicy drama and melodrama with its own creative psychologist imagination. Qualities of the first movie in the contemporary movie, what most people think, is the image of Capo's mind, which can be the coldest blooded aspect of all. Wonderful viewers are weird but not necessarily Black's performance choice. The nightmare from the unreal imagination of that actor Keapot. <br /> <br /> Who would say how to kill two killers? Who is to judge whether it can create a primarily poetic psychological snap from excessive courtesy and generosity to kill "now it's"? I agree with some of the great performers I've seen in the work of Erie Roberts, Shakespearean in his role, still acting with heartfelt sincerity. Anthony Edwards takes a safer "attitude of moderation" to create an acute hikoc; But he is one dimensional and annoying, with only a few notes on his television range. Roberts is about four-dimensional, adding a strong animal body to physical weakness and pain, a Frankenstein creature who thinks of poetry and does not know exactly what to do. Like Leopold Approach Loeb, Robert Perry Smith frustrates love for an evil person. Without the people of Hikoc or his specialty, Perry Smith did not bring his psychological mind to a terrible world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> and the new production of the theater. In the same case, some of the same lines from the record of the case, but apparently deeper, more complex, with the psychological pressure, Roberts is so good like this liquid crazy that he shows how much awareness he is physically and face-to-face at all times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many of our critics dislike this picture, especially Roberts, those cold blooded killings are not seeing the hope and demand According to health has been utilized. Because here we see a much more realistic "life and death explanation" rather than creating a capote - a real tragedy. <br /> <br /> The real cold bloody killer, Mr. Captain and his hypocrritically artistic "non-fiction novel" does not control this interpretation and performance. <br /> <br /> Capote's influence on life, literature and truth as much as the scholars say, is true, or a version of the truth, which is not a rank, its talents hold the fathoms of their lazy talents As the genius gives.
