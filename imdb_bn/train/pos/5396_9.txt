Simple, meaningful and delivers a mental punch. I walk through regular uninterrupted movies and it always likes to come up with something which is simple and light message, without any trend or spontaneous instructions. <br /> <br /> A boy in school must play time in his studies and the most important lesson of his life is given only when he does not have enough copies to go, he has to share with the school . <br /> <br /> Like kids with small children or actors, these kids keep their own and it's trustworthy. The soundtrack completes the nicely the emotion of the piece and the fifth part of the film works well.
