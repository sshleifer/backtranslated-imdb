First of all, if you plan to see it, do not forget to see the UNCUT version (though it was too skeptical to go back and see what was visible due to censorship), it made a huge difference. This film is about a young man, who has played Stanwick repeatedly, who was forced to prostrate by his own father at the age of 14. When his father suddenly left, he was able to move to his own world. After reading Nietzsche's philosophy on life, he used his sexuality to give his wish to man and destructive and frustrated for his love. Throughout the film she became increasingly materialistic and impressive and the audience began to think that there is no sense of morality left. Overall, Baby Face is a very frustrating movie with a sex scene that most people would not expect to see in black and white pictures. Although no sexual activity is clearly shown on the screen, the camera is going to be closed, it is very clear. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed watching this movie too much and I believe that most modern audiences will enjoy at least some of them, especially with movie shock standards. I saw when it looks like the pensing parts seem to be slightly slower, but I think most of the movies are about to see them for the first time. In fact, I think that almost all of the movies I made from the early 30s were not some "minor" pacing problems or some parts were "flowing" right. It is probably not the only draft to make the film perfect ?? It just takes a few years. Compare a movie from 1939 and compare it with its first 30 films and I think you will see what you think. <br /> <br /> Again, I'm very happy that I was able to see the original cut; It really makes a big difference. Also John Wen fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role.
