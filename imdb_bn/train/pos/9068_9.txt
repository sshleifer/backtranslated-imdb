I think great movies of cinema movies. I deal with kids with kids of the same age, and I thought their behavior was very trustworthy. I had a problem with reference to 5-year-old personalities. I did not need the comment and actually gave a slight reduction in my opinion of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Louis Benver is coming up and star. I would like to see more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed his reaction to the situations that found himself in him. Often this is not the thing without thinking through the results of kids age. Almost all actors have done this work throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's important to test a few more messages in movies with this age. This is a big problem in schools today. <br /> <br /> The end was quite unexpected. Although he did not win or won the beat, he was astonishing. He was so nice to manage that situation. Very often children are not willing to compromise today. The actor of this movie showed that compromise is an important part of life.
