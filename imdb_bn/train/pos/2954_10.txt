But if you can support the Region 4 (Australian) DVD, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the internet. DAVID complemented by a great story, as well as its supporter shield, especially Claudia Carvan and late, a memorable performance from the great John Adele.
