A new way of enjoying Goldswari's work, rivers and tides allow fans to see their work at the speed. Goldsworthy develops his pieces, develops the perception he uses for each stone, leaf, and thorn that he is. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides affect and affect their work. Although, I was pleased that this film was covered with a large portion of Goldsworthy pieces (not Snowball), I think it was a bit long. To bring Goldsworthy's work back, filmmakers did a great job and made a beautiful movie that was happy to see.
