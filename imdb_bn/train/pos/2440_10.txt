What peace I saw this movie on March 12, 2000 at the Irish International Film Flat in Manhattan. Both they attended and were available for later questions. What a big film! Although the Catholic / Protestant opponent is set to be in Ireland, the story can hate any one of those two groups. When people get the chance to get rid of their hatred and anger, the horror of how quickly they can carry a beautifully intelligent and funky story with a moving love story. If it is not selected in the United States, it would be really unfortunate. <br /> <br /> ... for the star and fans ... the first rate. They call Orilla Bradie as the Irish Meril Strip. It's my opinion that he is better than Merrill Strip. America Ola Brady Meril will call! And, the strong and powerful illustration of a simple and personal person of Liam Cunningham was sticky in a political war. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
