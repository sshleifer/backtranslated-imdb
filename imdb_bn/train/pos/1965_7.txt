I found this image very well in all areas. All characters played, especially Ms. Stone and Morissey were brighter than Tramell's letters just get smart and psychologically rolled by minutes. Although this plot is interesting, this film is more about the minds in mind and how Catherine is going through new ways and novels for her novels and twists. The setting was also fantastic and the whole atmosphere of the film was mysterious, excellent works like thriller. Now look at this movie, it is better than what it has received from viewers, which was confused by some faulty scary reviews about the movie. (Even before it started) ..... If you see it, you will not regret it ...
