Valentine is one of my favorite slasher films now. The death scenes are wide and the performances are the best. Marley Shelton has acted as a female lead ("I know ..." better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the film). David Borinaz, I was the main reason I saw this film, he had a small role, but he played well. Exceptional list exceptions for best actress Dennis Richards He was terribly terrible. I was happy to see him * Sphile * * His death scene All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You must definitely see before "Scrum" or "I know ..." before looking back.
