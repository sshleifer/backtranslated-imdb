I've been looking for a copy of this movie (16 mm, DVD, VHS), so I could show it to my kids. The film is funny, and Spike and his band members have shown why they are the best musicians in the business. They have that demented game that will be good. I like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around the firehouse of the century, the fireman and department bands (when the fire does not fight)). Normally running gags, plus Spike Jones and his orchestra have greatness. Also, comedy relief body hackett and straight-man provided by Hugh O'Brien.
