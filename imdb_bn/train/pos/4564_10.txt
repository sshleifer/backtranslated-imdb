If ever there was an inspirational story that could make a person strong and nonetheless despite the oddness, even if it does not make a person (even when it is an expression "made by it", there may be a wide variety of which is ultimately personal truth) Maybe, my left photo is it. It is a tough movie to watch: Chris Brown's less complex aspect of personality appears in two main scenes - his sister declares that she is pregnant and able to effectively communicate with her dad's bad reaction and when the table is about to be given to him at dinner. By now, he has announced at another moment (the opening of the Brown Industry) that he is the second one Who is going to get married - is difficult. Very, very difficult. Even more so because it is a person who can not respond to these incidents and only express himself in the way that he knows: aiming to hurt himself through screaming, roots and mustaches. However, this is not the story of heart disease and family inconvenience, even when it inserts an autobiographical account, a person attacking his serious disabilities, it becomes an effective human being and is involved in a power industry world. Daniel Day Lewis won the Oscars for Brown and Brenda Frycars, as a strong but unforgettable performance as strong, unforgettable, as the role of his support for Brown's tough mother.
