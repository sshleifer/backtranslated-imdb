"In cold blood", adapted by Richard Bruce, the masterpiece of the truman capet, related to the ruthless and intelligent murder of the family of one-and-a-half of the abducted criminals. This image is character of the character of the murderers, especially the trigger-man Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> This cast contains some recognizable names, but they easily bring the story to life. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are extraordinarily beautiful together with two criminals together. Black enjoys a lot of opportunity to explore the foolishness of his character, when they play with each other easily. The rest cast is not only average and commentable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks received Oscar nomination for both his script and his instruction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the script was wrong with some sick advice at the late stage. Oscar nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall as a top-genuine, edited. Also, the qualification of the note is the jersey score of Queen's Jones, which is the last of four Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many criminal films, it does not fade from violence. Brooks turns the murderers into unfortunate characters instead of condemning them. With this feeling you agree or the film presents interesting alternatives to the usual Hollywood method. I recommend the film for this reason and the skill of handling technical aspects.
