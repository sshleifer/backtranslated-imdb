There is a lot going on in the college girl Marda. A crazy scientist creates an almost undetectable toxic gas. Prior to his discovery, the scientist was killed by a hooded, whip-welding monk. A co-ed of a church dies by gas, called to investigate Scotland Yard, but continues to kill. Who can stop this crazy killer and think of coming back to college? <br /> <br /> what works <br /> <br /> - The killer Do not like about a killer who sneaks around after an animated red KKK looking outfit full of red gloves. She stood nicely against the bright red gown using the white whip very effective to carry. Although the concept of an assassin of a red, point-and-head fencing around girls' school has been fairly remote, I found that one of the more poor working clothes <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60 songs I really like to track the music of College Girl Murders Title It seems a jazzy, hip, 60s that I just loved. <br /> <br /> - Seamless Touch. Outside the assassin's red gown and the hood, the film is a slideshow fireplace, a cage overhead handed cage, poisonous bible, strategically placed manenine, mini skarks, go-to-boots and mile high hair. I'll describe it as a cross between the 60th Batman TV show and an Italian giyalo. College Girl Murders is a real treat for the eyes. <br /> <br /> - Finish. Let's just say there are more twists than a mountain road. Just when you think that the assassination occurred, here comes a twitch ?? And another ?? And another ?? And <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know people can be humorous, but their buffish character has a lot of screen time. <br /> <br /> - Why are there eligitors? Previously, I mentioned the collector in the hay. And when they touch a nice, they serve very little purpose. Why not go through all the problems and use them? <br /> <br /> - Plotding Plot There is little flow or rhythm of the College Girl Murders. There are many moments throughout the film when things come intrinsically in a screening suspension. <br /> <br /> I saw many German worms but saw a few (I'm Soho Phantom, Blackmore Castle Strangler, Late Eye) London) This may be my favorite. This is really a real fan feeling that I really go in. Once the plot was a little better, I could easily give College Girl Murders 7/10.
