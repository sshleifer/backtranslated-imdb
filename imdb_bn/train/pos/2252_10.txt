Henry Hathaway is brave and enthusiastic, for her love for the people in the early history of US history. However, there is no need to comment on the film for criticizing the film's historical error number about Bridgem Young and Mormon people. In my opinion, Hathaway gave amazement to the fact that at the time of the death of Joseph Smith, during the liberation war, how a Mormon man expressed in the first history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Christ. Often, in fine films and dialogues distribution, they cover Mormon philosophy and teachings in a number of sections and scenes. <br /> <br /> I see this movie on my Saturday morning in the early 1950's. Just 10 years after the release of the films, and before I completed the Los Angeles template I saw it, and more strange wonder about Mormons. I recently bought this image and suddenly I will enjoy the following message explained in her picture. <br /> <br /> 1. Despite their personal beliefs, love for everyone, 2. Charitable for them or not. 3. Families are seriously high, 4. Listen and listen carefully, because it is important to consider and accept important things in opposing messages. Work both individually and in the community, work hard. 6. Prepare and save for the future. 7. Hope high quality and a cabbage link for our daily life. 8. And appreciate that, there is a unique quality group, and marked as beneficial.
