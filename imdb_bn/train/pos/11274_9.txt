One of the best Tarzan movies is its highest action packed (and graphic). It is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To collect Safari ivory in elephant graveyard. Expect to use to win Jane back from Holt Tarzan that her friend carries her wardrobe and perfume. Before Holt left, they stole his map and tried to rival a campaign and capture it became a crazy dash. In the end, when they capture the thief, they consider the whole group dead and surround them. They have no choice except to fight their way and they soon find out from the frying pan and in the fire. Eventually, Tarzan and Zen show up and everyone gets locked up in more events. <br /> <br /> In order to reduce graphic violence, the infamous film was heavily censored (it's today's graphic even today's standard, it could possibly get a PG-13) and to remove all the hints of nudity (knowingly a few minutes long naked Swimming scene which is full of its nakedness, it was recently restored). This recovered version clearly shows why this movie was reduced to TV running time in 20 minutes. As it stands in the restored version, it is a very mature film that is romantic, touch, action-filled, and any other movie that should be. It's an amazing film by almost any standard. Its the best film of all that plays well just like the Academy alone, the first one to watch it does not see the first movie, but it is a film that deepens the characters and themes set in the original film. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The rear screen is often very obvious, many have gorilla suits for apes and some other effects are more subtle than believers. However, this image is a top notch at almost every other level. <br /> <br /> You really owe it to yourself to see it. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the sofa and let it move you in a simple time. One of these great events.
