This is a wonderful movie and the Salt Lake of Mormons, the ultimate settlement of Utah. The beginning and the end is particularly strong, and we all want to remind the message - God does not speak, but he communicates, if we only listen. Because of Katrina, I am writing this about the horrors of New Orleans and the surrounding areas, especially after Mormon was behind everything after killing Joseph Smith. People came to this country to avoid religious persecution, and they still could not. Mormon's struggles, the cost of living, the hardships they suffered for the country were really wonderful, they displayed their extraordinary power. As far as Marmon's real beliefs, it does not go extensively, and polygamy is mentioned, it is not the center of the film. <br /> <br /> Cast is at the top, although others can talk more about actual characters and talk about how true the illustrations are. But as an actor, Dean Zogar, Mary Astor, Brian Donley, John Carradine, Jane Darewell all work well with the script given to them. <br /> <br /> While the film can easily stand on its own (and of course today), Toron Power and Linda Darnel will see a film about the movie about Mormon near the movie theater. The power is nicely handsome as a young darling, and Dennel as Jinnah is not a virgin but with the death of his father, the family remains with the family. There is not much of electricity at the end of the movie, when it has a big view, and Darnel (still a teenager at the time of filming) is less, but they make a beautiful couple. His fate left vague about his transformation, and in his case he was surprised by polygamy. You can not beat one for eye candy candy, however.
