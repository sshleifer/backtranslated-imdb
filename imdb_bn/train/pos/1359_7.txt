I work in a library and hope to like this movie after coming out 5 years ago. I love Lisa Parker Possi (she's an extraordinary actress) and Omar Townsend was really cute like her boyfriend (she could not act, but when you look like him?) But the movie was bad. It was not fun or intelligent or anything. Posey kept afloat movie with its strength. But he learned the Daiichi Decimal system overturned and then look at the books to beat the music ?? !!!! ??? Come on! Still, when he saw that when he looked at how he had become a complete librarian - there was no idea of ​​a hair, glasses, humor - can we please take that stereootype? Looking for Posey and Townsend is valuable but that's about it. The TV series was much better.
