The great and intimate Merriam Davis shows his stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy, which also features the wonderful William Hines. Davis has played Hick from Georgia who has crashed Hollywood with the help of Hines. Until Marion "discovers" and becomes a big dramatic star, he appears in comedy. A great lighthouse in Hollywood and its pretentions. Davis and Henes are a great team (very bad they've never created a chat together) and a shot shot from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Heart, John Gilbert, Elin Garin and Marion Davies (you see it) is a hoot. Must for a serious film buff or for anyone interested in still fierce Marion Davies!
