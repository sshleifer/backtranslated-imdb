Dennis Hooper and JT Walsh steals the show here Cage and Boyle are fine, but this nu-noor gives their juice a blurred, violent character and jetty walsh shine. <br /> <br /> A drifter goes wrong for the hit-man, and trying to do something a little from it, but gets on his head. <br /> <br /> I found a peculiar parallel in the first scene of this movie, when Cage Wymming is getting a drilling job in the trailer, her friend ... and Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same thing! But it's another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hooper is his best here ... Kaki, one-step forward, scary, explosive, and explosive violent. Jetty Walsh (RIP) is valid as a dark past person, trying to live legally well (well, almost). <br /> <br /> Here, there are only 4 original characters with no exception, in the Red Rock town, Wyoming's deputy. The first twist hits at first, and from there it is a nice new-comed adventure in the sleepy little town. Satisfactory 8 pounds
