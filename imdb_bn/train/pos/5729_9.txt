A bit of a maze for this lot of Lynch crowd in the Arts. They try to write a little nonsense, crude on the link, as well as this project. Like he passes gas into the real pieces of his film art. But it can be a bird, but one of the misconceptions that you take and feels embarrassed to enjoy. Dumbled dull art outside of <br /> <br /> What you can do in the direction of modern life but smile it If you take it seriously, you have to go nuts. You hook it in, smell it, taste it, feel its pain, its irrational stupidity, and then you publish it in any medium. Thats art called, and the art is stupid. But it's Dumbbell
