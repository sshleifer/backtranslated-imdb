'If Nad Kelly was born, he probably won the Victoria Cross in Gallipoli.' Like Ned's courage. <br /> <br /> Australia, and especially the name of the country Victoria, can be called Ned Kelly and immediately recognized. He is still a hero in Greta, the city of Jillillery, the city of blood depends on the journey made by blood, but in Mansfield, they still do not forget that they were from the three police killed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> He was hanged from Old Melbourne, where he was in the post office in Gerrelli. A cell held once in Gretta can also be seen in Benelas and Anne Jones's hotels, stations, and even in Glenrons. <br /> <br /> The facts of the movie proving to all (without the love of her love) can be found in all records in Victoria, police records and even the deck shelton can be found in Ned to get rid of drowning. None of these is wrong, and the ones remaining to justify the Neds verb. The horse that was stolen was actually stolen by Wild Right (the person who came out of the prison and came out with the Ned box). Ned had already been in prison after the horse was stolen, so he could not steal. <br /> <br /> Zerillary's letter is more than what has been said earlier. It's not a self-righteous, it's a biography of Neody's biography, what he stood for, and who he was. So go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then stands for what Ned stands for about your mind.
