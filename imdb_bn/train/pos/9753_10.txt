... in our family. Like all those who commented on this movie, my brother (at the age of 7 and 4) and I (10) will watch this movie again. We all like Star Wars, but we always go back to this one because of the great song and adventure. We all like camels and singing them at the top of our lungs during the song. Some slow moments (spent time with King Qu-Ku in his court) and usually we became disturbed after the song of the night ("for that reason I {sound effect} because I loooooove you"), but we like the journey to rescue baboo And to the end and the king became a bit weird by the coup's picture, which dominated the whole horizon, laughing to the end. I'm still singing this song "Hurry for me! Gabe Paris!" My friends (I'm 33 now) who lost my mind, just looked at me; However, when I sing a song I'm 10 years old and again remember the wonderful year of Star Wars.
