This may be the best movie of all time, Columbia studios did not spend much of the essence of Osan Welles. What we kept is a flawless, sharp film that shows the great talent of Wales as the serious dramatic talent of actors / directors and Rita Haven. <br /> <br /> 'Shanghai Lady' photo is silent, it's the most sizzling and confusing. Wells, with a vague expression, Michael Oahra, portrayed a passenger Irischman, who found herself effectively as a chronometer after a fierce face-to-face confrontation with a seductive, dangerous Elsa Benstar (Hewroth, a great performance). Her and her unmarried husband's (Everett Sloane) Yacht Elsa, or 'Rosalie', Michael likes to call her, innocent, helpless dolls are very good, pushing her on the web. Lovers manages a secret relationship with the sea, Arthur Banner's partner at George W. Gersby (Glen Anders), his law firmly comes to the sea. He is a strange, incredible personality who gave Michael a unique offer: Greensby will receive $ 5000 to help Greece in fixing his death, so it shows the killings. Plan to get a strategy off for Michael, and run into the sun with Elsa. But things are not to be planned. <br /> <br /> One of the most hesitant illustrations of Haiere is that our greatest women of all time have given serious deadly executions. Sometimes he feels cruel, trustworthy, tired and harsh on the other hand as a real weak and childlike. Always she is brilliantly beautiful, she is calling her for a situation, she is wearing a swimsuit dressed in wet or black, brandishing a gun. Heaven is beautifully photographed, and he has made much cry from his famous 'Gilada' role. Her next husband, Orson Welles, cuts his trademark non-lock for his dark-green crop (angering angle boss Harry Ko). It was an awesome marketing plan, and he surprisesly suits to change its changed attitude. He is not 'Gilada', the sympathetic female fatty is not here - instead he is a hunter, a black heartwarming, who sees the killing as a very useful alternative. <br /> <br /> <br /> When the couple had extreme difficulties in their marriage. After the creation of the film, they will make a divorce, so it is a curiosity to see something in complex relationships. They are loathsome, not romantic, lovers in it, so it is difficult to calculate whether the actual chemistry was on screen. Of course, each encounters and is filled with raw sex, 'fallen guy' with Wales (he even admits himself in the movie!) And Rita is the Double Crossing Babe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Usually do not mess with 'drifter' much knowledge. Wells used to voice-over use, they do not really use their brain 'the hope of thinking of her (Alsa)'. Wells generally played in the cute, charismatic Fellow, so his turn here is as unusual as the dim-witted Michael and very interesting. In fact, Wells is an actor of fine talent and he pulls it off well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One wonders why he rented Michael It is clear that his wife is romantically interested in him, so why he invites a 'threat' to the board? One explanation may be that Michael has provided 'service' to his wife that the bancaster can not stay in helpless position. Before her visit to her husband (she was a prostitute?), There is a lot of implications for Elsa's behavior and her knowledge of the most secret secrets of the banner shows a number of scenes. It's a junky, convoluted film with a defective plot. We are more interested in love triangle than killing, as with most silence. Wells offers our usual brightest cinemic touches, of which there is a prominent 'mirror hole' climax. This is a horrific scene, one end that can remove moodle in almost mobile phones and it can lift it in greatness. These funny house scenes are apparently in stunning, illustrated sets with a dolly-like feel (apparently drawing them in motion). The fine visual imagery used by Welles's film enhances the plot and makes it a thought-provoking experience. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is frustrating and confusing, Rita's alternative breathing voices and helpless, highly educated young girl. Heyworth demonstrates his ability to act, and proves that SHE is the 'fat' fat fat. It was a sad thing (the Ritter was a bright dancer just a little) that he had so much fun, sharp and often forgotten musicals for Columbine instead of over 40 dark-themed noir. There was a brilliant actress when she gave the opportunity to show her talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
