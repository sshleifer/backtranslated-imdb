This image represents the survival of the war, the worst part of the memories. For many soldiers, men and women alike, real problems may start to come home. I was expected to return to my father and his brother WWII. The war never ended for one of my cousins. He survived the D-Day Aggression, as the first 20 minutes of private privatization saved. For him the memories are not only lingered but tortured him. He became my cousin, a drunkard like his son. Continue for 60 years and keep soldiers in different countries in a different fight, the result is the same. Who saw me in Filmfare, I was reminded that there is something about war that never changes. Ideal young men and women do not refrain from the emotional pain of what happened in Iraq, especially if you are against the war, will also be shown more condolences for their compassion and report to the soldiers who are trying to correct what they believe or say. <br /> <br /> Platoon's tagline in Vietnam's war picture says it all. "Innocence of the first killings of war."
