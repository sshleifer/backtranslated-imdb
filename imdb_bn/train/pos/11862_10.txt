Anyone who plays video games here knows that GTA: the game's Vice City Mansion, and other things, including weapons from this film, and this movie inspired the Ricester games to copy. Some things in this movie and how it is one of the best 80 movies, I recommend someone who does not see it yet. 10/10 No question was asked
