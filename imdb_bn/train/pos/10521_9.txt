Well, I think I'm passionately attached to this movie because it went to see the first movie 10 times more ... my master helped me through the thesis, or prevented me from doing this! <Br /> <br /> But after a few years (and many movies) I saw it - this is a pretty fabulous little gem! I have never seen Gananath Paltrow acting more strongly, and Jeremy Northam perfect Mr. Knightley - where such a man is seen ??? <<< Sigh >>> Sophie Thompson's best acting as MP Bates (Oh, Napins, sorry!) And the rest is not disappointing Caste - Tony Colette brings her Harriet to Muriel, and Ian McGregor is firmly charming - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are perfect "Impossible" couple! <br /> <br /> Certainly contribute to the feeling of set and clothing, and beautiful soundtracks, almost Hobbiton-like atmosphere of the movie - even though the cinematography and artwork goes far, it is almost a scene of visual overload. Very nice, but a little more intensity can be expressed in a good sense of time. But the good thing is, the film does not accept itself very seriously and has lots of fun - and some cool cool edits - which it refrains from being sinking into the saddle in sweet old England mode. <br /> <br /> Special favorite ball scene - Some beautiful acting and instructions here, and the conclusion concludes that the relationship between the beautifully Emma and Mr. Knightley is neatly summarized. The final resolution scene is going on for a very short time - cut two shots (I can remember exactly what!) And it can have more with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I understand (by reading the Emedeb Lists) that I saw Jeremy Northam at least three films, even I was not aware - even I thought it was too much for him as an actor. Only one hearty English hearty! Hmm, guess I have to give a visit to my video store ... <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. My favorite Jane Austen adaptation is so far - although probably Ana Lee's sensitivity and sensitivity is not strictly saying, good movie, it's the closest to my heart - and I certainly have seen it many more times! See if you can do it - and little incompatibilities is not very difficult. <br /> <br />
