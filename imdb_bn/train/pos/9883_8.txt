It ran for 8 seasons, but it was first, early in 1959, and it lasted, in the autumn of 1965, the season was smaller than 2-7. CBS chief William Palley canceled the production of Rahahid after watching the first show of Season 8 in September 1965, because he disliked the series without Gilos Fryming seven years later without Gil Aafair. The latest new episode was circulated in November 1965. The CBS broadcast began on January 4, 1966, on January 4, 1966. <br /> <br /> I am often surprised why RAHOHED did not switch to colorful film last season? The big west of the 1960s went to color until 1965. CBS broadcast for most of the sitcoms in autumn color, but Westerns like Gansok and Ravenheed were black and white. On September 17, 1966, Gansak was the last Western (and the last prime time network series to switch color) snap decision.
