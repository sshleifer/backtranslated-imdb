This is a very good movie for me, especially Michael Jackson lovers. It contains a message on drug, stunning special effects and an extraordinary music video. <br /> <br /> The main movie is song and music video 'Smooth Criminal'. Unlike four minutes of music videos, it's a normal speed and in my opinion, it's a lot easier to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Jackson played a witch 'Gangster', when he saw a shooting star, he turned into a part of the machine . Throughout the film, he transformed into a race car, a giant robot, and a space ship. <br /> <br /> Especially the robot pulled a bit of view and weird. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All the bad guys push up. A little weird Yes <br /> <br /> But alongside the odd robot scene, this is a very good movie, and Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both smooth criminal music videos and movies.
