When I was young I saw this Kung Fu movie, and I thought it was very cool! Now I am 26 years old, and my friend has it on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We got a case of brew, and saw this classic! This is not the original Kungfu coolness! If you are a fan of Kung Fu / Kerat movies then it must be seen ... the DVD is available. I believe this movie is called "Choose your poison." <br /> <br /> Watch soon!
