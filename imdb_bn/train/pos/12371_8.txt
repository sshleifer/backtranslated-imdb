Sure, it can hold the ideas of horror movies with other similar themes of the same time, but still managed to bring its own emotional impressions to the scoksin material (good versus evil) and a unique perspective, in some cases, the absorbent set piece in an impressive wide range. Completely sketch it, but with the scares remains the plot by instilling an unexpected charge without going gang-busters. Indeed, there is always something going on in his busy framework, but it has reduced its shocks with soap design and atmospheric knitting steering, until it is clearly annoying and intensely with a strong wind.

The emphasis is largely made in the Moody corner, because it gradually starts in light of its internal steps and in the light of strange / anxious experiences while going to its new apartment. This is where the winner eerie tries to pull out the shadow, which is some ice moments project. Gil Mille was responsible for the grand, high-powered orchestra score, which did not miss a single coup and Richard C. Critics handle sleeping, scop-like photography instruments.
