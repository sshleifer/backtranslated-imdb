I bought this movie a few days ago, and it will be a fantastic shitty film. But when I pop it into a DVD player, it surprises me very well. James Belushi Bill plays the "head" Manuccie very well as well. But in particular Timothy Dolton plays a very good role like Sheriff. The 'last' scene in the bell room is very nice, good camera-work, excellent dialogue and very well played. Bill "The Math" Manuscier stole 12 million dollars from the Mafia. A wife living in South African South Africa in the Witness Protection Program But the mafia holds him, and wants 12 million dollars. Bill can only depend on the person that he knows himself inside.
