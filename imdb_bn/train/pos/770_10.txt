I love tudor cherry and that's why I enjoyed the movie. Two days before the movie premiere I went to see her concert. I saw the video "Jimu" before the trailer and the video and I thought it was all about me. I was wrong: instead of a good movie I helped a great movie! I FELT movie It was sad .. It was funny .. but mostly it depicts love .. I can not even start to describe soundtracks. So I will not :) I'm not a movie critic. TT describes in more words .. my nasty unclear details are all the reason because this game has fooled me. Thanks to God for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Gurgaari, thank you Maria Popstasu, thank you Iowa Barbu and thank you Turi Chirla. Again! :)
