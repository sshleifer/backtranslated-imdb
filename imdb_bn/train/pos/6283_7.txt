The bigger the big epic picture I like - I'll leave you nominated - sometimes it's great to go back with some beers and a simple action flick. Where the set piece of plots takes a backseat movie. Films where the dialogue is not so cleverly written that it is related to the continuous knot of violet prose. There are many movies in the film that fit the bill ... but in my opinion it is better to be in 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> An update to the movie was shared in its name. It shares that photo ethos, but mostly executing it. Whatever was great about the original has been synchronized. Thanks to a big budget thanks to whatever was balanced. Often this type of effort has been published for the disaster of recipes - it has been published by the Pag-ugly repetition of Italian jobs - but here, thanks to a cast of most wonderful actors, Sixty has been successful. <br /> <br /> <br /> Plots and dialogs mostly do not have much to write IMDB. Often you will have scenes where the same kind of dialogue will be played between the actors and everyone will voice it with different forms. Many people have found this annoying; I find it raising a smile. Each actor has the opportunity to show his style definition here, Kaj, Jolie and Duval are certainly operating the pack (and it is also noted that it is also happy to see that Mrs. Pitt did not get the first billing). Good Ol 'St. Nick Stewart (see review date) and Angelina take a nice moment. Chemistry <br /> <br /> Villain is not a little scared - I saw Chris Exelston playing the role of a tough guy before I knew that he could manage them, but I think he deliberately directed his role to make it unreasonable so that the action Is not confused. We know that girls are going to succeed, somehow; We are just sitting in the car with them, enjoying the journey. I think many of these scenes have played in so many tails with the tongue that it went on top of many people by giving a poor rating. Actually, I did not think of breaking the fourth wall of the camera: it's just that kind of movie <br /> <br /> Not all of these styles and so much stuff - which often convey my patience to executed * exactly * - if the action was not there it would be worthless. And for the most part, it's Surprisingly so. I have noticed that fast-cut extreme close shots seem to be a general trend of direct action in these days. I personally find such kind of tiresome. I like this kind of movie where stunt all time tight shots ramping up artificial tension by rape is enough impressive. I said that Cage actually did a lot of car stunts because he could go away with losing his insurance (in real life I mean - his character does not care clearly) and it shows. People can actually drive a car and it can be good at slow climate phenol where he runs a mustang between the most shallow - and potentially on possible routes. So yes, this film is not about "an epic, life-affirming post-9/11 compulsory social commentary". Pacing is unbalanced, some scenes can be spent, and not all actors can cut the line. But car movies rarely come better than this. So if you hate cars ... why are you even reading this comment? <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll accept it with a lot of repetitions of "Flawed and the Teddyas" (franchise guess) any day. 7/10
