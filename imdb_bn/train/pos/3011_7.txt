One of the best vans movies has been more successful in the fascinating plot and skill direction by someone other than Michael Cartridge. This time, usually a disgusting financier is found dead - shot in the head - in his locked and bolted bedroom on the upper floor. Filho Vance, hearing of the situation while being closed for Italy, decides to end his leave and tries to resolve what he thinks and while others consider suicide. William Powell is a Fillow Vans as you'll find. He is never saying that and what he said and what he did is very easy. Powell is credited with the most gifted actors - some of the first-class characters such as Mary Astro, actresses and actresses, who hated her mother, hated Ralph Morgan as Paul Kawanggh's rival dog Fansiar Arthur Hohl as the secretary of the deceased. The mysterious Butler, Helen Vinceon kept the blonde as the next door, and two really good performances by James Lee as a well-cracking police detective and portie Eugene Palette as James Cook. Etien Guerradt transformed into a great curiosity in the mission, as a public performer, he always missed his food. It is this depth of suspects and a story that has many plots twists and turns that make the Kennel Murder case a fast moving, funny mystery.
