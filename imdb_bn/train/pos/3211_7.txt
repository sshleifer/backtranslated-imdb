This film is okay if you like unconditionally, dry acting and very little plots! Special Effects This movie is considered as the director of "Event Harrison". Dresses crazy things like most movies. No soldier is spoken, so others tell them what to do. It ultimately ends with the explosion as a big shoot-up film. I personally love Russell as "Tano and Cash" "Exemption from LA / New York" and "Executive Decision". This movie is about to release your mind on the door for action science fiction film in a brain!
