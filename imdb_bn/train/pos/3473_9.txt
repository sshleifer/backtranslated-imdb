I admit some trepidation when I first saw the preview for this film. Was the VH-1 treading the hollow ground here? I mean, Harris and Quinn are not really watching or even words like John or Paul. But I must admit, this picture really surprised me. It is far from the expected exploitation film. Instead, it is a character study, a low-key, radioactive and diverse view of friendship, and the final lesson we learn: It is difficult, if not impossible, to capture what we have achieved, and what we have passed.
