I actually enjoyed this show. Even as a youngster I was interested in all sports and that includes horse racing. It was always difficult to create a series based on race corruption and simultaneously get permission from Race Track to record filming on controversial topics. One episode I especially feel centered around a horse is expected to win a big race that looked a color off. A syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought that it was drug addict but nothing could be seen in the blood test. Very late, they realized that the horse was not poured out but that was left out of the knee-chip. It is better to drive and engine without an oil, breaking horses with tragic consequences.
