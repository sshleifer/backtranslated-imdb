"War Inc." Do not make mistakes, for a brain comedy full of internal joke for an awkward captivating taunting or news buffs. It is not. <br /> <br /> This is an old fashion sculble comedy, ridiculously coincidental plot twist, stock character (John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marcia Tomi and Hilary Duff with some of the fun) and an easy outlook for political content. <br /> <br /> You see, filmmakers have political issues almost all know that the country is already true. Yes, we understand that corporations are corrupt, inactive pigs, its responsible political leaders, even more intrusive BFFs, and American imperialism has never been crushed and exposed beyond touch - but <br/> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A (Tomi) and young Middle Eastern starlet do not believe, who wants to stop her marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, cartoonist enthusiast about his assistant plays. Ben Kensley was lost in my small part as a cruel CIA b oss. <br /> <br /> All of it, and it works. It's easy fun, but if you do not see the reality and you think the war is going well and every well-connected work is done and there is no corruption in the Middle East and people want us to leave Western culture. You can not find it as fun. <br /> <br /> To all of us, this was a light comedy with a political edge.
