Intelligent, polite, and thrilling, "The Invisible Man" was formed in 2000 in Saifi's normal lineup, consistent with Fantasical Art Directions of "Farscape" and sometimes colloquialized with fluidromatic scripts, radioactive plots and modern niros. The show was sat in "law and order" and "doctor" in the meter of credibility, but there was no denying that the characters of "I-Man" went out of jokes. Even characters such as Copper, Official, and Iberts were retrieved from the characters. Paul wrote a chemistry in Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventrere, which evolve beautifully and moved, making the cycles of writers and managers more remarkable by the team. These effects never allow the conspiracy to consolidate, and sometimes the science is completely unbelievable. The low point of the show is still entertaining, and I have not seen such a tight pilot episode. Matt Greenberg and Sa-Fi should be acclaimed and fans have the right to claim a comprehensive DVD version of this show. Every time I came across a marathon of "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" of Saiyah, I kissed my eyes aloud aloud loudly.
