"Purple Rain" was never the critic's darling but it is a religious classic - and should be demanded. If you're a Prince fan, it's for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot, Prince, sees her insulting parents and falls in love with a girl. Believe it or not, this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming. Sometimes it has fun off but it really works when it works. Very hit and miss <br /> <br /> No one can act in this movie. Everyone is a "Prince" as well as "Time" and "Vanity 6". Yet, it adds the charm to the movie. When Prince is in the screen, he becomes brighter and his business peers have fun to see him. <br /> <br /> Go to the conclusion, if you love Prince like me, check it out. If you are not a fan, it will bring you together.
