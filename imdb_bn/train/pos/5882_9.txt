This movie was only broadcast on TV in Mexico. The diary is the true example of Bonhofer's life, a good German and especially a good man. Conversation between Tukur's character and Nazi prosecutor is particularly interesting. A true concept 'War: Two different Germany, both beliefs believe there. Bonhofer was a very complex person: people, freedom fighters, lovers, church members and great intellectuals; Oscar Tuku is awesome as Bulhafa. I specifically recommend this movie especially for this planet in these difficult times. In Mexico we do not know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and succession, it's a great job to rescue a forgotten hero.
