Eskimo is an indigenous people and a serious film about the cultural erosion of white people attacking. Although painted with non-professionals in a documentary style, Eskimo is a skilled production that holds a believable story and the audience wants to see through the final shot. <br /> <br /> There are only different beliefs in the native Eskimo and its landscape behaves about women and life than that of the dark whalers. When an Eskimo guy loses his partner, it is normal for another man to share their women with their friends. Their women also want to take the place of the missing husband, but it is normal. All of these vulnerable settings seem natural to the background of forecoding. Believers Eskimo are helpless victims of white whalers (with heavy European accent) who do not see this native as equal to them. Drunken, drunken drunk, rape, and death occur after Eskimo men leave to work on ice cold sea. Finally, lead Eskimo (necklace) realized that he was convicted and he took revenge. The audience was delighted in the 1930's theater. <br /> <br /> Royal Canadian mounted police and write moral conflicts to bring Mala to trial. Mounty is played as a police feeling, which knows that it is not a cut and dry field. Will the mountains get their people? Is it fair to keep Mala in the behavior of behaviors outside its traditional society? Is there any way the garment does not punish? Is it inevitable that the law of white people must definitely win? There is no hope for innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but it's a subject that you enjoy to enjoy deeply. I suspect that before today's waiver, there has been a series of sequences with animals that no one was injured in making this film - so beware of the sequence of raw nature. Highly recommended.
