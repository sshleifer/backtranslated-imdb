I saw this picture with my child, and I was not frustrated. The story is well-known, some abandoned orphan should be brought to her parents by an unlikely trio (mammoth-sabertost tiger and a lazy animal) ... and do not forget to mention the incredible little hungry animal her hedges. This really makes me so much fun during the whole movie. In short: It works, it's fun and it should "definitely be seen" with your children (they would love it).
