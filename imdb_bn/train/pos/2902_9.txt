I am sitting in the movie "Tempo de Valitis" and I want to talk about the movie for a few hours. The praise of this movie has exceeded my limit of interpretation, because I am watching film scenes and I search for ideas for filmmaking and my conversations, which can be something bigger than Damian Siegfron's mind. <<br /> <br /> Seeing the environment, so incomplete, so simple, I wonder; This guy is a genius. Surprisingly, he did not create Argentina's best-ever television show, and yet still the first film of those contemporary directors has not been achieved. The name "El Fando del Mar" and it's our wake up (a few years ago), my encouragement for my daily movie. <br /> <br /> People start from daily life, go to Szfron where Pablo Treporo can never be "El Bonnares"; The life of the Federal Police Department. Treparo's film was a journey of human mind and experience, which she did not see. Yes, there was a detailed training and criminal situation, but there "Szfron" was a secret story, as we know and love, mystery and thrilling music. <br /> <But he has many humanity in his writing, and he showed our investigation through the eyes of our main character, Alfredo Diaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are many actors in the film, but these two actresses can not do films as well. The first character (Luis Luc) is a detective that only finds his wife cheating on him; And have to work in a field. <br /> <br /> The second person is a Psychiatrist that Detects Detective Treatment. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions, but Sheriff takes advantage of interest during his time and recommends that he joins his rituals with Dayaz: "It is nothing but commonplace, there is no problem". But it is bigger than that, and it will reveal a part of the doctor's personality that he did not know. <br /> <br /> It can not be explained until the better relationship is explained in two leads, because it is a complexity that signifies our history and shows how talented the men of Szfran are gifted today. During the high pressure situation, Diaz told Silverstein: "How can we continue to treat us?", And Silverstein answers: "No, I am not your doctor, you call me for dinner; I am your friend" : We laugh because we can not help it. <br /> <br /> And when Diaz car crashes in the street, we can not help it to laugh and it does not matter, or when he mistakenly turns all the red lights on the street, or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and Silverstein It can not believe (but still he gets screwed up because it smokes too much); Or when Silverstein Diaz's bandits try to be friendly with friends. Magic from Diego Peretti is what we will get there. He himself has given a psychiatrist, "Loco de Amor", a performance of the plan, but is influenced by all its range. Lewis Luke, on the other hand, looks at the track with the leading screenplay, which he reminds our great actors. <br /> <br /> This is a passion for me, and as I said, I can write about it for hours, but unfortunately it does not work and I have to be precise and summarized. Although I have to watch old movies and study them, I can make sure that the "Tempo de Valentes" comedy is waiting for Argentina and will never get it? until now.
