This was the behavior when this event was a new, innovative and original show. This makes me watch every show that I ever saw plainly annoying. In the first phase I entered the first moment and I was easily connected to all the characters (which would never happen because I always hate some characters). It is a sad fact that this show will not be the third season, because it should be one of the best shows and it will not increase my feelings for the show too much. Can not replace Pushing Daisies, because ABC may possibly replace this show? This is easily the best show on television. <br /> <br /> I came for Christine Chanoyette and I stayed because I fell in love with the whole event.
