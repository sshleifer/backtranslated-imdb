Just came out of a punch preview for this photo. It laughs me every 30 seconds. The end was so funny that tears roamed in my face and I did not want to buy bigger crows. There definitely has some lulls, but overall, extremely entertaining. The movie has got the opportunity to kiss Steve Carroll's "Bruce Almighty" Jim Carrier and the spotlight "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferre "Amnesty: The Legend of Ron Bergready". Paul Rud is always as pleasurable. I can be so much fun in these wide comedies and work in Indie plays (like PSS). I think Seth Rosen would get more work because she is so freaking talented and engaging. The value of Leslie was some incredible fun moments. I highly recommend it for those who want to laugh like a patience. However, if you're easily offended, do not see this movie. If you are a barbaric feminist, do not see this movie. And, please, no matter, even if you think that you are one of the "hip" parents, do not take your kids to this movie. Of course, your teenager should see this movie, just do not show it to them. It will make for some incredibly awkward moments.
