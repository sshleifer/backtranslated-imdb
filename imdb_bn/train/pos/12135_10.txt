Each motion picture cost Bette Davis to face the stars. Prior to Davis co-stars with Leslie Howard in "Human Bondage", she was more on movies. Davis was "looted" in the 1935 Oscars for his role as legendary son Mildred Rogers's candid mother and impressive lover-user Westchester. The story is to give AFI Davis its first Oscar after playing "1st Hazardous" Joyce Heath. I think Davis' fans of Human Bondage, who agree with the Oscar-Robbing legend, will be against my criticism of the 1934 film, for which AFI has not rewarded its performance and the 1936 film "Dangerous" performance. For which he received his first Oscar in 1937. <br /> <br /> I tried to see Bate Davies' motion pictures, TV interviews, videos, WWII advertising and TV performance in the popular series. Finally, it's easy to recognize why this image "Human bondage" has given Davis the opportunity to nominate Davis for his performance. At the end of the film, at the age of 25, and to reach the red carpet in Hollywood. Due to his performance in "Human Bondage", public name Bate Davis was seen as a star. That's what makes his legendary performance. However, Roku also saw greatness in his "The Man Who The God Goud" and lend him to Warner to play Rogers. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go with AFI, in Haydite, after 41 years, Davis is a great decision to award his first Best Actress Oscar for "dangerous" after two years. By doing this, AFI may be able to achieve the best of Hollywood's most talented 20th-century actors. Because, from "Human bondage", Davis knew a little bit that he had to reach deep inside for his golden idol performance. Undoubtedly, he has received more than 2 Oscars; Probably 6. as 6. 6. <br /> <br /> "Dangerous" Davis provides an example contrast to the depth of the acting character. Because, it is "dangerous" (1936) that he has become the greatest actor of the 20th century. Like Davis Joyce Heath, he died in red carpet. In "Human Bondage", Davis is ready to turn off the right side of the edge, still on the street side and the rest of the 60-year-old career. <br /> <br /> In 1935, instead of giving birth to an exceptional Oscar, inspiration was given to an actor to surpass Stardom in his soul to perform the greatest work performed by the actor. <br /> <br /> It is well known that his contemporary colleague Yogen Crowford was; A star whose performance still does not measure up to Davies. Even Anna Nichol Smith was also a 'star'. Howard Staron is also a radio host 'Star'. Lots of people and silver screen layers. Some became great actors. What is the difference between them is that Bate Davies understands: the difference between a desire to be a great actor or a star. <br /> <br /> Try to compare these two movies. The other Maybe you know what AFI and I do. Davis was at one point of time, becoming the greatest actor of the 20th Century and achieves his goal at 27 years of age. For the next 50 years, he spent so much time on the bar that it was not reached. . . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If AFI sends him a message to reach "human chain", Davis might become a great actor in his life, instead of becoming a star-dark-dom.
