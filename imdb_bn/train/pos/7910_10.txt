When this first came out, my father came home - we were surprised at it - different from what we saw earlier. I was looking for a particular movie last night, and again I found 'The Minds Eye'. The box is completely broken, and the tape is still working! Although this is not a 'Nemo Finding' quality graphics, it's still very good. They should be sold again - it's a landmark for computer animation images. Highly recommended!
