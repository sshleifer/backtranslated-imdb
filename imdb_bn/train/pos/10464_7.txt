For those of you who do not speak Swedish: The title of this [Swedish] title; "Ronnera" translates something into "The Robbers" line. This picture is my main problem, because it is not really about the robbers. This is a young girl working for the Swedish police robbery search It seems like a regular desk job, but this girl is going to take some of her own hand, as the story goes, even shoots the robbers by shooting them ... OK: we've seen it before. Instead of halfway through the platform, it does not really help in an interesting interesting curve, it works as a first two-thirds of the film's review. <br /> <br /> Does it protect from another mainstream? The film is executed efficiently in all ways, which are as great as the actors and they do not neglect fairly and the director really turns it into thrillingly thrilling adventure. /> <br /> One thing I really love about this picture is that the music sets the right mood when it is needed, but is absent for the rest of the time, which gives real good reality to the shootouts and spreads across the car wheel. A nice touch! Michael Persebrand is one of the few Swedish actors who has often been typed in. It tragically hits the film, as you know he is not just going to play a heroine boyfriend and may be a back-up character in the background, but it will have to neglect something like this <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
