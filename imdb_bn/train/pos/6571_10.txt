<br /> <br /> First thing I have to say is that I have jake speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most fun movies ever made. Pictures started with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family did not hear anything. As well as Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crowford) comes, his sister is right and offers to find out. Jack is a hero of speed. He does not work for money because he simply wants to help and do a good adventure. His companion (Dennis Christopher) followed him around him and wrote his literature in novels. This picture is a great adventure. It's ridiculous, it's action-packed, it's just great. I guess it's a ritual movie with a very small worship following it. Crowford is perfect like Jack Speed ​​and you throw some one-fishing machine that you never forget. Coppin and Christopher respectively, daughter and lateral as well. In John Hearts, the belly belly of the man, the devil makes distorted villian fun. In many ways, this film is like Indiana Jones, in some ways it's like James Bond films. Perhaps it should be called Indiana Bond, but it's a very enjoyable movie, whatever it's titled.
