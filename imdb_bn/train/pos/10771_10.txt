In Monte Carlo, a few runs, American Mitti, Cycle Shepard and Jim Belushi, starring John Kenney, Richard Lewis, some other beautiful European positions and this is quite interesting. Everyone's problem is great, despite lying to protect themselves, and I recommend you watch this movie, it's valuable! John Candy once top offense as the top form, as everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family film, this is your ticket. Everyone gives quick acting, great acting, great comedy and great time, which is rare in movies this day. Great plot, great mystery, (which I love anyway) and overall, the value you spend is good. So to get kids, take some popcorn, juice, or tea, or soda, and enjoy the show !!!!
