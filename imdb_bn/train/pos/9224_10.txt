This movie is apparently stunning. He can not work or who care. Each scene collected by John Derek and is a work of captive industry. Location, set designs and costumes work perfectly to be found in a love story made up of beauty, youth and wealth. In some ways I want to watch this movie as a tribute to John and Bo Derek's story. And ... this comment will not be complete without mentioning Anthony Quinn's role as illustrations of parents, counselors, lover, and men, when males were lost in a great era when men were male. There are some of us who find confidence and strength in the sense of self-confidence, protection, and security that contribute to a sense of security. Yes, they do not make such people! But how many times have you discovered women like Bo Derek?
