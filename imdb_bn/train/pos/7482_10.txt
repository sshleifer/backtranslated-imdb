"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderful thought out movie. Or rather, "Abros los ozos" is a good idea. I saw a movie late in the night, excited about what's coming. I was not frustrated. At the end of the movie I was scary. I could not get it off my mind. The whole idea of ​​just blew me away. In the end, Shyamalan was a wonderful than what could ever do. The plot line was also something to keep me interesting through and through. Cast, pretty. It was an almost wonderful movie. You can see the type of film again and always find something new. I saw it four or five times and I have always found something new. It's always a movie to keep you interested in it.
