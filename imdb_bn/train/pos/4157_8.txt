This is the first animation movie that was a good movie that I once caught in the science fiction channel when actually in Anime was actually popular in America and adult swimming claims that it is on the cartoon network. I think it's fairly low with less popularity and more people will now see the DVD episodes ineffective on the Internet. Although probably there were not many cuts and voice work in this film, it was right for a dubbed movie, though I would like to see the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use daredevil rather rather annoying voices for some children. The film brings a young boy who runs a train called Galaxy Express, which hopes to create a planet whose technology will make him robot. He wants to become a robot for his mother's revenge, who is brutally murdered by a robot, who is a victim of fun. During his courage, he got friends with a train worker and a pretty lady like his dead mother, who was secretly with most women in anime movie, which could be really good for our young hero, or really bad. The train creates several stops and moves into a space pirate named Asteroid Heartlocked, which apparently has played in its own animated cartoon series, so the galaxy express is mainly performed in the universe. All is a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected end. There will be a signal for this, but it was not as good as it was, but it was more final than the end.
