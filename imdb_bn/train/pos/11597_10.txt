I've read many comments, I've shared this movie to remember and feel very bad to see it again but I do not know the name of this movie. Thankfully, due to finding titles and looking for titles on this site, I've read the comments here and understood that I remember this movie. I then made a search and found the film and after 40 years I was so excited to watch the movie. Because of this site and your comments, you helped me and so I would like to thank all of you. I want to share how I found this picture, who are looking for a copy for you. It was in the VHS version of Venus World of Disney's "Wide It Courage", out of which there are two movies, the second is "The Legend of the Boy and Eagle". It touched me 40 years ago and now owns my own copy. I think it is available only on VHS. I found it eBay and I saw a few copies here. Enjoy it, I know I did it! <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful story about a boy's love and a wonderful story about the cow he cared about. At the time of the sacrifice of the cow, the boy freed the eagle because he did not allow him to kill. After forced to release the cows after the cow forced them to leave the tribe, the eagle also saved the life of the child and even more, taught him to live. The boy and the eagle were so running on the thighs and the filming was really amazing. This was a wonderful era. I have not seen anything in this movie come even closer!
