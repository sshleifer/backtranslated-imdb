Dressed to Toss (1980) is a mysterious horror movie from Brian de Palma and it really works. The environment is fine. The environment that makes you scared. And it's not a horror movie that should not be. All the actors are in the right places. Michael Kine Dr. Perfect like Robert Elliot, narrow with a little secret. Annie Dickinson as Cutie Miller, mature women who are disappointed with women are very horrible. Keith Gordon is bright like his son Peter. Like Alice Allen Black Call Girl is fantastic. Dennis Franz plays his ideal intelligence role. This Detective Marino is the most colorful one in this movie. There are many amazing scenes in this movie. The lift scene is one of them. This has been made and compared to Alfred Hittak's Psycho (1960). There are some similarities between these two films. These two movies may be somewhat sleepy.
