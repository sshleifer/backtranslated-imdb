I adored this movie. Not only am I the big fan of Moritz Blebretre, although he is actually all German filmmakers. But because he is not the main actor. The only reason for seeing 2001's Juliet, who took the leadership of Barnaby Mitzurut and actually carried the film on her shoulder <br /> <br /> A family comes from Italy to Germany in Germany's quest for dreams. (This is my own innovation and ironic ...) Cheap Labor in Steel and Coal Industry. However, they ended up opening a restaurant, and the way this movie is traveling at the moment is so poetic, as well as funny and charming. From this point, the story mainly refers to the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Blayberue) and Gigi (Maternity). Gigir's dream of being a filmmaker competes with his brother and is threatened by his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a great - and completely neutral - see what life can create by what you like. Finally, this film is not a life (Gigi or Zyngaerlo) was more successful or fuller or more interesting. It involves a rewarding glimpse of what will be the identities of the identity of the two countries and the mentality involved. And this view is not driven by hatred or dishonor in a country, it creates a great movie that conflicts with any migration from any country. In the 70th year, director Fateh Akin has come from Turkey to Germany, gave the film a large measure of its credibility and mental accuracy. The icing on the cake is fantastic performance by casting completely, especially Metschurat and - this is what I really needed - small boy who plays small gigi. Children's performance is hard work to follow only by someone! Great movie, go see it.
