A ridiculous and insightful perspective on the dating world is illustrated this off-bit comedy by the first time writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The four male heroes publish this story at the local diner at the weekend to suffer their dating. We meet Brad: A beautiful look, fast-intelligent and sharp-tongued tongue; wall-street players; Zeek: A reproach, sensitive writer; Jonathan: A sexual malicious nice guy with a feeling for arm cream and masturbation; And Eric: The married man, who hopes to have some disgusting marriage and some illumination of his married life, is concerned about his weekly face-to-face with his single friends. The trials and tragedies of men's single living in New York have been very ridiculously highlighted, City In Sex and Hubbard's New Comedy The Mind of Buy Man's Reflections and a Light Illumination for Scamming. The story takes a turn that combines with three singles Mia Mia - amazingly played by Amanda Pett and everyone is read for it. He removes them with their amazing powers to adapt each person to their personality. When they realized that they met the same woman and had fallen, they chose her on their friendship. Whipped dating is a realistic illustration of the world, one that critics have failed to recognize. In plain language, they missed the point. The hero here is the caricatures of the real people. Ambitious violent, satire and humility are not mixed, and as critics' disagreement offers are not as serious. Watch this movie, you laugh to finish from the beginning.
