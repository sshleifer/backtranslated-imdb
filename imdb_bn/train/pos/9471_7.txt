Steve Carroll newspaper apologized to Dan Barnes and three daughters to single parents In a big family, Daniel Dan meets his perfect woman, only in search of his brother's relationship. <br /> <br /> What a man can do <br /> <br /> I rather like "Dan in Real Life", but imagine that Steve Carle is willing to take a relatively straightforward and restrained partnership in any part, Instead of making broader comedy movements, you have succeeded in making this success or otherwise putting this flicker down so much that made him so successful. If you can not accept it, do not be afraid, "get smart" will be later in the year, but for the record I think he was very good. <br /> <br /> "Dan in the Real Life" you have started like, usually, amusing, family drama, but it goes along as it gets funnier and funnier and increases Carell's frustration with his situation. It's not original at all (but if you've only seen movies with the original ideas, then the film is really rare, would not it?), But "Real in Dan in Real Life" is entertaining, and a good cast (who does not read the meaning of love and An insightful script that gives a lot of thought to emotions, which falls in love with the greatest philosophy.) <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Karel shrugs himself And will again give something as interesting.
