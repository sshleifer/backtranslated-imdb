Filo Vance (William Powell) helps solve multiple murders in a wealthy person after dog shows. <br /> <br /> I usually hate the very rich mystery (but I like this movie). It's very fast (only 72 minutes), it's run smoothly by Michael Cartridge (he uses most of the camera tricks which only increases the speed of the story), this is a very impressive story line (the solution of a locked room killing that was simply incredible ) And have a very good throw. <br /> <br /> Powell is very civilized and like Van - he does not seem to act - he's vans! Mary Astor has not been given much, but she adds class and beauty to production. Everyone else is very good, but Eugene Pallette as the best DJ Heath is the best of all. She was very nice actor with a very distinct voice and her line was lovely. <br /> <br /> Basically, a wonderful 1930s Hollywood murder mystery. Looks good <br /> <br />
