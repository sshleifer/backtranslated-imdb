I wanted to see Valentine because I saw that Dennis Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they acted in some of my favorite movies. When I saw Valentine, I was surprised to see how wonderful the story line really is. It looked at me that it received a low rating because it was not very dangerous. Actors and actresses have played a part in the wonderful, and the way to end it was so bright and intelligent. Some scenes were a little incredible and poor, and I admitted in some minor parts it was a bit annoying, but overall it was non-entertaining and suspicious. It was a mind-breaking story line that guessed you the whole way and it gets all the nonsense. I recommend recommending this movie anytime, but especially on Valentine's Day, because it is sure to give you a ton of winter. Oh, and even do not pay attention to the trailer or rating, please, do not ...
