It is a famous film by John Cromwell, who is not a great director, but made some fine films, including the 1937 edition of 'Jedna of Prenner'. Setting up in London that can only be operated by Hollywood, nothing like the atmospheric but the real thing, it is the story of inspiration and strong love from the Somerset Mahan novel. I was looking forward to seeing it as a DVD I had never seen it before, and because of Bate Davies's great fondness, he wanted to consider her the best one at the first. So I bought it. Well she looked fine but I'm sorry to say that her London cuckold accent just let me smile. Bate Davis was the greatest film actor, he did not make any mistake, but here he did one. It was impossible to take his character seriously. Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppies' cocaine accent but close. It was <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another big role was Leslie Howard and she did pretty well. He was a subtle and intelligent actor, supporter of actor himself separating well. Observing observer despite Ms Davis' vocal gymnastics.
