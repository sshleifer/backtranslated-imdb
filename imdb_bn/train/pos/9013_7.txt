Although there are some weaknesses in this movie, it is valuable to watch. I chose this because of cast, praising Bonahom Carter and Branag for choosing a different role than those I've played in the past. Both represent a very annoying person, who is perfect with Mart, but makes them liked because of their humanity. The story is touching, but it's upwards that performance. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a remarkable achievement, for which my eyes are open to look for romance, which I did not think before, but it was also interesting for other reasons. I think the movie has gone very suddenly, but it is better than an emotionally manipulative ending (see "stepmom.") The very real English setting has been added to my delight - it was 90%.
