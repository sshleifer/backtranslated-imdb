An explanation of what makes a great movie for me first. Encourage to know what is coming next, for the first time I will enjoy watching any movie (Case at Point: Twister). Good humor (Uncle Buck and the Great Outdoors John Candy), in Resolution (madalaina and matilada), fantastic story (all Star Wars episodes - George Lucas Man), and good music (and all the Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound Off Music). At least six times in the theater can I watch a movie and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characters. That said, I present to Cindy Lou Ke and Grinch. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carey. The rest was very good, especially Jeffrey tembara, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Krisatina baranaski, and Josh Ryan Evans. However, the singles scene with Syndy and Greenchoo together is nice and very fun and / or hearty. Why Cinema is one of the most attractive reasons for my favorite character and cartoon in the film Cindy Lou? Grinch is a strong plot, good conflict, and a very good theme (I can not start because I do not want to hide it). Gene Carey was very funny like Greynch - especially when he contacted Cindy. And music! How nice! Nice music by James Horner I liked her selection of her instruments and composition. Great job Jim Carey - I do not know you can sing. Taylor Momsen! Oops! The reason enough is to watch the movie at least once on your voice. Your Exclusive - Where Are You Christmas - Is Your Voice Really Worth As High? Sounds like a F # It's a porn range for a 7-year-old (supposed to be the best possible way to non-sectarian). Great job This is the best performance by a child I've ever heard of in a movie (Taylor von Trap beats a child-no small achievement!). And now the actor. Jim Carey is amazing, funny, and, surprisingly very sensitive (this is really shown through his view with his Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen's unclear expression (one of the best acting performance secret) is very strong-he really becomes Cindy Lou. And when he talks, he is stronger. <br /> <br /> *************************** danger: spoiler alert *********** ********** *************************** ************* For example ******************************* <br /> <br />: at first the expression Grinch. This is a classic quote ( "You are," and then grinaca line "r r r r grinaca with the full" by the grinaca was found after he went sortare). "Thank you for saving me" and the next response by Grinch was very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this movie is when Cindy Greenchas invites the Holiday Chemistist. This scene shows two excellent actors and each other with their best interacting. Little Taylor Momsen occupies this place completely with Jim Carrie. I sincerely hope we will see Taylor Momsen in many more films. Everything was great in all these movies (probably except for the feet and noses).
