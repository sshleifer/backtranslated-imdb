The National Gallery of Art has released the original version of the film's long thought on July 10, 2005. This release restores vital scenes cut by sensors. In the original sensor release of 1933, Koblar's character is presented as a moral good-natured person who has been presented as a follower of philosopher Nissez and urged men to use men to move to the top spot. Also, I guess the true end of the original has been removed in the current VHS version and the last one has been restored in its original form. Seduction and power is a wonderful film. Hopefully, the movie's reproduction of this movie will appreciate everyone's great qualities. Looking for it.
