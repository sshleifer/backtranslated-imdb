I've never seen the best movie about this bulimia. What is Bullymia and what it is not always about skinny and dieting, it hits the right place. It shows how people in Burmese started to think about things like life, friends and their views on themselves. The best line and the part that really looks like what's the problem of Bulimia, Beth says, "It's not about you!" That line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. It shows that anyone in Boulimia has no problem with anyone else. It is only with them and them. It shows that the time has come to talk to the person rather than focus on your time. It shows that Bett was required to pay attention to that moment and at that time his mother's attention was needed.
