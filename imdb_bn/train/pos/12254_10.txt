After watching Paltrow's version I saw this movie. I found that good one, and I thought it would not be good ... but I was wrong: the British version was so good and enjoyable! I think Jeremy Northam is more "recognized" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong has a lot of catch in Austen's knight. However, both versions are good, but anyone who likes the book of Asten, should watch this movie. I agree with * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Andrew Davies has changed some things, but is still faithful to the core. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
