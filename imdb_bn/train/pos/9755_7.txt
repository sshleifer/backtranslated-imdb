Last time I saw the movie about seven years, so my opinion could be awake over time. At that time I enjoyed the painting that switch between cartoon and live action. At that time I was sorry for the blue camel and his sad life. Even after capturing Captain Consigius's heroine (a princess or a toy shepherd), I felt that her table was moving around her. Unfortunately, the producers never decided to transfer the film to VHS, so I'm 20 years old. I am sure that if I have seen the movie again, I think it is crazy and sad, but I enjoyed the movie at that time.
