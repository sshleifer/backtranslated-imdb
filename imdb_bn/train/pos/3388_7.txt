NYC, 2022: Green house effect, invisible ocean, unemployment and lack of water, electricity and food etc. And the population of New York has increased by 40 million. This is not a small jewel of a photo, because we have a real-time future for a 21st-century citizens, a reality. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> An unspoiled American veterinarian is developing a contaminated and crowded hell in less than 2 minutes. Clear and clear, it's really memorable. Budget constraints are behind unlike movies and other obstacles, rather than contradicting the brightest premises of the story. Sequence of police station is like an episode of about 70 TV spy shows, and other interior sets can be seen in the best possible direction. Perhaps the budget probably tried to 'predict' the SWOT executive's 'Chelsea West' apartment with state-of-the-art products, which means the other dresses are full, i.e. some established shots are used oddly neutrally and all of the extrinsic ones are shot in one by day. Smoke filter. The memorable scene where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Haston) has shared their food with expensive and rare food items: They enjoy real meadows, lettuce, celery, tomatoes, apples and beef. , And we really feel the feeling of their lips and screams for others' rich privileges. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Reminds to the creature, with the horrifying feeling of junkydust Thorn, the opposite is contrary to the future that has been deprived, in another fear. <br /> <br /> This is a smart film and its main message is today as it was in the early 70's. Yes, I know that we are not yet dead, but permanent predictions of 'Swant Green' can be passed with the destruction of our property-ratios, poverty reduction, corporate global capitalism, and unelected habitat of climate change.
