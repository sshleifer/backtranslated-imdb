I first saw this movie on television some years ago and apparently like it. Charles Dancing makes one of the most awesome villains one can imagine. Such a perfect contrast to his sophistication crudely good hero. I have never been a fan of Eddie Morphy, but here's a bizarre screenplay found here: "Axel Folly The the Looking Glass". The Charlotte Lewis Hackney phrase is to use, but only one applicable, brilliantly fantastic. Some scenes are wonderfully designed: the sequence of dreams, birds, stupid war scenes and climatic clashes. Through it, Murphy is the modern man who suddenly falls into an astounding and silent version of an oriental myth, in his territorial fantasy Robert's Cart Russell. Like that movie we have James Hong, a wonderful actor whose scenery, but short, even enhances the Derek's quality. Since 1955, Hong Kong has defined the best actor actor of his career, the "Class Act". "Golden Child" is stupid; It's not perfect; But it's an enjoyable and fun fantasy, so there are many redeeming features that worth watching. Four years later I saw "Golden Child"; I enjoyed it more! It's really great fun.
