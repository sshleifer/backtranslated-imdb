Good luck even for watching this movie - it has not yet been released to tape or DVD. I was released in the early 70's, was lucky enough to catch up with American Sinametak's efforts to preserve it, and it is still a few real moments that had been with me for thirty years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here are the exact comments. After the huge success of five simple PCs, Jack NK's low budget effort as the out-of-the-box manager has been described as best as possible, and it must be seen in scary and distraught which can overcome anything. But it's a memorable icon for the time: 60s deadline collision with college sports, student movements, sexual revolution and more. <br /> <br /> Why see this image? It was probably a ground breaker in some scenes: after frisky male ties in the game shower; Karen Black's view with the tapers in the car will take you away from the watch - but this is the first word I have not seen before in the film; And the overall nudity is casual and unexpected use. Perhaps others are excluding me. <br /> <br /> One of her first films is to surprise a young Syndi Williams; Steven David Ogend Steers; Mike Warren came out of his powder-blue UCL uniform and was ready for dark blue TV uniform; Robert Town - actor; And many people just play themselves. <br /> <br /> Now: what is the last name of Harry Gates, Robert Town and Chinatown and a specific character of two Jake? <br /> <br /> <br /> It gets a "7" based on Karen Black.
