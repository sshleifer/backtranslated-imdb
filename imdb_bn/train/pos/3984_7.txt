As part of the celebration of Casino Royale's release, the film was shown with new bonds from director Roger Michael (Notting Hill). I turned it off almost being annoying, but I'm glad I stuck it. Originally May (Anne Reid) is Helen (Ana Wilson-Jones) single mother who rarely sees someone and did not have a boyfriend at the age of her age. Her daughter says she might want to marry her new lover Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). Just a few days after each other know, May and Darren have a secret matter. And with his age, 30-something, and new bond?! However, they obviously want to keep it secret, but if Helen knows Helen, she can express her pardon and surprise. When he got less trouble than Daren May. In fact, Helen allowed him to hit. Peter von as Toots, Diana Govic as Au gambler, Harry Mitchell as Harry, Rosie Michael and Roni and Johnny acted as English Oliver Ford Davis Bruce. very good!
