I like to give high ratings to Calcutta, but the show has become stupid due to the scary / suspicious of the show. ABC's fault They shifted to mourn Friday 8:00 pm, then known as "family hours". The first place should not have been on Friday. I was a sophomore in high school and loved the first episode! It was NBC's first woman in police. ABC was a big problem on Friday night. Barney Miller, Barrett and SWAT started their bad season for the first time in January. Kolchak was supposed to hit one. Darren McGuin begged to get out of his contract to finish the show. The very bad writing was not with Richard Matheanes in real TV movies. Yet, McGavin made Calcutta his own, the actors could do. Rocky Cromden like Ari Bunker and Jackie Gillon as Carol O'Conner thinks. It is strange and ancient that sets with the DNS manual typewriter and claying teletype, but it was part of the appeal. They were fortunate that Simon Oklahr has rebuilt "Vincenzo" from the TV movie.
