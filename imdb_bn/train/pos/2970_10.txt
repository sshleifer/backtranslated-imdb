I have found that the baseline is one of the most fun movies I have ever seen! This wonderful humor wanders me all the way, and Tray and Matt are so much at the top that this movie supports the comedy. <br /> <br /> I just bought a basetball in DVD and it's only a movie where you will not be tired to see it. I have a very low attention span and I think this film is so funny bit that it has kept me entertained throughout. Sunny quotes are memorable, and if I remember them later, I can smile for hours. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think baseline is a great movie that everyone can see, especially if you are young, then I will Will keep the smile for a long time. <br /> <br /> p. Does anyone think something strange for me? Hehe
