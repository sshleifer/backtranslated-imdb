Riding Giants is an incredible documentary that describes the history and stories of three influential big wave surfers, Greg Knoll, Jeff Clark and Layard Hamilton. Stasi Peralta has done an amazing job about the introductory role and congratulations on doing such brilliant work. The film has been brilliantly edited and works perfectly with descriptions, interviews, animations and surfing footage. Music Soundtrack only adds overall satisfaction to this movie, which creates bright viewing of the riding giants. Among the personal highlights, among which Greg Pull's comments are, with his straight-point-point-point, with the footage of Layhard Hamilton in Tehaputu, and out at the end of the film. But in reality this entire movie is a big, proposed highlights, which is highly recommended if you have a chance to see it. It is embarrassing that it is not very familiar, but it is worth a gem. 10/10
