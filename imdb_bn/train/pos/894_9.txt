This is my beloved Samo Hong movie, "Pradigal Sona" and "Eastern Condoras". Fat Dragon has spread to this end compared to "Condoras", but as a director or actor, he is definitely not sure. In fact, he is at the top of his form and has given a devastating, cruel worker who holds half a dozen amazing sequences and leads to a compassionate, sweet love story. Love and romance are not the guiding priorities here, but they act as a strange addition to the performances and ensure the viewers do not hit the fast-forward button in physical clashes. <br /> <br /> The first scene, which is a fun lap saber dual feature, set a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence which is chasing Sammo's pedicab by a car is pretty sharp and sweet with a sharp, humorous tone. Fast and flaming stick fight between Samo and Lau Car Liuong is a dazzling dance-style, and sharp, superb direction and easily one of the best types of its type. The film's violence gradually increased, eventually, when climatic showdown came, we were in some part of the most severe rebellion ever seen in the production of Samoan. Billy Chawy is a bone-cracking, physically disciplined entertainer in a house filled with angry and angry, angry opponents; <br /> <br /> One of the best martial arts films of all ages, and awesome. <br /> <br /> Great score too.
