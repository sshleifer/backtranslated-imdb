At first the cat soup seems to be a very random animated film. The best way I've been able to explain it is quite acidic. Although it is not completely random The story is about Nawata, a small cat boy and his sister Naako. The nuco is very sick and died, however, Nyatta is taking away her spirit by death and it is able to rescue half. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of it is a symbol of life, death and rebirth. You can see references from other stories like Hansel and Gralal. This funny little movie has an interesting story, which is full of deeper money than what you see on the screen page.
