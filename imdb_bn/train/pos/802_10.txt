I know I know it's a good end but sincerely it was great. I love when the movie ends in a horrible dark nature, but at this time I turned around the emperor and was fascinated with the direction of Delight Wader, I was really surprised. The film was suffering in pain while defeating and defeating Luke by Emperor / Diet Cedias. He will be destroyed when Shah's dark Lord Dr. Vidar removes his dark master. A nice sacrifice. Cinematography of this photo is fascinating. I am amazed by all ships of rebellious war ships and all the empire war ships and superstars. I like the new nation to take on the screen of Mon Calomari, ewoks, sullesteian (with Lando pilot) and much more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in the film: 1- When a decent eraser is destroyed and seriously injured. 2- When Oki sees Ob-vahan and Jodra's spirits and then it shows Anakin Skywalkar (Sebastian Shaw) (the greatest scene in Star Wars) when 3- When Lia-haw murders Jaba for being a criminal. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Post-Script: Layer Scene at Slavery Bikini is memorable. 9/10
