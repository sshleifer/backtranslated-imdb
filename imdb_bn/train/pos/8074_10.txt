Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is poor as anyone in the world. Living in the 1920's, part of the underground rebellion against Jimbo and his colleague Iristan tyrannical Bright. A special insurgent, wanted to kill English, returned to the town secretly. He thinks he can trust his friend's jipo, but the Â£ 20 prize is proven to be very tempting. Gypo died of his friend and sinks in a hole in despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile, other Irish rebels are searching for information providers. At the moment, jipo, by burning a hole in his pocket, by paying money, their main suspects, but they do not want to believe his friend. Informer's story is easy to plot, but its moral and mental problems are complex. It is easily one of John Ford's most passionate films. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand its purpose. We also understand his tragic character, and he has a lot of sympathy for him. The script is very suspicious, as well. This is such a mysterious event where we are sure that we know how to finish everything, so we have to hold down our teeth and bear with them. Acting is amazing. Victor McLaughlin has played most of Ford's films, probably giving his best performance here (and won Oscar for it). Other actors of the film are eligible for their kids. In addition to an amazing script and performance, Informer is one of John Ford's most evocative films. I love Ford's dark side. In addition to his mood, the Informer reminds me of my two favorite Ford movies, The LongVoice Home (1940) and The Fujitsiv (1948); In this case a little bit like this wine (1940). 10/10.
