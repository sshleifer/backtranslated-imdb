Apparently it was filming in the second restoration of this movie, 1911 and 1918. And, in many ways, it reminds me of the next movie, Anchorage at Yank. Two films cause distressed blow-hardness, one who is one of the world's leading schools, and both of them appear, eventually, gradually learning about teamwork and modesty. In this film, William Hannah "Tom Brown" and his main competitor, "Bob" Francis X. Bushman is played by. And, Jack Pickford in a helpful introduction - always remember as Mary's brother. From these three, Picford has made the best offer, like a sympathetic depression who has become Paul's Paul - in fact, in addition to some great scenes, a dramatic moment before the Big Games! All have standard clich√©s and movies, it has been so many times before and after, few wonders offer. In my opinion, for a good silent college film, try the Friedman of Harold Lloyd - its football scene is more exciting and Harold is much more favorite and annoying than Tom Brown. . Freshman is probably the best college photo of the era. Another reason why William Harness decreases in Harvard is that William Hynes has repeatedly played the same unexpected and bomber character with the same platform (like Westpunt and Smart Set among others) - and if you 'see one of these movies, you've seen them all. Well made, but certainly not the original! And, since it's just a rehearsal of its other movies, whoever gives this movie 10, they strongly recommend watching other movies. <br/> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and saw this small film was the highest rating movie in IMDB since 1920 !! Talk about more ratings! There are dozens and more good movies - how much does this movie estimate from # 1.
