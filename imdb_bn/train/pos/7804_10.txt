I keep watching over and over and watching this movie. I have to watch it at least once a week. I came from Africa and looked at the movie and learned something which I did not even know about Africa. Denzel's movie walks in life are all full of text for people. I wish she was my own brother. I saw and love your Masala Mississippi. What a thrilling situation. When Danjeel was trying to push his brother in the job, he reminded me of my younger age when my brother was busy and busy with himself. My brother was always caring for my father and he also wanted to see me in the same way. Where did you get African accent from Danzel Cree Freedom Movie? I first saw that movie in Africa and I do not know that Dangle was not American until I left here.
