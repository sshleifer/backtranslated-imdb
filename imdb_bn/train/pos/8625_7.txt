The zigzagragret many times goes far beyond his movies and themes, even for my taste, but his films are always special and difficult to classify. They are created artistically, often with deep meaning in his theme. This movie is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> Labeling this movie is really difficult. This is not actually a movie with a story, it's a start, middle and ending sense. It does not even have its main character, but instead there are 7 different days on 7 different suicides and murders. <br /> <br /> <br /> More 'attractive' and realistic than others. They are not necessarily connected but still together they tell a story. Movies do not feel discrete at all. It has a different feeling in all the different stories and the budget uses only the story (ideal for its style), but instead, the expressive emotions of images and letters will tell the whole story. It helps to make this movie an effective one to see. <br /> <br /> Again, the production values ​​are not too high and it can be something that some people might fear. But this movie helps to set the perfect tone and atmosphere for the whole movie and its dark, annoying and depressing themes. <br /> <br /> A nasty picture that I saw. <br /> </ br> 7/10
