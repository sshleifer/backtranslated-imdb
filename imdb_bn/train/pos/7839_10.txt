Pans by critics but fans prefer, this film has now turned into a classic. Mark Lohan's home, Mc Bolan and T. With the live footage of Rex, John Lennon's house is visually shaken footage footage in any other place, this film is essential for everyone who does not like Marx Bolan, but gives an interesting insight into the era. <br /> <br /> <br /> This time, when Marx hobbled Beatles with Ringo Star [who pointed it out] and you can find a short spot from a reggae dite [Elton John you] bashing. An amazing [and officially released] version of Titu Frutti and Ivoris in Rocking and Ballad versions of revolution children. <br /> <br /> Chelita Sikunda [like 'Glam Rock created' using Gletters etc], Mickey Finn and even Katju's actors !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finds a string section and acoustic versions of classics such as Get It On and Sliders. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended! Five stars [five out] <br /> <br /> Rory
