Damien Siegfern's second immersion in the film after the film's research of the amazing character of "El Fando del Mar" He has done a very good job with "Tempo de Valentes", from many prototypes and among them an outstanding chemistry. I saw Szaphron's talent presenting each character in a light heart, but enough is enough for us to engage with them. His control over them is great, so he restores the polished script in a great way in the film and brilliantly, the letters cry with laughter and the real feeling, and invites the audience to join them in their emotions and screen on their evolution. <Br/> <br /> It takes a Spanish-English, Buenos Aires Irish urban landscape that replaces the Hollywood set in the night and the premiere is any other fun, so we have a bold movie to compete on Hollywood equipment. <br /> <br /> But I want you to see the movie mainly because I have never treated such respectful characters. It seems that the script is completely acting and against the actor. I really believe with making this competition a film like this Argentina.
