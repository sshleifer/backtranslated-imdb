I prefer this movie because it is basically more with less. It may have been more interesting if they restricted it to the studio (although some plot components were difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The guy who did the DJ play was doing well and spooked out his spooked and frustrating looks. I got her conversation with callers quite funny. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/ <br /> <br /> I thought it was the smallest ghost story for most parts, focusing on the living side of the equation. Last 5-10 minutes was done nicely, everything was being published. <br /> <br /> It was a short movie, but the story was just right. Any and it will start to pull.
