This movie is one of the all time sleepers. I gave it a 10 rating. The story was famous from Missouri's famous 'Bushwakkar', which fought on the south side of the war between the United States. The clothes they were wearing were authentic, history and why they fought very well and were researched. Actually there was a fight that they did not show ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well cast and the actors were the most brighter or the directors really know how to get good from them. I suspect that this is a great guide, super-casting, finding the right people and the extraordinary performance of the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie is really gel! It has actions, romance, mystery, good boys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your personal perspective) and history has rolled into a movie all over. There's even Spiderman and Jewel in the future. And he's good!
