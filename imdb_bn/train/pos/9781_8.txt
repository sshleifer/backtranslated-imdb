I initially heard the ink tears, a little back and it seemed like I'd go in, but I was coming regularly with all the pictures, it stopped my radar. While traveling around the local Wanderer ... I saw this box and presented it. I said I am very happy. Ink's Tears is a weird, poor, sometimes obscure obscure film that is somewhat compressed by the budget - but it's still a fun and appropriate surveillance. <br /> <br /> The Tears Taylor-Ericsson group group of fictional India-based ink centers, which practice meditation and other rituals in the face of internal and internal aspects of the person - but apparently these strategies do very well or are not good enough (your Depending on the viewpoint ...) The army is not only exposed to darkness, but also attack the victims of kidnapping. Is. <br /> <br /> This film is called the "little story" style, with the "short stories" and "eyes open", and then three stories that make up a large part of the film. <br /> <br /> The first (Shock) is a journalist who visits a civilized member of a psychiatric hospital. Journalist Taylor-Eriksson entered the cover of the study of culture, but we see that his true motives can be closer to the house. Violent changes occurred in the interview, the journalist finds that he is stuck on his head ... <br /> <br /> In the second part (Goddess) expresses concern about a violent youth, who is punished for emotional rehabilitation, a young man in a coma A prison sentence for killing We see that the specialist doctors are actually Taylor Ericson "ex-student" and its rehabilitation methods are far from the norm ... <br /> <br /> The last story (ink) is turning around a crow, "Believing" and his assistant Perform a "miracle" for a fee. When the healer unintentionally helps one of his clients and expelled an army that actually holds him, then the monster is now traveling around and open for a new host ... <br /> <br /> I've really enjoyed the ink's thirteen . There are some flaws in the film which can be really nice - but what is it for an original and ambitious movie? My biggest poor poor and unknown dubbing conversation with the production Dubbing is a sub-par and I want to select a subtitle option with the original language track. Some critics say poor acting, which I essentially disagree with. I think dubbing is so scarcely impressive that it feels performance stunt, which is not really. In fact, some of the amazingly cheerling performances ("Doctor" in second section and "Client" in the third thinks easily ...) and notable. Cow Fox works very well for low-budget films, some graphic scenes of eye-removal-through-chic-scissors, a pencil-in-the-throat-suicide, some decent (but excitedly "cone") self-flowing, and some Other Goodies thrown for better measurements. Some more "extreme" cow's films are rough as rough as anything, but your average horror is definitely stronger than renting fare. I found a welcoming change in the story of religious group in the curiosity of the curious and general horror stories. There are lots of real atmosphere and tension scenes, I have not been involved in anything. Although some fundamental ways are defective, I still think the ink tiers will appeal to most "underground" horror visitors - some scenes can prove too much for more mainstream viewers. Definitely recommend - 8.5 / 10
