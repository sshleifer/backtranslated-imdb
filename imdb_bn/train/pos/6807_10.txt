I have been a classic of these two movies where Robert Blake is a great actor, where most of the 1967 film Blake has shown his childhood life standing in a prison in a prison where he killed Clauter family because many of the classics of what really happened show that none of the actual killings I did not say it is a two Closer surveillance, if you look at the 1996 film, the classic cold blood creates a lot of senses.
