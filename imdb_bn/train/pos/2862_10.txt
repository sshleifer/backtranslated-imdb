My comment is usually limited to the first season, 1959-60 <br /> <br /> This spectacular series was the first person on color television, and it was very influential to persuade Americans that they had a color television set, which was about 800 in 1959 The dollar was, equivalent to $ 3,000 today. How many of us will pay for the privilege of watching a show sent by the cathode ray tube in 17 inch screen? I was eleven when the series started, and I saw it from the beginning. It is now seen, after 50 years, I miss a number of things. Firstly, most of the lines of the story are comestruct load and silver mining organizers, which are in the date of 1859. Arms and costumes for most of 1859 are not authentic. (The ointment has gone out of the discussion.) It is basically a nicotine. <br /> <br /> And Ben was not able to reach Lake Tahoe in 1839, and 100- square miles in the next twenty years. By the end of 1832, pioneers were still trying to solve the problem of Sierra Nevada, and the Gold Rush did not even begin even after two years. <br /> <br /> Indian actors do not play dramatic American actors. John Ford is using the Native American actor of the 1920's. Bonanza producers can be easily completed after 30 years. This is a big nitpick for me. <br /> <br /> There are other timelines problems. In Season 1, Mark Twain is displayed, and he is portrayed as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was a 24-year-old in 1852. The stories were more suitable for the period 185-1860 (Pre-Civil War) and the 1880 period. There is continuous continuation, over over. <br /> <br /> Take a little bit of this, that in the first season there have been so many killings. At the time, the assassination is reduced. <br /> <br /> Many episodes take socially liberal slots, which will be difficult to believe, have been given time, but credit for the authors' credit changing expectations. The attitude of the nation started in the 1960s <br /> <br /> Not everyone is saying, acting is good, and I'm finished in the last years that Adam's character was better than anyone else. I think Parnell Roberts never received his credit. Also, season 1 strengthens the issue that Dan Blaker (Hos) is a good actor <br /> <br /> Identifies the true historical facts of many stories. Guest stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> This was a great family entertainment and the series stood very well in any way.
