This image is a legendary song from the Wild Bill Hikk. She, Bill Billy Cody, and Pen Jane, central character. <br /> <br /> As soon as the civil war has closed, Lincoln has mentioned his concern that if the people's advice will be developed, the country's dynamism will be enhanced, "West-West, young man," that is, mercifully, the film wrongly attributes to Greeley Greeley, others Many did as it did. But then, he is murdered, and some moneylenders think they can get rich selling arms to American Indians. In <br /> <br />, we see the Wild Bill Hikk, who is in contact with a small boy, and a steamboat load on a dock along with Missmipi. Wild Bill uses a bovie knife, which eventually calls him the boy "Arkansas Toothpick", which was really a different knife, though both used across the border. <br /> <br /> Hick eventually meets Buffalo Bill Codey, who looks closer to actual people's pictures and painting. Cody is just married, and her wife is coming to sit in the Old West. <br /> <br /> When they reach their destination, they have crush on Halok, they know the clay. He sees Kodi's wife and asks Buffalo Bill, "Is this your mope?" There was a reason for the Line Heis Board to have some problems, the definition of "Mopsy" was prostitution. Demil wanted the line, and one of his associates said that Peter Rebeit was in Beatrix Potter's books, there were three rabbits Floppsy, Mopsy and Quantellel. He points to this and asks the sensor to identify "the rabbit of illness". It worked; Stay in line. <br /> <br /> Indians were being separated, because partners got surgical from them from the agents of the previous fund. Kodi and Hikkak were asked to help to scout the area, so that the soldiers could safely get through an undisclosed area. Cody led the armies; Hikak went to check the activity of an Indian chief, who was an old acquaintance, and who was leading some hostile Indians. <br /> <br /> The pen is captured by Jane, and Hikk is trying to save her. They were brought to the chief, and even though they did not speak, the hiccup was tortured, the frustrating accident is that the pen breaks the will of Jane's will and says that way using caddy. <br /> <br /> Two are released, and join the Hikk codehi. And his forces, to warn them they're walking in a trap. With the help of Hikoc, they stopped the Indian attack. <br /> <br /> Hikk decided to go after a gun run and finally captured them. They are waiting for the authorities, while shooting the card while shooting the hikk was shot dead. <br /> <br /> There are numerous historical exceptions in the film, but it holds the legend of the legend. Very good for the 1930s.
