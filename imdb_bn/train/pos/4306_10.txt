After a decade I could think of the movie, actually the volume of this movie could say. It proves to me the grand canyon as a movie that will touch you one way or the other. I really believe that the movie was the Grand Canyon before the crash. In my opinion, the main difference between the two films is their release time. I'm not going to argue what's good, but I'll share the same opinion that I'll fight against this idea. I'd like to hear from those who have opinions on this issue. I'll start a comment that you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can find me to post any other post about movies you can share because I have genuine love for movies.
