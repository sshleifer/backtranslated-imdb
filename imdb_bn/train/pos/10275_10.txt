Get ready for: It's always one of my favorite movies. I'm not unexpected about the other work of David Maitre (author and director), but I've seen this image half a dozen times (it's always a pleasure to watch), I can say without any hesitation that he is a genius. This image is very well-written, and attracts you quickly with the hype, Con-Artisti and Back Room Hustle's Millions. The feel of the movie is very similar to Sting (1973) and it shows respect for the movie Nir. <br /> <br /> This is quite a psychological complex film and you definitely want to think about various plot twists and aims Shadow characters. It is sometimes somewhat predictable but frustrating climax is always exciting to watch. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> To play. I agree, but I think that's great in that role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this film, well, the latest movie of Mimit, like the Spanish Prison, because the end has to be even more impressive. Just come back and ready to be ready for a ride that comes dangerously close to the currents by a movie.
