This movie is really the problem of Clifhangin film! Stallone was always good! Michael Rucker puts an amazing performance and John Lathgo plays a nice villain! The music, especially the theme is fantastic! The film is acting and never ending! If you watch a Stallone fan then Cliffhanger, you will not be disappointed!
