The most moving and truly eye-opening documentary never made. I cried from the beginning, through the whole way through. If you see the show, you are immediately imprisoned by people's struggle to survive the pain, and we will be allowed to live. For the first time I heard the title, I was afraid to see this event, it was difficult for me to live every day in my life every year. I really felt for him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonie finds out her coffin. Can you imagine that work? Even more so, even though he suffered frustrating and uncomfortable pain, he still opened his charity. (Debra) is the only person to be truly respected and respected, he defines a role model, he was a true and credible hero!
