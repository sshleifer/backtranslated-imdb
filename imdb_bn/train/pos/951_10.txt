I know many people have a special interest in Dickens' story Alastair Sim version, but I could lose this 1984 edition for me. My wife and I own a copy of this movie in VHS, and we have seen it together before each Christmas. I have often commented that we can see it in Haloon because it is a very terrifying ghost story. <br /> <br /> Like a screw-typingstrust screw - it is fierce and nasty, making its transformation more miraculous and moving. I think it's patan there with its performance. Spirits are all effective, each one lazy than the end. Even after seeing the dark, floating, skeletal form of Christmas spirit, my spine decreases every year. And what a support cast! Especially David Warner, as the top form of Bob Crichit, as Susanah York his wife. <br /> <br /> I thought that this version came closer to the original story than the other - but I could be wrong, because even after a few years of reading it. Regardless, this is a terrific Christmas classic.
