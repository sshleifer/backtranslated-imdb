I bought it as B-side in the Omega Man DVD, saw this film sort by accident. The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - without the beginning, which was evidently inspiration 28 days later, the rest is just the elements of the TV movie. But Swallow Green is a whole other league. I bet one of this teritone's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film which I have never seen before. Hesson is going to sleep with "furniture" casually while discussing something unexpectedly! All those who survived a boat carrying mechanical excavators! A pastor is being confessed and shot by the conference. OK, because it has been done - but there are not many movies that are so consistent. And Heston and Edward G. Robinson hacking is going on? This is probably the most likely gay couple, or what? Thankfully, I saw this film without knowing the end - which is apparently rare. Then I saw it again, and enjoyed all those small elements to make long primary scenes. A very nice script - and very great set of things. Just when you thought you saw everything. . .
