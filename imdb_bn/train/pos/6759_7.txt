Sidewell Indyes, where Laura donated the world, is a well-known film directed by Otto Pringing. And this time, he got the same co-star: Dana Andr√©s and Jane Tienne It must be said that there is less support for the role of any supporting person at the Terni Undersea spotlight here. <br /> <br /> He played a tough, hard-headed forehead, which was very strong for a night until the Gogh killed one person deadly in the process of arresting him. When a car driver (Tom Tally) is in doubt, he begins to feel guilty as well as investigate the murder because he loves the cab girl (Zen Terni). Tirane, however, she looks very cute for the girl playing here and does not look fit to the intense background elements of the story. <br /> <br /> it went deeper and it was discovered that the murderer had a silver plate on his head as the hero of a war. In the end, it turns into a story of morality with Andrew developing conscience on his crime. <br /> <br /> It's a strong supporter cast, as well as an impressive performance film like Nir. A good entry to the silent, despite being strongly motivated by Premmingma, and despite a little mistaken view of his character, especially Andrews and Tearni.
