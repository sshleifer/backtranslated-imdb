This is really a great movie. Some songs have become immortal classic and dance by Fred and Ginger is sometimes their best. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After singing and dancing, one of the characters of the film works on the film. Really annoyed me why Randolph comments all the negative about Scott? I have seen this repeatedly because of his romance with Harriet Hillerd and the movie sub-plot. He adds this movie, he does not refrain from it. She has a winning personality and a great smile. Randy is my top ten favorite list of all time. He looks like something other than a cowboy. OK, so he's not really a great actor, but many other stars like: Errol Flynn, Allan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. He was very fond of and could top it in some shows. All of Fred and Adaa's sub-plots of the movie, which relied on other actors to fill the space in music numbers, otherwise the film would be less than half an hour. I just want to appreciate more people Randy and I felt a need to stand for her.
