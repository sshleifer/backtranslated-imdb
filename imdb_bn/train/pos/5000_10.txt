In America, animal configurations should be released on a different network, or at least an opportunity to run episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The American audience (apparently) has a tendency to drunk attention when it shows an embarrassment that does not contain objectionable diatribes of dogmatism, or an embarrassment with both the scalologic function (both words and smell), as it looks like it will be less and a lot of distance One of the main problems was that although it was brilliant, it was made for a rare audience, who had hoped for what to expect, but it was shown by the visitors and the board chambers that they were not aware of what they were seeing. Which is tragic, but not unexpected. Although produced directly for this DVD release, I saw at least three seasons of the show. The components and interactions between animals were enriched with sub-context and other conversations were just waiting under the surface. But due to political revisionism, such conversations happen only in my mind.
