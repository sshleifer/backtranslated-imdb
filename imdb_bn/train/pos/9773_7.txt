The plot is real horror, the environment is really depressing, unusual for low-budget production, and at least, for a German production. Indian spirituality, mysterious thriller and slash film mixed together. The plot and character development is great, it sets very close to reality without any studio-atmosphere. It may be perfect, but unfortunately, some things were frustrating, which must not be generally for low budget movies: <br /> <br /> 1.) Cast is never more than average. Almost every actor looks like a man. Some of them work fine, or very well, but German court-show is acting like some actors! But I am very disappointed with the performance of Matthew Carrier! Her performance (her many old movies were fine for her performance) was down! But that might be the reason why he participates in a German showbiz or TV series on private channels today. <br /> <br /> 2.) The dialogue is sometimes on the soap-opera level. <br /> <br /> 3.) To understand the bad word, sometimes it has become very difficult, what the characters are saying. I saw it DVD and was re-reviewed and delighted to hear it again. It is set by (grown in the hospital or specially group) and sometimes caused by strange dialects of actors! <br /> <br /> But all in all, it is an interesting movie, it is worth watching, commercially excluded movies, which are often more terrible.
