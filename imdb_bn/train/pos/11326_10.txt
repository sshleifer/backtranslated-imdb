I saw the first 17 episodes and this series is just amazing! I have not been interested in an Anime series from Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on an H-game, which I'm not sure whether it was done before or not, I did not play the game, but it followed very well from what I heard. <br /> <br /> I give a 10/10 in this series. This is a great story, interesting characters, and I have seen some great animations. It also has some great Japanese music! <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series yet, check it out. You can find sub-paid episodes on websites for some analytics, this is just outside of Japan.
