I only saw it once. This happened in 1952, I was seven years, film 13. <br /> <br /> We were so young ... but I remembered, for a long time, the powerful moment of the Ganges's sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I understand how much of a foreign country can be deposited and used. In this historic situation, movies, personal relationships of friendship, friendships of a friendship that ignore yourself, are raised among people who share everyday life, who see each other, who know each other's name but may belong only to different worlds. Then, at the most important moment a troubling question is raised: "Who are we supposed to be first, trustworthy?", A man, family, motherland, you are a known person? You do not have time to answer the perfect, there is instantiology and it is for life or death. The Ganges-Dina answers her through her self-sacrifice. Somewhere, in a confusion, the problem becomes incomplete, the emotion of the film increases with emotion, no one dies, until someone dies, we do not see anything compared to just one life, many other predictions or reality, because this death, this unique invisible life I live, I shared my child with unconditional friendship. It was I lived by the visitors. On that day I opened the Ganges-Dina forever. When I went back, my beautiful childhood, because I live from many worlds, I came back. I left it all well and these lines are a short tour today, I do not expect to get this morning.
