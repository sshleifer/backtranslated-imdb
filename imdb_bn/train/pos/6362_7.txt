I saw some "speed racers", but I have never seen it, and I have seen some shows that dressed in a dress like those who were flying in a ship called Phoenix and were traveling around an astronaut like another cosmic ocean. Ship and it was really dark and difficult to understand that anyone who had been behind behind for some time and really wanted to have five. This time I have seen almost every episode and amazing to me, though this show had some solutions. It's actually over, bad Americans have almost ended up with almost every American cartoon where nothing really has not ended like the last episode of the generation, such as ending with Galvatron and this new bad guy promises to get kids with Autobots, Dongguan and Dragon. It is home made, ready to try again again and again with GI Joe with Cobra. It's finished and there is a cool robot that got new weapons to move forward as a show, it was a bit cool to start because it could not fly and there were only a few cool arms. When it was gone, the 16th Android 16 used against Dragon's Z-Cell had a cool shooting fist, then the weapon developed to include the enemies who shot. Then the big robot even gets the bird so she can fly and even more weapons are included in the wings. She will get a couple couples in a funny robot and a friend of America who called a mug. Villains not only included Dr. Hellen, but a weird man who was half a woman and a dude with flying head. Interesting shows and it was kind of nice to see a conclusion.
