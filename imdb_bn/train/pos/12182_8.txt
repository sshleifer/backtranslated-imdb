I did not research films before watching it because it was part of a Wells Box set recently bought. I got a box set mainly because I own a man for all seasons and wanted to re-evaluate Waterloo. So I've kept the player's groove and Rita and I'm treating them in class and confusion in equal measure. <br /> <br /> The whole story seems simple, the man meets a beautiful woman and protects her from the couple. The Goggles, they are directly clicked and a woman and her famous lawyer husband, and then ................ <br /> <br /> It becomes mysteries to plot plotted devil and many shenanigans Became. Michael Oahara (Ascension Welles) does not know exactly what's going on, he is confused as a spectator, and most of the film is wonderful to drag it all over the place. Apparently like the Alsa Banster (Rita Haven), the beauty of the moment is being dragged by the heart strings, but you only know that these things are going on in the form of animals. <br /> <br /> There are many wonderful things in the movie with Velece's visual style, look at the scene in an aquarium that the endless scenes of the wonderful and fun house are fantastic in the eye. Happily, the description described by OHRA is fun and we can get good light relief on the streets of court case with Everett Sloan. In most cases there is a stir. <br /> <br /> Still the film is a diversification, and actually it's a sticky viewing experience, because {after I want to know} studio bosses mostly cut the film by the whole hour, and that not only disappoint the visitors, but in the way of Welles's view of the wrong I am positive that the whole film will be appreciated by cutting the original and honored wholesale, as well as we have very good and interesting movies, which sadly only indicates greatness, but it is like a great movie. I'm happy I own more revisit. 8.5 / 10
