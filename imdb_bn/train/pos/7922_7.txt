Paranoia, Reagan-Egger America, and High School Films, 50 Great Cinema of the Cold War, Adam Armin plays the full moon fourth star Tony in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) traveled to communist Romania and lost one night in the street, he was bitten by a useless. When he returns to the state, he can not control his animal defense and be killed. Frustrated, he flees in the city. Decades later, immortal Tony goes back to town and re-registers for higher studies. He still can not control his transformation, and the dude, and his friends, he does not quite understand the human. It's all finished while playing big soccer in school. <br /> <br /> I hope it's good to get it 'bad' from the early 80's. But I was surprised that this movie was actually legitimate. Ren Kelly as the lively ex-Teane of Ten, Demand Wilson as Bus Driver and Allan Arkin as Adnan Doctor, along with Kenneth Mars, came out with a cheerful outcome. <br /> <br /> <br /> When I was watching this movie, I got the same type of 'Family Guy' writing and humorous similarity. 'Full moon high' is something that takes attitude and does not take it seriously.
