I used to stay in Tokyo for 7 months. For my journey to long train journey, bike ride from train station, soup stand and so much scenes, I have really added my own gratitude for this movie, which I really liked. The film has various aspects of Japanese life, but it does not have to be Japanese for you to enjoy this movie. The manager's tricks were mostly fine; I highlighted the character Tobo Tamura by his soft filter, I made a great spell, made a little bit, but most of the manager's tactics were so gentle that I was completely dragged and danced with his characters. Or cried. Or laugh loudly. Wonderful. First row.
