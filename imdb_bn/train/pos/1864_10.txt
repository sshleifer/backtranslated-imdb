I just saw Antonovan Fisher in Bravo. What a terrific movie and incredible young This film must be seen for any person who is faced with how to abandon childhood abuse and as an adult. Denzel Washington keeps the young man who plays an extraordinary performance as well as Antwone Fisher. Kleenex alert - feel good and untamed. The most heartening moment when he finally met his mother, he was removed from the age of two months. And when she was most brave she stood her offensive pastor mother and sister. I saw this movie in Bravo in 2008 and I knew about it just years ago. Of course, a movie to add to my DVD collection
