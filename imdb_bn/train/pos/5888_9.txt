I was able to see this movie completely and was deeply moved by it. I was not really sure whether it was a comedy or a drama - it was both elements. Both Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper looked wonderful - our 60-year-old women of our pictures must have been changed from aunt Bees! They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! The only error in this movie was that there was no mention of other characters in the "MTM" or "Ronda" show in the 1970s. I was set to be in New York City (where "Roda" was set), at least that some of his sister Brenda or Julie Kawner was mentioned, of course he still was Big Apple. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope ABC will create this series and bring back all the old events of this event to the guests. However, what was wrong with this reunion of CBS, or a final series? What does "MTM" and "Roda" carrying network do not show?
