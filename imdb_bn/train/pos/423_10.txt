I just read the plot summary and it's the worst I've ever read. It's not justice to these incredible movies For a good example, please read the list of "Turner Classic Movies". However, it is one of my favorite movies as a small child. My sister and I could not wait till April when we could see it on TV, it was one of its best horse movies. This is one of the great classics that the whole family can see. Romance is clean and respectful. The story lines are interesting and the songs are great. They do not have movies like this anymore. Well played and not above. Pat Boone and Sheryl Jones are one of their best actors.
