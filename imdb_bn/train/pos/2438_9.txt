It was a jewel. Wonderful acting by Lead Cunningham, Orla Brady and all supporting casts. The film raises an issue related to many wedding units across communities and communities around the world, not related to Ireland and Irish history. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how religious convictions and traditions drive a fondness on a loving and enthusiastic family. The title "love split" could not be considered any better. Although it was a real incident and the 50th Ireland Ireland incident saw the loss of the entire village and the life of "the pogrom", reminded me of Russian history. Intolerance and discrimination are still very strong in the world and unfortunately it is deeply hidden inside human nature. Like the movie, Liam Cunningham's character says "hatred was always under the surface" This story was interesting to see the moral choices people made. The character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was quite meaningful. But the story hopes that love of both can win everything and love makes us stronger, stronger. The character of Liam Cunningham goes through the transformation of the story which she always wanted to be. Again, acting is a top notch. The story is fleeting. Irish countryside is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
