On the page, "Lith on the Wind" is a luid, shiny soap opera about the sexual intercourse of a Texas oil family. But below all the deep, social commentary in the life of 1950. Director Douglas Sirac scored again with another Universal sudser. Robert Stack falls in love with Loren Bacal. The problem is that Stack's best flock, Rock Hudson, loves him very much. When the stack finds out she is stupid and the nonsensical becomes pregnant, fireworks fly. And, very well Dorothy Malone won the Oscars for Texas's largest enmophore painting, who left Hodson. Good epic soap opera
