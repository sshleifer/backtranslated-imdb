CREEP is a straight-up deadly horror movie set that sets in real time, which does not want anything more than attacking a mutant in an empty subway platform for 85 minutes. And it's just that. Not too much Director Christopher Smith has kept this drama far away, as long as he has reason to stay in the subway after being locked. He deliberately left the titles of the title croplessly (60 underground underground illegal tests are hearted), and most parts of that part mostly work in the field. Sadly, he is actually going back from a point where more genetic distortion (which has been indicated) will eventually end itself. Yes, you heard me right - I wanted to end a clich√©d twist! Franka (Run Lola Run) Potente terrorist female lead as well and the rest is fine fine.
