Save it after leaving it, this image looks beautiful and looks great. Gilgood, Kenneth Hey, Harry Andrew, and especially Anton Walbrook, and a source of intelligent thoughtful acting from the intermediary central performer of the intelligent and incredible young Gene Sberg. Do not jump around and do not show up - her long slower encourages you to listen and reflect and Graham Greene's script narrows down without sacrificing complexity. The piece was made for the TV movie and of course the studio is locked but someone is bad for that. Many contemporary movies can not prevent dumbling in 'historical' themes. Mel Gibson made a maid? Perhaps Rack has his many shot shots, then firing up as crisping up on the BBQ. Preminger does not have any of these. Burning is mainly shown through a criminal-response reaction. There are some poor performance, but not enough for any serious damages. I grabbed this movie on TV and was not waiting to see it through, but I was trapped. In the era of our religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, there is unexpected resonance of the zones stories.
