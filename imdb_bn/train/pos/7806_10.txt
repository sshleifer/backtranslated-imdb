"Cree Freedom" is not just a movie. This is a historical account, heroic story, and cultural background insight into a major event in history. Dingle Washington is not a terrible act to impersonate an inspired, determined protagonist, Steve Biko, but he gives a message to the public about the fear of South African racism. Biko, the story of an influential leader and his main "influential" Donald Woods is frustrating. However, the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the persecution of South Africa. "Freedom of action" leads his audience to communicate with the optimistic outlook of the seemingly annoying plot. This is because of a great movie, which is a terrible event in history, great leaders try to put an end to them and we never let them happen in the future. Due to this importance, "Cree Freedom" is an extraordinary movie that everyone should watch.
