It's always a great dream when the movie made for television becomes as entertaining as Little Richard. This is a very popular movie about the story of Rock and Roller, an actor known as Lyon, who I have never seen before, but works very well. Like most television movies, it is a little tamer than a movie, which is a shame because I'm sure we were a lot of controversial about Little Richard. Instead we see many religious trash which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually destroys a very committed career. All of these are all well-played and above the average fot of a TV movie. 10 out of 7
