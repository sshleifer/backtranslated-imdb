The original title means "Birth of Octopus". I have to admit that I do not fully understand this title. The English title "Water Lily". But after writing it, I read another user's comment: "The title in French also indicates:" Private "or octopus, advises a person to get more pressure." Thanks for your explanation. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> It's no different for boys. I think that both Florian and Marie will have different feelings, except for any lady. <br /> <br /> Most movies are water ballet. Sometimes the girls will be down their heads down, and feet are less feet without feet on their feet, with which they will wave and jump in the air. People like me who have never seen such an event before, it was interesting - A leader of the Florida "Water Lily" team. <br /> <br /> She told him that he wanted to see the florian during training. This seems to be their first contact that is not just common. Soon they will walk together. Florian takes Marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for him, and then goes for an hour with him, while Marie is waiting for her return. I took for granted that the couple slept with each other. But we will learn later that they are less than that. <br /> <br /> I can provide some information that some users can find elsewhere. A scene that Mario secretly steals Florida's garbage bag. In this he found an apple while eating most of the food. And Mary eats the rest. ?? Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980), another film "Kazatchi no Gogo" (Breezes in the afternoon) is a parallel scene. It is about adult youths, and a definitely lesbian woman is in vain in love with a satirical woman. He stole a junk bag of cheetahs, and found more eaten apple and eat the rest. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, Floriano tells Marie that she wants to get her first orgasm from him. Mary says she can not do this. <br /> <br /> But after Marie says she really wants to do it. And she masturbates Floriane. This scene has no nudity. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a female director could do such a good psychological show or research? I want to quote Bowdelli, "Les Amoros Enfantines". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Florian played Adele Henel, who played an excellent role as Christophe Rugia (2002) as the autistic girl of "The Little Devils"? ? A very underlying movie
