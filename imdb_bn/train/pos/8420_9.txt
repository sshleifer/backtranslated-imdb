In 1927, and for several decades, Hollywood was on the map as the center of the movie world. Now it has become the site of many millions of dollars industry and vertically integrated studio system has been established, some of the temperatures in this film making factory are taking time for a few small reflections. The Last Command, when his heart could be a classic story of a once eminent person falling on a difficult time, the frames imagining how frames can vaguely restructure reality and make their manufacturing process vaguely private. Lajos Biro wrote, who knew this scene quite well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emil Jannings Prior to the arrival of the United States, Jannings mainly worked in the comedy, being a master of Hammy, still acting disciplined, often with great authority images or old dowding. For the last time, he called his gateway as the next, and at first it seems to be one of the scenes of janing-chimping character. However, as the story progresses, the actor gets to show his range, fine subtlety, ruthless dignity and endless displays by the extraordinary ability and last appearance present. He will never be brutally exaggerated (German acting tradition does not know anything about despair), but he constantly keeps our attention with full control over every aspect of his performance. <br /> <br /> The director was another immigrant, though there was a little around Hollywood and there was no background in the European film industry. Yet Joseph von Sternberg has drawn himself to the artistic and illogical Titanic Kino Mr. ("Fan"), and is drawn to a very unique approach to this draft. This photo note is a great example of early speed of Russian flashback scenes, managing its speed and rhythm. We are open with a carefully created chaos with converging directions, which pull the camera back across the screen and participate as an additional dash partner. Then, when Jannings comes, everything stops. Jining's performance is incredibly broad and measurable and when its players can start the mirror, its effect, such as its perfect presence, has been gradually restored. <br /> <br /> Sternberg appears to be annoying for violence. The screens are close to the moment and it still seems that they have happened with the flow of images which are almost poetic Indeed, he seems to have lacked all-rounds of interest in the workplace. The prisoner's rebellion scene took a different and motivated position in Sternberg, whose camera eventually turned to the fly-on-the-wall position. Compare this to the following scenes between Zennis and Evelyn Brent, which is a complex module of Point-V-view shots and intense shut-ups, which fixes us through their interactions. Personality in the set, it seemed that Sternberg was like a cold and tarnished director on screen by William Powell, and actually the Powell script would probably be the deliberate parody that Sternberg himself was in there. Unfortunately, this harsh attitude does not make him easy to work for, and his people meet his attention on his technical organization, little performance in his picture becomes a little preferred. Charles displays classic hamming in Lathon Mode which works dramatically, but does not think anyone has called his co-star as a comedy. Evelyn Brent is fairly good, giving us some good emoting, but overplaying here and there. Jane's only performance is Powell's own. It is a little strange to see Thin Man and The Great Zigfield's perfect perfect star, which is so harsh and humorous playing like a male shooter, but he did a good job, which shows a smiling mental intensity under the hard-hearted outside. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the very least, I believe many heads of studios were disgruntled at seeing "behind-the-scenes" because they threatened the mystery of filmmaking, which was still very much alive at this time. As it happened, the effect of the film was that Jannings won the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Best Writing nomination for Lajos Biro and (according to some sources, the matter is a little unclear) nominations for the best picture. This is important, because the academy was a small organization at the time and the first prize was more than self-motivated back-sledging by the Hollywood elite. But elite or not, they recognized it as good material to see it, and willing to reward it.
