This is not a "looser", in 1958 Moniselle's classic "I Solitie Ignati" Tito, Mastriani, Gassman, Cardinal etc. has become a definite, trusted remix, and the reason is good, it copies all the funny characters and intrigues. Even, in detail (photographer stole the camera from the local market). <br /> <br /> I saw a lot older version and I knew all the gangs and finally heart. I still enjoy "Welcome to Collinwood", which has its own uniqueness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how the 1950's life and ways of little thief in Italy were adapted to the US in 2002. Things have changed a lot. 8/10.
