Critics are stupid This movie is fun and smart. I liked this movie a lot. Why does everyone hate this movie this? I hope they will not like this movie more. Ben Stylar and Jack Black are true comedians and they work a lot for creating this movie. I do not see people making you movies like them. So people should just see it and not comment on it. I like this movie. It's all right through. There are some parts to get it stupid but at least they made it. Jerry Stilar loved it because Queen Shaw the King played the movie. But this is better than that. I can not believe this was so low rate
