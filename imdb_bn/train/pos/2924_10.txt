Rated NR (R will be rated for strong language and RED erotic humor). Quebec ratings: 16+ (Canadian should be 13+) Canadian home video rating: 18 at <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirius Eddie's first stand-up comedy routine It was published in 1983. Then he acted in 48 films. Hours and trading places and he was living on Saturday night. Eddie made two comedy films. Deliarius and Ray I like the favorite verdict because I think the subject is more ridiculous. Although Eddie is very funny to talk about his childhood and Mr. The fun of singers like T and Michael Jackson are fun. Any fan of stand-up comedy films will see Eddie Murphy's inspiration.
