I actually like the original, and this image is up and down. There are only a few of them: <br /> <br /> Compromise: Most of the original voice castes are back. <br /> <br /> Downs: I do not like Timon's mother's voice. I know she's a voice of Simpson, but that show is just plain stupid. Compass: We see Simba as a "teenager". <br /> <br /> Downs: They ruined it with a slug-slurring competition between Timon and Simba. Compromise: Rafiqi about Timon about "Hakuna Mata" <br /> <br /> <br /> Downs: How Pumbaa learned about it? <br /> <br /> Compromise: The song again (Some of the original songs were, but they only had background music.) <br /> <br /> Downs: But silly songs. (A.K.a Timon's solo.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a beautiful movie. I'd recommend it to the original fans. But if you do not like the original, you do not like it. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
