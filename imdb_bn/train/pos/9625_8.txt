At first it is difficult to know what happened, but after the next visit, it becomes more evident. I enjoyed this movie. The role of Don Keen Bob was excellent. Lexa Dugg was confusing to understand the character, first of all, she was out to stop Bob, but I really believe he loved him, even though he broke his heart. Dean Kain's performance was a normal nice. She gets better with each film she's. At the end of the picture, my only question was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was left to the audience to decide
