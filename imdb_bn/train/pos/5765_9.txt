A Zombie movie created by Zumbi fans for zombie fans with a true love of Zombiebus Bloodbath threat. I understand from the commentary and the things I read, it was created during the 1993 Great Midwest flood, when half of Missouri was under water. The building was under water. Cars and houses were underwater. In one article it has been said that Junk and the crew from this movie will help the river sandbag after shooting every day. This movie is really a miracle. It's sometimes like a huge mashing of each zombie movie made through a trauma filter. This is a party movie that makes fun with friends, who love to spread and hide the people of the disguised ones. And it's fast, dynamic and energetic and really fun. <br /> <br /> Because of the toxic accidents due to nuclear power accumulation, people fall or fall into the water. The local government covers it, tears down the factory and builds the house on it. Some ground migration (?) Causes a cave to be opened and some new residents find the cave and exhibit immunity to newly formed communities. From there it gets crazy and fun and fun. <br /> <br /> I read these reviews several times. And it seems to me that the same person used this fake short film to attack this funny little movie three times as a different reviewer. They use the same words and sentences. Zombie bloodbath cheaper. It's raw It has some bad acting. So making half the movie. There is much more work than this funny movie. If you hate this image so do not buy it. There is no need for personal attacks and crusher calls or trash trailers. And it is clear that you do not get to Australia or England. This wonderful service is just boring, that IMDB can not catch people just by using others. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I do not think those. I give myself both bad and good reviews. But it is very painful that some fools want to use this forum to personally attack the film's director. Sad <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "critics" claim to be their "review" in order to promote their own films. This movie is called boring - good, love or hates it, you can never say about this movie that it's annoying. It runs fast and never has a dull spot. <br /> <br /> Oh and these critics from the Netherlands ??? Um - LIAR You tried to post the same review at Amazon and got it yanked there. The same review was only from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This should be stopped. Love or hate it - give it a real review or type something. It is clear that you have not seen movies. <br /> <br /> But for the record, I have and although I saw it is not the best, it is far from the worst. And even the worst I will give a truly REVOEW and the director will personally attack. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will help some people see stupidity here.
