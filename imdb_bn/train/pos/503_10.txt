I was feeling quite numb after 7 years of horrible nonsense that called Star Trek Voyager. The next general and the DS 9 were the bloodiest good thing and the TV track to destroy the Voyager. This is a trek show probably opened with the best pilot. The crew was really good as the actor loved for the part. Scott Baqlah played captain for the first time in deep space and knew everything beforehand even before his work was wasted. Their role in the rest of the crew was really likable and I think they have a good first season off. I was really disappointed when the show canceled prematurely. Show what a mirror is able to cast us in the dark. The movie or TV movie has never been considered. The story behind this and the establishment of the federation has been talked about, such that the war with Clingson has started ....
