This is a movie that is affected by a person's interest, influence, or eating disorder. This is a teenage girl, because of her reasoning and her symptoms, an amazingly accurate and sensitive illustration of Biliyya. This movie is played by the brightest young actresses in today's movie, Alison Lowman, who was later where 'Where is the False'. I suggest this image will be shown in all schools, you will not see good in this regard. Allison Lohman is absolutely outstanding, and one of his powers to express the pain of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder is a surprise. If the barometer tells us air pressure, Allison Lloyman is also stressed with the correctness of the same magnitude. His psychological range is very specific, each scene is to reach the unstable intensity that can be measured on the level of increasing violence and depression, microscopically measuring the growth of trauma. Murray Winhingham is the perfect choice for his mother to play, and he does it with deep sympathy and emotion with deeply sympathy like Lohman. Together, they created a pair of sensitive psychic oscillators vibrating with each other. This picture is really a wonderful achievement, and director Kate Shea should be proud of it. If you are not interested then this is the only reason to see it. But if you like the movies of nature, then it is still after all animal behaviors on a sharp edge. An extreme version of how the painful soul can destroy its body in Bulimia depression. And if we are not sympathetic to people who suffer from the depth of despair, then we are dead inside.
