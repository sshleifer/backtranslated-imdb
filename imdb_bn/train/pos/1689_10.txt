What does the movie say to "Christmas Story" Christmas to Halloween: Both are relatively low budget, big names-stars movies ... and both are free and fun movies, seasonal classic !!! "Spaced Invaders" from the beginning, a superb cast of hot and humorous characters and characters ... all five filthy Martian, Colmbecker Realtor, Russell Dept, Verne "Fuel Supplier Depot" and many more! You just have to look at this movie to believe, and, like "Christmas Story", it's just getting better and better with each watch and you pick fun things every time !! Most definitely a ten !!!
