Knowing and Beringer will keep on the edge of your seat. I usually do not go for military / war movies, but it was worth my time. <br /> <br /> It was serious, but it was ridiculous. Beringer's character proved heroic and honest. No matter what, you know he's got your back. The genre evolved across the whole film without knowing <br /> <br />. He was not just a case, he explicitly proved that he could be a hero and manage a gun. <br /> <br /> This does not actually take action across the whole movie, but I saw that I saw it. <br /> <br /> This is worth checking.
