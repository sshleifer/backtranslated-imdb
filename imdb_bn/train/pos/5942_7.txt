I really liked Batman: Dead Indy, I thought it was a theatrical feeling and it's a chance the Coloos could create a fine movie. This trailer does not quite give me the same impression. The story line, or the possible story line was good, but due to the acting and special effects, I kept feeling good TV movies or television shows. <br /> <br /> First, Michael is not a good superman. I really thought, he made an honest Clark Kent in his short appearance. Sorry, I just do not think that being buff is as superman. Suit Kate wore her size masked. Batman may have Body Body Builders but not Superman. Supes tonk is no doubt but not bulk. However, I did not care for posing all of her and Superman from Kent looked her cheezy transformation. Now it is not just the fault of the wahrain, Kalowara may take some credit for poor scripting and direction. <br /> <br /> Second, special effects for flying were Cheezy. Superman fly through the sky. If it is obvious that this superman is roaming around the surface with visible telephone cables and house. I do not think there was any physical shot of the superman flying. Clearly, to support Orehen, it must be well lined up on its lower side. <br /> <br /> It was all a good trailer. I would probably like to see a film, if ever made, and be sure to catch it on television. A supporter of Lexkoppe and Wayne Industries, a superman for attracting Wayne, Lex and Toffes, to join Superman with Betman and Superman, is a good man I could confirm with a big budget and approval for a complete film Collora and Company, even O'Hearn could provide a decent film. Most of the recent comic-based shorts from Hollywood are definitely a good one.
