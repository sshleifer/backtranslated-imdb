Music and Lawrence Olivier Commemorative Delivery sets the voice perfectly for this outstanding documentary. It is still WWII buffs, that must be seen for the descendants of those contenders, politicians believe that when they expand their foreign policy through a deck of air carriers, they go on their way (have you heard George Bush?) And someone else is weird or that conflict Whos whys some aspect and need to know how to know. 26 episodes are increasingly in progress but can be seen increasingly since they are less or less spontaneous. New viewers are forced to have new insights due to the free volume presented. The actual footage of the war is interspersed with interviews involving the story. Most of the interviews support the second line authority, main character, personal, captain, secretary, witness and similar person. You will get the real real taste of everything in the war. <br /> <br /> I'm basically watching the DVD version of the television documentary. I firmly recommend this on Ibane golit√©, gaptothed, overpriced VHS encouragement. I've provided $ 120 CDN for five sided DVD discs This new release includes bonus element and is full screen mode. The menus are easy to follow, first you want to see which episode, and then after selecting it, you are given options of different chapters, or you can run the whole episode. Such extensive presentations suggest that there are few navigations in the menu, but after 30 years you will see that the effect does not diminish, after 60 years after the war. <br /> <br /> I saw the first broadcast in Buffalo PBS station just before I was away from London in 1975 and since that time I wanted to get a copy. Now my wish is finished. <br /> <br /> Check out this documentary. Tell your friends. Buy a copy for your library. Remember and respect the sacrifices and challenges defeated by all other nations and people involved in America, Russia, Britain, Canada and the final victory. What opened an eye.
