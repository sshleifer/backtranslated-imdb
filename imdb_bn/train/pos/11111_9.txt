Soprenus is probably probably the most open-minded series you'd like to see. It's smart, it's quirky, it's funny - and it can not prevent watching the mafia section so much that most people can not see. The best aspect of this show is the amazing reality of letters, which are found in the underground world of New York crime families. Most of the time, you do not know that wise people will hurt someone or buy their lunch. <br /> <br /> The depth of their personality by adding more realistic view of the character of this event - these men are dangerous, most of them are murderers, but if you do not even love them by God. I laugh at their advertising, they made a mistake during the trial, and were frightened by the cruel brutality of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> New Jersey's colonial setting is perfect for this show's theorem - people do not always think and a great contrast between the hemodrome and the steps taken by this seemingly small culprit are even deeper. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have not already done so, of course you must.
