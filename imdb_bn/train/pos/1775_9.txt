I wonder why this series was so much slammed. I had it written brilliant and very cleverly written and performed. I think the time has come that it will be seen in light, if they issue it. Many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and all the big things went on. Maybe this truth will tell people about its value and it will be issued. Julie Rhind-Tutt of Sally Phillips, Simon Peg, Peter Serafinowicz and Hugely Successful Green Wing Writer Graham Lionhan and Arthur Matthews are both comedians of the modern era. Anyone that can produce comedies like father Ted might not be able to write something worth publishing. If it is ever issued then I would certainly buy it.
