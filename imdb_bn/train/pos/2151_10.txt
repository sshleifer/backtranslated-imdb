Ridiculous Sad Charu Seeing this beautiful, simple film I wrote these words through my head. <br /> <br /> This is a rare event that really removes the movie, but "Can we dance?" That's done with grace. Sometimes humorous humor mixed with subtle distraction is easily one of the best experiences in my movie viewing history. It gave me a cool idea of ​​happiness, but mixed with a small touch of sorrow. <br /> <br /> and dance, oh, dance. Even if you are not a lover of art, or you can not put one foot in front of others, the steps shown here can breathe you and you want to sign up for the class as soon as possible. It was absolutely wonderful, even in the parts of Suziyam (cognizantly portrayed by Kozi Yakusu), the parts in which they began to learn dance were fun, beautiful like a child. And yet, this film does not dance completely, but more about the human behavior and the subtleties of feelings. We are teaching a shy person to express his feelings of pressure, re-discovering his love for a beautiful dancer and the personal growth of every member of the cast. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain Passion All the love and little distraction of life is here, combined with the delicate feeling of Japanese fine water, with the grace of mental energy and culture. <br /> <br />
