While browsing through the movie store, I tested it and I could not even be more delighted! My mother and I saw this movie together, and we've enjoyed it perfectly. It's not usually "chick-shaking", it's a sad love story and tears all sorts, but it definitely touches a nerve in wrapping up to the end. This is an end where, though unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film is not affected by it. I think Reese Witherspoon also acted as an actress in this movie, and it's definitely worth it! I did not recognize many supporting actors, but they all played their important supporting role. "The Man in the Chan" credible story like a young boy falling in love with the first era. Most women can be explicitly related to the words of Witherspoon, its delicate aspects, and the delicate feelings (stimulated like the ordinary teenage girl). Though he is playing a character confused about love, he is very much appreciated considering many movies today, which does not come across as silly and unfamiliar.
