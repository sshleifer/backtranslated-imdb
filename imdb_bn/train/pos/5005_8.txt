Under the belts, like "Wallace and Gromit" and "Chicken Run", the good man on the other side of the pond, Armman Animation, is now presenting some of his abstract humor in the form of "Kreierur Comforts". <br/> <br /> "Animal Commodities" created from the beginning of their career, a slice-off-life show where the reception snippets are removed from their context and given to any kind of creature. <br /> <br /> Armman Animation visits all over the country and interviews people with unjust queries such as, "Are you a liar?" And then ask some about their sex life. <br /> <br /> The answers seem annoying and shaky, really interesting, when you realize that the dialogues are first and then the animals are added <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I do. " A worm, walking stick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. Since "wife" speaks of her health, her long-standing husband is standing in her arms and says, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It should find a place on television for those who are tired of ordinary people. Carter has more reality shows than Liver Pills, "Animal Commodities" is a kind of and definitely valuable observer. <br /> <br /> Some humor may seem a bit high, it is so sweet that the attention of the children (like the old Batman series of 60's, the jokes are quite fine, the kids will not get them), and this is the joke that is for adults .
