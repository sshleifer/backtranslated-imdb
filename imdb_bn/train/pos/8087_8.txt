The net film seems to have only two types of reviews. Those who hate it and curse the curse of Ralph Bacchis and those who love it and say abusive acts. I'm eager to be in the middle. I am compelled to agree with most of the criticism of this film (such as the cruel cutting of the story, the badly rated character, the actress ...) but still I love this movie. Rotoscoping (if done properly) adds an eerie lifelike dimension to charecters and the ultimate battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic. Incredible scenes when Chasing Fredo is stylish and well executed and the musical score ... magic Sadly, bad point outweight film, but if you can bring it to ignore yourself, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> (There is no doubt that I hate this movie after writing this review, ah well, as life)
