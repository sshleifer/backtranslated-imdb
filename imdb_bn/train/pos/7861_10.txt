Uneducated and uncomfortable, Storm is a great fisherman's daughter working in a wealthy person's land. Inspired and brave, he has captured the heart of Millionaire's son, but violence, terrorism and sudden death will frustrate his endless future before claiming the happiness of his happiness. <br /> <br /> This beautiful, heart-twisted film of Mary Pikford is completely charming. He considered Tesk as his favorite role and he filled it with all the great joy and encouragement that kept him as the world's most popular movie star. Mary, with a strong, sad heroine covered with all kinds of dangerous, stressful situations, has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale. With the first rate, the outdoor grounds of the villages are particularly fabulous, <br /> <br /> Supporting cast Gene Hersholt stands as Villene Villene, who tries to force Peckford to marry her. Hirsault, very gentle soul from the screen, shines brightly to illustrate the full moral corruption of his character. <br /> <br /> This is the second time Piccard movie TESS. The 1914 edition was one of its first major films, but its production values ​​were worth the 1920s (for example close closure) and Mary made her own films and made them strong enough until 1922. When he wanted that picture, he decided to rebuild a film on his career's only time. The end result certainly lives up to his expectations. Both films were very popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> An interesting study for future film researchers will have the effect of Christianity in the life of Mary Picford; It certainly runs like silly threads produced through a silent movie. Although romanticism in the nature of silent movies may seem somewhat painful for today's spiritual feelings, but we are forced to accept them as a sincere reflection of Mary's heartfelt convictions. TESS, especially a beautiful scene, stands on this: Picford teaches himself to read using the Bible. He refers to Lloyd Hughes (who plays his sweetheart), a word behind the book that he can not understand. He mimes it for him (definitely the word 'crucified') and turned his eyes on the eyes, as the full meaning of the dawns on TESS Jeffrey for a fantastic new orchestra score Mark Silverwarmen, which has been undoubtedly underscores the beauty and ways of this wonderful movie.
