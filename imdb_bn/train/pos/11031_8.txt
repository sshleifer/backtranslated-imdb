Sly's best out-and-out action film. It's a fantastic enjoyable movie that is gorgeously assured by some interesting characters, strong performance and Ronnie Harleen's. Stallone is rarely interested in his action films and he must have seen part of the scene in view of the scene. It's one of the best action movies of the year and one of the most exciting and enjoyable movies of the 90s, it's a definite series classic. As a Stallone fan this I look back with absolutely memories. Lots of superb actions and forms of the main action people form. Action lovers appreciate this movie because it has all those hallmarks that make a good acitone movie. The film looks great and got great support from Jane Turner, Michael Rumer and John Lathgo. ****
