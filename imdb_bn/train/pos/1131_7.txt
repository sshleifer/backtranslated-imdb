This is a really interesting movie. The one who can sit and watch the one as the dictator gets the plot more and more twisted; More and more fun. Sally Field, Date Hatcher (Her Hey-Day), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Schu, Robert Doney, Jr. ... These well-known, quality actors are acting so that they are soap star star / producer. If you've ever seen soap operas and thought, "How did they come up with this idea ??", you would love this movie. I have seen it multiple times; And every time I see it, the more I appreciate the humor, the more I understand how well it works. Do not expect Oscar quality It's a fun movie, entertainment, some artists' efforts to find "people inside people" etc. Sit back, relax and smile.
