Every time I hear a movie, because it does not have any sexual, violence, bad language, special effects, etc., my b The detector is off. Generally, a movie like this is an emotional affair that makes people wonder, who do not want to surprise them, but to make sure they are ambitious to us. So when David Lynch's Streity Star received this kind of review, I was scared, especially since I was not fond of his other "uplifting" story, The Elephant Man. For all the great images and good acting in that movie, we felt more interested in our promotion rather than encouraging us. <br /> <br /> I do not need to worry. Stratte Star is a honest movie than a Sakaryan. Most of these, Lynch and author John Roach and Mary Swiey are said to be straight and easy in most parts. I could have made some homelike straight, I could have done it, and grain grains were made a few times over, but they were only quill. There is no heavy hand message, there is no horizontal string to blur our feelings and there is no restriction towards us and its characters. Instead, they depend on the story of creating its own power and doing so, so through the final scene, we are actually moved. <br /> <br /> Of course, Richard Farnsworth added this part to the reality. He really is a person who thinks he has lived a lot but is still going on, and besides that Homuli, his desire to return to the house together with his brother does not seem too emotional, because you can understand here that no one lives for long and long To be driven by anger is very much seen. And he knows that his time is ending, so he not only seeks peace with his brother, but also his life. Sissy Spaces also works as the girl of fine, unpremed work Strait. And although I was shot nicely in a city and suburbs, Iowa and Wisconsin landscape, I'd like to see at least some days.
