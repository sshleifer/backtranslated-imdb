I can not remember the best way to spend my two cents on Friday evening, after running across the movie on the Fox movie channel on Friday afternoon. Especially when you consider lack of user comments on it. Not every movie is worth more than the good or bad four comments? And this movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> As you look for a movie like April's love for the first time, it should be remembered that in the fifties of the end of this era, this event needs to be remembered. The film then was quite a happy medium back. In a box called Television, the screen was full of screencrawer screens when the movie was free from the tragedy to make the premiere of dark gray people. I do not know how many people loved this man from the tube tube to see, but it was able to draw my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Tin Idol is sent to live with Nick Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Z (Arthur O'Connell), after coming to the countryside after being admitted to Nick Conver, a young teenager stealing a car. It seems that her aunt and uncle lost their own son (Z. Jr.), so Uncle Z thinks she lost her life to survive. Massima Henrieta is hoping that Nick is going to the farm, then Z.K. will take her out of the blame. What is happening in the story line is that Z and Nick certainly must not care much about each other. Z then came forward to meet with neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Lease (Sheryl Jones) Templeton. Immediately develop a crash on ZFAN, and of course I do not want to let you know that a crush on lease z develops. Then Uncle Z's horse, a trouter who has become wild and will not let anyone handle it after the death of Jade Junior. Any real surprise you can probably fill in everything that's happening to yourself. Although it does not matter, you will enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> Once you see Pat Boone's sticky clear picture as a bad boy, you will not have any problems with the rest of the movie. Considering that, Boone Nick turned an amazingly good performance as well. Of course, the role of the role does not require much depth, but when you expect it at least it works a nicely job. As Z, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the role. Initially, he did not reach and cold, but as he slowly wakes up to Nick, we see that he is really a nice good guy. Zenit Nolan is very funny like Henry, who is playing the mediator between Z and Nick. Sherly Jones breaks from Rogers and Hamertstein and get a chance to grace us with his talent. As Liz, he is great to look great, to hear, and quite funny at times. Freel-like Dolores Michaels, who is a bit more in the wild, he is equally entertaining. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole thing is not true one. Everyone is so great that you can not help but enjoy the movie. I really like refilling it mostly, putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old Andy Griffith shows as musical numbers, a little more intriguing and broad screen technics. A mixed bag of tracks, the title song being made in April is their best. Another thing I really liked was that they did not come back to the use of blue screen backdrops during horse racing sequences, and because of this they are more entertaining and exciting. The fact is, you have done the entire picture nicely and it is good to see that they did not skimming in that section. Chemistry is good in Jones and Boone. Above all, the dislike of Nick and Z is illustrated as how each effort is made to respect others. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie will never be confused with a great movie. Yet, instead of going to Disneyland, one needs just one nice toying in the park and that is April love. <br /> <br /> My grade: B + <br /> <br />
