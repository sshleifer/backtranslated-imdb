Pickup at South Street, written by Samuel Fuller, is a tough, cruel, well-made movie about a pickpocket (Richard Wyommark) that unknowingly gets secret secret microfilm and becomes a target for spy agents. Also used as a tough broader as a courier by his bad former lover Richard Kiley who is involved in a tough broadband. This is her best photo-nir, and though her acting actress Thalma Ritter is very good, who steals this movie. A tired road peder, as M., sells the relationship of throat relationships (and who sells the information), he is an excellent role in the role of another Oscar nomination. Miss Ritter was given six nominations for the Academy Award and she never won. This was the role that should have been copped for it!
