Was not guilty, but the charges and their house were about to break, they ended up well, nothing, finally. The whole world has gone out of their house. <br /> <br /> It's weird, but funny, too. What to do if alone in the world? Two friends just enjoy each other's company, and they do not want to. But, that seems old, gets fast. <br /> <br /> Then they started to improve their lives by hating memories. This time the sound effects were great. <br /> <br /> The things are really amazing.
