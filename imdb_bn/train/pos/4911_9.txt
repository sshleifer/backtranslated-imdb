This picture has become one of my favorite pseudo-nourished experiences over the past ten years. Each of the three storylines threads offered by us by Kazan has their unique and individual joy. Internal chit between Bell Jades and Widmark, movements between cells, phone book repeatedly put a small gesture on the chair under his son so that he can reach the table, little interchangeable exchange between husband and wife is all made well. And natural. Other than anything else, I love their porsch, the second living room where it is clear that they spend most of their summer time. The second thread is professional relations between many of the film, but especially in the characters of Weidmark and Douglas. It can not be completely original and it may get a bit explosion, but above all it comes as real, respectful and effective. The third thread, the grunting story of Blackie and its harmful little gang, makes us the closest to the dark and horrible messy world. Coolness of banal ice cream in ice cream. This self-proclaimed businessman, this self-reliant man clearly taps us with complexity. For me, this image is going to be a completely satisfying experience.
