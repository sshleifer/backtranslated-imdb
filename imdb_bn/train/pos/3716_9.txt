I was seeing a look at the cracker bag on the night before the screening of Disney's hole screening. I do not know who decided to display it but I'm so glad they are so. The cracker bag is an absolute jewel, Australian snapshot in the early 80's that can be seen in the eyes of the child. "Conversation" between Eddie and his brother was a lively and life was so true with other movies. Every shot brings a great idea because it reminds me of my own childhood (the director can be the same age director) and the audio multiplies the feeling. I hope I will see cracker bags again for a while.
