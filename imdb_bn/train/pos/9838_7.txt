Bourne is also a good episode of season 1. I think, the rebirth bit is calm. As much as I see, as much as I like it, it will not be "very good" for me. Although it is not very memorable, I will always remember it as a reproduction episode. However, now I have to say good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> Good: Orgamy. Oh yes <br /> <br /> That fish tank was beautiful. =] <br /> <br /> Drop out of a window. Very classy X] <br /> <br /> Bad: Get married to your best friend's wife! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " > <br /> Conclusion: OK, the episode is not very memorable. 7/10
