This is a live action project created by My Bush South Park builder Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after one season, due to bad reviews (it actually got a better review), but it was very expensive. This is a political satirical incident in my bush. It is now a political satire. It's not just like the South Park, but it's a very funny fool and a pretty good political mockery of a sitcom. The man who plays on me looks like a lot! If you can find the show, check it out. There are so many smiles! <br /> <br /> 9/10
