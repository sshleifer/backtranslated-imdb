Emma is a terrible faulty film based on the classic novel of Zenna Austen. I did not read the book, so I did not really know so much about the plot, and yet I almost gave a full plot of the plot. There were so many scenes that disappointed me about bad writing or guidance. Although film is very entertaining for some reason and I like it. Of course I dislike all the scenes but mostly it was well played and fun. Gaminath Paltrow showed her best role as a heroine in Amma. This film is Tony Colette (who has been well, but much better) Ian McGregor (who was even better but he is still very good here) Alan Kumming (I have never influenced it and most of the same here) and Jeremy Northam Performance was rather wood than the first frame, but it was really fine, even if it did not even need it). It has been added but it is still very entertaining and valuable.
