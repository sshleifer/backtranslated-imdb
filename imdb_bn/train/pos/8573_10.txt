The London Metropolitan Police (God bless them) was arrested in 1996 for trying to steal and murder the "101 Dalmatians", Kruvava de Ville 101 dog brothels. All covered in mud and hay, he made the "Tin Tin" for the next 4 years. Now, after 4 years, unfortunately, he was released from prison. I say, about 28 years - in dogs years !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 2000, Disney decided to publish a sequence in the successful live-action version of the classic movie, and it was called "102 Dalmatians". In it, 1022 family members have been added (the name of the name, I think, it should be known only on TV), and there was no stain on the dog !!!!! Also, Krulah (again played by Glenn Close) escapes again, she again wanted big dogs, made out of dolls !!!!! <br /> <br /> I especially like theme songs - I'm sure everyone loves the song "nuclear dog" from the 70s or more. And now, we can hear somewhere in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is a great movie that I'm surprised - when there will be "103 Dammals"? ??? "LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
