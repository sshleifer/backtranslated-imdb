On Friday, April 7 I was watching this movie. I did not see the last scene (because I was talking to my brother N. mom at the same time). Can anyone tell me what happened to him? I saw a little while talking to someone in bed while talking to her husband and then she opened the door, she already died. <br /> <br /> What happened to him? Did he kill himself? How could she keep everything like a phone call, while her husband was in the house while talking to this strange fan? Can anyone explain me I'm so weird !! (Lastly, I read that he is suffering from multi-disorder personality). <br /> <br /> Previously Thanas.
