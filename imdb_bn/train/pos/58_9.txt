This movie channel trail was caught in the surfing of the last cable movie channel, and I was so tempted that I tried to show the next. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to expect after the program summary. I came away from this movie feeling quite annoying and distressed. At the age of 80, I have also given high school education to the elderly, some of the best insights for our kids to fight these days. <br /> <br /> The shooting you do not see just adds the plot pinch. Struggling both children and adults in the same context with understanding and intelligent shooting was repeatedly abusive. And I will admit that I have tears a few of my life. <br /> <br /> Which movie I do not want to know about the whole movie, but I'm sure I saw it.
