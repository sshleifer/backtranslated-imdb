I'm glad the users (like this date) who liked this movie are coming forward now. I do not understand people who do not like this movie - they seem to expect a serious (?!?!) Treatment! Come on, how can you take the importance of a killer snowman seriously? The filmmakers knew it was a shamy court, and they did not try to deny it. Directly face-to-face delivery actually makes it fun! Yes, there is a time when there is a low budget (such as an explosion scene), but it seems the fun of the movie has turned away from expensive! So if you like B-movies, and the fool premiere appeals to you, of course you would prefer "Jack Frost."
