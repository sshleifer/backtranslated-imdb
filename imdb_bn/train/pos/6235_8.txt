This is one of the best Fred Ashtere-Zinger Rogers movies, or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R films have great dancing but unfortunate romance stories. This is still authentic as coaching but not as pronounced as other movies. <br /> <br /> This movie features just great dance but a bunch of favorite characters and good songs. Music is added here to the central theme and what a tap solo by the excellent Rogers. She was not only a super dancer but also a very nice woman and one with one extraordinary figure. He certainly dances with Fred, and they always have a funny pair, which is on the dance floors. <br /> <br /> Watching "Og and Harriet" on television was growing in the 1950's, it was real I saw seeing the first young Harriet Hillield. No surprise no more fall for Ozzie for this beauty. Although she had a small '30s hairstyle, I could recognize her voice comfortably. Also present in this movie is fast presence by Bati Grable and Lucille Ball, but I must admit that I have yet to bow out. I can not find him, but I know he's here. <br /> <br /> <br /> On the third floor of the film, without any objectionable gum-chewing, it was fun to see and Randolph Scott - although good Westerns - very liked. <br /> <br /> If you want to enjoy the wonderful talent of Astaire and Rogers, it's just a nice, good movie and good.
