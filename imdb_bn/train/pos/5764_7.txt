I basically reviewed this movie in Amazon 6 or 7 years ago, and it exploded. I believe I am "mad" and a "turkey." OK, well, by most standards, it's still a Turkey This is almost no production value, no small plots make sense in any sense, and the acting level is in the third-level level. That said, it has really grown over me over the years as a sort of camp classic. In fact, the director Todd Sheet has all the effects on this film. They are almost like Ed Wood: look over them and select the flawed lines, continuity errors (same jambi, two different positions!), And other flaws. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you: Sheet is a very nice person, and when one of its first production, it's not cool, it's better. And I'll add more that the only true actress / actress in this movie is Russian in case, although I may be favoring her, though I used to accompany her to school.
