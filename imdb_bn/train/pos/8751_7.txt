Two adventures, good friends, before going out and going to college, do a trip to Thailand for a last experience. It seems to be a fun time for a foreign land tour, until they meet an interesting stranger who inspires to visit their Hong Kong and puts medicines on their luggage. They detain local police and justice in Asia is different from the US justice. It is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is the original story of "Brocodown Palace" and it is a good one. This image works a decent way of portraying arbitrary and corrupt judicial system of third world countries. Actually, the screenplay was rather light, because the prison situation is much worse than being illustrated. It serves as a reminder that we do not think so much of our judicial system, it is quite bad compared to other parts of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were many narrow situations in the movie that hampered the story. The whole escape attempt was folly imagination. It seems that friends can steal money for a bribe in a padded bra, and those who are regularly examining everything taken by the guards will not be searched by them, they think that the guard or the viewer has complete blockheads. <br /> <br /> The story failed to stop the suspicious question about how Alice (Claire Dance) got backpack from the drug. Does he actually agree to transport drugs? We have left the guess. It was very exciting to guess about the innocence of women throughout the film, but we never knew if one or both girls could be found guilty. Without this significant error, the end was nice and the results were unexpected. <br /> <br /> The performance of Claire Dances and Kate Binsell was very hard and good. On Dennis, who oversold and hyped, this photo actually came as an actor. Although his screenplay was often unfamiliar (as was his character), he improved with the improvement of the film and the situation became even more terrible. Baikinasel is flying against the radar's entire short career, and suddenly she is as shy as a lovely shoe that finds herself in a jail. His film was one of the best performers. <br /> <br /> Bill Paulman was wrong as a lawyer. Her Y and Defiant Style property in a movie like "What You Were Will Sleeping", but as a third world war lawyer, she was with the wrong person to free two innocent girls from injustice. <br /> <br /> Traveler was attractive in Thailand, but I did not want to go there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7/10.
