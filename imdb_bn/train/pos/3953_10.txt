I saw this movie on TV and saw it, and never seen it. For my life, I could not remember the title, and Roy Thin's film credits were checked by it throughout. Excellent, dark and ghostly TV horror films in the same class as "Crowen Firm"; "Do not be afraid of darkness"; And "devil school for girls", all satanic classics have been lost. I think Clint Eastwood's classic, "High plain drifter" equals the same. Why do not they publish these cool little movies, especially when you consider all the latest rubbish which meets the DVD rack on Wal-Mart? Most of these flickers follow a ritual, so sales can not be a problem.
