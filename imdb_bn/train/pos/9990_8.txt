I recently watched the movie and really loved it. I surprised myself and cried. This movie is in the same style as "Away or Hare" - or even "Bucket Lists", but runs the entire old theme with incredible authentication. The unlikely main character of Hagga is really really difficult. The director does an efficient job with the challenge. Hogar burden is difficult. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hagar (Elen Bertin) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter. She figures out the routes and freaks out of it. Its edge is really difficult. He is the hymn. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I did not like him - even a little bit. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we gain insight. We know why he does not like Peteanus, why he supports a son on behalf of another son, how his loss has created his character ... I started watching the angel ... and I started to like him. I especially liked him when he secretly admitted his son. Alan Bernstein, you are a brilliant actor. Glory. Glory. Glory. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I understand more clearly that there is a person who has a tough edge to protect, they are for a reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she is not my mother, law or Neighbors ... but its part appeared in many women (and men) in my life. The part that no one saw in my Stone Angel now makes me more knowledgeable.
