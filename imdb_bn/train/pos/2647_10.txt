Various levels of this movie can be explained. Another comment frustrates the movie and says it is a playback story or w / e and it's just about drugs. It has a lot of dialect metaphor for medicine; However, the rest of the film (and why I think it was made personally) is not really about this. It is really mocking the psychology and conditioning of society. It shows for a split second that the main character's brother is watching online sick videos. Why? My explanation is that instead of showing this man as a human, all the exposures of this enthusiasm are made to make us easier to be mechanical in our profession. Logic view is as far as possible, reaching people in 1% smart classes is also confused and frustrating because the life does not look like macroscopic level, calculable and mathematical and logical. You have to apply Hijchenberg's uncertainty principle (with other laws and uncertainty principles), not just physics, but to live and to change your plans and leave the room to adjust to the way. One of the best movies I've ever seen is one. It can only go the way above your head; This is not for you, for those people whose problems are facing problem of life, they do not work as a math problem. When you are critically critically analyzing or writing your critical review, do not try to read the cover first (written by marketers and parasychologists).
