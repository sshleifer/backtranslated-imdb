This film depicts the fanatic American patriotic feelings of a fanatic - who believes that his work (and politics) thinks itself as an important opinion of the American people. Allan Bates has completely captured this psychology as Michael Bouts, and I'll remember the bats as an immortal character. This is a similar movie for Canadians and Americans. It is a valuable part of the film, which enables the viewer to take a movie-making magic and reveals how easy it is for producers and directors to lose control of actors and complete control over numerous forces. Surprisingly, the "Hollywood Answer" is not damaged by the subject that illustrates it: Peter O'Brien refers to the precision and absolute control, and refers to the film's "scene scene" in the film and within the film-film, "Flight to Bogota" transparency and With Insight. If you are interested in the wisdom and power of Canadian movies, it's a great place to start the "Hollywood Answer".
