(Sorry for my flawed language, I'm not a native speaker ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a movie that demands almost a remarkable response. Personally I agree almost on all that superlatives. But I will not use this verbally ineffectual way to describe this movie. Because those "perfect! Exclusive! The best of all time!" - Reviews turn some people (with me). <br /> <br /> So if you look for another 'hamlet', it's very dramatic and it's likely to compete with all the movies - so if you find it somewhere then do not miss it. (Unfortunately not many people have a chance to see it. It seems there is no DVD, and the German language version that did a great job - is not available in any format.) <br /> <br /> If you are deciding to get a copy: Cut the version of the film two hours (or even more). It is no use and no fun and gives a wrong impression of a movie that works interesting with flow and architecture. And it also falls below the 4: 3 aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F. L.
