A few years ago, youths were somewhat unique and brave and courageous about the youths struggling with their sexuality, but in the last few years, more such films have been made, which has become difficult for movies. This movie also got a little promotion, along with the usual little festivals, along with this little French film, as well as the large sources that are always tender about such small movies about everyday things. The movie is not being operated very often. The film was premiered in 2007 and actually won some awards there. <br /> <br /> This movie has not really been standing out of the other because it has already seen some similar movies. Looks like this is a bad one but this is really a bad idea though "Nice Days PivrayRace". The film must be a good surveillance which handles its subject well and feels its story steady and effectively effective, slightly slowly, at the speed of French cinema. <br /> <br /> This is an age film, which focuses mainly on life 3 whole different mid-teens. Sex is a big theme in movies, which gets delicately and delicate managed. This movie and its story are a real realistic one, though perhaps somewhat predictable, since the film does not offer enough original ideas in its genre. <br /> <br /> Such French films are likely to be scared because of many people due to the reason that they might find it very slowly, deeper and with its money. "Niceness des Puyves" is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really do not have to be euro-teen movies to appreciate this movie. This is a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie, because of its subject and visual outlook. <br /> <br /> This film is becoming realistic by its actors, who did not have much experience in it and they did not even have experience. In the movie business but their roles are authentic looking and feeling. Powerful characters give the movie some nice themes and good moments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
