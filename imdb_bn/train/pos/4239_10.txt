My observation: Postwar Hilarity. Two years later (I was born years ago) "Meet me in St. Louis" from Tom Drake and Grandmother. Donna Reid is charming and beautiful. Margaret Hamilton is always as good; Smaller parts than "Oz Wizard". Spring Byington is way prettier, due to lack of precaution by Hamilton, with small noses inferior. Tent scenes with the next boy were at the end with the sunshine. He was very nice and inexperienced in the tent of the two-year-old army, when I looked in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I used to work in a department store, and it was also elegant as it was. Sadly, it has disappeared and faded into obscurity. We were famous for those great show windows, which were used to marry the passengers through the store, so that they could buy that wonderful merchandise. <br /> <br /> 10/10
