Sansine Boas was a delightful adaptation of the 1975 Blue Ciron game of a memorable Vaudvivilian team that played Walter Mathew and George Burns, who had a very bitter break and was asked to reunite once more to do something special or otherwise on television. . The problem is that they hate each other and do not want to do anything to each other. Richard Benjamin Matthur's nephew, who appeared as a theatrical agent, gave serious rewards for the reunion to fulfill the reality. This lovely and winning comedy is a lovely Valentine ... forgotten as entertainment, and one of the outstanding works of Michael, Barnes and Benjamin, and thanks to Neil Simon's better image presentation. Barnes won the best supporting actor Oscar for this, but I think Mattho's film will be ridiculating him with a great acting like Willie's Clark. Mathau was nominated for Best Actor, but Nicholson did not stand an opportunity against a flavored dog vest; However, in another year, it was an Oscar-worthy performance. Matthau has a false note of screen commands and this beautiful timely performance. The scene where he is auditioning for potato chips commercial and can not get the right name of the product is a classic. Sansine Boas is a warm and conquering Neil Simon Comedy, thanks to the extraordinary chemistry between Matthew and Burns.
