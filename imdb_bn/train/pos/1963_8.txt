We start with all of our reviews with the following information. For the last 15 years my wife and I have seen about 100 movies each year. Recently, we were honored by accepting the passage of lifetime film at any time in a film! So we can see what we want whenever we want. This point is calculated by CRITICS for ZERO. Your local critics or national critics of Ebert are not actually different from yours. The only difference is whether they want to write about movies and see hundreds of movies. Therefore, it is our belief that if you are eligible for two hours of your earning, it is enough for us! We do not ever hear critics reading. We only care about our friends and those who do the same things like us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is very good. Not only good but also very good. Critics have a clue of silence. Just because they have nudity and language they hate it. It was worth the ticket price and everything you can do. this is not right? Not every movie can be nominated for Academy Award. Sharon stone is fantastic and the movie does a great job and critics want hell to do it to mystery
