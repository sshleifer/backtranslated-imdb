I saw a 139-minute version (widescreen) with some friends and we've been flying far away. I will not be bothered to repeat what others have said. What is unexpected and fun with the idea of ​​filmmakers? Huge war tired Later we wanted to know that there was about 30 minutes left to go there, but it did not keep us completely involved and kept away from entertainment. <br /> <br /> One thing that was almost destroyed and it was a horror song / song Blues, country / guy and rock ballads are not here and when they are used we all become laughing. It's horrible You have been warned but stuck to the story and the story. <br /> <br /> There are many extraordinary moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. Along with silence, there is a lot of use of slow photography which works nicely. I really want to delete the song but <br /> <br /> <br /> Find out this. It's fun, it's different and it takes you to a place where you do not expect it and it's very refreshing.
