"The Mother" A peculiar low budget movie does not touch at least two uncomfortable themes, which are not usually searched in movies: denying mother's love for their own son and daughter, passion and passion among third parties. <br /> <br /> Characters are terrible: Mood is a disgusting woman and I believe it is impossible to feel sympathy or grief. He admitted that he did not love his son and his daughter. She cheated her husband two times with the intellectuals. He stole his daughter's favorite man without protecting him from morality, who does not love him, but he feels horny with her. She is trying to organize her life after destroying her husband's worst way of losing her husband. Paul, his daughter, a hungry hunger, who took his life the same way. His brother Bobby is a man who lost his savings to his wife, who insisted on his shop, is really a terrific business. Darren is an immortal addict who does not like anyone, even himself. Acting and Direction Excellent: Actresses and actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very specific. I liked this movie, but I acknowledge it is recommended for a very specific audience. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Resume")
