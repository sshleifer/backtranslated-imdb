I saw this photo at the Toronto Film Festival, where it got a lasting encouragement! This film tells a story that was never before my knowledge - as Rosendrocarus (on the Berlin street) about the rebellion of feminist women in Germany, married the Jews at the end of World War II. For example, this is a unique story and more so, the only film I ever seen from Holocaust shows that the Germans were (for example, the "helper family" in French was "Dutch") who did not support the Nazis, and indeed, at the risk of their lives During the Nazi regime, they were determined to stand up against their country's immorality and cruelty. Great across the exclusive board, New York's framing story is interesting and complex, with each scene's expertise from Van Trotta, and outstanding prices with exceptional cinematography. Of course the New York family could speak in Germany. Many migrants in this country prefer to talk to their families in their native language - a common incident. So criticism is unreasonable. To say more, the experience will be lost. The film is not long, but once I look at my watch. I hope this film will be delivered to North America, because it is not just a film, but it can help the Germans suffer from any discrimination due to Hitler's support. These pictures are playing in your area, I'm bored to see you! You will be happy to do this!
