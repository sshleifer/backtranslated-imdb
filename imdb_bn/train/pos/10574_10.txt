This is a wonderful film. Non-stop pattern takes a few observations to fully appreciate. Musical production of Busby Berkeley will not be duplicated. I think this movie has easily surpassed all other efforts. Joan Blondel and James Cagney are incredible together. Some of the humor will push around today's movie borders. How they excluded each other and make reasonable explanations for enjoying it for a reasoning view.
