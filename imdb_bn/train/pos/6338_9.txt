I really liked this movie, I saw the original classic several times but could not remember any details. I think the movie is not much darker and white than the cartoon. I especially liked how they made Greenchke a complete character and why he gave it a reason that, in this movie, villain is not a real grin but much larger than the original cartoon. Jim Kerry was perfect for all parts of a great movie made for both kids and adults together.
