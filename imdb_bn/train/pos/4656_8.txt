A clever, perfect romantic romp starring Peter Ustinov as a career creator with his sights in London in the United States. He was excited by Foxie (and the tremendously sharp) Maggie Smith and threatened to expose the exposure of Bob Neighart, the fierce company guy. It's an intelligent film with a lot of brain. Uthinov exceptional as Smith and Nehart quite funny. The real wonder is Karl Malden, Pill Papping "Executive Vice-President" Malden has rarely been very loose. Caesar Romero and Robert Morley pop up in some fun comes. The excellent music score is by Laurie Johnson. Eric Till's order is fast and the first rate of the script is Ustinov and Ira Wallach and very smart. A good time to swing!
