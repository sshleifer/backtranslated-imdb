Pierce Brosnan's best performance is not easily mentioned. Of course Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when he's really bad? I think these pictures incredibly intrinsically! The use of the colors of this movie is very different in today's film world, where all other movies have a payback blue filter. I also like the way to use the Asian song. The one that was thought of as a Kinda Chess once can be really set up properly. <br /> <br /> When I came out I was making my first feature. Since my film was a hit-man movie, so in any version of the liberation war I had to do some tests. After watching this, I'm sure the process has some impact on me. My picture was found in IMDB when it was quite cool that if you like me, it will recommend this movie. I have no idea about how anyone else related, made a more interesting trick. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
