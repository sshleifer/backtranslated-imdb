Why Panick's good theater was not released: It is too smart, and the audience probably had a difficult time with it, it compared American beauty to the investigation of the Middle Life crisis and analyzed it in Soprons and its research. Illegal way in family life. While Panic may arise from uninterrupted material, the characteristic of Bromel's life, combined with uninterrupted dialogue and observation, makes the film a realistic look to restore the condition of the middle-aged people. <br /> <br /> William H. Messi, a Hitman who works for the contract-killing business of his father (Sutherland). He conducted double life with his wife (Ulaman) and son being informed of his true trade. In his middle age, he hated growing with all his life. Under his peace, the collected masks put pressure on his father to control his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell), she feels disgusted and decides when to leave her family business. <br /> <br /> The writer / director Henry Bromel decides to take this profession, trying to break his main character, is far more disposable than contract-killing. He could easily replace it with any illogical profession; His characters have been so advanced and trustworthy, so scenes are handled so easily and realistically, and the dialogue is so insightful and naturally written that instead of his job as Hitman, Messi has a focus on the conflicting character. Bromel's script seems like Shakespeare's tragedy, with a definite theme running the life fate. <br /> <br /> In Alex, Messi creates a tragic, easy-to-understand character and becomes a different brooding, great performance, which is always optimistic. Donald Sterland is effectively hated and abusive as his dominant father, and a welcome change for Messi's wife Comedian as Uleman's dramatic change. Consider the scene of a bicycle shop, where his mood is sensually confusing, in a visible scenario, partly in the dark and peak. <br /> <br /> The first feature of Henry Bromel, Panic is a film well-made with his sincerity. With a first-rate cast, a possible script, sharp dialogue, and beautiful aspects, this character-study is expected that the precision of the bromel to create original-looking characters is just a taste. <br /> <br /> 10/8
