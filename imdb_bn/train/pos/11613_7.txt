Confusion is a movie that can surprise me. A kind of multi-layered play that focuses on writing a game of his life which is happening with him right now. To be even more shorter, he thinks his wife is cheating on him, so he keeps a personal eye to monitor him. His wife has no idea that this is happening. Meanwhile, the actors of this play have put a few people in their midst to make a fool with each other, what would we say, immoral people in the world of Israel The whole event ends in a theater with all the actors present and will be predictable (but not true). <br /> <br /> This piece director walks alongside the cast of true characters and edits a way that gives you attention, this is actually a funny movie, which I did not think of seeing and suggesting people to check out.
