I was delighted to see Big bad swimming at the FBI recently. Lauderdale Film Festival and I must say that I have watched this year as the best film and the only film I have ever been inspired to write / comment. This picture combined a script with nicely directed and realistic dialogue, excellent acting and an inspirational message. General life is integrated into an adult swimming class and celebrating diversity of life becomes extraordinary. It is continuously portrayed by the first minute imagery of this impressive film. Where we go to the pool of water to see feet and smoke of different shapes and sizes. This image is brilliantly arranged because actors are placed in focus scenes and hold your attention and imagination.
