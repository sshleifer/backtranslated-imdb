This is one of Hollywood's "Golden Edge", which they do not create anymore. It's a unique, funny movie that guides what will happen next to you. <br /> <br /> All the actors have cast completely and they are the biggest supporting actors. I saw this first film with Ronald Colman and I am a fan of him. Reginald Gardner is always my favorite actor and he added a certain quality for each movie that he has. He played a different character here, he has added yet to the film that there will not be another actor acting in this character yet.
