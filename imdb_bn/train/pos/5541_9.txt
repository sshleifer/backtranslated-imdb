A highly atmospheric cheaper, showing a great sense of props, sets and effects (fog, light, focus) for creating an eerie and moody texture. The story is far from functioning, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop a complete visual description. This movie is recommended for her story, for her mood and texture.
