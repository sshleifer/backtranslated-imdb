I did not help while studying the rest of the comments for this show but noticed that a large percentage of the critics did not actually see any episode of the show or seen completely through their own will. Things about kerching! It is a child show, so probably for children if your older it seems fat, forced, and probably stupid. I told them that the sets were stupid, but the eight-year-old seemed to think that why the Taj made the Ikwa ice cream on its wall, and my parents kept me stuck on something even though they were thinking. Yes, it can be annoying, acting can be even better and some characters do a really strange thing with their hair, but a child shows, I rate it 10/10 They compare today compared to air in its place, well, I say just because it will be broadcast again. DVD release, anyone?
