John Ford is one of the most influential and most memorable American filmmakers in the history of cinema, his name is usually associated with western film. However, John Ford's controversial best film was not written in the West but in the early 1920's, a great drama in the Irish War for Independence: the 1935 documentary. <br /> <br /> Times have been hard on many in Ireland and Gaipo Nolan has been burnt on a web of poverty and frustration - and the walls are closed. Jeepo is big, but not the most bright bulb in the tree, it is a warm heart but has a small fuse and never thinks. Everything is way through but he is not a criminal or a self-centered central. Jeepo Nalan, who is walking on the streets in the streets, finds her life's leading lady Kati Maden and asks for her own disappointment in the street and she dreams of taking it to the US. 20 pounds had to pay for it. Good luck, his friend Frankie returned to the city with a price of £ 20 on his head and was quite frustrated to report to the police anywhere in the Gypsy frankie. Zipo with new £ 20 blood money, blames him on this dirty night, especially Fogger, and the IRA invests all his resources to find out the Frankie's information provider. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Her brutal, stupid, and flexible forms gave the character of character and Arthur's character, Arthur's MacLagglen Doodle Moore, put Arthur Bach as the second gravity of the second entertainment movie. MGGET's performance like KG Madden is fantastic, but McLaglan is only the only member of the actors who is truly impressed. Preston Foster made a mistake as the head of an IRA, mainly because he is probably not Irish and his role in the film is limited throughout the Jim Cartignin border, but this frustrating supporting role is the only poor point of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the long career of winning for Oscar nomination and John Ford, Informer won four Oscars for four of the best directors in 1936. Ford and Company's shadow and light film are particularly compelling and important stories. Gypo's walk through the streets is described by the city's tragic situation and glaring accusations of street lighting, each shadow continually reminds him of his dark work. Ford's command of this strategy was remarkable; If after 10 years the informant is created (thus the necessity of the genre is made) it will probably be considered as one of the best films silent but it does not prevent memory as a classic classic.
