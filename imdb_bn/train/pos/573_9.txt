I've always enjoyed the pictures that illustrate life. Life is sometimes a boring patch, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Races Thor It" is the perfect name for this movie and (Norman McKellen's novel). Life flows like rivers and a river, and it has rough spots, but it is a wonderful trip. <br /> <br /> The film comes with a lot of Robert Redford films. His description is a friendly feeling that perfectly fits the image. As a director, he captures calm and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. For the role of acting, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt did wonderful work as a brother. I do not know how I can describe Tom Scarit and Brenda Blothin's performance, except they think they're real. "A River Runs Through It" is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8.6
