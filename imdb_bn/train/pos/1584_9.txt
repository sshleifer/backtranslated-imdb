In Rojenstraße, Margaret von Trouta creates a vibrant tapestry of love and courage in two stories. The film is a story about the separation between a mother and her daughter and the stories of German women, who protested for the release of their Jewish spouses from a specific protest in Rosenthal. In addition to the dramatic historical dramas, the focus of the movie is due to the Holocaust of Germany, to protect the child from the child and to experience the loss of his mother. Mrs. Von Trotta shows that few of Germany's courage does not use it to forgive German society. In fact, he shows how the rich artists and intellectuals of German high society express great sorrow over their lives and parties, in torture and elimination. The Jewish widow Ruth Weinstein (Shoes Lamp) has decided to sit in Shiva, after the funeral, the Jewish family members commemorate death and mourning. Paying full attention. When her daughter Hannah (Maria Shader), her drunken louis (Fedja van Huit), a non-Jew, forbidden to ban a phone call, suddenly asked why her mother suddenly decided to follow an orthodox tradition that she had earlier Refused. When Ruth refused quietly from her cousin, Hannah questioned her and when she adopted Roth as a child for kidnapping and murder by the Nazis, she asked about a woman named Lanna, and she wanted to find out the lanah and her mother's past <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < At Lena (Doris syade) got out, and he gave this interview that he was a journalist who interviewed him holokastera're searching for some direction. With immediate memory, Lena, 33 years old (Katja Reiman) as a woman, was asked to look for her husband, Jewish pianist Fébrae Israel Fisher (Martin Fifel), who had disappeared and asked to stay in prison despite being protected normally married Jews. Lena has discovered that her husband and other Jews are being held in the former factory of Rosestrust, in a brilliant performance of the remand. <br /> <br /> German women standing together at frozen nights whose husbands are absent. Outside the building, their numbers are increasing every day until they give a thousand shouts, "Give us our husband back". Lena Ruth (civilized lohde) has found, with the daughter of a girl having a mother in her house. She takes care of her, protects him from Gasepo and raises her mother after her mother dies. Lena came from an elite German family and her brother, recently returned from Stalinadrade, a Wahmet official After helping to free Fibian from his father, he talks about his brother's help, who tells a fellow officer, "I know what I do to the Jews." In her support, she topped the channels and topped her beauty and amusement culture minister, Joseph Guebels, who proved unexpected for a wise woman. This fictional piece of film has criticized the criticism of women protesters, it is a historical fact that Gobble was very active in taking decisions to influence robotrastras. <br /> <br /> Director Margaret Von Trotta, an activist, feminist, and intellectual, political drama is no stranger to. He conducted a film by socialist Rosa Luxemburg and Marian and Julian, which is the story of the relationship between the two sisters, one of whom resorts to political violence to fulfill his generous objectives. In Rosensstraße, he had to work for eight years in a film, and to accompany his film, he had to adjust to the present imaginary elements. It works very well, with respect to the beautiful screenplay of Mrs. Von Trota's art and Pamela Cat, whose father was a refugee from Leipzig. The events of Rosenthal lie to the Germans, who say, "We could not do anything". Now Von Trott has shown in opposition to the truth, something can be done to prevent the Nazis. It is a tragic example.
