Unlike any other film, I can compare it to the closest thing with Woody Allen ... But where Woody Allen is constantly exploding in the human frame, Brett Car seems to be trying to find ways to hug him. A helpless unsafe which defines us for good or bad. In Lou's case, it can be expressed through the flash back to the stuttering root cause, which is an exclusive child hood trauma. <br /> <br /> There are many weird neurotic people in the world and I believe they all deserve a chance for release, even though the diversity of the human character that makes this world an such stimulant, so rather than fixing our noses or breasts We should not fix our neurosis. <br /> <br /> This is an indigenous film shot of a tall shoe store, but production prices like movie opportunities are fantastic. I feel like a quirky gem for self-help markets. Looking forward to seeing what I really want to see in this filmmaker, I can imagine a career like Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, although usually when such a person breaks away, he goes away and forgets the "X Men" and his humorous joke. Or are they a bit awaits if they think of x man properly :).
