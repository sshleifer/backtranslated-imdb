If you come to the film with the expectation, then throw it now, because there will be no role in the context of this film trial. <br /> <br /> This series will be criminally classified as single continuously. It is a spy thriller, silent, bit and action piece, elements of science fiction and cyberpunk combined with a brilliant story, mind-screwing plot twist and gorgeous paintings. <br /> <br /> Many comments here are centered around both of these movies as both metaphors in good and bad ways. But they say that every story is made from Shakespeare, so once you can get it, you are a street for hell. <br /> <br /> You need to suspend your mistrust at some points, and the set is never incredible, there are parts (read: lift) that suffer from low budget and some chessy visuals. It does not misunderstand at the same level as the silent movies of Saipai Channel, although it is on a higher level. <br /> <br /> If you search for action then you are away. This is pure psychology. But if you want to enjoy and dedicate yourself to a 90-minute novel movie experience, in all the ways, now! See this movie now before it's been cooled up!
