Through the special telescope, Johns Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully proved that a meteor in Africa was unknown some years ago, but the most powerful element. Dr. Bennett (Bela Lugosi) ran an operation led by Rukh to identify this material. Unexpectedly, Rudd discovered "Radium X" is more powerful than radio and radioactive, and Carleof is polluted and can only kill someone by touching it. In the second era of World War II, this classic science-fiction film sparks really fly between Logosi and Karloff. Director Hilarya used some permanent set of "Flush Gordon" series, which was filmed at the same time and inserted some footage from Frankenstein to the electrical device. Universal Use this great classic film to keep the special effects unknown. Karloff and LuGosi were the best of them and both of them enjoyed working together and enjoyed by future generations.
