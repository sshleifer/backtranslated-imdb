I saw the pie-lett last night and the word that comes in is "real". This is a word that is not used much on TV because they keep copies of what other networks are doing and you end up with seven nights of crime, procession, and reality shots. <br /> <br /> The first thing was to hit me like a brick in the presence of Jim Dell. Those who have not heard the "Carrier on ..." series with the British or the Harry Potter book, they may not be familiar with Dell. I'm not sure that additives or distracts his presence as a narrator. I will make more tunes, but it gives the show a "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (notorious, white countess) has a gift. It does not explain where he got it, but he can return from the dead for a minute. He uses this Macquarie ("Boston Public," Roll Bounce) team to solve the murder using this genius. Everything is beautiful and funny, as long as she comes across childhood love, Anna Freelle (goal, dream start, timeline) and things are really complex She can not send her back and she can not touch her. Boy, it will make a relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> In this continuous series of continuation of this series, I am dragged to see it.
