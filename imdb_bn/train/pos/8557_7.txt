I will have to hand over the creative team behind this "American Pie" movie. "DVD to Direct" is usually synonymous with making inexpensive, incompetent films. Although last year I was delighted to enjoy the DVD signals "The Naked Mile". The filmmakers took the opportunity to offer a messy, yet funny little film. This year they follow, "Beta House" offers. True, "Beta House" lets look at the first few "American Pie" movies like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> This is not a closed, vain, sunny game. Sure, the story is a little thin, but the beauty of the whole thing. In the first 10 minutes we introduced all the main characters, new supplement letters, to get the most messy mess, meet villains and set up common plotslines. With all that way out, the movie became a boundary road. A lot of gags, and they do not hold this one back. I'm talking about male sperm, urine, dildos, dicks with girls, sheep with sex, female orgazim spray, and more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Supporting role as the last few films). The whole throw works fine. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has a great power and screen presence. I predicted good things for him. The film is loaded with great movie references to keep their eyes open. The biggest smile for me was "The Dirhurt" parody of the film. Classic. <br /> <br /> If the line below is a fan of the series, you will feel right at home with "Beta House". It really pushes the limits of good taste, but ultimately quite fantastic fun.
