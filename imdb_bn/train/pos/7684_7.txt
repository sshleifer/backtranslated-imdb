All of the comments are very exciting to read. But can anyone tell me the name of the real artist who has been photographed for better broadcasting. I understand that everyone J. But as a family artist, the real artist was a real family, and he has not yet achieved any credit in this sight. So if someone does not say the name of the real artist, then I want to say "good job". I know this time is a good time to spend, but do not you agree that he touched the hearts of all of us. Whether he is still alive, he still wants to draw or know. I'd like to do some work in her home appear in my home.
