If you like movies about school bullying, brave children, ridiculous kids and pests, you will be asked to know what to eat in the food. <br /> <br /> This image is about a boy named Billy who, on his arrival, found the first day in a new school, that he had a joke about some of his classmates putting insects on his lunch. The school rapist, Joe and his "team" started teasing teasing friends and called him "worm boy". <br /> <br /> Billy says that "he always wicks up". Joe and his friends do not believe him, but the Jolie joues loudly aloud loudly aloud loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In his bet, a weak stomach is mixed with an operation by feeding insects, fried or living foods from his classmates. <br /> <br /> The film may sound great, but there are many messages in it. For one, it recognizes the true friendship and how to accept those people. It shows you why some bulls are being raped by other children. <br /> <br /> The heroine of the film Billy is a strong, intelligent and courageous person who is related to all of us. It is easy to feel her, because we are happy to achieve her goals, although we will not always agree with what she is doing or her preferences. <br /> <br /> The children of the film were portrayed exactly how the kids are in real life and the film is very much creditable for them. Children actors show a big part of this show, other kids' true emotions and feelings than movies. <br /> <br /> Some adults can not enjoy this movie, but kids, maybe even teenagers. <br /> <br> There is no good movie in the circuit at this time, so if you are not in the mood to see a snake on the plane, try a worm on a plate of how to eat fried worm. This is not a good funny picture and fear factor for kids.
