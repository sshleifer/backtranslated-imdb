I just saw a press screening of this photo and I was pleasantly surprised. Often I can not see my favorite actor together at a time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the pocket scene and it was good to see Rachel Billson and Hayden back together. I think the cameras are directly results in their time together with their chemistry cameras. I was far away from my favorite scene (surprisingly) the pieces of Brett Ratner ... without much distance, I would just say that surprised you that ... <br /> <br /> The old couple was really good together and you The idea is that they have spent the whole life together. <br /> <br /> In both sections of Chris Cooper and Ethan Huq, a punch was packed with wonder which is real and similar to the big apple experiences. It's a great place to take a date on all the pictures ... especially if you're already the city's favorite. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next cities.
