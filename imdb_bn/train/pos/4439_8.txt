The best-selling horror novelist Cheryl (the strong and sympathetic performance of the finest Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (favorite Paulo best) and their son Bobby (played naturally by Patrizio Vinci) go to a remote castle in the rural areas. The claim that the local legend area is cursed. Cheryl lived in the basement to discover a weird, hairy, nasty ogre (davking David Flosi in a strikingly despicable costume). Cheryl has been forced to raise his animal's deepest fear of childhood so that he can defeat cruel inquiries. Director / Co-writer Lamberto Bava is a skilled and rational expert in creating and durable nightmares. Moreover, the ideal blood volcano flight surpasses the routine for writing fiction like a compulsive and provocative dark adult fairytale on how to talk about how Bowe encourages the best way to encourage us. Sabrina Firili's friendly school teacher Anna, Stefania Montrusi as the hottie The Babysitter Maria and Alex Sara are supported by the Bat Artist Dario. Gianfranco Trancutto's shiny painters are very proud of some liquid tracking shots and plenty of atmospheric lighting. Fabrizio Sforza's gnarly make-up of F / X, Simon Boswell's nicely spooky'n'shuddery score, and the dank, dark, cobweb-cylinder set hit all leather-crawling spot. Well worth watching.
