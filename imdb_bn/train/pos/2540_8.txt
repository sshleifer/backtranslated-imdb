Although they are not as famous as some of their other collaborations (such as Black CAT and Body SNATCHER), although it was a painful little horror film, casting decisions were somewhat odd. Boris Karloff Dr. Jones plays Rukh, a strange scientist who lives in Carpathian Hills - where Dracula's home town is located. Bela Lugosi Dr. Benit plays - whose nationality is never heard in the French language. I think there really is a sense of two switch roles, because Carpathian is considered to be tailor-made for the role Lugosi - especially with its pronunciation. However, despite this unusual twist, still did two excellent works. Carloof had played a major role, but Logosi was innocent as a relatively normal person - something that he did not play very often in movies !! It seems, Dr. Rukh is a bit of a pariah, because other scientists (especially Bennett) think his theories are odd and irrational However, during filming, Rukh was correct and Bennet, especially his new appreciation for the rook, was generous. But, unfortunately, the surprising new material discovered by Roit has had a bad effect on turning him into a crazy killing machine (if you happen to do not hate it?). Although it can become a simple story of becoming a simple scientist, but the plot was well-formed, the letters improved nicely and were not a standard killer, but it was complex and interesting. <br /> <br /> Movies will be enjoyed by others without those who hate old horror films. You can really say that Universal Pictures dragged all the stops, and both Luigi and Karloff have made big budget films instead of cheap cheap accidents, which unfortunately underestimated in the following years. Good thing
