When I was the first little kid I saw this movie and fell in love with it. The sets are breathing and some scripts are extraordinary sunny: "You are the sons of thousands fleas". <br /> <br /> This is always shown on late TV at night or really in the morning I woke up about 3:00 and it just started. The TV company will have to show a little more respect and keep it to the Prime Minister on Sunday so that everyone can see this fine work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
