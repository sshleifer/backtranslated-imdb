I must admit to enjoy bad movies. I love them I watch them all. Especially Horne My friends and I all gather at school and after the rigorous week of work, hire some crazy tape, order a pizza and have an explosion. This was a great box, so I was less expected than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a housing project that is built on a nuclear facility, which bulldozed soil layers above it, and the other is just covered by the underground layers. Finds the advantage of this neighborhood's covered children when some children fall into a hole inside the cave. Some of these zombies awoke. <br /> <br /> From this point, it's a city hijacking. The effects and actions of the womb will never stop till the credit rolls up. <br /> <br /> It's not a great art, but it's his joke, the dialogue and the most wonderful things were our favorite. Indeed, it was one of the best "Party Tape" which was the joy of seeing me ever. And you could say no money with a bunch of crazy people, it is done. Hundreds of jumboes, and director Brendan Fraser (he has a Kyomao), and it's just a wild trip.
