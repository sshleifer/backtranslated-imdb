Best Film on Bit Street Breaking Street Spot everything about it, clothes (puma), music and dance most importantly! The storyline is basic, but hey have to tell a story? The whole point of the film was to show the children what they were doing at that moment, which was important to them. It shows that teens are generally good, everything related to these daily kids was music, dance and friendship. Recently watching the DVD I was very surprised to see how much time it is! The clothes did not see the dates (Possible because Puma is now returning to the massive), the music still looks fresh and the animations are still alive to watch. As a part of their youth culture, a movie of 10-25 years old will be seen.
