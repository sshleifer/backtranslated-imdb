Robin Williams tries his best to combine comedy and pathogens, but a little currents come out. Donald Moffat is the very one note as his father-in-law. For the fourth time Jeff Bridges is wonderful, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reid are fantastic, it carries the film through most rough spots. It's nicely filling in time, but a little more than that.
