This game is amazing. Really, if you do not have it you will get it. Although it was amazing when it came to ancient times now. I believe that this game will always be a classic. It's just as good as a super mario world. When I was young, my friend and I used to sit and finally tried to beat this game. It is not nearly as advanced as the Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a fellow Mario fan it is essential. It's fun, entertaining and challenging. Apart from the good graphics you want to get out of anything fantasy games (it comes out well in 1996.) 4 Eva Mario Luigi and Joshi !!! Nintendo is the best!
