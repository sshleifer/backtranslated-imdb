Generally, as a fan of fanciful fans and Neil Guyman *, I am so worried about this picture, so much so that I can do so with the fear of hunger and unexpectedly and frustrating, seldom believe it here. And you know what? I'm not scared, the film's version is awesome Unlike the book, but in a good way - less radioactive, more ridiculous, still deep sweet and striking. <br /> <br /> Special effects are absolutely spot-on and think magic is the natural and right part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> British Comedy's "Who's Who" - Rupert Everett, Little Britain fame David Walliyam, two blocks of Green Wing), most of the best lines and most of the movie's most fun moments, . Actually, a small criticism of all my films is that, sometimes the comedy elements become a little more oti, leaving the window for the separation of the main story ... Riki Garv√≠s's camio, for example, my choice "Ricky Garvis is much more than his usual David Brent's office comedy personality" and in my opinion, it is impossible to make magical magical stories What is made and the flashing interval. (Although, ideally, I remember the original book WAS commendable "Ricky Gervises" - I believe it when I believe in the character of Ferdi). <br /> <br /> But it is a minor spots thrown with a good mix of actions and romance in an otherwise silently and scribbled fairy. The character of Tristan Cox's Bazar character is needed for the story of Cox's Bazar's casual, exquisite comedy and self-realization of the story where "the humble young man looks for life changing search". Clayer Danes, like Yewin, is beautiful, captivating and a little distracted or miraculous, the perfect interpretation of his starry role; Robert De Niro speaks to the critics of the camera, is desperate to be praised, enjoying a lot of fun (looks like he also got a ball) ... and Michelle Pfeiffer is wildly lavish and nasty. Overall film performance. If you are in the recent "Hyperpres", its delicious B! Enjoy tiny performance, but you will also enjoy it completely. So close this review: you will surely laugh, make sure smile, and you can even cry - Stardust is a beautiful, heart-warm fairy tale for all the family, with the heart of gold and more chess' s smarts Immediately clear. One of my favorite favorite movies is the Pretty Princess Bride, and Stardust is very easily compared to it because it's a similar type of movie and a similar type of movie search .... And just like Princess Bride, after 20 years of her initial release, Smart and funny, I believe StarDost's delicious tongue-in-cheek sweet is ours. Libhisanagulira (or similar device in the future!) Will be shown as a family favorite for many years.
