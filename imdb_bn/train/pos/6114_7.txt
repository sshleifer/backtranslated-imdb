In 2001, the hit "My Sassy Girl" is a genuine sweet film, but most of the time is encouraged. The biggest applause is to go to Lead two. Ha-Neil Kim sweet and comedy both, Sang-woo Kwon both interesting and rebellious. Chemistry between two is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyong-Heyong Kim uses some CGI-Inserts to highlight the chili pepper and also provide spectacular battle scenes which can shine at the Shang-Wai. I highly liked him much than "overdrawing high" overrated And that boy has a future - who looks, who is the war strategy, and a romantic lead. not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can summarize it: nice pictures. My rating: 7/10
