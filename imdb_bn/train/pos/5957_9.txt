The title is telling all. <br /> <br /> I'm not a movie critic, nor will I work as a rest of the commenter in this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie has millions of taka budgets, but the plot was done very well, the performance was extraordinary and cinematography was great! Looks like you had so much fun to create this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 because the sound was strong in only one channel instead of both, but I imagine it could be an error in DVD recording. <br /> <br /> I must check out other movies produced by brain damage films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, Cast & Crew, I thank you!
