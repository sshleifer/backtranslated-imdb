"Most of us live in at least two worlds, the real world where we are in the situation and the world, mercy, unconsciousness, safe place where we can escape ..." with those words, Mr. The mass "Maxx" is an impressive world where the imagination and reality are combined. Inspired by Sam Keith's joke books, "Max" is very loyal to the material that was inspired, not only in the story, but also in the graphic style, which looks like comic pages. Surreal and unique look. However, this story is interesting and entertaining. It can be very weird in moments, but when you enter it, it's hard to get out of it. The stories and the characters are wonderfully developed. The music goes perfectly with the style of the show and it gives the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, many good animated shows are good, this was a short-written one. "Maxx" must be seen. It's my favorite one of all time.
