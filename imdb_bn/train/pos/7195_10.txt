I like this exotic Republic Serial! The story I saw was the best one! Even harder, the quality of the photo was not good, but OK. The fence in this serial is also a bad, but not terrible. They should only practice some more. I said the story is good! You're just sitting there and waiting to find Don Dell Aro! Theme music is excellent! This is the same person who slammed the music of the rare version of Walt Disney, who was a Phoenix Lezian music maid. Clothing and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and so legioners! I highly recommend this serial. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I love Reid Haddley Zoro! He's funny, smart and brave! Mark: 6.
