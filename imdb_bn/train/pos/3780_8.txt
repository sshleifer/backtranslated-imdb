My second scene was a few years later, I got to understand two things in this movie: 1) I enjoyed it, and 2) because its execution is firmly sharp compared to its warrant itself. I had laughed through the movie before it happened to me to renew my initial protests - ValleyIPPak and logo and ventilation (even * good * - flexible aviation) is not naturally funny, especially when it comes out of the length characteristics. However, the motion of the film begins to look at the end, and exhibits the extraordinary feeling of comic timing across even more brutally-written jokes (such as Ted) in Revis and Winter and Saddler (and Hall in London in an unforgettable scene). Witter (such as challenge) works easily as it fails to recognize a specific inhabitation of Hell. And the Winter and Reeves teams have so well clicked that Bill and Ted's teamwork (who spend a scene split in the whole movie, if they do not match well, disaster) are completely unknowingly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wonderfully good fun
