It is one of the best military films ever made. And it's great because its focus on the value. This is a great human interest story that promises a commitment to respect, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Excellent in the main roles of Gooding and Denio Karl Brush's determination, drive, and yes, with the feeling of respect, Master Chief's racism is getting attracted to respect and love. The headline indicates their bond source. I did not look at this issue at last by seeing how bright the screenplay of Carl Lambley's Karl's father Mac Brasseri was. In this case, it is the foundation stone of the film, it is the memory of Karl's memories, which helps him to carry on difficult times. <br /> <br /> I'm about to choose which movies I've bought. This is one of the rare ones that I want on my rare. It will be seen many times in the future, I'm sure.
