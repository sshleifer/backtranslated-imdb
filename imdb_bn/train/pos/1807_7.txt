This is one of the first films I can remember, or perhaps the first one. We lived in the world of beautiful pictures, violence and intoxicants rather than introducing a beautiful baby. Babe, a little bit of casino and Constantine, all these mix well in a carton, and we get this. I do not really know whether it's a rating for kids, but I think it was very cool, very funny and fun. Even when I see hatred, there can be a good end to a film (clearly a carton) and disasters can occur because every character must be a happy ending. But it was right, he just went to heaven. They're just like that. <br /> <br /> It's a critics, it's a good movie, something new. Touch very much and I have to go
