I must say, I was surprised by the quality of the movie. It was much better than expected. The scenario and acting are quite good. The director did well as well. Although some scenes look a little upset, it's overall a decent movie. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself to the very end. The emotional hospital atmosphere is given quite well. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought out. Because the line of the story is very attentive, some people may find it a bit annoying and they take time to develop character and stories. The moral of the story, it's a decent movie for its genre and it's surprisingly well.
