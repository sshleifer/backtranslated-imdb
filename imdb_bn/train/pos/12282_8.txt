At first I did not like it, though I did it. They did not include the third truba generation, did not elaborate love between Blanca and Pedro, and some actors were different from what I thought. After <br /> I realized that the film has been loyal to the book, it can be five hours long, and it will be kind of tiring. Now I like it because I have portrayed my favorite characters. Clara really looks like an Angel, and her role in film begging is superb, loyal and concise. Glenn Close Fearaula I just painted her like, not only mourn throughout the whole thing. Esteban was not found enough. I never liked his character, and even though I was interested in him, I hated him much while hitting Clara. Like the book, the last part is one of the most exciting and it also has real history. <br /> <br /> The film is really good, especially it was a gringo film based on Latin America. Book. How wonderful are his amazing stars, do you think so?
