I absolutely love this picture! I do not read about it in all other comments related to it. I was completely enthralled by every second! <br /> <br /> I grabbed the story, got acting intense, and got the spot-on-direction. At the end of the movie I have literally in the phone at the time of the phone. Although there was nothing "scary" about the story, I was firmly on the whole film and for the rest of my evening. <br /> <br /> I found that many perfect choices have been made ... casting, scripts, sprinkle a little bit of laughter. There were many points where the film could go for a cheerful thriller, but it never happened, and for me this movie has placed so much on the thriller of the intermediaries that the last moment ... and the year for the last number.
