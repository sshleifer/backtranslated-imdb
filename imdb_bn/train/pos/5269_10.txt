I love bad movies. Not only that because they are often entertained like 'real' movies (like Caribbean series and other Hollywood passos), but they are often much better than those films. And that's why I love Italian Rip by closing the movie in the 1970s and 1980s. And that's why I especially love this movie, The Barbarians and the Company. <br /> <br /> The director Raggero Dedoo has also made many good films, such as the Park of Edge of the House, and his Atlantis interpreter and live like a cave, a fun-like comedy action movie. But this is really bad. Barbarians are so stupid movies. Peter and David Paul, like Barbarian Brothers Kuchak and Gore, are very funny because of lack of performance and lack of talent. But if they can not work, they shout and shout when they make something important. At one stage, people tried to hang the Barbarian Brothers, and they ran away from a very extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad special effects, very stupid stories, bad sides, in fact everything is bad in this movie. I have seen this first time when I can not tell how much smile. Barbarians & Companies Camp Classic Everybody will see once. If you thought Plan 9 was a fun camp from outer space, it would be a real killer.
