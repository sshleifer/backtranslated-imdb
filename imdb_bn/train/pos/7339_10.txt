Since I heard about Ralph Bakhshi version of "The Lord of the Rings": Do I call the 'Rotuscop' animation? !!! Well ... I finally found out ... I have seen this film almost three years ago that there is no idea about any Ralph Bakhshi ... and I liked it ... a lot ... very good story line ... There is also a small character development for a cartoon ... If you are annoyed with contemporary animation then see this ... do not make me wrong ... I'm not saying this is a nice cartoon ... it's a very good movie Very ...
