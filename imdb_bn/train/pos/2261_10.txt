I saw this movie, and the game, and I jumped aloud loudly. Unless I saw this movie I do not know how horrible life was and probably was still for South African children and adults living in that era. It tears in my eyes and saddened my heart that no man should struggle like a struggle to survive, and to bring children out of that area, and to teach them to do their work and to loose and to speak. Their own stories are simply amazing. It only exceeds a five star, I rate it ten. Thank you for such a wonderful story. Mbongeni Ngema Even though this story is said to be 12 years old, it still makes my heart heavy. If there is VHS or DVD, please notify me as ASAP. Thank you. The PS had no wrong with the children who wanted to raise awareness of their problems and conditions, hoping their heart and assistance to help other children's attention.
