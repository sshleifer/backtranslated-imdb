Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. This is a completely unique urban piece, where the whole plot will fail to reveal many things. <br /> <br /> This central theme seems to be the underlying uncertainty of life for every nation, background and station people. But the theme of this film declares that its scope will be severely reduced. Similarly, it makes the pigeons in vain for a certain series. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Finally, I can not even define his central message for myself. <br /> <br /> It still does business with laser precision; Every promotion, dialogue line and background music bar has contributed to its wide range of mood and strong message, which I am amazed and after every visit, it becomes very thoughtful. Still it does not seem at all stuff. A superb film with a great cast and everything done.
