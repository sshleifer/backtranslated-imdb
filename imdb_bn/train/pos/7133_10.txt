Absolutely the best composition of a photo! Good night Tom quickly became one of my favorite films. Nobody will miss this picture, it's great! As a soft parents, John Thaau is portrayed as strictly engrossed elderly parents for Mr Tom to oust William Bech (Nick Robinson) like 'Town Mouse and Country Mouse'. A truly heart-wrenching film. The director knew how to launch the book in the film and he worked very well. This picture has shot so well that the emotions of letters and emotions from the fear of watching the audience are feeling emotions and this emotions can turn into six pins. Set in fluctuation during World War II, this image also shows the difference between city and countryside, they are almost like in many countries. An absolute must see, who is not really unusual in the film and brilliant.
