This movie is very touching. I do not care about what people say about this movie, it's a very good movie. The role of Amitabh Bachchan's role is great, because he wants to teach his son how to live a bit and Akshay Kumar plays weak role in Aditya Thakur. The supporter of Shefali Sethi, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was a wonderful one. Priyanka Chopra had her small role in the movie. The brain has a very good connection to the brain like Ragappa Yadav and the father-in-law of the deceased dancer and the comedy scene is ridiculous. The direction is very good.
