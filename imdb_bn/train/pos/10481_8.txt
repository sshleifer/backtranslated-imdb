A sweet little movie that will not blame your grandmother, "grace to save" seems to be spending half a dozen British comedies in the same dress in the last two years ... The difficulty in finding an adolescent, finding the strength of the challenge and <br /> < br /> Widowed and thus broken, a master gardener in Grace, and his friend / employee Matthew is listed to help her pot plant grow. He's all wrong, so Grace helps him. They realize that he is a suitable person to harvest, that they can benefit from both. He enjoys smoking, he will have to collect money to pay his mortgage. <br /> <br /> Travel to London for some travel travel in London, the white suit John Trivola as "Saturday night fever" and was stopping as a mustache. <br /> <br /> <br /> Blethin has always seen, and you can not talk to many people ... however, I can not. Ferguson was very good, and Taccio Kiero, who liked me as "Nikita" at La Fémé. <br /> <br /> Not very moving or insensitive, but very entertaining, and in 90 minutes, it seems like walking with friends. 8/10.
