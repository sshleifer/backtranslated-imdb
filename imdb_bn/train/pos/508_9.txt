In 2115, Broken Bow, Oklahoma, after a methane shop explosion in his farm, Plugga shot Cliff Clang with a rifle and Klingon was sent to Starfleet Hospital.

Jonathan is treating Klang for completing his crew Ensign Hoshi sato and Dr. Invite Fox and the Valkan sub-commander T-Paul was appointed to participate in the dangerous mission of the enterprise.
