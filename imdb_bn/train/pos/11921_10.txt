This movie is one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen. The whole family is great to see. The ideas can be a little distant, but it's a feeling-good comedy and great acting. Love a little boy, j P. And part of Academy Award winner Adrina Brody is very small, but it can be very memorable. Highly recommended.
