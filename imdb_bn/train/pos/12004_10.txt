This film is a true and historical film. It is very useful for those who study LDS church, because it is 100% true. This is a nice movie and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is very practical, exciting and inspirational. Some people think that this is not real, but it is. <br /> <br /> It is about the resurrection of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Santos, and the restoration of the prophet Joseph Smith. Such an incident happened in his life when he was a young boy, his wife Emma Smith, her wife Emma, ​​birthdays, etc. But most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church.
