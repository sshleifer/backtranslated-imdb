Thats my first one at a very entertaining show by Bush Parker and Stone, I thought. This is often very funny, and its quite devastating and crazy. South Park fans will surely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the production value here. A lot of money must be placed in this, and it shows. A lot of expensive little details. This is not a little show. And comedy Central is not a very rich channel, but they must have given so much to this show. One way I realized that the death of the show was also very expensive. It has certainly been cheaper and there was a will. <br /> <br /> Critics liked it and had a little fan base, but it failed to achieve a big audience. We know that the show is closed after 8 episodes, which I guess is about 1 season. <br /> <br /> I really liked the show that it was its fault. The problem of the show is that it does not know exactly what it wants to be. Like this, it is a sitcom and at the same time tries to be a sitcom parody. Actors do a good job, and some of them are well casted, but in my opinion they do not seem to get 100% of malicious humor they are supposed to present always. <br /> <br /> I personally think there were a few more characters on Earth in the show show. In the South Park you have Kyle and Stan, which is the realistic realization of the lonely universe. I think what kind of works south park works. You need some realistic characters that you can add to realistic and it makes insane elements even more interesting because it forces you to take it at some level seriously. If everything is difficult to mentally add to the archaeological and stereotype, which is really my biggest problem in Bush. Kyle and the character of Stan South Park which makes sense of madness. We do not have anything here, and this show is suffering from it. <br /> <br /> Another Anchorpoint is flirting with Parker and Stones Republicans. The only thing about them is that I'm not really trying to do what they are. Bush has nothing else to say except statue. Homer Simpsons is a kind of romance character confusing in a world where many people can not stand him and think he is the worst president and the parallel comedy world from Nixon's parallel comedy, and so he just wanders his every move ... But Parker and Stone are actually He understands the meaning of any meaning by him. It's like our ideology, but it does not hit the mark anyway. It seems weird, because it does not remind you of Bush. <br /> <br /> I really thought the show was very enjoyable. Here are some jokes funny. Pro-Life supporter who was a living pregnant fetus is probably one of those my favorite joke by them. And the show is packed with great ingredients, and sometimes it is very funny if you use a little head while watching it.
