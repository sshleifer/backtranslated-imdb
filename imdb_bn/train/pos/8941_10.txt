I really enjoyed watching this movie about Delany Sister. I knew about them, but that was all. This movie opened my eyes to my brutality and courage. What a pair Sacrificing what they live in their own terms. This is not only for African Americans, but also for all Americans. It is a history lesson and a documentary combined with a roll in and an entertaining cinema biography. The performance was superior by all of the included and we really got a glimpse of the difficulties these two sisters went for many years. Both sisters are quite different from each other. They came from a very loving and very rigid family with high, perhaps even perfectness even impossible. Sadie's father refused to allow her daughter to see her boyfriend due to possible misunderstandings. I recommend this movie thoroughly and I am happy that I used to take it on television in another day.
