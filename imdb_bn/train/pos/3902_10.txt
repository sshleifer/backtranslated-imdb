I heard about Eddie Ezard, but I never saw him. I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw he was in HBO last night, I kept it, I did not know how my husband would react. Well, he blew us away. He was even better than Robin Williams. He has total control over viewers; When he 'did not die - did he?', The routine does not know what to think until the end of the audience. God is also an inspirational touch as James Mason and his version of Paithan Spanish exploration conducted by the Church of England - 'Cakes or Deaths?' Invaluable My jaw was injured by smiling at the show. A few months after we were able to see him again scoured the TV list, and later he came lucky enough to tap him. If you have the opportunity to see this show, cancel everything and tap it, you will not be disappointed.
