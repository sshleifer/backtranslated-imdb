Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's St. Evas, during the Napoleonic War, the film tells the story of the violent young French Hussein captain (Gene Mark Bar). Taken to the war, he sent the prisoner of the Scottish Highlands war camp operated by Major FaruKar (Richard E. Grant), so that he fell in love with a local girl (Ana Freil), Major, and discovered that his long lost grandfather, who was in the midst of revolution Ran away from France, he just lives in the street! All cast and spirited performances from some memorable lines offer this an above average.
