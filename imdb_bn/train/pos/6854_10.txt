A brilliant, stylish, and compelling thriller from Brian de Palmer, a modern classic, which is firmly among his best films! <br /> <br /> When a wicked housewife is strangely murdered by strange strangers, the victim's boy joins him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> De Palma is a fantastic dramatic story that starts with an incentive setup and strong The mystery makes it full of an annoying mystery. The end and the conclusions, especially during 'night time'. This is the actual edge of your seat Shankar. Even more impressive, though, is the dazzling aspect of De Palmer, which not only gives tight suspension to the film, but it is a unique and dark environment. The kill dress is also a very erotic film, but mainly a strange beautiful way. Pino Donaggio is also a beautiful musical score film film. <br /> <br /> Another powerful feature of this movie is Michael Kain is an awesome turn as a psychologist. Angie Dickenson is as wonderful as Wicked Housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as a involved street-walker is tough. A young man Keith Gordon also proved a worthy supporter as the investigator's son. <br /> <br /> De Palma criticized the film for many Hitkocian elements, and this picture was no exception. However, any of the hits and de polomas can be seen only as a good quality of Hitcock's work, due to the call, a 'rip off' will be reduced to a fine fine thriller. For fans of all the filmmakers killed in Shahidul, of course, must be seen. <br /> <br /> **** ****
