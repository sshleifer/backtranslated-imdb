This show starts with the great mystery episode. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the short episodes started with Shaggy, Scuppy Doo and Scrappy Doe. <br /> <br /> I think Hannah repeatedly had to make changes to 20-minute episodes in small episodes. Some of the voice actors became unavailable. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became unavailable. Velma's voice has changed in the first 12 episodes, because the first voice actress was unhelpful while playing Velma. <br /> <br /> The network has repeatedly ordered the studio to create shaggy, skub do and more shorts. Scrappy doo, because the rating was high So they had to make more shorts. I wish the 15th episode was like mystery. It's still a good show.
