I wonder how much I enjoy this image I thought it was funny, sexy, painful, and warm. Andy McDowell's performance was humble and weak. At one time, McDowell's film director did not make his beauty another character in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is beautiful and it's a very good game. His relationship with his friends is both a thorn and a sand in his life. Emailed Stalinson, who was MVP in many British movies, did a great job. There have been some tragedies, but I think the film is endowed with brilliant acting, clean and malicious writings. The quality of the movie is excellent and the music is good, although the soundtrack is unavailable.
