This movie is awesome. Type, type It's really a lot to say, or a lot, but it's a stupid movie to see why it's stupid to watch. High school bad students are all accepted by ms.togar love, rock and roll that one thing hates. riff randle ramones get everyone's tickets for the show, and this film peaks led to my riff randle and ramones taking school adoption. This movie contains everything, a bad script, suspicious directions, bad actor (i.e., Clint Howard and PJ Souls), a great soundtrack, extreme campaign, these elements and much more, which is a classic. <br /> Note - During the live ramon set, notice Vitamy's Derby Crash front of the crowd. Neat-oh
