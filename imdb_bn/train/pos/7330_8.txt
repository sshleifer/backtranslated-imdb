This film is Frank Frazzietty, mythological fiction painting. Some characters are straight out of his painting (Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages to maintain the feeling of the original industry. Bocci heavy use of his rotoscope (strategy to trace live action sequence) and this image is no exception. However, the film is quite realistic (all characters people), it works well. <br /> <br /> But here's what I like: Plot: Once we have interesting characters and wonderful sequence of characters, a really terrible villain and a superb babe. This movie is a sensation of the best Canaan comics, not surprisingly, Roy Thomas is the author of our favorite Symillion Marvel Series! Many of these cats live from the live action kanan, not to talk about these b-movies. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommend!
