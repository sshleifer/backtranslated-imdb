This film did very well in 1932 and probably will not work today because its style is a bit old and transformed. However, if you are sort of like me, like me, who respected the old Hollywood movie, you push the film a bit and enjoy it for it - an attractive soap. <br /> <br /> The problem is set in a ward for pregnancy. This large room has about half a dozen beds waiting to give birth to women - but doctors are concerned about possible complications (ie - such a room will really hit the mother!). And, like an episode of "love boat" or "fantasy island", each mother has her own special story. With so extreme and crazy stories, you have to suspend unbelief. I could enjoy the film a bit more. <br /> <br /> Here are some stories: One involves father. You do not see mom, but she is very, very nervous parents and it is included for the comic relief. However, he was surprising here - very touching. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are sad. Loretta was sent to the hospital from prison - he apparently killed some horrible people. You did not know exactly what happened, but you're guessing that he is trying to force himself to do it! Yet he was given a 20-year sentence - and his husband was dedicated to him and beside him as much as possible next to him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is quite funny and worth seeing through mostly photos. I like to drink a gin filled hot water bottle, when he learns that he can not sell his pair! At the end of the film, a general Hollywood-style change heart that was about to touch - I felt it. <br /> <br /> There is a woman, who still gave birth to a baby. Surprisingly, later, they put the lady back in the same ward as women are waiting to give birth !!! A crazy female, you think some time ago lost a baby, wanders from the psychological unit. He insists that he has a child. Later, she ran away and actually took the kids! <br /> <br /> There are many stories but I have mentioned the main thing. I said, this is a soap opera and it is very entertaining - and quite sad in the case of several stories. In the end, especially, the heart is broken and exceptionally well. The head nurse, especially Farrell and Alain McMahon, has done particularly well. After all, a very good movie - and I do not think why they thought they had to rebuild the film after a few years (which was ideal for Warner Brothers).
