When I saw it as a child, it answered all my questions and removed any fear or wrong thoughts from me. It's animated because it's easy to watch, which makes it stupid. There is no moral bias or "preacher" direction, so nobody has any objection. This is a beautiful movie which gives only assured, menstrual information through the "subject-true" way. I hope to show this to my daughter.
