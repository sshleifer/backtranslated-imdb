Lawrence Fishburn is a fine actor and deserves respect for this effort, but he does not have a class with great Shakespeare like Olivier and Wales; And he's more suffering from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always bright, clearly stole away from the show. Olivia recognized its production potential, and Iago Cast with someone she knew could have uprooted. I almost did not understand the possibilities of Shakespeare's worst character, Iowa, but Branag shows our depth. Very nice to see the views of Venice too.
