Do you think it was difficult? You should check this film. Carl Brasier is the symbol of courage and determination. This man had to go through a naval diver, all of us should be encouraged. And notably, after seeing this movie, I learned that even half of it is not! Cuba Gooding, Junior Brasier made his best work. De Niro, as well as the Southern Trainer who trained him as well. George Tilman has only made Quantum Leap as his second major feature (after "Soul Food") filmmaker. If you want to move and inspire, you definitely need to check this one.
