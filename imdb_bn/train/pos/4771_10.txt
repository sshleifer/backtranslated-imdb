The two bright career Zinta David Lynch, less accessible element, a subtle and subtle story around the most unlikely compound of crafts. A man travels to see his troubled brothers. Having no other means of transport, his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawn mower. Richard Farnsworth, in his last film, played the role of acting a stunningly level and nuanced performance. Wonderful, delightful little story, a classic movie experience that should not be missed. Notable as a daughter of Sansi Spesk of Farnasworth, a mad middle-aged woman lives with her children's loss.
