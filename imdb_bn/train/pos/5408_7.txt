Among the Pokemon films (which are the most suitable creators for me): Pokemon first movie, Pokémon 4 Ever, Pokémon Heroes, Pokémon 200, and Pokémon: NT and unknown, perhaps it is the most beautiful, the most beautiful and the most quiet one about the environment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />). The movie theme is well presented during the movie and Team Rocket (Comic Relief / Rubbish Beds) ends with a good mess and ends with more original characters than sidekicks. <br /> <br /> These flaws are always, unnecessary violence and action, and Badi is quite unusual, even more than Pokemon films are worse. <br /> <br /> A peculiar pokemon is being tracked by a huntsman in the jungle. A young boy tried to save Pokémon and took him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Missy are entering a big forest ... <br /> <br /> Curiosity? See the rest ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy all Pokémon fans and "American" anime good for movie fans, "Pokemon 4 Ever"! :-)
