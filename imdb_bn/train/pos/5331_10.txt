Just miss the first half hour on the sky TV. I wonder if it's a true story so it finally saw it. There was no short word to say what happened to everyone. It reminds me of speed, but at the end of the day I do not think it was released in the film because we saw the following error. We found that the cave removed the bone (Hood) and then there are two shots in the car when it tries to slow down when the car is trapped. It was at the edge of my seat, especially when I thought that the bridge was going to decrease and of course the bridge would not be reduced and it was then. I was frightened in tears, not so bad !!!!
