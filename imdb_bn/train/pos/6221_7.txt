If this image was well kept together, it would be best with Astaire and Rogers. As such, it is a fine film, but the ultimate long-lasting theorem, which means that Roger's sister Randolph romances Harriet Hillier (this turns Ozir Nelson's wife to the baby boomers) romantic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two navy men in Scott. Scott, for the first time, saw Halider as a stereototype librarian, and after Zinger Rogers asked her friend (a blonde but unreliable lasile ball) after asking her glamor. Meanwhile, Astaire tried to leave where he and his old dance partner. The result was amazingly different from the number of dance figures, as a team with Astiar and Rogers: "I'm putting all my eggs in one basket," "let yourself go," and "I'll lead the band." Heyler turns a sweet, glamorous little girl like a sweet but a little general, though he sings two songs well, "But where are you?" And "Drop me behind, Satan" - A poster did not take care of that song, but I love the title. Rogers vivid, and a young man Astaire is a dynamo. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie is ultimately written and of course one of the most brutally executed by Rogers and Astaire. In the, they are '30's glamor and imagination.It is really and treasured and is seen again.
