Salino really moved me with his deep painted characters. The challenge between two brothers is simple story, it was not about hatred or jealousy only. I liked the movie most, how Jigi came to know about her feelings, especially when her mother was taken to her home town in Italy and remembered to join her film festival festivals Film Awards. It was so frustrating to see this character of such a struggle in his characteristic dreams and his innate duties towards his mother. Even so, when he made another attempt to reach his father, he was brave. And in real life, for example, most parents can not cross their walls to reach their children. I could even have been acquainted with the brother of Giancarlo, who was so confident and became so insecure during his elder brother. A really nice film that made me smile and cry.
