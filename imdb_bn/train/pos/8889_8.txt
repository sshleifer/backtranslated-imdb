I lived at that time and I think the program has caught the heart of the era. I think it will have to deal more with the Afro-American issue but I think it covers many programs in the program. Seeing the riots in TV and fearing the clock, they were afraid that they could not reach your family as far as it could not burn. I've done a great job illustrating a veta illustration coming back from Jerry O'Connell's war. I went to school with those guys who came back. Some have changed a lot more than others and some do not. When someone comments that no problem is covered enough or it is not enough, it bothers me. Live through it and then comment on it. I was great in movies and it was that everyone did a tremendous job. Thank you for a trip down memory lane (sad and good).
