Japanese animations have unique independent freedom with animation, which is why they are able to come out with movies, which eventually end up with Enam-fans hard drive and college students end up on the floor, but most of them are totally totally ignored and out of their country. Cat soup is one of the movies that is believed to be analyzed from western eyes, in drugs or deeply. Really, this is simply a neatly detailed spiritual journey. <br /> <br /> There is no real conversation, which makes it easy for other interested parties to be reluctant to do things like subtitles. Imagine a cat and her half dead (brain dead?) Sister and travel through various landscapes of the association. There is a general theme of water, or its lack (probably due to the sinking cat at the beginning? Perhaps due to the title?). There is an interesting sort of Genesis. There is a pig that gets itself to eat. An elephant made of water. And it's superb, engaging, exciting, and fun - if you do not see it around a drug that does not get a visually unique experience than an acid trip. Eventually the film itself stops, adds another interesting self-reaction level to the proceeding. <br /> <br /> - Paul Olar CDIB
