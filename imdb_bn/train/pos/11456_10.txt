Andy Goldwarthy, the first author of a first order, reveals the path through his first epic art. Indeed, the time and the changes are fundamentally about what his work is about. I bought her first book several years ago and my family has been surprised at it a lot. So it was a treat for the artist to know personally through this film, he hoped that as patient and gentle as you would be and would say some wonderful things about the normal world, the deepest in him is sometimes impossible, Like most children who can play abroad alone (if they do anything else), before making the things from the staff and sand and mud and snow. To give Mr. Goldswarte a deep perspective of nature, a mission was given to increase gifts and such a game, and in bright new ways we had to open our often tired eyes. And always with a scary, and wonderful beggar, with absolute respect, gratitude and humor.
