At the Santa Barbara International Film Festival last weekend, I had the pleasure of being present at the Pacific and Edia screening. When I was frustrated across an article in Jalaos Magazine, the film attracted my attention. Interesting during the interesting, but nothing very exciting. However, I saw it at the festival event and decided to test it. All I can say is that I was speechless when the last credit roll started. It's a nice and refreshing movie that I've seen a while. Photography, art direction, acting, and especially guidance, was stupid and stupid. There is nothing 'spellbound' for you in this movie and actually thinks of you. Something that is currently doing the exact opposite of most movies. The conversation is carefully prepared and although this script is not the wall of the wall, but the letters are very deliberate and meaningful. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a movie that is a second watch and the more you see it, the more things you aim for. This is a very layered and intelligent film. Not sure when or where it is played again, but a particular course for movie enthusiasts must be seen.
