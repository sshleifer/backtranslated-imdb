The carefully written dialogue of Simon's is really done by Matthau and Bern. You can literally hear crack crackle. There are some movies that can make such relationships between actors and scripts. For example, the famous reunion scene may be too low with low-quality actors involved. Methu seems to have been born to play Willy Clarke (of course, the strange couple's Oscar Morso), and with a slight curiosity and method, he made a sequence of mathu character (the line where he argues that he is with him, he lives in the city, when Luis is "out of touch "It's the best performance I've ever seen in an actor playing this role in living in the country." To be made, it may be dramatic or funny or whatever else. Duration Matthau and Barnes work together together; Simon's gorgeous thrust accentuuates during the creation of ridiculous contrasts painted in their reflections. This movie only "must be seen" and claims to be a suitable honorable place on film history pages.
