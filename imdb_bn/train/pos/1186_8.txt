Many conversations have been made about "Psychological Westerns", but it is rarely the same in that style. It is big and large, big and big stars Stuart Granger lost his British Safari Hunter stereoateip, which could play Huffard retired torch hunter, who is known as the best in the West. Robert Taylor plays early (unlike normal young beginnings, Taylor's character is middle-class), who wants to kill the torch and Greners love to do business with her. They include one of their biggest names, actor Lloyd Nolan and Rash Tumblr, in their skin. Granger was scared of the torch that killed, knew that if they were extinct, they could blame, to know if they were extinct, American American living would be greatly damaged. Taylor soon expresses a sadistic side, but it is a realism, created by nerds and dorks, in contrast to one dimensional sadists of modern film. She needs insecure, and man's companion. Yet he will not stop killing. The last two pits against each other, with a wonderful conclusion. They are well illustrated with the psychological effects of what they are doing.
