It's a quirky movie that brits are not so good. Low budget, role of camio type, good execution The story is a little weak, recently the widow Judy Deck decides to surround a all-female band in London during the war and surround her "blond bombardle". The compulsory boy / girl thinks that he's got a rib. The film lets youngsters see that they do not have exclusive control over their feelings, love and even the blacksmith! "Old wrinklies" may laugh very well Judy Dench was always as great, a grace we did not see, I did not see anything "Blond Bomb Explosions, I thought I was the last one, I thought that David Jason had made Patrick better than Ian Homom, though he was just enough like" Transvestite "drummer Enough was enough for all the lovely movies for a night with girls :)
