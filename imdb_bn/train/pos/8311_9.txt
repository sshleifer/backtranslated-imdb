I really liked this movie, it was good, and the actors were brilliant! Richard and many other classic singers who played Leon Robinson, very good at his work, when you see him in a musical movie, you know it's going to be good! If I want to know more about Richard, people will see heart warming, sad, and special movies! Distinguished! Fresh!
