Is it a good idea to use Live Animals to display a department store window? <br /> <br /> No, and here's why .... <br /> <br /> "Hire Conditional" bug is sold, the promotion is over and the store manager (Nelson) is moving him to a new division: Tax Darmy . Naturally, bugs and fun begins. <br /> <br /> Using almost every department in the shop (Children's wear, sports, shoes, dresses, women's nightgown - do not ask.), the bugs come up and each turn even mentions the manager as "Great GilderSNEEZE". Even if caught on the edge of the elevator, the bugs make the situation better. <br /> <br /> The director blanks (such as Bug, Nike) and Nelson (such as Bags, Nike) and is always at the top of his paintings. Manager - who makes sounds like the radio staple Gilderslives - ask your grandfather). <br /> <br /> and the sage word of advice: Check your ears when a vague woman encounters to try on the chapters in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Sriram centric", yet the best argument for animal labor law.
