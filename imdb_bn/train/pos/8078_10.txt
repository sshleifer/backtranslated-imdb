Although it was a disaster at the box office, this is my favorite movie. This gives the family a strong message. There are many violence in it and there is a song with a bunch of girls at Bikinis. Compared to other Bollywood movies, the action scenes of this movie are more realistic. This is the incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see Indian Godfather, Amitabh has portrayed this film. Do not read reviews by critics, they are just unconscious. This film has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially the action. So if you want to see more realistic steps than Muin Hoon (still good movie) but it's movie.
