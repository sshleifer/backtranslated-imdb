A very unique movie directed by Streetfoot (Ur Konskin) animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It's the film's oddity, and it's so valuable to see. It is a live action mixed with animation, which probably affects Disney's legendary song of southern, often responding to its reaction. Phillip Michael Thomas, later famous for being the Vice President of Miami Vice's Don Johnson, and the role of Kakrick's The Shining, ran to the prison with Scoutman Croth. Charles Gordon and Barry White (yes, Barry White) is a friend of Thomas and plans to help him escape from prison. They are stuck in a police road blockade, and Crohthers tells a story about a black rabbit, a bear and a fox that goes from the south to Harlem, to find another more peaceful eternal existence. The story is animated, and a lot of wonderful things to watch are available. Like all the pictures in the box, most will be annoyed and dislike animations. The true animation lovers will quickly apologize and fall in love with their innovation. The film is very violent, very sexual, and it is mostly about fighting between races. For a long time, I thought I was looking somewhat important, but after a while, especially after seeing this, it seemed like a run-of-the-mill blackspelow flick, just like a superfluous. It's too drunk and really does not say anything. Is not it white? Whatever the answer, Coonskin / Streetfight is still worth a lot of observers watching for fans of afi√≥nionados and worshiping movie fans. 7/10
