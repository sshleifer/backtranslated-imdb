Despite the sharpness of the first, there is still a pair of legendary stories and dialogues in Bagas' journal, not to mention a ridiculous performance of William Saddler, who brought a humorous side to the depth of the grape planter. For the new game, see for the best moments of the whole movie, but one of the great strategies used to justify the practice. <br /> <br /> While still packed with comedies, this film has a more dramatic movie, part is more serious and risks more risky. <br /> <br /> It gives a great dimension to the film and another beautiful feature.

The fantasy genre is again spotted using this amazing time travel device, though it is a bit confusing, a bit confusing over time, and the objects and situations are set before present, such as final couple scenes. <br /> <br /> The first scene I hate this sigl, but the second was the original fun because I appreciated the more and the story, and the joke and plot is not as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey is good enough for the purpose, the joke and it A good nature family felt a fairly steady plot to film.
