I like this movie sort of to remind me about my wedding. It's very clear you can see it with the family. Very nicely done. The song is very fine. I think the author's director is great. The movie shows how progress through time of marriage. In their lives there are couple of different stages of life and their relationship to life, this story is beautifully portrayed in parallel phase at several stages. The dialog is some good The film portrays complex human emotion with dramatists very nicely. Also looks perfect is not so perfect at all. It looks new when the nicely arranged wedding dynamics. The movie is very well written and directed.
