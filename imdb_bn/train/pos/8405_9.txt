I'm proud to have a copy of the 70's Crown International Drive-in Sedlotation Comedy Cheese this choice. It's really a fantastic and enjoyable overflowing flick with it's fantastic breezy'nasy 70's vibe. It is a cool set of impressive wheels and tries to create a sincere point of heart for genuine love and friendship than the faster part of the tail. Of course, it is basically an intelligent teenage male fantasy picture - the main teen Gophass character Bobby Hamilton gets the opportunity to showcase the girls, respect his friends, and blame a local van-racing - but it is also very dopey and way to hate nature. As Gates's main object of affection, Gauitz's fondness of love is Stewart Gates created a sincere Dark Lead, Deborah White is a definite comedy, Connie Lisa Marie is also quite as delightful as a beautiful blonde babe and Niferno Stefan Oliver (60's Bike) Anniversary film annually ) Brutish Dugan Hicks is as surprisingly hateful. Especially the pre-Stardom Danny Davito Gate's cranky owner is a complete riot, as a boss Andy, a genuine cannant ner-du-well slab that wears a very ugly high Hawaiian shirt and suffers from serious gambling habit. I especially love the scene where two lips beat Danny fiercely - one puts arms behind him while another man works with Danny's smoke! And Sammy Johns' shocking Fuku Hit Theme song will jump around your pillars for at least a week. In short, it's great fun of Great Groovy Retro-70!
