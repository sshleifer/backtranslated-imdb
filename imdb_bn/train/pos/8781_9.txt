I consider myself as a container of boxing cinema, and the only thing that prevents me from calling the best movie called "Gentleman Jim". Robert Weiss / Paul Newman Flick "Coed Up Up Likes" The movie can be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is a close number 2. <br /> <br /> This movie is James Jay. Not only growing the rise of the carpet, it also shows boxing sports. Transfer is a very important time. Boxing at the end of the 1800s, the more "courtesy" days of glide from the fierce day of Ben-Fictitious rules, the Queen's Law was moving away from Marquis. And the game was moving away from a day when it was an illicit sight and during acceptance and respect. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" that day is not a realistic look. It's romantic and yes, even a bit of hokey at times. But it's always fun. Errol Flynn "Gentleman" is perfect as a gym that is not really a "respectable" but a working class family is not a fast talker. Alexis Smith is a high-ranking woman with whom she has a love / hate relationship (and we all know, of course, that match will ultimately win). <br /> <br /> "Gentlemen Jim" Great John El Sullivan (whose famous line "Of course I can not spit any man in the world" Of course ... romanticism again) Carbate on his belt. It's really one of the really best scenes in any sports step. Realistic? No, but wonderful. Hey, if you want to see "Raging Bull" instead of realism. That's a more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is a lot more fun.
