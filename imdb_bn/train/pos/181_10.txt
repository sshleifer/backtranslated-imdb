UC 0079, one year's war ended almost. A neutral colony of Side 6 was targeted by Cyclops, a Zion Task Force. Their goal is to create a new gangster specially for Newtips (supposedly created from original gangrape Saga for Amro Roy). A boy of Zeon MS, a young boy, Al-Ejurhah, encounters Zaku after the war break in colonies, he is a newborn MS. The pilot made friends with Benard "Barney" Weissman. To become a good friend of two friends, Al Cyclops is regarded as an honorable member of the team. Through the ceremony, Barney works as Al's father (whose real father is always working) and the federation pilot seems to be taken with Christina McKenzie, but eventually they will be seen in the war. Al soon learned that the children of the war will not play and Barney will choose to make the final sacrifice to accomplish his mission. <br /> <br /> For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a good work show. The mobile suite is very well designed, and the date of animation can be seen, but the characters really show emotions. If you like 0083 then check it out, or if you're new to gundam world then this is a good show to start. If you see a show for the development of drama and character, it is for you, then it gives more attention to the mobile suite war. I would rate it more than a drama than the action. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit bullet 0080, Pocket War. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose the win.
