How can a movie be both controversial and gentle? This one does it with near perfect structure. Someone wants to be an athlete of their girls. Apparently most of the culture does not want to be small breasts of their girls. Here we saw a bunch of spectacular actors that we have never heard of before, people of different cultures want to live their lives without living their life roughly and are likely to be their professional football players. The structure surrounding the two cultures parallelism is surprising. There is no condescension. Both cultures are seen as modern and legitimate. (And yes, both are silly, too). One mistake: Hindu wedding ceremonies were related to hundreds of relatives, but they did not have a child.
