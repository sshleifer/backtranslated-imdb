Attractive characters, lots of tension Black and white being black and white as close. Fantastic sympathetic mainstream character, calm, deaf Secretary Secretary stopped, was able to become a criminal for the destruction of his colleagues and finally was involved with the people and finally somebody got involved. Get her own off as a decoy. I'm a little annoyed by the trend of other quality movies to sympathetically portray the criminals without tackling the injuries to others instead of portraying their immediate opponents as a quarrel. In this film, we never know who is the money, what is really the wrong, or the innocent wife, who is the sympathetic deaf Secretary used to make the disappearing disappearance of the owner of the secondary bar. Too bad, the film could be great.
