This is a great short. I think each voice is done by Jason Steele. (You only hear his normal voice but can only say so, so do not worry about them.) It's about 15 minutes long. <br /> <br /> <br /> The spatula is fighting the war against the spoon and he meets some weird people. In fact, he knows everyone is very crazy. <br /> <br /> "Edward!" "General Pietersen, you have to get our medical unit!" "No, I do not have to edward it." "Do not talk like that, I'm sure you will be good." "I'm a Goner Edward, and you know it. I go before-" "Yes?" "Can I just kiss one?" "Um, no." "Come on, just one, small, peck on the lips?" "I'm walking with sir now." <br /> <br /> Soon the movie will be. That date is September, but perhaps it will go back.
