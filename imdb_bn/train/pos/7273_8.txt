Carlos Mencia was excellent this hour special. He worked hard to show everyone the real deal. I know that people have stolen this special thing, but this is not true. Carlos brings the joke forward, no one wants it, so he's so good. People say that he is not funny because he tells a lot more about Devi Devi, and they still do not understand the part of his work and they do not want this in the way, but that's how it did this, and the man has succeeded in creating ridicule. Here's a message here for all the enemies, for Carlos to stay here, you have no point trying to bring him down.
