Perhaps the last film you want to come from Basrao de Sica and Sesar Javatini (wrote the novel based on this novel). It's a neorealist fantasy, kind of an oxymoron, really. An old woman gets a baby patches out of her cabbage and raised her as her own son. After a few years, the child is going to die as a young boy (Toto) and adoptive mother. And when he went to an orphan, when he finally turned 18, he left. Immediately, he finds that he has no home. Toto is hopeful, though, and some will not get him down. A man steals his values ​​and instead of being angry at him, Tito becomes his friend and lives with him in a little Shantouton. Toto takes some initiatives and organizes many homeless buses in the area and they build a good Shantytown. Soon, the landowner is trying to sell the land, and the citizens of S'tantine must protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner counted an army of police to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the movie has become completely full of fantasy (earlier it was more ridiculous / spectacular melodrama in the Charlie Chaplin style). These things are so weird and frustrating that it's probably better for others to see it for themselves. It's quite amazing, and very fun. You must be objecting to Milan Milk's plot, of course. Fellini did not falsify Newlyalism and Viccanti was widely criticized. I think this release was widely criticized during this release. At this moment, though it is very enjoyable - I like it a lot. It may be my favorite of the movies based on De Sicker, although Umberto D and bike cheaters are very close. 10/10.
