This was the best documentary I ever saw !! I just saw Dagtown's Lords and wanted to know more about Stasi Peralta, and it was astonishing and happy to see it as one of her films. Great work Stacy! I worked out last week, kicked her, and *% was less and this movie came. 80 of the local beaches grown in the Orange County were surfed down and down and it happened when my father was still a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I surfed the body, got out there after the boogieboard. This movie just captivated me. It was the way before my time but this was pretty fantastic what the guys went through. Pioneers! This is a collector item in the movie.
