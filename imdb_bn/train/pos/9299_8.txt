Loopy, but captivating and progressive crowd Boss Vic (an excellent performance by Richard Dreyfuss) was released from a psychiatric hospital. Victor's fellow criminal assistants are mostly Begum Henman "Brass Bells", Ben London (a magnificent manicure and leading Hammy screenplay by Gabriel Beyonc√©), Commemorative Jake Parker (fully Kyle McLachlan), and the evil rival "Walkie" Jackie Jackson (a clear rotation of Bart Reynolds) Trying to stop Vikt. Meanwhile, the muscular and confident hit man Mickey Holidai (played well with Jeff Goldblood's low self-confidence) caught himself in the middle of this deadly plunder. Writer / Director Larry Bishop brings a great hip, quickie and original strange sensitivity to this delicious dark and dead pitch-black comedy about betraying, loyalty, and ruthless ambition of being helplessly unexpectedly. The bag-up cast is a field of wonderful miraculous and treacherous hoodlums in the colorful wonderful gallery: Alan Barkin solid, molten Mullah Rita Evvari, Henry Silva's trusted right-handed elephant slip Joe Cristal, the Gregory Hines philosopher's smooth velasses and Christopher Jones brutal rubber- Dylie Lane like smooth Welsh as out artist Nicholas Falco. Bishop makes the most lethal and leconic ass assassin Nick of his lethial secondary role. Nifty bits popping up is Billy Idol Blastery Thug, Michael J. As Pollard is unfortunate red, Joey Bishop is appointed as a brainwoman. Gottlieb, like Robi Reiner, like Jolly Chowdhury, and Richard Prior as Jimmy the GrayDigger. Bayern's singer Paul Ankara is delighted with the delightful mad couple as highlighting a particular party at "My Way" rate. A sore and fun climatic Mexican stand-alone makes the funny bone violent. A favorite soundtrack of Frank Byers' molded cinematography, indecently lost dialogue, the Judge Cocktail Lounge score of Earl Rose, and the Wine Sweeping Golden Oldies all developed an impressive fantastic charm of this highly entertaining one-of-a-kind curio.
