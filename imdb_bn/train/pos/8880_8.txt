Some (some) colleges of life Of course, the licenses were received, but you have seen some of the movies in some colleges. <br /> <br /> I went to the College of Southern California where most of the nations roamed with themselves. This is interesting because these schools want ethnic unity, equality and I can honestly say that it is there. But when the classes leave, or when they are just waiting for the class, they (students) just seem to roam with their own nation or ethnic people. Is it bad Not really. Everyone needs a sense of feeling. But I wrote a class that I had studied in school to read in a school that "we should all try to get along with other students of different caste and try to know them." Otherwise you are creating your own isolation. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly existed among the schools I joined. One time someone kept a leaflet around the campus, talking about the glory of the Arya race and the symbol of some racist organization. Fortunately, there was no such incident where the movie took place where young Caucasian people started shooting at a multicultural gathering. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that nothing will happen. <Br /> <br /> So what is "high education" too dramatic? Exaggerated? may be. Is it the way "off marks?" It depends on where you go or go to school. There are ethnic things where only the nations are touring in their homes. Hollywood Hollywood exaggeration, the race thing hit pretty near home for me.
