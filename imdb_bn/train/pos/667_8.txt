Although I had been a fan of Peter Wayne for a long time, I did not see any of his Australian films until I saw The Last Wave. And it was a pleasant, unpredictable wonder. <br /> <br /> Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer is invited to protect five indigenous people for the murder of another Aborigin. For David's colleagues it is a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should be guilty and serve a quick sentence. But David believes that there is a mystery under the murder, which is related to tribal events. As a result of his investigation, he learned not only about his clients but also about himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Many elements make it an impressive movie: Chamberlain's acting, for example; But David Gulpilil's performance, who plays a young indigenous man who presented David in tribal mysteries; And Nandijjara Amagul, an indigenous indigenous who is a spiritual guide. Relationship between these three characters creates the heart of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are also supernatural recommendations in the film Weierre. David has a dream that warns him of the future. The horrific weather in Australia is going on, storms, hailstorms, and even a mysterious black rain can also be more than pollution. But it is also related to David's defense. How it is related is one of the great publications of the movie. In just a few cases, Weir manages to create the atmosphere of fear and persecution, which shows the future fears by showing something really. <br /> <br /> Charles Owen's score is fantastic, especially using the Daisididu. Photography is very good. For the Master and Commander won the Oscars in 2004, long-time DP Russell Boyd, depicted the mysterious dark, obscure world. <br /> <br /> I find it remarkable that it is not done for a film centered on indigenous peoples, but in a rising celebration of white culture or their traditions, such as the Volvo or The Last Samurai dance. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating, and it can upset the viewers who want to finish the movie understanding everything; But for those who do not think of some oddity or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie for them.
