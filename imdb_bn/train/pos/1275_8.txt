I found this movie to be charming. I thought I was better than the characters I saw, I cared for these people myself. This is a break piece which I believe is committed during depression. A single mother, who is known in the city as a recovery (may be the reason), she kept an advertisement in "Swami" magazine. Christopher Rivy played a former Konk who works in search of the city. He looks at the advertisement and he goes out to see him. He hired her. Because of the progress of their relationship, I was really shiny because they were made easy by their shoes. Everything actually went so well. She does not want to make her mind so she needs work. And he needs his help, but he does not want to get the upper hand. They need each other to start that they dance around. Things begin to warm up ...... big blowup I will not loot it by telling what's going on. But the resolution point is quite surprising. I found the story to be credible for the time it was happening. I think this is a good "relationship" story beyond. Perhaps the younger generation will not "get it" but if you are over 40 then you may like it. And if you like Christopher Reeve you like him at "Somewhere".
