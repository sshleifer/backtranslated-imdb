The novel is easily superior and the best part of the film is Green, which is a direct translation. For example, broken or mild humor that happened in Bair and Lor's scenes, or the murder of some of the plot, child's emotion. Once the film is isolated from the novel, it becomes ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I do not want to think that the film is a bad thing anyway. It always shows the part and the story is in mind like a good mind. Some small characters were stock actors who could do something in their hands. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible shame that the movie is not available in DVD.
