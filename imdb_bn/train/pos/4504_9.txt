Here I thought "North Nanouk" is the last word in the oldest half-dunk 'Eskimo' movie. How wrong! As a Sea-Sea manufacturer, I saw this hope to get some glimpse of a 'skin-boat' made of some hand made from 330am. The movie was not given down to me. Kayak / umiak will see a look here no student of construction. (Colleague SKERS note: they seem to be using Norton Sound Calls with single blade pedals). <br /> <br /> But the film went the way beyond this recognized narrow interest. Although some small back-shots like others seem to have so many hearts in the movie, they are just a small annoying. It was (from this very amateur anthropologist's point of view) probably the perfect time to create this film. First thirty: 'Tociz' is so new that they (with Lau B Girl!) Actually Inuit speak their own language. And still there was so much that, despite infused melodrama, authentic. They are really whacking that pole bear, that whale and those caribou. The fifth edition of this photo has become so beautiful with the 'big', technics etc. that it can make it up. Seventeen version? Not even Geek's "Eskimo" mirror image also works with the uninterrupted and deep disturbances of Western culture / technology in a very good companion part of this excellent movie "The South Shadow of the South Sea" (1928).
