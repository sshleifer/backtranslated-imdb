We have seen VCR and it seems interesting. I did not know anything about this true story, I thought: "Oh, no, P.Edennan is an American Indian (in the movie" Lal 'Indian), what a bad choice "unless I find the truth about Gray Oil. The film does a good job of displaying the status of native people and reducing racist myths about them. And Annie Galipay, WOW, a beauty, and trustworthy as an Indian woman (I believe she is French-Canadian; she definitely goes back to this familiar lecture). However, the bourbon's isolated, grunting style, at the end he comes through firmly as an enthusiastic, dedicated man. The plot in demostrating its transformation from the trap of animal protection to the trap is a little weak. Good film, highly recommended.
