My idea is that why so many IMDB users are not getting such a bad rap (some say that this is their worst movie. Do not you have anybody seen the Cradle 2 grave?) My favorite critique is that the plot is totally stupid, and only a verb The order of action holds off. Duh! What did you expect from Jet Li? Do you really believe that someone is worried about the story, then simply loaded it with the steps? Of course not! Black mask is awesome, wall action from the wall across almost the entire running time. It is also quite curious, and we are killing creative ways of watching lots of broken limbs, decapitations, and bad guys (and several innocent people, too!). Compared to Black Mask, most of the other martial arts are nursery-school; There is no concept of non-violence, bloodshed, or action back in the sequence! And that made me a happy camper. Again if you hope to have fantastic conversations in a Jet Li movie and a playful plot, you're going to the wrong reasons. The black mask is probably my favorite of his movies (though, beware of horrible dubbing).
