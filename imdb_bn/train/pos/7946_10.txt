This movie is a real masterpiece, it really is. If you keep your hose, it is very rare to come across such an impressive flick, with fun, smile, heartfelt, and a little drama. <br /> <br /> A true family movie, Homebound, tells the stories of three brave pets who try to find their owners, to overcome the Rocky Mountains, and to overcome the barriers they face and the obstacles they face. One of the most amazing things about this movie is the ability to give animals human personality - voice acting is good. Shadow was a wonderful character, old, intelligent and courageous, and had a very powerful moving moment when trying to save the river in the river. Chance - Do not Like Dogs Like Chances? She's got to be the most naughty and lovable dog to appear on the Big Screen. And Sassie was very upset for a cat - when he was joking me over the keeper, he shattered me; 'Kitty kitty here ... not in your life, drunk'. <br /> <br /> There were many good emotional scenes, such as Sassy Falls (I was really scared for her), Shadow was hungry (almost tears) and then ended pretty, when three pets returned home ... good old With shadow! <br /> <br /> Favorites for all times - anyone who does not like this movie must choose the animal. Rent it or buy it now, and it will keep you with happy memories that will end all life.
