All these Cheech and Chong flicks have funnist jokes out. I saw this with the guys first. I found it really good My dad actually suggests me to get it What a great role model, and my grandma actually bought it for me, know what it was like. I have a family Well this movie is quite good and the rental is great when you want to see a good classic. Although you must warn, it is not terrifying. It's not as funny as its moment but there's something about Mary. Check it anyway. I'm sure you will laugh unless you have a drug anti-worker or something
