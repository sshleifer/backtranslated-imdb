A documentary without any damage to the words ... sometimes ... <br /> <br /> Let's assume that the description is more than a blast, let's assume that it is a commentary on the society of Japan. And as soon as the movie comes, the sooner they come to an unreasonable documentary, the standard word goes as soon as they are, and as badly translated - in the current version of the screenplay it is seen in the Copenhagen cinematic tonight - it's still quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> But for patients, and only true patients and open minds, I'm talking to you with GD Jermass about ADD Replace, I believe this is a movie for you. This is an intelligent movie, if you allow it to win you. <br /> <br /> is quite beautiful, and quite a tweet, and most Japanese sub culture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in a 3D world Above all, those Japanese food culture spoofs are fun for those who want to see a Japanese film. If you're in the mood for something completely different then a thumbs up.
