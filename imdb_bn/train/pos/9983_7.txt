This movie is basically about human relationships, and the interaction between them. The main character is an elderly lady who started her journey in the evening of her life, analyzing how she lived her life. This journey arises due to its financial crisis and its intentions to keep its nursing home. At some point in our life, we all ask ourselves whether it is a good attitude and secondary ideas for family succession, real love, marriage or fate such as discussions in this film. Although such movies are not new to melodrama, it can be helpful to see with a family members to discuss it. There is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very trustworthy, but due to that time some characters are not fully developed. I really recommend this movie for a cool Saturday afternoon.
