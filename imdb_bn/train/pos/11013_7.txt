In the years of war, many films were produced by Hollywood which were designed to help people to support our soldiers. Today it is seen that some may dismiss them or see them as campaign - which they are technically, but for a positive kind and the purpose of uniting the nation. This film is a very effective and entertaining example of the genre - a beautiful realistic script and good production value. Pat O'Brien played the same role in many films (you know, hard talking, hard-driven but "swivel guy"). Randolph Scott is always capable and entertaining and extra rest is excellent (look for a young man named Robert Ryan as one of the bombs for training). Although this story is a memorable event for our pilots and other movies about the staff, the film is well-designed and is well-designed to not be too far away. This, perhaps, without the very end - where the film is a little more than satisfied. Only for serious negative, and for most of the nitatives, some parts of the stock footage suddenly got integrated into the film and "like nuts" like me, which history teachers and air lovers will probably notice - probably others will not notice.
