I like this movie !!! Characters people may feel for you that. The young man who came back from there, loves the girl she left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect as romantic lead as well as Donna Reid's love in his life. Seeing her face, she thought that she was hungry for her attitude and her hesitation and confusion, and she also played her feelings very well. The rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring together. But the most sensitive scene was the young couple in her grandfather's house. I got laughing in part, made some cry and saw this movie thoroughly. Actually I've seen it again almost 5 times. Must view the course for a specific total romantic.
