It's better than an average silent film, and if it's still a fan of silence, it's good to see it. However, if you are not a fan of this genre, then I recommend you try some other movies before looking at it. Because the plot is quite old fashioned and places are hard to believe in. However, despite that, it still maintains a good film and my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately a good woman quarreled with the wrong person and ran away to marry him. Five years later, after the movie began, he realized that he was a truly barbaric thief. Despite this, he tried to make it the best and did not have the faintness of how good life was before he came into his life. However, due to the rent and no money, so Lady is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a wealthy woman whose husband is trying to swing a business deal. Unfortunately, the woman who was trying to hook a prospective client with a dining party could not make it, and the semester was paid well for the man's date. Well, like Cinderella, he has cleared well and the man is inspired by him! What to do now - is she actually getting married and wants to marry him? Well, see the film to see how it has been solved. I did not like how I used to handle my husband, as it seemed to be very hopeless and clutched. However, once I stepped out of the way, I suppose the film did not end, leaving the film some loose ends. <br /> <br /> To see everyone, a very good film price, but certainly not great.
