Kells of Secrets is a film that I've been waiting for some years after seeing some early footage in Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I'm telling you now it's worth the wait. I am afraid the cartoons are not too styled but annoying. The whole film is a matter of beauty and great imagination, I especially love animated light, where the page comes in a little bit of statistics. Characterization is fantastic, I love Brenda Gleeson's voice as Stood Abbott and I especially like the voice of Spright Aisling. Forest is a win, such a beautiful place. The story is well understood, a mixture of truth and imagination. And really shows the visitors encouraging Brendan on her search for the perfect ingredient for the book. I'm the gentleman and the lover of lightness, however, the matter is close to my heart, but the people who I know have seen it and fans of this crafts do not agree. It's a beautiful little picture. While releasing I must buy DVDs, and say, good cartoon saloon and all the people involved in this huge project. May be much more. :) I said that I could copy some of the DVD's as soon as possible and leave them on Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish all the luck in the world of Oscars, so much joy to see this nomination.
