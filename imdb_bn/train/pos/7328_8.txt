I liked this movie a lot. I did not expect anything too bad to spend this evening. It has become a particularly rewarding experience. Some scenes were sunny and were directed to a movie that was not just a silly slopstick comedy, but with some money and moral values. This manages both of them. Leads are all good, but especially the guy who wrote the movie and made this movie. I have never seen any of these actors before, but they were loved and ultimately worried me about what was happening to them, which is saying a lot. The script is tricky and involves a refreshing feeling. I do not think this will be disappointing you.
