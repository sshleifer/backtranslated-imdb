I like this program very much - we got the first and only one, it will be available in the UK series on Channel 4. This character had the correct meaning - Something like Simpson had all the different aspects of the small town population <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not have any sunny tracks - at this time in American TV comedy, except Larry Sander And it really worked well here, this painful policeman is really raising this advice, and not hamming it for the camera. <br /> <br /> All, a quirky little number that tickled me right away: I could not help but think that it missed its mark, the specific audience. I think this is a religious hit in the UK, it has been shown in an acceptable hour. <br /> <br /> I will close this round with my standard comments: where can I catch it and see again? Any ideas?
