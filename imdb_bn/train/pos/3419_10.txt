After a 23-year-old girl's "Welcome Home" in Iraq for a year, Camp Anaconda Medical Support Unit, I was forced to get this DVD. I wanted to try to see the feelings of the other coming back better to see the feelings so that he tried to understand his mentality better and did not wait till the bad things happened. Whatever the peace of this film on your acceptance of war and peace, it is a great start for all Americans to start cure our returning mental impractical. The maximum statement of the entire film is "Take Action" problem. Incredibly emotional movie. I would suggest this movie to the vet which vents the whole family, and ask that they follow a plan to hear consolation to help continue the fight of the golf war. <br /> <br /> Fast forward almost a year & my daughter watched this DVD. His passion has taken the account and actually pledged to repeat for another 6 years. She took some time to spend her sand, she did something good. Local Balad children have received first-rate medical treatment for common illnesses, which can not afford to support Escort and translators generally. His appearance on his shoulder was on his shoulder in Iraq. "We've changed some minds in there" The Great DVD will keep you an open mind and see all the parties
