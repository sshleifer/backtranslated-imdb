Do not tell me that I have never reviewed any movie in IMDB. However, I'm the video bij itself. And that is coming from perception; I can say that this movie should be short without any shadow. This is a very good story and the other thing I love- (even a good turn-end). Opening was great, I liked the video I liked for it and how it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not the fan of B & W, but the way this movie influences it. And that's all matter with any film. Film flow works perfectly and editing is done very well. Everything from a technical side (which works as well as I usually do) is done very well. There are no major crafts. Point out the point. I'm just a small one that's a little enthusiastic to end credit. This is probably due to a rendering problem. I also say that I loved watching the scenes of love but I am a guy (so you can do it up to a guy's factor). <br /> <br /> So I overall it is a 9/10. If you are a fan of Indian and / or a small film then this is the price of the watch. <br /> <br /> PS Sorry for the bad grammar or spell.
