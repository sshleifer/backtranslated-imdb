What a movie! I never thought that Richard Attenborough could have such a film. Gandhi has always played without acting Ben Kingsley, and I have never considered Attenborough as a good film producer. But Friedom's action has kept me interested in some movies in recent times. It's an exciting, ridiculous political movie with great performance in Kevin Kline and a young Dingle Washington. <br /> <br /> Kine Donald Woods, editor of the South African newspaper, who is friendly with civil rights activist Steve Biko. It starts as a tough friendship, because Woods looks as a black supremacist campaign hatred against blacksmiths. But Biko, with his kind words, encouraging attitude and complete transparency, conquered Odds and presented him with a reality about apartheid that did not know anything about Woods. <br /> <br /> Biko is a decent, law-abiding citizen who stands against all the altruistic ways and against the system that keeps his people down. One night, coming from an illegal meeting, he was arrested and beaten to death. The authorities have become a big personality in South Asia because the authorities are trying to get this issue. But the truth came out through Woods' efforts. But a win should be just nightmares because Woods and his family targeted the secret police. <br /> <br /> This movie has an interesting form. It actually has two details: First, it describes the life and death of the bakers. This is an amazing first half of Washington's absolute mastery, which can be his greatest performance. <br /> <br /> The second half is not a funny thing, Woods has tried to flee from South Africa to publish a book. About Biko Woods has become the enemy of the state, a banned person, which means that he can not meet people or leave the country. Plus he is constantly spied by the police. Kevin Kain also gives a great performance to this second half. <br /> <br /> Although the first half is easy, but the second edit shows interesting topics, flashbacks and suppression of events. Black South African Some may make it more interesting, but for me the second half is just as impressive, so Woods and his family made a brave plan to flee from South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last minute was so impressive. There was tears. The score of George Fenton and Jonas Gowanwa was definitely to do with it. Although I was once a fan of Fenton (not able to stand his Gandhi score), I think that Cree Freedom's score is the most beautiful one for the movie. The film, thanks to married songs with powerful pictures, sometimes reach the incredible peak of emotion. <br /> <br /> Ear Freedom is definitely not the movie to watch because of Dingsh Washington. It's a movie to be fully complemented. Acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography combined with perfect synthesis for the existence of human soul power. This film deserves a place beside movies like The Pianist, Life Is Beautiful and Shawshank Redemption.
