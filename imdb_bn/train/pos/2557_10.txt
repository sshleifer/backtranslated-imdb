I, I'm a child at heart, I love watching cartoons, still what! When I was a child, seeing buggy, he was my favorite. I thought, this was a great "new" show on TV and my father wanted, "Bags Bondi, when I was young, I feel like seeing him" and I like, "Father, the bugs were small when you did not have them ". So I guess he probably is probably more likely than one generation. 3. I love Shock It's great for kids and adults, okay, everyone. It's so funny, both me and my husband show us 20 shows showing love and we do not run again. A lot of memories of this show come back, more than happy ones I love Christmas special with Tweety as a very small team, it's tricky. I can not choose my favorite Looney Toons character, because they have changed over the years. Of course there was certainly when I was small, and Porky Pig was there. Pepe cool, I always loved him. Actually, I would say there all my favorite. I'm giving 10 of 10 out of this show, because it's a great show for all ages, very funny, the voice acting is incredible, the only error is that it's gone, unfortunately two decades ago, but it's great to run again!
