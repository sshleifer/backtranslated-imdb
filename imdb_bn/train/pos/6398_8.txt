"Inspirational" stories about "the soul of man's soul" usually make big changes for me. The most wonderful thing about Honor Maine I enjoyed despite myself. The movie is as predictable and cliched as it is, but it works. Many credits go through exhilarating performance by both leads. It's a perfect role for Cuban Gooding, Jr., who has surprisingly prevented it here. We came to expect much from De Niro, and he is not disappointed. She creates a bold funny portrait. Director George Tilman, Jr. set to flick an old style and comes with a winner.
