The critic did not like this picture. This is a US bomb attack and this results in only a limited display in Britain. Which was shameful, because it represented British instead of American humorist and should first be shown in Britain. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks fantastic and completely Russian. The character of Dustin Hoffman from Ben Chaplin 'The Graduate', and 'Birthday Girl' has at least 4 scenes, which reminded the classic audience of the 1960s. (Despite being completely different stories!) <br /> <br /> It changes from comedy to black comedy in a number of times - but it is a breathtaking breath of fresh air compared to the memorable, ongoing and average Mega budget blockblaster. <br /> <br /> See it open mind!
