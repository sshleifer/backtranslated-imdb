Now, I know that French prisoners will not be less likely to fall in love (and my statement proves that his writing should be taught in school, maybe as a separate subject), but how can they think of the word "Fatgan Jodi Sotith" a good leadership? <br /> <br /> This movie is held in a prison where four unforeseen cell partners fall into a magical book that can read properly, to find them. While in prison, the house was completely unreal, so it makes it difficult for me to enter the atmosphere. It continues slowly, which can lead people. But more than that, it's a very awkward feeling, the "Hark another guy" of Sarther, joins the boyfriend / barker story and works successfully. <br /> <br /> Take time to see the bottom line. This means that when you do not go to work or sleep or do something else, do it. This is a movie that works best when you immerse it. Lesson to learn: Yog bad, almost as bad as French women.
