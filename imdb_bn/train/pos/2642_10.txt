It's really a 'heart-warming' film. It won the George Peabody Award, won over "Roots", so that it could tell you a bit about the movie. I order this movie to see how my former father-in-law Eugene Logan, the co-writer of this film has been living on the internet for years, so I do not have the opportunity to get information from him. I want to see his only lady, my daughter, this film, as well as send this wonderful story to his grandchildren. My first daughter was seven years old when I was on television and I was waiting to see it again. One of my friends said it was his favorite movie. I will not loot this movie for you.
