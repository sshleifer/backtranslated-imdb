"Calculife" is one of my favorite movies ever, and it can be easily labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90's. This is a very stylish patronage in the film, but behind it, horrible and honest images of detrimental toilets and they show horror to others. Its performance is one of the most powerful aspects of the film, Brad Pitt initially surprisingly as trailer-trash psycho. Pitt potrays his shameless character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is equally playing his innocent girlfriend, heart-breaking around his innocence There is a very common plot of "California", which moves slowly for an hour and goes slowly, but suddenly it goes to desperation, because Pitt reveals his psychological personality. There are a few casual scenes, and it depends on the size of all the electricity that will frustrate you for the day. "Califonia" is a film that should be closely monitored for human psychological viewpoint and not only for its violence and gore.
