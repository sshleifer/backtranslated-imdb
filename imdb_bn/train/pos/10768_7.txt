I saw at this age when I was a kid and could not remember the title, for a day I was scrolling through the credits of IMDB's Kandy film credits and noticed an entry called "Once Upon A Crime". Some bells sounded and I clicked it, and after reading the plot summary it brought back many memories. <br /> <br /> I found it to be nothing, though it's pretty good. Meaning of a "great" comedy. However, it is rather enjoyable and misconceived and is a good rock formula in the world of exciting thriller hitco. <br /> <br /> This movie contains a large cast of letters, one of them is found by the American couple who finds a woman's dog during vacation time in Europe and when she decides to return it for the prize, only her body will be found. From there the plots become rabid and silier and the police driver seems to be the victim of the murder. <br /> <br /> "It's a mad mad mad mad world" and a lighter Hitcoak feature, this Eugene Levi was directed and he was able to star in some of his best friends - such as John Candy. The film is mostly compelling because of its cast, and the last little funny twist that is not completely unpredictable but unexpected.
