This movie is ridiculous! I saw it with my friend and we just had to see it again. This movie is not for you, filmmakers who will only see films nominated for Academy Award (who do you know.) I will not repeat it because you have seen it from all other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Whipped" is a light hearty comedy that I saw smiling throughout life. It does not take very seriously and should be seen with your friends, not your girlfriend. It does not win any prizes, but it should be appreciated. True, some jokes are in the toilet humor, but it's not a bad thing. Everyone can sometimes use something like this. Some people need to look lighter and "whipped" for what it does not, do not do it. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 *****
