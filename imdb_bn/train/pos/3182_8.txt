British aircraft pilot George Taylor (Giuseppe Pammeri's strong screenplay) was fantastic and shocked by the cold joke after the wild night of Handcong. George Sweet and Maiden fall in love with Dr. Amy Wang (a fine and impressive performance of Lovely Chan Lee). George returned to his health and returned to work. When Emily failed to listen to George for a long time, she became frustrated and prostitute. Director / co-writer Bito Albertini actually provides the expected delicious nudity and amount of steam soft-core sex, but this movie is nothing but your Leaves of Stevez. Instead, it's a well thoughtful, sensitive and sad catchy story, with two well-drawn and highly striking characters (Emi Wang, especially bright and respectable as a charm). The film starts bubbling and starts joyfully, but the voice changes mainly in about two-thirds of the way in a more serious and rigorous mood. Emaiah's descendants have become very disturbed gradually by pretending that James was abandoned. Wonderful sad and hearty surprise ditto end of insurance. The supposed, narrative certainly is the musician, but never is stupid or trashy. Moreover, the sexual scene is quite flavored and even realistic sex. An excellent piece of support, such as the jealous and helpless secretary Helen Miller of George Ilona Stoller, a messy Italian porn star. Guido Mancori's polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots to the exterior position. Niko Fidenko's Fannaki, Throbbing score hits Groovy Spot. A look price for those who want something different.
