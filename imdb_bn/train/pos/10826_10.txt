I rarely grew up to see a movie with a warm, happy feeling. I was really out with good friends and I felt a wonderful time! I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The performance was fantastic, although I must mention specifically Bill Nye as providing absolutely perfect performance. Bill is an extraordinary actor and loves to see him in more movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also desired and always love to see them as they give a solid performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, is completely gorgeous It was a wonderfully ensemble performance related to all of it. A well written, superbly played and handsome movie viewing such a refreshing experience.
