After Alain Dellon accidentally killed his wife and child, Doosio Tesarea visited Rapillary Violence on the ruthless criminal family appointed in the thriller "Big Guns" as a victim of the crime. Franco Veruchi of Tesari and painter Roberto Gundas, "A Minute to Two Priya, A Second to Die", and Franco Viruchi of "Ring of Death" take the movement directly to the working gunmen to crowd. Indeed, "big guns" are rather predictable, but it still qualifies as stupid and often sudden killing with solid entertainment. Allen Dellon of "The Godson" is a good creator, because he systematically executes the death of his family members, who refused him retirement, so that he can enjoy his younger son and daughter. Richard Conte of "The Godfather" starred a Sicilian criminal Bausa, who wants to bury the hat with the character of Dellon, but the rest of the non-partners would go to the hit-man's dead. Like most crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" subscribe to cinematic morality that does not give the crime. Interestingly, a person who has nothing to do with the murder of his wife and son, and betrayed another hero with extreme competition. Tessari does not waste a second in the 90-minute shooting. In addition to being a mother and son bombed in the parents' car, the worst thing is to happen in an automobile salvage guard when the hero's partner is crushed into a junk car. Apparently, "Big Guns" is a bloody Gulf incident, but it has a high body count for a brain in 1973. Only in the last moment, our hero keeps his protector down and so the eyes perspective is intact for the eyes. Tesari runs a number of decent cars and the death of one of the trains traveling through tunnel of a train is bloody, as bloody yolk. Photography and composition are excellent.
