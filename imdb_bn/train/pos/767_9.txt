Since I am a real product of hip hop and electronic dance music generation, it is my suspicion that one of my favorite films all the time. Although beat Street is not as "pure" in some form of wild style, it is a film that guarantees to protect the heart strings of the urban sample / DJ-based music and the culture of the electro-club culture. <<br /> Although I acknowledge that sometimes the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but you can not feel for characters and ultimately "you want to stay there" at the beginning of the hip-hop culture in New York, Saturday's detention city. The B-boy war scene at Roxy Nightclubs (Real-time competition between legendary rock studio crew and NYC breakers) is essential as a classic album, just like a hip-hop fan archive. Slowly see some break-in steps, if it is possible to appreciate the true B-boy / B-girl's athletic and artistic skills. All praise for the nation of Zulu!
