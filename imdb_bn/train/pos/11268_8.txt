Harry Hollt (Blue Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Kavanagh) came to the hidden jungle assortment of Tarzan, which is the first to see the "Elephant Cemetery" in search of the golden gold mine in Tazanan, App Man ... Only Men Both have hidden objectives to discover ... as well as Jane. Will Tarzan stand for that? Perhaps Tazan ("Do not stand for any kind of trouble at the elephant graveyard") and after this trying to get Martin out of the picture from Tajan, he later got into trouble after himself and his team. Jane, who holds Tarn as the dead, has been kept in jail for the lion's sake by feeding the lion with the charismatic tribe. What do Tarazan want to do and reach them on time? <br /> <br /> This picture loads in the scene involving Tarzan and fills with other wild animals and faces a climax to attract visitors who are facing the grip and do not give up. Cruelty to animals and negative screenplay of negative people can be a bit annoying today, but everyone should remember that it should be entertaining fantasy adventure and should not be taken seriously.
