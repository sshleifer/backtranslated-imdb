I saw McCawes's reunion and I'm happy to see Richard Krena and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez! It was nice to see them now because I have always seen that this event has seen increasingly when the TV said that there will be reunion. Was so excited !!!! Lydia Reid (Smiley McCoy) and Michael Weinkelman (little Luke) were not the only things I did not understand. I know Walter Brevin died. So I went to my computer and tried to find them and found this site so that there was someone there who could tell me what happened to Leiden Reid (Smiley McCoy) and Michael Weinkelman (little Luke I would be thankful !!! What I learned about Michael Winkelman was only about to be born in 1946. This show was Proficiency and morality teach each and every lesson to learn from each other. In today's events, it was not the whole cast which was better than finding the incredible thing they wanted to meet them, so if someone please help, then it is impossible Thank you Glenda
