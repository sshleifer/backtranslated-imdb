It was very good to have some parts with it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was good to have a rest on the corner, the end of the film was a huge blindness. It's better than Bullet, with what a boring movie, muscle car chair was badly illustrated? The character of Wiegoar knew what he had to do to escape from Johnny Law, the influence of a few movies-night vision, the CBS radio-all right, I forgot the name of the movie, the person has 76 'candy soup up, the guy is bored with the toy. The end is great, you can not say whether he committed suicide, or did he do very well-it-not-no-no.
