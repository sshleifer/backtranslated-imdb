A wonderful thriller with twists and double cross than a doodle pad. It's a great mix of mixes with a playful plot directed by director Dahlien Twin Pick-Is. Nicholas Cage shows an extremely inferior actor and a great painting of a man in a dam looking for the right thing. J.T. Walsh (a great actor rappe) is always a wonderful villain, such as Dennis Hooper So much shame that he never wins for a higher profile. I'm sure, though he has his followers. After all, it's a great movie that shows you that you do not need a great entertainment movie or amusement soundtrack.
