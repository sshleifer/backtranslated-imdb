I've heard the director's directive of this film, and I think that one of the great things I received was that I like Manna the Insider, the film is completely intelligent. It's from Howard's Pov. So, a review or attempt to think about a set of Ebert's opinions is actually about Nolt's character. If you think, as he did, the film "does not work" but you say that Howard does not work. And, to be empty, you may be right. Howard's argument and personality will not really stand up to professional psychological treatment and analysis. <br /> <br /> Hey, it's human nature. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
