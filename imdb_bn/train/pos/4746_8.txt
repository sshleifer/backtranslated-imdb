This image draws out the border - on one side, those who love it, others who find it unbearable. <br /> <br /> At the outset, this movie is not very "comical" to many viewers. Of course, Jat Lee's mask looks like Bruce Lee's Kato - he's supposedly, it's a joke. A man who has bombed his time - insulting? Of course, this is a joke! Some readers might ask, if this picture seems so funny, then why all the stunning and ugly violence? Well, this tolerance of some kind of violence is actually different, from culture to culture; And when Hong Kong viewers feel the violence is extreme, it's definitely a little more than the average of a hack action film. Also, the Black Mask is actually a film that takes conventional conventions and pushing them into extremism, simply because the Convention itself is completely unrealistic. For decades people have got guns without any significant open wounds, many people are scared of seeing Bonnie and Clyde and the extremes of wild rolling blood all over the place. But actually, when you're firing a metal project quickly, it is almost sure that the blood will emerge, especially from the arteries. <br /> <br /> This image is a Chinese comic book movie. Spiderman films never get the glory - but if they were genuinely faithful, they would be! Well, despite its comic-book source, this film is truly faithful. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have to make is shiny, more stylized filming and editing. If the filmmakers shoot it with the attention of Hollywood-style nostalgia (eg, the rocket, or the latest Sky Captain film), I suspect that someone considered it objectionable. <br /> <br /> But since it stands, I still have a lot of fun watching this movie.
