"The Noticias Betty Page" is a woman who always wanted to be an actress but America became one of the most famous pin-up girls in history. America's first sex icons include Gretchen Mole's actress Betty Page. Modeling Betty Page participates in nudity and slavery included in the 1950s which led to a US Senate investigation. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I You can now go to the internet and sometimes find the most annoying and shocking images that appear to be "infamous" on the page of the infamous page, which is almost childish and innocent. Most footage with betting did not show the nudity when the Betty Page was involved, yet today we have a sick picture where we can see that women are having sex with animals. I have seen that this leaflet has been pushed very little since the 1950s, because in view of today's pornography, this film is seeing, it is done very nicely. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was very nice "The Kutty Betty Page," I think the film is very good and interesting. This movie will give you trailer what it will be like and it's a very interesting look among America's first women's sexual icons. Gretchen Mol just gives the Betty page and a very subtle performance just like that. I thought that the film was shot in black and white, because the film seemed realistic because the viewers believed that they were watching a movie made in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this picture was the running time, some scenes that were cut and seem a bit shorter than they should have been. I have seen it and it seems that 10 minutes have been cut from the film on its original exhibition at the Toronto Film Festival. The finishing was too low and I'm hoping a little more than this or maybe some paragraphs come to the screen so that the audience say something more about the life of the page where the film was left. The guidelines were not strong, but only two of my allegations about the film were the allegations, the performance was particularly great in Gretchen and was good to write. <br /> <br /> Mary Haron, who operated "American Psycho", one of my favorite films, director and writer "The Cuckoo Betty Page". I think Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create a great movie based on the characters, because like "psycho", the beta page is a character study and it's a fine Haran captures all the characters with 40s and 50s easily. He is a very talented director who hopes for many years I'm hopeful. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: "The notorious BT Page" is definitely a look. This is a very interesting story that shows how far America has come in terms of pornography, as well as the world. The film also provides a great performance of Gretchen Mole, who literally plays the headline titles in the title role. And a gifted director who is able to capture the look and feel of the previous era and it has the best movie for you. Sadly, this image is probably going to Flopley, in addition to the grown up in this era, the film will show interest, but I think it is worth checking. <br /> <br /> The final rating of the movieman Menzel is "infamous battea" page "8/10. It is an interesting characteristic of the most famous Pin-up girls and sexual icons in American history.
