I saw this picture after seeing the captot and the infamous. It is simply incredible how the gay relationships between writers and tribals in the movie have become fertile. The reporter is straight, the hero is more beatniks than the homosexuals. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly, but for the second time in review, we can get all kinds of interesting information that creates a writer / director Brooks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remember the incredible cutting where the killers will be killed. The phone is mixed in the penis on the phone. His face washed his face and was mixed with pearls. Just looking at Perry's mirrors and watching her boyfriend's male body set off a fantasy playing from a vacant chair in Las Vegas to a guitar. This failure / fantasy failure-coupled with fantasy that Perry had told us about our father who made a beautiful mattress to find it simply in Alsace forever. <br /> <br /> Talking about the shooting of Dick Pisces and the Quest, they do not know that they're going to die. We cut the clutters. <br /> <br /> Perry is talking about his dream about his "taller than Jesus" bird, who attacked him not a persecutor. "An unsuspecting person apologized for mercy," he tells us, "but how the birds killed them." Parry lift in the bird paradise. Curiously, Perry says that she is unhappy about God, religion and religion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> A friend of Nancy Cutter gets a proposal to sleep at home. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment next to her and a picture of the house. Nancy can not sleep at her friend's house because her boyfriend is coming for dinner. The decision seals his fate <br /> <br /> "Sierra Madre Treasure" Bogra's Perry Talks. But this is another bogart picture, "Bite the Devil" co-written by Truman Capet, where the imaginative fame is MacGuffin. But Dick knows that the hero of the movie did not finish anything. Dick wants a hard cash, $ 10,000 he thinks he's safe in Clutter, which becomes a fantastic fantasy like Perry's Mexican Treasure. <br /> <br /> <br /> She is thinking about the death rate right now. Wickedly ending his death within a few hours. On behalf of the company, the insurance agent wants him long life, and we know what will happen in a few hours. << br /> <br /> Dick says that they did not want any witnesses so no one remembers them. Later, in fact, they excluded all the witnesses they had remembered. <br /> <br /> "There was one witness," the detectives later said to Dick. But who is the friend of the prison, Dick, Perry, Truman Kopo or God? After watching this movie the audience becomes the witness. <br /> <br /> <br /> Movies.
