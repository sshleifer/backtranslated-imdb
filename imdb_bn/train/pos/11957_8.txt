Great Woody Allen? No, Good Woody Allen? Clearly. In the presence of the audience I found myself, most of the hard disk hard and most of the best Woody Allen lines we heard a little. Adult Alan Scarlett created an appropriate role for himself as Johansson's "father" ... well, sort of. Someone said that Johansson played "a young man, Dian Keton". I want to be different. He plays Woody's conversation, which always has a similar feeling in his comedies ... Good, Woody Allen Comedy. This is a compliment to Woody for us. He must have done much better than his last comedy Melinda / Melinda Young Cast. Someone may think of Woody's humorous exhaustion, but when it is correct for those of us who like it, we want to look at the next one.
