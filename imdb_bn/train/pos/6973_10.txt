BSG is my best-ever TV series. I was lucky after the series came in the final season. It was a marathon from me and it was an incredible ride! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilot, I was just for the title - CAPRIC! However, when compared to both series, some things are not added yet it is still pretty well implemented. There is no mention about the significant Hollbands in the Batelester galactica or the virtual world, but maybe I did not reach the series to explain why <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alternative concepts in the universe, technology, and our world. This show is very interesting and you want to see more!
