Possible Spirir - In what way "How to embrace a friend ..." is "The lost person can learn to adjust, succeed and find more." - The last of the spinner <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book, but this comedy provides several good moments. Although I think the last is faulty. It felt very fast and very sudden, as some were missing. Besides, I would say that the film will not be able to keep a high level. As well as you will find sweet selection of actors and actors sometimes with controversial acting qualities. So far I have not seen Pegg any different. Yet she is a very unique type on screen but sometimes she may feel a little exhausted than needed. Fox proves that he is able to play a hot starlet with his head in the clouds. Do not know whether it was hard to do, but its performance was "Hot Transformers" (OK ... This is probably not a difficult match) Kirsten Donest is very much Carsten Donest (again) and you can like it (as I do) or find it boring. On the other hand, you will see Anderson who proved his acting skills and Jeff Bridges (who was probably the most powerful, perhaps more powerful). Conclusion: I think this is a good celebrity comedy and some less funny passages, sweet cast but with a very sudden end.
