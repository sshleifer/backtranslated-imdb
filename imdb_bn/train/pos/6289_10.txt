This movie has taken many stick. It was faded by critics when it came out and was responsible for the destruction of Nicholas Cage's carrier. I do not think people think that this can not be an epic, it is a film Oscar contestant, it is simply the best of its "Brooke -Start" action Quick cars, quick editing, and a great soundtrack - decide what it says on the tin. Also, a pure treatment of anyone who likes it It has everything: do not forget Ferreris, Mercs, a Hummer and Eleanor! I think you'll work hard to find a good action movie, and personally, a good movie !! Then again that's just me!
