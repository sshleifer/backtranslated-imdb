First of all, this half-life was seen on a black and white TV in a small samoyan village, and it seemed to be pleasant. Now, the second time I saw it, after a lot, I can not find it ridiculous. I can not find any more pleasurable things. But it's a wonderful and light-hearted comedy that goes fast without touching it immediately and I've enjoyed it perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is 1945 and Fred MacMur is a 4F who is going to die for the Armed Forces. He placed a lamp on the operated skiparard, and a gene greeted him with something. (Huh, okay? However, although the presentation is not something else, the fantasies are quite vivid.) Macmoorie tells jin that he wants to stay in the army. Pof, and he is particularly warm with Washington's soldiers and inviting us to the United States where June Havre and Joan Leslie have lots of lace deli or whatever they wear and lavender wig. Macmoor's message to spy on Washington enemy - Red-leopa, German-speaking Hesians, not Brights. Hesians enter Bayerswei and praise a lot of alcoholic drinks by praising Whaterland's qualities, "Where white drinks are won, and Ryan water rayner / and Bratwart Meloure / and yellow hair yellow and / and Frauleins jucier / and stepping steps are fierce." Something The characters are fabulous, best known as Sig Rumen. Oto Pringmemar suspicious and mad Hesian General "You know, Heidelberg, vee against you 241 to 1 - but do not be afraid." <br /> <br /> I can not go with this imagination for a long time, but they are all very funny, and so the songs too. When he wanted to be in the Navy, he used to send air with Columbus in Macmoor and the imagination was presented as a grand opera. "Do not you know that sailing ship / a tremendously expensive investment in the west? / And who gives you money to Queen Queen of Queens, but who? When they look at the new world, someone comments that it looks great." I do not think so "Columbus mutters," but that place will be called Columbusland. "<br /> <br /> However, everything is finally straightened, although by this time the genes are pretty drunk, and Macmoor As if the right girl rides the air in the Marine Corps. <br /> <br /> I have made it very beautiful, maybe, but it is beautiful. Kids will enjoy smoking and magic and authentic love story puffs. If adults do not graduate from college Find out more challenging elements of the story (who is Hesien?), In that case they may want to stay with Leatherman and say, "Wow! Awesome! "
