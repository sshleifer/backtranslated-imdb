Director Samuel Fuller features a brilliant visual setup: Kaki Pickpack Unconsciously a woman takes some microfilm from Paris; He turned out to be a courier for the active communists, and now he and Giffer are being seen by the police. Film Noor Formula has all its glory - before going to the clich√©s - Waterfront locals, fluji, saxphones and sound of a ship's claytik boxing arena. Richard Wymark and Gene Peters' performance are accurate on the target, and smart, sharp scripts are quite colorful. Fabulous Thlma Ritter got an Oscar nomination for counterfeit support role as a "professional stoolie". Sensational, atmospheric, nail as tough. *** *** to ***
