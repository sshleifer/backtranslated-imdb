I first saw this film as a teenager. It once ruled the world of heavy metal. Trick or Treat is a movie that has every element for the stone. Skippy features from Family Relations, Odd Osbourne as a teenage gene Simmons and a preacher, is a cast which you can make mistakes? Back in bad news vinyl played! Yes, they used the record of this movie. In one case Eddie (Skippi) began to become scary when listening to the message from his record player's bad predicament. The monster started coming out of his speaker and his stereo was overwhelmed. As a teenager I expected my record to happen. My record will happen It happens to me. About 20 years later, Trick or Treat is still one of my favorite movies.
