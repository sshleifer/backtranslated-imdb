This movie is pretty good. Half a year ago, I bought the DVD. But first I think it was the original movie. I've seen the series and it's a good movie, but here they put together "Living Legend, Part 1 and 2" and "Fire in Space". They are similar to the first film, but the same with other episodes. But still, it's a pretty good film. Just last weird (you do not see what's happening with Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. Actors and special effects were good. If you do not see it, go see it. Starred: Richard Hutch, Dark Benedict, Lorraine Greene, Harb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer
