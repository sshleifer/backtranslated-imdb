I finally got to set up on Mail Order DVD Rentals so I could find movies I found in stores. I chose The Solar Opposite because I love Christopher Melonie, and small, often ignored films. <br /> <br /> This is such a treatment! Meloni is such common in this section. It's easy for the pigeon's hole, you see him as the Ahiyal Stabler (LOSVU) instead. In this film, Melonie is a step-by-step medieval man who hits the skies in many ways, just unexpectedly finding the way to happiness. <br /> <br /> Barry (Melonie) and Team Busfield's character is realistic and not complete. I have not seen Busfield from some 30, and he was fun to see. But it was all Chris' film. I turned to such a fan girl again. <br /> <br /> It's a little slow at the beginning, I'll admit. I thought "flashbacks" can be edited. But overall, this movie will make you happy - male or female - it has a honest, fresh perspective on today's relationship.
