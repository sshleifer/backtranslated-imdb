Although this movie is quite old, even though I have seen it, even though it lets me laugh. <br /> <br /> A special quote from the film stands. <br /> <br /> When Danny (Joe Piscopo) reached The Disabled Space near The Daily Office and Park, Danny's partner said <br /> <br /> "Can not park here, disabled for it". <br /> <br /> Danny answered, "I'm helpless, I'm psychic". <br /> <br /> One of the many lines in this movie is that you do not see how frequently you watch, <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangersley is standing in my best 5 comedy / spoof films. <br /> <br /> As an extra bonus, it also includes legendary actor Peter Boyle. Selected. So watch this movie and look like yourself and many others who have seen it, you'll be hooked.
