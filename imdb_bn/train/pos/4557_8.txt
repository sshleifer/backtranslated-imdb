I think Hugh O'Connell was wonderful as Chris Brown, and really deserve greater recognition for his role. I could not believe how well he played. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also bright. My favorite scene is where boys are playing football and Chris uses his head to score goals and then gets punishment! Wonderful performances by two Christys (and others).
