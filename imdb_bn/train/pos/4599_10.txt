This is my favorite Jackie Chan film and in an interview, Jackie said that it was his favorite. It has some incredible stunts and jaw drops drop sequence as well as some very interesting scenes. This movie was Brandon Leyer's favorite, who used parts of Rapid Fire and lifted Taoongo and Cache, which used some opening scenes. <br /> <br /> Jackie is playing a cop in Hong Kong. The story immediately skips into a fantastic chez through a tranquil city and Jackie slides down a hill and gets picked up on a moving bus to catch the bush (which caught one of the greatest villains in any Jackie Chan movie). Acting by Mikey Chung, very funny scene as trying to balance her responsibilities as a police with her daughter's friend. His job is to protect the Secretary of Koo, who has enough information, but also many problems arise. Jackie is the best of her here. The last battle scene of the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone - duration. This was the most deadly battle I ever saw in Jackie and saw Climax on a slide in a pole between explosive lamps. After all, he did one of the greatest stunts of all time and kept it in the skin with a hole in his hand. He is fortunate that he used high voltage instead of low voltage as a stunt agent. <br /> <br /> All, another Chan is one of the classic and obviously one of his greatest films. At the end of this movie, you can say that he did not return anything entirely and not even his stuntman. During this movie, many of his stuntman was injured, nobody would heal him - Jack had to take responsibility for himself. There is no hostage, cable or stand-ins - it's all true-life actions that a behavior to look at. It's such a kind of action that he created him, and it's a film that will surprise people for 100 years. If you have not seen this movie and are a fan of Jackie Chan or take steps in general, give yourself a treatment and see this movie. It's really exciting
