Although I can not claim the courage of a ridiculous book, I read my fate, so I think I was part of the audience of this movie, and I was not frustrated. It comes out of steam at the end, it flows with ideas and it seems like my favorite actress Lena Olin Katyat has gone down in the room. Hank Azariah's blue king may also be a little longer. However, when you have a film, these errors are easy to forgive. Their role in all actors, especially William H. Messi seems to have been an explosion as a bowler with direct bow shovel and Zenne Garfaloo. And unlike some, the city's designs are also made funky even funnier. I like the disco bad boy's favorite music; Somehow, it seems to be appropriate.
