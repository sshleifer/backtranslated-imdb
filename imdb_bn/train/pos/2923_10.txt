Eddie Murphy really laughs at my ass in this Habib Stump Up comedy show. I am T, Ed Norton and Raf Corman, "Elvis Presley" and Michael Jackson of "honeymooners" love their impressions. Ice cream man, Goni guo guo, it's funny I saw it for the first time in 1984. I was very frustrated, almost my chair fell. I still think it's very funny. <br /> <br /> When he was in "Saturday Night Live", Eddie Murphy smiled me so much, he was one of the best people out of "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Deliarius" is his next best stand-up performance "Eddie Murphy Roy". <br /> <br /> I'm "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumbs up and 10/10 star.
