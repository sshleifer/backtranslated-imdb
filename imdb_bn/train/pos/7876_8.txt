I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director. <br /> <br /> I did not see her other movies. They came. <br /> <br /> <br /> But Page -3 was beautifully made. Think real. Like the truth from RGV. <br /> <br /> Summary of the so-called high society mental illness film. In all illnesses, there is a problem of living a normal life, which is the novelist, Konkana Sen. Serious movies, meet with kids or wives will not be expected. In the newspaper page -3, the public space to know more about the filthy behavior of the rich and elite groups during the activities of the parties. How this page-3 is shown in a business prospect movie. Event management companies pay for arranging parties and rich but famous people do not pay money by clicking on invited photos in the photo overnight with famous people. <br /> <br /> Western culture is deeply-formed in the high society of Mumbai. The film shows boldly, there is no obstacle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A new journey started from the sweet shopkeeper.
