Although the film has the first-rate roster of superb actors, special effects are excellent and a storyline that is amazing, it was not selected for the distribution of the studio and went straight to the DVD. It probably has many 'anti-police forces' information, or perhaps it is a lot of action flick released during a chic, but whatever the reason the big screens have missed, new ideas for direct publishing the DVD allow us to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The theme is old: Rookie Reporter unveils the inner circle of corrupt police - in this case FRAT (First Response Astal and Tektikal) team, a team of trained policemen, is at least a crime, drug, prostitution etc. from the legendary city of Edison Made to clean. The temptation to blur the fraudulent items and money pocket has proved that after 15 years of its formation, Fratit is responsible for the killing, drug trafficking, innocent people, etc. Chief Dog Ledgerov (Dylan McDermott, who created an awesome real gangster!) And his partner Reff Did (LL.L) Cool J, even more punk than the normal and the evidence he might be a sensitive actor). Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) sums up an 'erroneous error' and reports on the theory of fraud and corruption to Ashford (always reliably Morgan Freeman), his paper owner. Gradually, Pollack believes Ashford, and later Wallace (Kevin Spacey is a consistently fine character actor) and in this investigation report, Pollack supports. Near Pollock reaches the truth, more surprises and bad events happen, and the story runs Paul Mall on a series of unexpected results. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of charisma to carry Timberlake lead, especially as the agency season actor. But LL Cool, J., Freeman, Spacy, and McDermat put the very oily machine of a movie to the very end. No, this is not a great movie, but it's a subject that flicks with a message on the edge of the sit action. Grady Harp
