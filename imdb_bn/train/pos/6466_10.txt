I really liked this movie and so with the Los Angeles viewer that I saw it. After the movie, many people started crying and how much the film had affected them. I can see why this was such a big hit in his homeland of Sweden. The film is well-executed and each letter is brightly painted so that you will ultimately know these people and take care of them. The music is quite normal and the original song of the film is quite hearty but inspirational. This film will definitely recommend for everyone - even people who do not usually go to subtitles movies. The film's deep themes deserve to be nominated for the Oscar nomination because of the reflection of everyday people in small towns without protests. This is a movie that brings us together in this divided world and shows us the possibility of human attitude. A must see!
