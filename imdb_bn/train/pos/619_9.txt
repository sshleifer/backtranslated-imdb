I hope this movie is beautiful and possibly cliche, but I was totally wrong! Charlie Cox (I have never heard of him) has played incredibly well-liked people; He was so kind and romantic, my friend and my friend who saw the movie with me completely fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> Cleans Dannies, I've liked it before (I love him in Romeo and Juliet), I enjoy him more. His performance was fantastic, I could not even say the American. Chemistry was very good in her and Charlie Cox, the welding was quite perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert Denarro and Michele Pfeffer were also arranged equally; That DeNiro as gay pirate ... invaluable, invaluable. I smiled so much in the scene where Septimus came to the ship ... O my God, Wow! Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked him as a snippy mother in Hairspray. But he made the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was funny (but not slap-stick!), romantic, special effects were often not frequent but when they were, they were fantastic; Ricky Garvis and Peter O'Waul's umpires were also good. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie that anyone likes fantasy movies like Princess Bride or even Lord of Rings. It will keep my interest in full time and when I come out to buy DVDs!
