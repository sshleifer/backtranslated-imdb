'Stanley and Iris' heart warming film that finds both of them and finds each other and crosses one of the problems in their lives. Stanley's life is difficult, because he did not learn to read or write. Iris is a widow who is working in two teenage children bakeries where she meets Stanley. Learning how to teach Stanley how to read his home in his spare time. Over time, they became romantically involved. After learning to read Stanley, he left a good job in Chicago, just to return to Iris and ask him to marry. <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie without nudity, violence, or prejudice. Which is rare in today's movie. A good film is all round. <br /> <br />
