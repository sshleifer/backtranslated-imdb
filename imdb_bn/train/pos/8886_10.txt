I was living in the 60's, so I'm sure this movie was not a perfectly accurate presentation of time, but it is definitely a running and full-fledged experience. There are some excellent performances, especially Josh Hamilton (with honors), Jerry O'Connell (Slider), who plays in divided battles. Bill Smitrovitch, the character actor, who has long neglected by many, gives heart-full performance as a stubborn parent, is forced to question his own beliefs and values, because his sons are proud of going to Vietnam but simply returning. Inside, the other just opposite. After all, this is a powerful and heartwarming movie that I hope everyone has the opportunity to experience.
