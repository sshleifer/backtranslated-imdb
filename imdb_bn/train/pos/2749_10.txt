A good picture is worth all the words. This movie has the most poetic views on people dreaming of Down Syndrome. And I will not loot it by telling you. You want to see yourself <br /> <br /> Pascal Dwacken is an extraordinary actor. I did not need to understand a single word to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> This image has its own magic. After seeing this, I better understand that we value too much on achievement and the people we love are not enough. Passion and simplicity is what we need.
