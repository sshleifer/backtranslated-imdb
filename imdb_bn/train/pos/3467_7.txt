I wonder why I still saw this movie. Confession, before I saw this picture, I knew something useful about Beatle. I do not even know all their names! I knew that they had a ton of fans, some of them had albums that some claimed to be the greatest of all times, they broke up, married John Yoko and killed John. <br /> <br /> Also, VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV. Yet, for some reason or another I decided to see it, I do not expect much. Surprisingly, I've enjoyed it a lot! Dialogue is written and written very well with little accented mess-up ceremony. This is very important, because most of the movies in John and Paul are enough, even though they are looking for more possibilities and taken out to see you. Jared Harris and Adrian Quinn gave good performance. <br /> <br /> was ultimately very smart. The movie gives you excitement about SNL performance and enjoys enjoying you and you realize that if it is good then it will be good and it will end in a good note. My favorite moments are probably the touching rooftops. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this film to almost everyone. After a break after 6 years, it is a great way to settle your curiosity about what could happen if Paul only stood at Johnson's door. Perhaps my main reason for watching this movie is that the beetles were really and my curiosity about what could happen after my break.
