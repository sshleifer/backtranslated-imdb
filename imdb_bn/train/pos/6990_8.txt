Bela Lugosi appeared in these small budget chillers for the monogram studio in the 1940s and Corps Vansish is one of the better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Play a crazy scientist who kidnaps a young wife and then sticks her fluid from her body so that she can keep her old-looking wife looking young. A journalist and a doctor stayed at his house at night and discovered that he was responsible for the death of the wife, the next morning he told the murders to the police and the mad scientist shot and died soon after. <br /> <br> You've got almost everything in this film: Scientist's assistants hold an old crawl, a hanback and dwarf (his son), thunder and collapsed passages in the bell room. Bila and his wife have found good sleep in the coffins instead of the cinema bed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Great fun. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 5 out of 3 stars.
