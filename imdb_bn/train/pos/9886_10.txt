It's apparently a fantastic movie. Pictures of the Mexican desert, the old palaces, the characters in their handsome dresses ... the actual amount of artwork. <br /> <br /> The story looks a bit loose, but it does not mean it's realistic. It is taken from a book called Hendrik Years of Solidudes, and it is the isolated, unforeseen atmosphere of Latin America "far from God, and so far to the United States". Iridina has a great debt owed to her grandmother a symbol of the international debt burden of Latin America, although there are many levels of money. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate a slow-moving, rich-textured movie, it's for you.
