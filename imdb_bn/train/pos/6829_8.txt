Gena Raolands plays an actress when she is an eyewitness to her bird's death. She became increasingly deluded from reality, and as a result her mental turmoil intrudes with her work as an actress. In this sense, he has broken all the rules of performance and development, but still as a filmmaker, the parallel film of his own struggles as a film maker makes it attractive (if it is a little less important), acting to his audience. So many ideas have spread around and as a result it has become somewhat boring (I still think of the relationship between dead birds and roulette much more), but they are consistently attractive and thought-provoking film on the way they presented them in raw form. A double bill with Mulholland Drive will be great. <br /> <br />
