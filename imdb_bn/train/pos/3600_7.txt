At first glance, I hope this picture is vague because I thought that this plot would be so feminist. But I was wrong. You may read before published published comments, I agree that the feminist part of this movie is not disturbed. I never had the idea that the main character exaggerated her position like a woman. It is presented to someone with a spine like Gujman, it is against his classmate. So I was surprised by the stories, in fact, I thought it was quite good, without the expected ending. Perhaps it was a better concept for plots to make a fundamentalist move, so that the audience was a little surprised. Also, I want to say that Rodr√≠guez earned his honor the way he kept his character away. I really can not explain why, but in particular love scenes she believed in me. It seems just realistic. <br /> <br /> I just got 7 out of 10, due to the last half-hour.
