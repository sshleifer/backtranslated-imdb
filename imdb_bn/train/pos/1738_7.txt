This is a ridiculous movie. Bart Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signed a sponsorship agreement with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pitt restaurants. The contract contains all kinds of abusive clauses, such as wearing a chicken suit while bert competition! Jim Nabbers is his main mechanic (not quite believable). Lonnie Anderson (Oh, yes!) Reynolds appoints Betty to keep loyalty to the covenant honest and firmly. This is a funny movie that Bart shows that he is not very proud. I like it
