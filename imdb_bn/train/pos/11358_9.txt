The poor DVD video quality is the only reason, I gave 9 movies instead of 10. It could have been so good that the movie claimed it. <br /> <br /> This is really a movie which covers the theme across a few at a time. If you do not like movies about serial killers, but were fascinated by the wonderful bureaucratic culture of the former Soviet Union, then this film must be seen. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to "silence" for various reasons. "Serial killer is depicted, Citizen X has been much better." You see a lot of details about his personal life because you "Travel" with the murderer, which gives you some ideas about her continuous anger and sexual despair <br /> <br /> <br /> The only other movie that I saw was real As wife, "Henry - Portrait of a serial killer." If you are impressed by the movie Citizen X, but you need to keep an eye on.
