I love the old Bart Reynolds movie. They are fun and better than meeting all other movies. They can stop making movies after "Canonball Run 2", but I think how they know that there will be no good things? This movie is good people Bart Reynolds has to roam around a chicken-like dress and many around Rascad and the luxurious Lonnie Anderson is in the hands, it's been very hot for eighteen years. Bart and Lonnie, those days were! I used this magazine, in which Lonnie Anderson was a vacuum cleaner's ad. I'm sure the ads are preferred! Plus there is a part where the movie viewers have become disturbed by the strokes S (Bourdie R.) and one person in the audience is sticking to his fingers on his fingers to show his humility! I laugh so much at night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then again do not see another movie, because I'm telling you now: There is no point.
