Auto pruning, Twenty-one Century Fox completes a silent cycle, with his "Laura" gathering, this Starc plays a malicious detective drama. Dana Andrews once again portrays a policeman, but this time he is harsh, reprehensible and accusing police of cruelty by his superior - "You do not hate the hood, you love to kill them!" Mark Dickson (Andrews) hates the criminals, because his own father was violent. She does not want to be "Sandy Dixon's Child", so she became a policeman, but her methods were harsh and hateful. <br /> <br /> One night, investigating the murder, he is unidentified suspect, K. Pine (Craig Stevens) is so hard that he kills him. A scary Thug for a shaken Dixon offense, Scalise (Gary Merrill) intended to frame, it does its best to cover the cover. However, Pine's father-in-law is guilty of guilty of jigsaw teller (Tom Tully), whose daughter's department department model Morgan Taylor (Tearney) is separated from her husband but her gambling goes to Scheim. Pine raped his wife, tortured her father, who showed up in her in-laws apartment, but Dixon did not go with the body. With a suspect, Jagges is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> In connection with guilt, Mark falls for Morgans and pays for attorneys. He decides to accept Schlaive anyway, but leaves the letter given to the department on death, admits everything. Finally, he can not live with knowledge by what he has done and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan professes his love for Mark and he will wait for him. <br /> <br /> This film was very good to find the DVD after many years of television obscurity. Film Noor historian Eddie Muller commented and did a good job, but I found his firmness that the audience could not have assumed the significance of the two-point vote because "Laura" was created six years ago. In this case, he is wrong because he appeared on "The Iron Curtain" two years before the WTSE and this movie was a box office success. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's burning. <br /> <br /> The night-time movie gives the threat to the wind. Gary Maryly is as great as a low-life sledgee, who had passed away with Dixon's father ("Your Dad Loved Me"), he taunts Mark. Carl Malden and a young Neville brand are awesome too. And Tom Tully is just touching and funny as Morgen's wrongdoing pop. <br /> <br /> Mute a watchable film with a superb cast.
