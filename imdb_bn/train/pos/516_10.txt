It is one of the best movies of all time. Dark and white changes were the directorial superiority for the sequences of heaven and earth. <br /> <br /> The plot is very clever, the whole movie is overwhelmed by the emotion of all human beings, and although it is a fight movie it does not discriminate. I've seen this film more than any other time, and I never got the fatigue of it. This is a movie that asks questions about your own death and beliefs about what will happen after our death.
