I'm worried that my daughter may get a wrong idea. I think the character of "Dark Heart" is a bit rough and I do not like it, is it "average" frog, Fox, boy? I was wrong, this movie was made for my kids, not for me. When he went (under?) On my head "it gets". Of course I do not "get it". This is not a new kids movie that adults will also enjoy. These are straightforward for young people, and the crew knew what they were doing. There is no political junk ether. There is no magic in the world that will save itself from the world, nobody has the right to access more and not everyone will be happy. And as a side advantage, someone dies! ?? russwill
