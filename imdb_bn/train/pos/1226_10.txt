They portrayed this film on Long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extra in this movie. Apparently there are some party scenes where they all drink beer, (which they said to me was very difficult to swallow colorful water, hateful taste, and repeatedly, especially in the phenile scene). Nevertheless, none of us listened to the release of any movie in any form. It was in the theater (apparently) and it did not come as far as I knew, never released in the video, and I'm not sure that the DVD was not released. Yet it seems that some people have seen it, although it is probably too few. So there must be something. I absolutely love to buy it for my brother, even though I can not find it anywhere. Does anyone know when / where / can this movie be purchased? And which format?
