More like psychological analysis of movies, but psycho titles make sound as well. The person in charge of the film (if you're a narrator), illustrates his movies here. Most of them are classic, but all of them are listed here in IMDB and I firmly recommend you to watch them (especially Hitkoc film, Solairies, Conversations and Lynch movies), because Slabaj Jizak will mention them! <br /> <br /> Or in other words, he could harm them for you. I do not think it's more damaged than I listed (I think Chaplin's film), but I wrote that if you see them all before, it will be good! There is a movie missing in the IMDB list, which I reported to them, so it can get there soon. This is a Meg Ryan film, but it's a short concise snippet that is not big for any deal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It will, but it can be!)!
