I think this movie is a wonderful piece, but it took at least 4 or 5 times to watch me, so that I could understand that this is a great movie. First, it describes the face of WW2, which we usually do not see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army and Nazi government are shown more "human". In the last 20 years, there was an event that affected me the most from the end of the film at the end of the assassination in the forest: Forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexander: The jungle where Reinhold killed Mijs. Another formula for those who want details, door presentation. Changes among people are erroneous when fasibinders roam around the door or open the door. Many doors are shown on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change their personality, their work, etc. any time. Have you noticed?
