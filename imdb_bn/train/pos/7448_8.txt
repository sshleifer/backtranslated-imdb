I have not laugh for a long time - even though there are some tragic moments in the movie, especially when it becomes hyper-fun and honest. Most of the characters are mostly realistic, sometimes sad, but quite reliable. I'm not a fan of the Jerry Springer show - I'm sorry for the participants. This picture is a satirical instead, and it works great. <br /> <br /> This movie has been broadcasted on public TVs, it has all the imperfection * been * out of breath, it feels much fun. I'll be enjoying this movie completely. <br /> <br />
