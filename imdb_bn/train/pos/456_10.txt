This is a lovely, soul-recovery movie. Inspired by the use of real villas, inspired by the inspiration of Elizabeth Mangang's inspiration in the 1920s, every choice was perfectly right! This movie is not bound to see the joy of repeating the cool joy. Jose Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plover seem to have been born to play these parts! I would love to see the movie Enchanted April released in a widescreen format.
