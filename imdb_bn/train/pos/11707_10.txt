I think this film seems so long ago, even if it did not have any special effects, the acting was really good. And today it has the same message for it, although the technology has changed, they can probably rebuild the movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also enjoyed the music from the movie, Larry Norman was a true writer during that period, although most Christian music now is worshiping and praising music. After the series ended, I was always interested to know what happened to Patye? She went to more movies, she finally got to get married and raise a family? I would like to make an update.
