Tarzan and Jane are living happily in the jungle. Some people are looking for ivory and Jane comes back to take civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take him back ... even if he means killing Tajan. <br /> <br /> This is a rareness - a series of good from the original. The 1932 "Tarzan, the Ape Man" was good but some terrific special effects were dragged. This one has many great effects and is much more adult. There are many racist racism (a black man is shot dead in death - and nobody really thinks) but it was 1934. There was plenty of blood, dirt and violence (for the filming of 1934) and unauthorized prints that made the whole naked swimming under a long water! There is also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane wear some later and (they mean) they are sleeping together and having sex - without getting married. It will not bother anyone today, but in 1934 it was extremely extreme. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the movie is very well run, very fast moving and adventurous and exciting. In that skimpy lion cloth, weissmuller is certainly a treat for eyes and Jane's props are very revealing. I still think that Morin and Sullivan are just as bad as Jane but like Wizmulla's Tarzan, perfect. Everyone else is okay. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best Wisler - Oahara Tarzan. Good price but not for kids!
