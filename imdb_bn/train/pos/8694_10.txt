It was in 1988, when I saw "Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (Austrian television). At that time, I was already a big fan of the spitting image (since 1986 won the bronze rose of the Montevideo Film Festival). Of course I recorded every show on tape and saw it again - especially "Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember the scene when Ronnie Abraham stood in front of Lincoln (it was a mirror) and said, "I need a shave". Or most of his fun, when he played ball with his dog - but the opposite! <br /> <br /> It's shameful that the image seems to be forgotten; It's sometimes the most gorgeous and most intelligent TV show made. It was definitely the best of all compared to other sophisticated broadcasts. <br /> <br /> It's been 20 years since then, and I could see the show again. It can be bought from anywhere ... anywhere?
