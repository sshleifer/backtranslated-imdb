Some summer camps were actually sent to space by a robot. And the ship's oxygen is running small. For gas tanks, etc., they had to send to a space station <br /> <br /> Firstly, the plot of this film is not possible in real life. But if you have set your heart, then it is possible to have some warm feeling. <br /> <br /> This young actors are so surprised to see that they still look the same after many years. (For the first time I saw this movie in 2000, it was filmed in 1986) There are several people who are still working in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This scene was great from space. It does look unreal. It's about 2 hours long, you do not even notice that it takes so fast. You know that this is not real, but you end up eventually suck it. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good family movie. <br /> <br />
