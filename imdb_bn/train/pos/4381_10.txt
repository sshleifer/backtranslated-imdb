This sweeping drama has it all: Top Notch Acting, Incredible Photography, Good Stories This is often compared to "Brahhart" because both films are held in historic Scotland. Although I love Brevehart, I think it's better than two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar). The role of Liam Nixon titles is fantastic. Tim Roth plays one of the worst, hateful characters in film history (he was nominated for the Oscars). John Hart Lord Montrose, nice as another disliked character. I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Heart plays. Debate over the meaning of money between Rob Roy and his descendants and Lord Montros Rob Roy is a self-reliant person who does not solve his problems with Montrose, if he violates the honor. There is no sense of respect, who owns the title of Monroe, his title. And that's basically what this story is about; Corruption against corruption of common people This movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has an exciting plot. One of my favorite movies is one.
