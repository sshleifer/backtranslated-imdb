Starced fans are only familiar with her work from the teenage girl film, a great actor Streiseand Wash - to watch this show - before reaching her goal of becoming a movie star. Sometimes there will never be a female singer like him, and there will never be again (sorry, celtine - only in your dream!), But Streisand will be reunited with vibrations, energy, and above all, with EnthusIASM and with whom he has played here - At the time he goes back to Central Park concert only after 2 or 3 years, he portrays Hollywood's Fooni Girlfriend and his acting style is less spontaneous Bong more reserved, more practice (and, let's face it would be more angry) - There is a wall between her and the audience. She did not really enjoy the live performance she really enjoyed - she did it because she knew that it was her Hollywood ticket, and once she did not do it, she did it as soon as possible (and oh, that legendary level fear is such a good supply Excuse!). <br /> <br /> Her voice is unbelievable in the sounds of here and her predecessory Judy Gerland: Streissand can really recreate the old song, and the musicians of Richard Rogers and Harald Arlen loved him. But in the 1970s, Streisand was a "rock" singer, trying to put his albums inside young audiences, shouting the ability of his effort or the incompetence of his voice. <br /> <br /> He returned with that bright "Broadway album" in the 80's, but how much struggle he had taken to end it, how he did not say "it", etc. Oh please - Streissand What would someone say? He could do such good things, which brought the audience what they wanted to the young people instead of bringing the UPs to its level. ("Back to Broadway" Not very good, Streisand thinks that the composer's work needs to be improved: If he was alive at that time, then Richard Rogers also knew his own "some spectacular evening". Rogers, notorious for working around playing around with his tune of singers, undoubtedly He could sing what he wrote after Straussand! He used Michael Crowford's "Night of Music" couples    সিডি থেকেও মারধর করেছিলেন - দৃশ্যত তাকে তার সিডিটি স্মরণ করিয়ে দিচ্ছে কেন? এই গানগুলি কেনো সেগুলোকে ডুয়েট করে এবং নিজের দ্বারা গান গাইতে এবং গানগুলিকে দুয়েক না করে গান গাইতে আর অন্য কারো সাথে ডুয়েট হিসাবে গাইতে থাকে কেন? <br/> <br /> Guess that Judy Garland took Streisand aside and advised her, "Do not give them what they have done to me", Straussand counsel did not waste time in protest. It always looks like its way or highway. Just imagine - he told CBS Bras how to make his first TV special - there is no guest, only <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was a legend before he treated himself with this brilliant musical phenomenon - you would be absolutely surprised at the difference! <br /> <br /> PS - I saw it last night (12/01) after seeing it many years - I was better off feeling better! The first law began with "I'm not obsessed" and "how to taste" and "how to taste wine," and Barbara began to pay homage to childhood, "I'm five" - ​​it appeared fully in Streisand (and I mean full) Orchestra "public "Singing - he was not indifferent to the song yet, and although it's a little bit of presentation, it really increased - after that some of its" auto-pilot "versions Compare with bullets. The second act (after Streissand's "Cookie" Schicik-Patter, which has not been changed for many years) is the famous section of depression songs set in Bergardford-Goodman's greatness. <br /> <br /> The third law stunner - Say "Streisand, orchestra, and the audience" (although we do not see the audience who do not believe this incident). This can be the hardest part for him because of his fear of the audience and the liking of such performance, but if so, it is not shown for his achievement. She "Come back to me lover" and the torch "When the sun comes out" (though I can not remember any order!), "Why did I choose you?" Streisand Performance) and a Medal of Fooni Girl song (of course) "The Rain on My Parded" and scored a medal of my favorite song "The Music Jute Make Me Dance" from the score. Explains that "Fan Briss sang a song like a song in 1922, and made him the toast of Broadway", Straussand then sings the song "My Man", and it is often a dress-rehearsal template that is followed by the next Screen Rennesi Foonini Girl In the film (the main difference is that here the gown is a disappointment - his film gown was a long covered and black background which we see Person was on his hands and face), but more important than the voices of her voice, and charged her next film. (There is nothing to do with Stereissand and Fannie Bris with his performance in the song, of course, here or here in the film - like the Grey Streisand, on this all-out ground - see the Great Jigphheld to see a different version of Bris.) " Happy days are here again "with the song. <br /> <br /> When I said to his friend, "He has never done anything good!" <br /> <br /> <br /> Her age is three-three years!
