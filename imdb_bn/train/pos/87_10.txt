This Academy Award winner can rank among the best in the short film series. Completely said without a conversation, it is a visual treatment about a young boy who buys a goldfish, lovingly places him in a bowl, then goes to school, unprotects the gold fish and leaves a window unexpectedly unexpectedly. After a while, a neighboring orange tabby comes almost insect, comes with windows and heads slowly for the bowl. The fish is apparently going to something and it gets very excited. The cat comes very close to the bowl, the fish goes out. The cat took the fish, put the bowl again in the bowl and came out through the window, the boy did not know exactly as it happened, came back. This was impressed with amazing real animals; How Cousteau behaved in this manner got this creature extraordinary. I was just willing to see this image people are now available; I saw it once, it was originally released in 1959, but it remains unforgettable.
