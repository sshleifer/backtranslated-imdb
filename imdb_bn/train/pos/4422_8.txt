Well, if you are one of the katana movies (like me), then you are sure to act as the Action Flick Swing Samurai of this episcopal katana bloodshed. <br /> <br /> Scramble (Vital, Baron Illusion) and Rou Dijouk (Kaizmusa). This Samurai war between the descendants of Hanani of the Hanani tribe touched Xenoth in the final showdown in Gozo Bridge. Countless body count <br /> <br /> Beautiful looks given by giant, magic sword, Buddhist beggars versus Buddhist beggars, Shino Patron and prominent Sogo Ishii will be rested. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese flick for a rainy summer night.
