I grew up watching the scuba and have been a fan forever. This cartoon move away from the same old routine that visitors can get annoying. The crooks in the mask routines gets old and this is a change from that cartoon. Replacing a Scubby gang does not mean that it is a break from the same old crime scenes for both viewers and writers. The focus of the cartoon is on the scubby and the rag, which is the heirs of huge amounts and the money used by the mad scientist and his gangsters to stop world-winning plans. Gangs and gangs are featured in small tributes from time to time. If you are a fan of the skuboo-do, you can still appreciate the humor that comes with a boy and his conversation with the dog. Just enjoy the cartoon and support the creator / writer and producer so that it is not the last sketch cartoon.
