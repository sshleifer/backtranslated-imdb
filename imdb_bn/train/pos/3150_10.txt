I did not like many TV shows since 1990, but 70 shows that are great. It's never seen during its first run, a scary piece of time, I think I was wrong! I started seeing the resurrection and as much as I saw, I liked it more! Now, since 1990, this is the only show premiere that I regularly see. <br /> <br /> While 70 seconds of the show imitates some styles, attitudes, music, and taste of 70, it does not make itself fun. That decade by going overboard with references and look of 70's. It is so funny, malicious, intelligent dialogue that is delivered through confidence and certainty in its main cast that it tricks it out of a 70 clich√©. <br /> <br /> Although a sunny sitcom does not matter for a period of time, the uniqueness of 70 seconds fun is working on it because it shows the signature of the show. But it draws attention to universal factors (focus issues, teen angst, marital problems, classmates pressure), they all deal with comic attack, which gives a mass appeal to the shot. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eric is still coming off as super-cool due to the bright self-reliance of a super skinny, geeky-looking, non-athletic teen and Grace of the character. Eric's 5 friends have played Donna, Heide, Kells, Jackie and Fitz (played by Laura Pripon, Danny Mastersson, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Cunis, and Wilmer Valerama). We will see life in the eyes of these six teenagers in Point Place, Wisconsin, and the boy will get a lot to see! Donna is a forward-thinking feminist, Eric's love affair and the two are the main relationships. Soon after the show began they became a couple and they are never boring couple. Most programs end up with meaningful conversations with them and their future, and it works as a great insightful bookand, which serves as the perfect counter of previous laughs. Hey Erik's best friend and soon after his form went away, his mother left him; Hyde is gentle, Jane, the group is a cool and just sitting back, observing, and makes fun of her fellow friends with a straightforward aplomb. One of the Kelsos group's mobile phones and Kutcher plays in full swing, displaying amazing physical comedy as well as the most painful laughing ideas and telling stories! Jackie, introduced as Kelsor's girlfriend, is a verb, self-absorbed debut cheerleader and is only acceptable as part of the Kelsoro group B / C, but she moves herself to accept the way she needs to accept all of them! And finally, Fez! Fez foreign exchange students from some unknown countries (we do not know where exactly) and he steals a scene! "I say good day!" "You son of a B * tch!" Valderama not only plays as a foreign accent here as she is not one of the realities and she always creates one in character and one of the most unique characters I have ever seen. His visual-stolen moments often help create a show for me. <br /> <br /> This program takes the thoughts and thoughts of these characters across imaginative scenes about how to choose or imagine us. The gang repeatedly gets into problem (the purpose is most of it). They continually play Gags with Point Place residents as well as each other. They take most of Eric's basement platings, punching, or almost plain play. <br /> <br /> The main features of this event are Eric's parents, appealing, common-hatred, red and loving, happy. -go-lucky Kiss (played memorable by Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp). These two adults give this program a very mature mature perspective and are continually demolished and 6 N'our du-Wells advise. Red and Kitty are supported by Donna's parents, Bafunish Bob (played fine for full-fledged Dawn Stark) and blonde Bibboo deft miz (super-sexy Tania Roberts, who was nearly half as seen for rice). In addition, for 3 full seasons, Erick's sister was a major refreshing relief for Eric and her parent's thorns to deal with the main six Schengenes, and Lorry of hell (starring Lisa Robin Kelly as the evil sexy actress Farah-Fouusette). 'The sides! Kelly returned as guest character for some seasons 5 EPS. But, unfortunately, Kelly's personal problems led him to replace Sean 6 with a terrible new actress. The bride was not finished, with gratitude, and after 6 seasons of EPS went away! <br /> <br /> Sorry, at the end of session 7, Ashton Kutcher (Kelsos) left the show at the top and Eric at the beginning of session 8 and it was not restored as the end of Season 8. Grace and Kutcher returned to the series, though, gave a satisfactory end to the shot. <br /> <br /> Many great supporters and camio characters will help keep the link fresh through nostalgia and humor. The top genuine supporters have always been in high leo (played by Tommy Chong's rivalry), Pastecher Dave, Roy (Wonderful Comic Jim Guffigan), Big Ronda, Mitch, Earl etc. They play the legendary Mario Ross (Happy Days) and Betty White (The Merry Tyler More Show), respectively, and Red Kitty plays. By the end of the 70s, many celebrities were reduced, from Sarli Jones (Parttiz family) to Pamela Su Martin (Nancy Drau) to four, Tess Nugent Kaisa. He was also present! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
