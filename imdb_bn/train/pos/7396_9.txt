Another outstanding foreign movie that cuts the growing Crude crop from Hollywood! This is a story of living and living. No, there is definitely not a perfect little life that is often portrayed in artificial Hollywood movies, but with real characters in real life in our lives and real people like ourselves and with the real characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> The dynamics of all these animals, this bathhouse and especially its old owners are attached inside the walls, great, heart touch and extremely worrisome. <br /> <br /> Sit back, take a break and take away the simple and beautiful life. If you have the real knowledge to learn in this movie then you just open yourself in it. <br /> <br /> Do not be frustrated.
