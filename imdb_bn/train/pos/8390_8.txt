My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Films and alternative movies (with short, uncomfortable seats, public Philippians had to wait while the changes were made). There was a perfect match. <br /> <br /> Many clips were used in the film, but the fasciinders presented them with so much skill that I Found them really amusing. The word was too bright (sometimes more loud than the conversation). <br /> <br /> Everything was in place. And I like how it was presented during the war. Real fun! <br /> <br />
