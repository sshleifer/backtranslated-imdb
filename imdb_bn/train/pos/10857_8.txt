Johnny made one of his best style exercises here, and Yakuza made a strong film with the story. The start of the war in the organization of the new Yakuza boss <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is very difficult to use in advertising with violence, making a gang film. I especially like the history, continue with all the roles in the Yakuza family, and we see violence, just as the only way to solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> Talking about, technical aspects, filming a movie shooting A good example of annoying, idiom and planned approach. Hong Kong film of the year is one. Like hateful things, but simple actions are like violence scenes and confused stories. All Asian film lovers strongly recommend. <br /> <br /> (Sorry for my english, spanish lol do well)
