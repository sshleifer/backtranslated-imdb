As a supporter of Peter Cushing and David McCallum, I wanted to see this picture. I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time, but McCullum's genius was brighter with this zoo role. Thanks to Akash for broadcasters Turner Classic last week. I can imagine that there was a lot of problems with the kids after the war, especially the ways in the 1950s. The boys are a little scary. I certainly do not want to meet them with a good light, a little too dark. There were some good insights about the feeling of firebug, or they call him a fire.
