Instead of the 1950s, unexpected (using any mysterious 'space-dust'), using a special electronic collar has been discovered, a young man, Timmy, finds a friend of Fido (Billy Conley), whose family recently received animated zombie. <br /> <br /> Fido quickly became an official father of Timi, whose real father could not express his love for his son (or his carrier-anne Moss for his hot-to-trot wife), psychologically disappointed like a child (When he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to feed him!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It goes shining, and In an old neighbor attacked and killed. Fido's position with authorities, trouble with a pair of local bullies, and his mother builds ties with their non-residential home-help, Tommy can retain his new adult friend? <br /> <br /> Acquiring a refresh to the full Jimmy Skty, Fido is a perfectly entertaining, tasty dark comedy that should appeal to humor a little intensely. Romero taking the zombie-verse and replacing it in the 1950s is a stroke of American genius, and as a result, I have found that being one of the only main films to deal with the old 'rebuilt dead' theme. <br /> </ br> / Connelly's Fido is a movie zombie that is worthy of the death of the deceased on the day of Bush, and the live return of the live star of the Templar Return; It does not often feel sympathetic to the walking body, but Big Yan's performance is so fine that I have transformed myself into a bluish blue bag! Young Caston Roy (Timmy) and Miss Mason praised cast performances with special mention ?? The verdict, because, at such a young age, he particularly reassured and Moss is because he saw this third jumbo film this week (others have some frustrating terrible terrorism and flying flights instead of flying dead), and I'm surprised, it's good. Director Andrew Curry gave some fans of the genuine treasure house and a talent to see it in the future. <br /> <br /> out of 10, 8.5 for 9 amdbd
