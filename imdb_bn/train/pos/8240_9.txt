I was in Toronto for the premiere. I think this image was a comfort sort when I did not see my first choice. Well, I just flew away. When I came to the theater, I could remember a little more than the basic plot of the movie (yes, I really forgot what was in it too.) The whole cast's superb acting. A true departure from his days as Kerry-Anne Mous Trinity was great. As Billy Connolly, I think Chaplin's actors are not acting so brilliantly that in any consistent way. The kids were also great. Please check this one for sure if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> And, however, I got to see my first choice - and this was good in this way.
