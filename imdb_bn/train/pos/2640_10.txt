Clearly, this movie has not seen many people, because no one else comments. It's not a movie to miss. After all, it won the George Peabody Prize as well as the Humanitus Prize. Paul Winfield won an award for his extraordinary performance in the film. Eugene Logan was a co-author for the TV movie, was a partner in another film against humanity, or Trauman Coppot became the technical advisor to Glass House. This movie is now available in DVD. If anyone is interested, then I would post another letter that how Eugene Logan came as a technical advisor to the movie of an amazing person like Truman Capet. Thanks for reading this and I hope you find a way to see these two movies.
