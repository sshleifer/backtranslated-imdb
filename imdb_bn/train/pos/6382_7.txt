Of course a very good idea, the screenplay was just fine. All right, positive things are if you're an adventure lover, but it's a new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. The idea that I personally felt personally was far more probable than this. They will end up with boldness more than this. It was not bad, but it got better with more runtime. Although it enjoyed a lot, say it was not annoying or not good .. who like Lol Laura Dodda likes to love adventure like an Indus This movie has been recommended to find a nice little adventure for a very happy happy. The end
