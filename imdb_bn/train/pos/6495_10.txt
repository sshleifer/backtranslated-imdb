Of the 10 out of 10, this brilliant, super-documentary must definitely be seen, the clips of this war film that can not be seen in human eyes until it is shown in 1974. In this documentary some of the movie clip clips will not miss, some of the clips left me dumbstuck. The whole series is a length of more than 20 episodes and Sir Lawrence Olivier is a narrator and a great story of war. Only this is still probably the best documentary of the fight, and now 25 years old still allows to pack a solemn punch. You will certainly see it even though it is a few episodes, even you will still have an impact on the effect of this documentary, who has suffered and died in the name of a ward in the name of war. ..
