I really like this picture, yes, I know that it was fairly far away, there were no other way except the Shelby's car being on the road as well as all the traction controls of 540i and other zizmos. The film is well-formed. Cage was as nice as usual and the rest of the brown Brite Bad Girl was quite good without exception, she does not feel a lot "very"? However, great movies, great cars and great acting. I was one of those sure that my car was locked and alarmed in my remote remote controlled garage. :)
