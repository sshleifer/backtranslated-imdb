If you're a fan, you probably will enjoy this. If you do not know Miss Mune, Darian Kain, Ruby Larka, or a Seduction Movie, it's not a movie to begin. It's very cute, stupid, girls hot, and fun to see it. There is no sex to the end of the 45-minute film, but the score is not Chesy-Trippi and the plot is full of bore. Sweet Mind's makeup This film is bad and her hair is painful braids, so she is not as hot as she has been among others. But her panties are quite tricky (you really will see that movie for really strange sound). If you like it, you probably will enjoy the "Girl of the 70's", "Vampire Vixen" or "Boyfriend Survivor" (which enjoys more sex graphic). If you would like to see Misty or Assembled in low sex, more horrifying / exploitation-based (but less budget) movies, see the Factory 2000 website.
