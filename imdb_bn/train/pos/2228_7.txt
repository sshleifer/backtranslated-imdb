The main problem I saw with this movie is its score, which shouted with every note, "This is a cheap ass movie." There is not much to say about here <br /> <br /> The second problem, which I see as very serious, as well as dialogue between the inevitability of the plot (one of the money shots, if you were), Martha (Adrian barbecue) and sunflowers (Richard Zimon) at the end of the film , Among which Martha appeared as a test leader. Always during the dialogue, the audience is very aware that he listens to the movie dialogue. In other words, the disbelief immediately break here. The integrity of the credible dialogue between the two people is dedicated to providing information that the filmmakers want to provide information to the audience. <br /> <br /> The third problem is Adrian Barbeau's cast. Although I truly believe in her belief as an incredible actress, I think this part can be very stretched. It does not seem to be fake that the main issue of his performance was a spectrum that took the character from a sad family to a missionary mother to a rambo-like woman in a mission. This aspect of the script was probably extended to an actress, and it can not be so much blame on the barbecue. He acted in most of the cases he earned, but I would simply call this picture a completely serious problem. Finally, the picture did excellent work in the first half of the building. A crop factor, most significantly during its horror flashes. I think the film will be benefited by making the film more committed for these flashs as a process to prevent the flash of the crap factor in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> So this is my overall grading? Piece? I would like to b this a solid C +, depending on how much credit you want to give to the makers for making this movie in limited budget. Even with two serious and two medium critical problems, the film is based on the strong plot of the Nazi mysticism. I see no problem with the development or coordination of the plot; Dialogue with the exceptions mentioned above, bright shining on the mother tongue in the beginning of movies and especially in all important pest scenes; As mentioned, the cripfact was made well, if the second half is intertwined; And Nicholas Brendon, who is associated with the production, delivered an amazing performance. <br /> <br /> To everyone, this image is visible - see it with your favorite Nazi. :)
