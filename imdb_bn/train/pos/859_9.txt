It is very rare to find a movie that provides a plot that can not be taken out of every escape. Life is full of joy. <br /> <br /> I did not understand a few things, though here are the characters of your led female that are playing "good girl, hard working" and finally she ends up taking a social-social risk. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, the movie. I have never been or what was his problem. If anyone has any ideas then I would like to hear what I want to hear. <br /> <br /> The picture was exciting and fun and always guessed me. Look very valuable.
