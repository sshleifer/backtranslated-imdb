Fast and easy, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As others mentioned, I am not from the south, I really do not take care of the country's music and never wear cowboy hat. (I'm not wandering in the car with the body of my trunk, but I love "GoodFellas.") It's just making a great movie. A 2.35 impressed in the aspect ratio and transferred to beautiful DVD. (VHS 1.33 was full screen). And yes, a strong 5.1 mix for your viewing pleasure. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> This is a great love / hate story, which is set with great acting. Travolta is fantastic. Next to "Paul Fiction", this is the best thing to do. My top 5 for 25 years! <br /> <br /> <br /> it's a 10 !!!!
