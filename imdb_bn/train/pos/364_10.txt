Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Alice Walker's popular novel is not without a part of his debate. During the first time during the Liberation War, others criticized the treatment of black men, why did a white man manage this movie about black films? <br /> <br /> The story of a black black woman named Seli, growing in rural America at the end of the century. His miscreant father has robbed his child from his arms during his birth. Her only comfort comes from her sister in her unfortunate life. <br /> <br /> Selly (later played the new actor, Huley Goldberg) is married to an insulting husband (Danny Glover). The husband is insulted by the sister and so she is quickly moved to Shelley's life. <br /> <br /> This story is suddenly heartfelt because Selly hopes she can meet together with her sister and her children one day. Throughout her life, she was hard-working as Sofia, her step-son's nail wife, and Shug, a loud and delightful Sluran singer, who gave some or two teachings about love. > Spielberg's direction is on this photo, which provides bright cinematography and performance of some stars. I dare not see this picture and you will not move! The image is managed by the colorful violet retention of a complex story. Although it could reduce gay culture as well as African stories, both of them were so animated in this book, that the film really adopts them in its themes, alice waqer's words shine. <br /> <br /> I could not begin to respond to the controversy surrounding this image. Not to say, however, it is one of the few movies that I can see repeatedly and that has kept an uninterrupted mark on me. <br /> <br />
