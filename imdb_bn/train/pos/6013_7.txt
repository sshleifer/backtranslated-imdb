After seeing it again in a gap for many years and reminding the flop, after its real release, I was amazed how good it was. One of the reasons for his failure is that one generation felt that it was blamed and a small person was disappointed that it would not show complete Hippie glory. Now it is clear that Antonioi was already conscious and fascinated by the enthusiastic mix of changes and the lack of clear visions for the future. The lead pair is nice and it's embarrassing that they were so blurred for the film's failure to guess. They express ideals and totally different contrasts and display pure joy in lovemaking. Initially, I am condemning others for increasingly increasingly increasingly increasing student rebellion, but it is revealed that one of them is watching the most beautiful pictures and he must have received the best from human made and natural landscapes. Oh, and I did not even mention the end of the explosive too.
