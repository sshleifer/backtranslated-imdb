Yesterday I was present in the premiere of the "exile" of the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. I had a great time. It was sold and co-worker was present by all the big stars, including my Spencer Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I started 7.5 out of the 10 possible movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> The college starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson). You can envision in the ideal college environment with running wild parties and flirtations. This photo photography was excellent. He met Jared (Chad Fawst) and they became sweetheart. It appears like any other relationship at the beginning. Men are hard to find in women's attention and affection and get to play. Both of these performed well. Very innocent flirtation between the two. He invited him to his apartment and everything was different. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very scary and dark. Finally, they ended up in the foundation, which is very dark and illuminated by numerous candles. This is actually a black hole reminding me. Here he shows his true colors and earns to rape her. This is a very dark and ray rape scene. This scene is not weak for young or weak. Rape scenes are a bit longer and difficult, but it is necessary for the rest of the film to follow. <br /> <br /> Maya now begins to lose her spirit to drug and sexuality. He falls into his own idleness. He started participating in the wildest part of the parties and woke up in the morning and there is no reminder about how he goes there. He was told to see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say "He is the person who stores the need to save". He is the one who takes the illusion of Maya. They started a relationship about dependency that came later to play in the film. The movie at this time the club scene is photo with extreme efficiency. I thought they did a good job and I noticed that the photographer was congratulated at the end of the audience's achievement. <br /> <br /> Maya again returned to college as TA and who is her class - her rapist Jared !! You could see confusion and emotions on the face of the Maya. What should i do What do I do next ?? His face shots and emotions are invaluable. <br /> <br /> What is happening is not really happening. He worked in Jared. She seems to be resuscitating the relationship and looking to be sweethearts again. I was sitting there really could be happening this. It was not. Nothing can be far from the truth. <br /> <br /> He invites him to his apartment and, of course, he shows. Now his apartment is dark and silky. She has completely strip her. He thinks he's going to get "lucky". Then she can tease her to any woman. He cursed him everywhere and he was getting excited. Note: Anyone who plans to watch this movie is totally in front of nudity - young viewers. <br /> <br /> Then she turns the situation and she becomes violent and is victim of rape. Him <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are going to watch the movie and do not want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and go to the end. Paragraph <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Adrian's picture shows. Maya Adrian (?) Protected Zerde with extremely rough male sex. He thinks this is a final revenge. Adrian Jared does not always hold the childhood and hold his dignity anymore. Marcus as Adrian, anyone plays this scene as credible as this. He plays a strong character in a strong actor and power comes out all over the screen. After the movie, during the question-answer session, Marcus explained that this scene needed many faiths between him and Chad. Maya believes that this vengeance will protect her but I do not think so. In one of the final scenes, Mess's face was closed and you saw a tear roll under his cheek. It was a fantastic closeup scene and started a steady discussion from anyone watching this movie. He wants to take revenge? Was it satisfying as he expected ?? In my opinion, it's not. It only makes things worse. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary movie, will play a good role and I suggest someone who thinks about watching it. I'm a little hesitant if I'm under 17. Rosario, Chad, and Marcus should be appreciated for the good work. Instructions and photography must be appreciated. It was a night I enjoyed.
