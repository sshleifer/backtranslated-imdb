Ratings are only 5 reasons why it is a movie that can play good acting and direction (or at least music!) However, it claims to be 10 for Walt Whitman's achievement. A previous poster is called Chasey, but it seems like it is not easy to see the forest for the trees. The filmmakers are more likely to find stories than have a Hollywood shiny feature film. And for this, I appreciate them - in fact this non-core stream also reflects Whitman's life. This documentary is more than the documentary request. When fascinated with such a story, you rarely hear such stories that the present day mental health shape, the most important thing. I found it a highly enjoyable look in history.
