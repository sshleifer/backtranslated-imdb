A true classic Beautifully shooting and acting. Reveals an area in Paris that is alive and full of comedy and tragedy. Although the 'Hotel du Nord' and the hotel itself exists, it is not as homosexual (in the original sense of the word) and it should be delighted once. This movie brings a year for the past, which became frustrating and lost with discretion.
