It could be a good film. It dragged in points, and accused Baira instead of Boyfriend's central story Boyfriend and campaigned for the death of Venda Hendrix, but Graham Greene is a writer who is really hard to spoil. Catholicism, crime, and innocence (the very relative position of his world scene), and stories of all the morals of his stories due to human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer Lewis Denard, a well-known concert pianist who collaborated with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He has been sent to England to carry out the surgical contract which is extremely needed. Unfortunately, he is literally on himself for Denver - all his acquaintances have become a deliberate turncoat for the Spanish Falagists. Especially Katina Packseinou (Mrs. Melendez) is a close-knit boarding house guard and Peter Loren (Mr. Contraceus) is an "Esperanto" type international language teacher. Wanda Hendrix works for Mrs. Melendez, who is the drudge of a girl (Else). Local diplomat, Likata (Victor Franken) is already an interested partner of the Fallangists. <br /> <br /> Do not give too much hope for the cause of Bright's (Homes Herbert, Miles Manger, and Best - if not bad - George Kuluris) Don Butler (which he may soon have been in Britain for a long time). Herbert and Mandar just back in the civil war by the government of Rams McDonald's and Stanley Belvedin, following the neutral governmental policies. Colouris here is a common colonel blaming type - always unreasonable in his native English fiction, he is generally sharp to show his dislike for foreigners. <br /> <br /> A beam of hope can be tried by Lauren Bacall (Rose Coolen), as well as his role here - but he really can not. She is an elite male - daughter of a press Lord. This was the second movie of Bacal, and (sadly) almost sank his long career. He works well, but in his first film, Spark has shown the double impact of acting with Humphrey Bogart and directed by Howard Hawk. Boy is a fine actor, but he is not Bogie, and Hermann Shumlin Hawks is not. The next image returned him to the bogies and hawks, and his star started its brightness again. <br /> <br /> This is a vague film (as a novel). Boyer's mission is not successful, he has many hidden enemies throughout the place. But villains have also been disappointed - often their life. <br /> <br /> Katina Packessano's suspected foreign hired (and who destroys him) with Dan Simu. Warner's many characters are unable to catch the best players due to weakness in the actor.
