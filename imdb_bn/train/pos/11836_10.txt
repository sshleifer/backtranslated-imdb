This animated movie is a Best Composition! Description, music, animation, and stories where all the extraordinary. My girlfriend and I again saw this for the second time and we got more insight from it. We invited a couple friends to see the soul with us and they really enjoyed it a lot. When I asked them to come to see them, they thought it was a movie about the horse, but later they realized that it was more than that. I love Esperanza, soul, rain, and Lil 'Creek, who smile me Nathan chasing a lot of dancing with the loot of those who reminded the horse. Spirit's deep symbolic meaning and metaphors that I thought were empowering and inspirational. <br /> <br /> I saw the spirit for the third time and I want to see again. I enjoyed the "soul" because the American Indians were realistic, glorious and irrational, like their screenplay in the film "The Road to El Dorado", which was a total symptom because it portrayed American Indians in an insignificant and intelligent way. But DreamWorks has freed me from the soul, which I think is acceptable! I hope they are continuing to carry more animated films like soul, and if I want to see Spirituals not being stereotyping the American Indian Indians, then I would like to see SpinerFox. <br /> <br /> To open the mind and see the soul Salary: The Stallion of Simran
