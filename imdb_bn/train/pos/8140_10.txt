I first saw this movie on some movie channels (HBO?). I saw CB4 in public fan, NWA and other primary RAB fan and theater. However, my eyesight was spreading for this, and I wanted to see all about it. Well, I knew it was going to be good (from the bat!) And I was right. Parody songs alone make this movie (my bees) look and value, but the overall flow and distribution of the film is great. You must love the rage group's mockery (of course NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and three members of NWH's humorous. Who can forget the tone deaf with his donkey? It is very bad that the film did not receive its credit, because it was spread by CB4 during the liberation war, but in my opinion it is a good film. If you know and like 90's gangster rap, you will see this movie for a long time and laugh. If you do not like 'Wrap' or you do not want it, you will enjoy the fun of this genre.
