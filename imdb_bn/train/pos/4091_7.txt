I saw this movie in the London movie in 1975 and I did not see it yet. I found it pleasing. I like it's originality. I have read a book called "The Black Hotel" and as a film fan, I always book as "photo" movie. Kinda "fit" them, do you know? But when I read it, I thought that it would make a great movie - but it must be "adaptive" - ​​where it has a little relationship with the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, why is that good? Sure, it can not be seen on TV on Sunday afternoon, but it was shown in Adults at Cinemas, it knew what it is, where is the forbidden? Damage, my civil liberties are being crushed here. A director will be able to adapt to the literal film of "The Black Hotel". But sadly, when I can get rid of such independence with independent adults, there will always be imagination that there will be lack of reasoning to differentiate between imagination and reality and those who do evil things. <br /> <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite the retirement, despite the theoretical theme of the film, the sensor has passed it, he was looking for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> But ... that day, there was an option. Yes. L. C. It was a local city council with a department, where there was the ability to pass a movie only for London, where it was thought that the viewers were more "less" than the residents in the stick <br /> <br /> was properly deposited and PASSED. However, it has been found that the "board" is just four people - three who voted, and a "chairman". And on that day one of the voters became ill. So the remaining two voters and the chairman are sitting to see "La Beti". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The lack of other imagination and simply break broken pieces. And the chairman did not understand it, so decided to make a mistake on Freedom. <br /> <br /> When the missing voters finally saw the film, they thought it was hateful, but it was much more! The film got its "x london" certificate and opened mixed response. Yes. L. C. Vandalized after the film censorship board! So "La Bettie" was opened only in London, which can be considered the best in the flu! But I was glad it was. It's awesome! If you do not see it, do so. This is a fun thing, and so, today's news is far less annoying than what you see ...
