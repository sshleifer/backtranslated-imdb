When Celesti died, the 4th Pokemon movie started crying to me. Pokemon sucks you do not say that dare! I do not like it when people say that ... I liked Pokeman for 5 or 6 years, so everyone, including this movie and other Pokemon films, would enjoy Pokemon. So, without more ado, please say that Pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by humans for all ages. Also, why Pok√©mon-Hotsars offer low rating for all or Pokemon films? I do not understand .... they should not do it .... There is no reason to vote for people to vote without excluding the fact that Pokamon should be voted: 1) Only for small children 2) Pokemon stupid And 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think people do not like pokemon.
