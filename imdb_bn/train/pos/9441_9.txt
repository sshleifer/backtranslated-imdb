The makers of these fine films have done a great job of engaging you in characters, because they are suffering from this terrible accident. The horrific scenes of this jungle were so nice that you forgot that these men were only actors and the parts were playing. To me, this image was not as immersed as I had it. Bert Reynolds and John Voight were not good on screen, as well as Ned Batty, Ronnie Cox, Bill McKinney's fine performances, and although he was present for a short time, James Dickie, based on the book of the book, was the author of the book who wrote the foundations of the film. It's a bit annoying, and of course, it should be protected from kids, but it's a great, dramatic movie.
