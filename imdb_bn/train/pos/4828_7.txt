Rupert Friend gives a performance similar to Prince Albert, who extracts from the unexpected level "The Young Victoria". She is fantastic. We know that Queen Victoria lost darkness, deep depression after Prince Albert's death and realized with the eyes of a silver friend. The film does not lead to our death, but an event that can spend its life very well. A work of love. I believe it, or I would say to him. I was convinced what she felt was real. Nothing about the flexibility and wisdom of the friend's characterization or anyone else. Emily Blunt is good but I did not believe Victoria was for a minute. No real knowledge of time It was not his fault but his crown prince deserve it.
