Now I really liked this movie, it is very interesting. Two Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are bright actors, I think after watching this movie they will have many other films together in the future. 3 <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < And I hope he has made a better comedy in the future, John Abraham played his best friend, he really played his role and he was so underrated that he had some outstanding work locked up He sya but he is really good actor. . I love John only, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this movie and it plays well. <br /> <br /> Music is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.
