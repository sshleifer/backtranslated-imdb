Peter Ustinov acted in a movie, who was coming out of prison when the film started. As soon as he gets out of the gate, he immediately started working on a project to make a bundle by stealing, although this time he has set his sights pretty high. This is actually one of the weak aspects of the film, because he clearly does not know anything about the computer (some came back in 1968), but overnight it was able to maintain the computer talent literally! Yes right However, he comes to a computer expert in disguise and get a job with a big American corporation so that he can finally embezzle a ton of cash. Considering its knowledge about computers is very basic, how it works out a great plan and it controls the penetration of the computer system and its protections. However, it is a movie after all, so I can suspend the suspicion. At the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) managed to escape with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They were all dummy companies). This means that he eventually bought this stock was worthless. What they seem to mean (and I can guess wrong here) is that before it became known, Ostinov and his new partners were quickly cached in stocks and the stocks would then become worthless. However, the film seems like posting a magician's last post, where no one gets hurt and everyone is happy - and it does not give too much knowledge. It was a shame, really, played and great as most of the writings. Karl Malden, Bob Neighart, Peter Ustinov, and MG Smith were just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I have to let me know if I talk about the last interpretation, because eventually the image seems very vague.
