Vincent Cassell acted in a part of Paul, who is a former ex-employee of an office where he met Karla, who is a lot deaf? Not while (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together they help each other develop like human beings. <br /> <br /> What was particularly attractive in this film is the complexity of characters ?? Do not fitting in obvious stereotypes. Paul appears uncomfortable in the office environment, is he just cut for work? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is a certain immortality which I refresh and I see how easy it is to act criminally, even if we think that it is frustrating or not <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, this is the full moment of a great movie? Karla is trying to comfort her baby when she is a baby and a scream. He continued to cuddle it ?? But his own comfort sounds for his own comfort.
