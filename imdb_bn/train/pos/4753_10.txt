Chock-full of a series brilliant episode, this stood as one of my very favorite ones. This is not the deepest episode, no great money or message. But it's a lot of fun, and there are some nice performances. <br /> <br /> But how it actually happened to me is for my knowledge, only * Twilight zone episode * double * snapar end. The zone is well-known for providing a big surprise at the end of a story. But this time, you get an amazing surprise, and that seems to be, but it turns out to be * another * surprise. I just like so much, perhaps it's one of my two favorite episodes (another deep, more messaging-based).
