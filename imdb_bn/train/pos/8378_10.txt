Is this a great film? The idea of ​​the nation to send people to war with each other with giant robots is firm. Finishing is not just a fit, it is more inspirational. <br /> <br /> But I'm confused by the letters. It's a sad incident that we did not see Achilles and Ethan's relationship improve for more than a few kisses and self-respect for Athens. Their romance is very enjoyable. <br /> <br />
