I'm a big fan of Stephen King's work, and this film has made me even a big fan of the King. About Pet Semitic Cord Family They just moved to a new home, and they feel happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind their home. Creed's new neighbor Jod (played by Fred Gwyne) explained the cemetery behind the pet cemetery. That cemetery is pure evil. Jude said that when Lewis Cride kills a man (or any kind of pet) in the graveyard, he will return to life again. The only problem is that when they come back, they are not the same person, they are evil. After explaining everything about Jute Cemetery, everything started to go to hell. I will not explain anymore because I do not want to give some part of the film. The pet commissar that was played was quite good, but the job needed a little work. One of the main parts of this movie was a story mainly because it was original and sticky. This movie has many make-up effects which make the film look even more awesome, and scary. One of the most basic reasons for this film sending me cold behind me was actually make-up effect. This film has a character that is really vague. That character is "Jelda." This particular character pops up in the film to be accurate about three times. Jelda Rachel Cride's sister who died many years ago, but Rachel still is afraid of her. Gilda is not shown in the film for the first time because she is not saying anything or something, but the second time to be the worst, and honest, the second time I'm afraid of ****. There is absolutely no mistake with this film, it is almost perfect. Pet Semitic distributed huge scares, played some pretty good, first-rate plots, and mesmerizing make-up. This is truly one of the most favorite horror films of all time. 10 out of 10
