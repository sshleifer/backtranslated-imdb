I always said that animated Batman movies were much better than live action movies. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the animated films, but outside of the bunch, it is the poorest, and it is rather frustrating <br /> <br /> "Fantasam mask" is the best, then "the best in the world", then "Sub Zero" ", Then" Joker's return ", and finally this space will end. In this newest animated film, Gotham has a mysterious new Battar and the purpose of discovering whether Batman is his friend or enemy in search of retaliation. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce was involved with three young women, he started their investigation and discovered the new batler. <br /> <br /> This movie tone is unusually light, because most movies are frustrating and silent, which is rather frustrating. Bruce plays oddly outside the character in most cases, villains are reused from the last film, and even if action scenes are exciting, they are not really new. It lacks the dramatic effects of other films, especially "sub-zero" which was heavy in the drama and character development. <br /> <br /> Everything in this photo is completely recycled and supportive characters are charming but <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Dr. Hopefully <br /> <br /> (** **** half of it)
