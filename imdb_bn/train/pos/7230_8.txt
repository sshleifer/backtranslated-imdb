"Invisible Mouse" is a delightful and different Tom and Jerry cartoon. It features normal cat / mouse traps and war characteristics, but at this point in a different way. Jerry apparently invisible ink falls into a bottle and he is very happy about this because he understands that he can prepare many "wonders" for Tom, fear him, torture him and confuse him. <br /> <br /> It's weird, it's great to see and fun, which we can not see: Jerry disappeared. Seeing who is doing it, it's fun to see the things taken in the air (who we are, right?) - It was like having their own life or even with ghosts. He is also equally amusing to see Jerry eating some candy and fruit while being invisible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jerry wrote "Miss me". When Jerry drinks chocolate milk, then he is happy to see his face. <br /> <br /> Overall, there are basic elements needed for this little classic cartoon: Humor, entertainment, fun and some very nice artwork.
