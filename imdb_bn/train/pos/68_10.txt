Why crappy overrated film series like a stupid, annoying, "Star Wars" gets all the hype, and really goes completely invisible to a really amazing film like this .. Outside me ... This movie will really open your eyes, dark, annoying, Sorry, and we live in a terrible world ... <br /> <br /> Like the annoying "elephant", this movie is not the "only ordinary day" that somebody will drag the trigger until this movie What will happen after the event <br /> <br /> he also takes it to heart very warm and talented Erika ... to be played by kriscenasena dyana a happy and healthy straight-A student and a great friend. Great life ... Until he was ... on the shooting day he was injured, shot in the head. She luckily did not die, but was seriously injured and had to stay in the hospital for a while, as a result of which she was a very polite and talented Basi played Philips, a nasty, cold heart, rebel, social- Social Goth girl who does not have any positive characteristics ... and she feels shocked when shooting .. Because it turns out, she was a friend with the shooter and she Anata was that he had done to it. ... which will bring him to the police station and some questions will be asked. If he knew that while referring to the shooting incident, he refused to tell the police, then he agreed to talk to her at home. Some ... and he is still not, so the school principal makes him serve the funeral of dead students, and after leaving it ... the main decision that enough is enough, and go to Diana in the hospital.

N ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Somebody visits her, but of course, Alicia is happy for something but happy. Debt is friendly to her Trying to welcome, but of course, Alisia has nothing to say except for harsh and harmful comments, and she is forced to do just how strong she has been, because there is no desire to befriend her. But sooner or later, the intention will change ... (And what I would say is :) It is actually one of the most moving movies, as well as one of the most dark and annoying. Indeed, I think. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It has very graphic views and pictures!
