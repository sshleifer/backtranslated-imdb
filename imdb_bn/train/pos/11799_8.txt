A good throw of a real event! Well, actually, I was not there, but I think it might be. I think the film has two common American standpoints: 'Communistophobia' and Adolf Hitler parallel. Most of these independent observers should be clear. However, Booth did a great performance, and so did other famous actors. Last twenty minutes of film helpless - and I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after them is unusual. (Why it's so terrible - it all happened, and probably looked just like it). But, really, did that last scene really happen in the air station?
