"Rich in Love" is a slice-of-life film that leads the viewer to the way of some playful Charleston, SC family. Very romantic, beautiful shots, good writing and acting, "RIL" washed on you like a summer wind because it breathes life in character due to its plotless anger, as at the end of the film you will feel like an old friend of the family. <Br /> <br /> "Mirror of Driving", a surprisingly produced character of "RIL", is a slightly obscure "sleeping" picture that will appeal to most adult audiences.
