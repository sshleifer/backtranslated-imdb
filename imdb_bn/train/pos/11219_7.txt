Before returning, before the creation of Evanjeel, Hydaki Ano had long been an idol and family name for Anime fans, and Ganbasetter was created before reaching the status of the Ganyax fantasy. At that time some of Gunn's hard work was followed by Gyanix's Win of Hanmise and famous Otakon shorts or courses. Space Opera has not been able to make it easier on itself by choosing a section that has been countless times before. Fortunately, Gaix decided to set up a six part OAV (Direct Video) series. It gives the opportunity to make a film in Syria, rather than a chance to make it bigger. It hinders the way it is very annoying and too long, as well as a dull battle and a lot of fill. In addition, they made some efforts to stay clear from the experimental space opera mechanics used in macros or hooligan and from many other popular places. <br /> <br /> For one, the programs started quite lightly, for Norcho's Okchawa High School Mechapiloting. Noriko is a respected ship commander who died in the war, he was still a small kid. This makes his life difficult at the academy, because some of his fellow classmates suspect that Niriko favor the professors. The first episode is the most comedy drama, which has a very tight focus on character and school settings. A quick change will occur when the threat of alien invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kamaumi (class best female class) will be selected for the help of the fleet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> focusing on both space, personal drama and action. A couple more characters are introduced, and Noriko's past parts are pulled again. Along with this, alimony threatens every minute more and Humanity's ultimate hope is presented by Gunbarta. Smart as the writer Okada, he spices for some time, includes the principle of dilation time. In short, slow pace for those who travel at the speed of time. This means that the Narrows can be part of the war, which can complete almost a century. Also, its dramatic aspect is strengthened further, when Noriko again looks back to his friends back base, who is much older than him. Science may not be perfect, but it has been presented in a very credible way, even with some short sessions in the SD Theater Theater, where Narrico, Kazumi and their instructors briefly explain the scientific principles used in Syria. <BR> <br /> Animation for the series created in the 80's is obvious. The design is of course retro 80s style, but it has the charm. Animation is quite good and the design of the character is beautiful, though clothing betrays <br /> <br /> After attracting some fans, gyneks will be fully utilized. Mechas very cool across the show, with Gunbuster Ultimate Mocking Machine, strong and vast. The last episode is completely black and white completed. Although it is generally believed (but not sure) that it was due to the budget, it holds completely different atmosphere for the series, which is perfectly suitable for the next part. <br /> <br /> Music is a very common place in Opera Fair. The place is very bombs, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. It fits the series for the most part, but it can be quite annoying at times. Tanaka is not really a famous musician and she is the only respected series directed at the Dragon half. If you think of the 80's ant music, you can know what you can expect. <br /> <br /> When the series is growing, the focus gradually varies from drama to space opera to epic warfare, but this can not be watched by the audience. The drama will be stepped down in step, and the battles will be in the front row. Both visions are completely left out though. With the last episode in sight, the Narroko and the crew are fighting for the greater existence of human nature, and with the last battle of philosophy, some questions have been presented to the audience, in terms of human relation in the galaxy and how far it can guarantee self protection. They are not answered later, they still present some interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic, a beautiful, but mostly at the conclusion of the finale, although all of the ends must certainly not have many miracles. Again, it fits in with the series. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> But it is working extremely well for a change. Instead of a composite mix of pre-elements, six episodes are long, a big scale anecdotal hero from our small scale drama presents a change. Along with the way we meet with several different interesting and well-fleshed characters, due to the occurrence of time differences, which change widely due to correlation. While the show is written very tightly, it tend to slip up in some points. Extremely dramatic events and very Chess Malla attacks can be easily avoided. Overall, Trip Gunbuster takes you on a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. It can not break the boundaries and limits of space opera style, but at least it will be slightly bent on them. Extremely enjoyable anime classic, but without errors. <br /> <br /> *** *****
