While making this film, Antonio actually showed some 'Kozone'. He has worked under the Most Profitable Studio (MGM) contract in America and he created the most formidable portrait of American society that he has ever seen. LA is seeing the first hand this crowd, the most accurate and most transparent city in the script. If only the Antonioni Bill had met the Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The next bury by the studio can understand after returning so much big investment and deficit. It is tragic that I can not see this movie anymore, I believe Antonio has been proved right. Here he predicted the end of the Hippi / Civil rights movement in American politics. Everyone is more interested in expanding their pockets and homeless (still beautiful) wilderness and beyond. How would I show interest in this movie again and be eager to see a glorious DVD release? <br /> <br /> I request people to see the Jabersky Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a truly unique movie to comment on a curved point in the history of the world's most powerful nation and we have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected gem.
