I really like what I really saw this cartoon so far. Of course, animation is not the best, but to be honest, I saw this cartoon style faster and cheaper faster and cheaper (which starts to happen more and more frequently). It looks only when it is only a style which is placed in a lot of time and effort). There is no mistake in angle line and little black-dot eyes - actually, I think it's really cute. In my childhood, I do not think that the design of the SUBUBO-DOO was particularly adorable, but I think I want to know it better. <br /> <br /> However, Shaggy has always been my favorite character and does not believe, but I She seems to have the most potential for some depths. Sure, the show is not centered around the original "mystery-solving" theme, but it was a tired old formula in any way. Do not make me wrong - I'm sure there are authors who will be able to bring a lot of interest in the mystery business (which are late) to mystery Inc, but this means that there is a fun deviation from the show standards at this point. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny, but no more comic relief. They are still nasty, but what seems to be finally (shock!) Have the opportunity to use intelligence. They seem to be older than ever-over-eating slackers, but now with the help of cateto Albert's succession with their lives. <br /> <br /> I found the most original skunk-dr-joke to be pure cheese and oddly ridiculous, but this show is actually a power practice for real humor. Also, I do not like KG Kashem as a chagie, so the new actor does not bother me like other people. (I still think Billy West was the best, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
