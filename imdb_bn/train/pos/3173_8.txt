It's a terrific thing to destroy a fantasy ... especially when you have talented actors. Writer / director Jones did not waste time sitting beside the audience with his hero. <br /> <br /> Anyone who shares an apartment with a slab will laugh and cry. When a meter maid has reached someone will place only a plain tile on your windshield. We all wanted to snatch a horrible toupee off a man's head. While viewing "Cross-Id", it's just the snippet of the store, it's an impressive film that Jones and the camera should have in both the front and back of the comedians.
