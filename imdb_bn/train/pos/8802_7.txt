This is a very interesting project which can be quite bright. 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame allotment for the collection of 11 specialized international directors and their preferred categories; Explore each short 9/11 worldwide reverberations. Without using any spoilers, I can say that Cain is a piece of rhythm in the crown, and based on a true story, Mirah Nair's short (segment "India"), is a complete feature film capable of making. One understands, is briefly seen, why is Alexandra Gonzalez Innerruta one of the world's best directors? He is only a medium teacher, who has deeply understood the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made as well. Yusuf Chahain, "Egypt" estimates the Arab attitudes of self-convicted joint crime in its segment, which was probably the most interesting piece. He sadly failed. Chahain's brief is poorly written and badly executed, at least enough to stand between one of the best chapters of the film. Despite the quality imbalance, I still will not let the 7/10 film give the idea of ​​judgment.
