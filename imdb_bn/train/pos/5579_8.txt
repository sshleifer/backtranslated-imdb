I never heard of this movie when I was browsing the IMDB accidentally. I saw how terrible it was, it's so hard to see how many colorful explorations are. Of course this meant I had to see it. Whipped actually as a good movie I was pleasantly surprised. I saw it with a group of friends and we laugh at than we had many recent highly acclaimed Hollywood fluff comedy. It is an independent movie and as illustrated by her popularity (sex and dating) without the popularity of Hollywood. I doubt that the opinions of the people of this film will depend on their life experience. If you have never made a date or fate, you will not get this movie because you will not show people like these characters. If you, comedic fashion will recognize many situations that illustrate here. The finishing was also good because it did not portray women as unreal, helpless, virgin romantic in contrast to Hollywood movies.
