But it's valuable for Boyer, Lor and Packsinos. Greene's entertainment, which was portrayed during the war, needs to be replaced on the coast of the United States, such as the role of this song for heaven or American actors where they were not suitable. Bacall fits that part here I waited for him and I brought him back to life. Voice is simply all wrong for a high-class English woman in her voice. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not talk like this without books, but Greene was sending a message that could wake up for the world's dangers. Another positive note: Green's character range is kept completely. When Mr Mukherjee was more like a Brahmin, at least his nationality was preserved, and his final conversation with the packsinos was infinite.
