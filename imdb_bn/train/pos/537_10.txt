The issue of life and death is only for me - only the best films have been made. <br /> <br /> It is classified from beginning to end. This is a reflection of the relationship between the world of war, passion and anxiety, post war. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply stunning and the unifying unit and the mechanics of the technicolor work continuously to pronounce the world. Character and plot development promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy near perfect and detailed attention. <br /> <br /> How many times I do not see the movie - and I saw it a lot - it does not fail to touch me. It laughs me, it makes me laugh, it reminds me, it lets me cry. It's fresh in today's 1946. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />
