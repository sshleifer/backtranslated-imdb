I gave this movie a high sign because it was really cute, it was really funny, it was always stupid. I went to see this movie while playing in the Fili area, and it was a night of great night with friends. The film is well-written and well-played, and although it is a film somewhat like a syntactic film, which is not far from the film. You just do not find less comedy like this, where you do not have to be shock to be funny. This image works with the help of a central couple on the basis of a Ukrainian domestic help. Although at first he helped, he soon added more craziness for their life then the petition for the couple. Get things out of control and get more ... ... you should see! Laughs laughing me even after leaving the theater This film just kept me in a good mood. I can not wait until it is released in DVD because I want to collect this collection in my collection.
