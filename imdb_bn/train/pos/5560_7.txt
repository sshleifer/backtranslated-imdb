Spinners <br /> <br /> One of my friends said that the next film was the best Chech and Chang Flick, and I went on the way to debt and Blue Brothers. There is no plot in the next movie, there is no panning, there is nothing that defines a movie ... but it's funny. And it's valuable, Cheech and Chong show some heart. Well, in this short paragraph I keep in plot, but in the movie that's four quarters, nothing will happen which will usually start a story. I'll just meet Chechen's cousin. <br /> <br /> Have fun once again when Chung Cheek twice had to drink onions? What about cock What was the first movie of Pe-Way Harmon? You will see yourself in the movie to enjoy it. I do not think the next movie has a strong force, it's great, but the film is heart and hey, my friend lends me so that it gets 7.
