The film starts with a bunch of kids in the reform school and focuses on a child named Gabe, who apparently worked hard to earn his parole. Gabe and her sister moved to a new neighborhood to move around in a new neighborhood, and soon Gabe met Dead and Kid. The children of this movie are small birds, but they are very less unconstitutional than previous movies and deeply down, they are well meaningful punks. However, there are some criminals in this area who are also subject to insurance fraud by arson and see Gabe as a convenient skaggat - finally, he wants to reform the school and nobody believes that he was innocent by being cruel. So, when Gabe is ready to send "Big House", to save her, to the rest of the gang and to reveal the real tricks. <br /> <br /> "Dead End Kids" Appears During the late 1930s, some of Warner Brother's films and movies were generally very good (especially Angels with darts fax). After the expiration of the boys' contract, they were very weak and formulated to hold nominated studios and movies - most of the huntz hall and Leo Georgie are mostly named in the show and the group is named "Bowery Boys". Because Andrew Wash did not look aloud for their great writing and production value and Hall and Gear Cameras, it's a beautiful movie - and earned about 7 scores (this is real closed). Actually, although it's not a great movie, it's so much fun to make sure, so I'll give it a 7! Definitely, it was absolutely right-especially at the end when the children took the laws in their own hands and ignored the Reagan Bill of Rights - but it was pretty funny. Dead and Kids are doing their best, and Ronald Reagan and Anne Sheridan gave excellent support. Of course, this part of the film was unreasonable and impossible, but anyway it was still funny and charming - so if you can suspend unbelief it works well.
