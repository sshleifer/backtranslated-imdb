These pictures outstanding and wonderful scores. Prince had deserved a lot of Oscar for music (many people did not know he won one). I think one of the best movies to watch as the late couple of late DVDs. A great surprise: Prince works a delicate job, and is quite good at conveying camera pain. Morris Day, Andy, and Lisa are good at their supporter's role. Very cool landmark film.
