The story of the liberation war was unveiled in the 1950s thriller 'Panic in the Riots'. A mysterious illegal immigrant body was found and until a further public scrutiny was taken from a public health inspector, someone claimed to have died that the body was carrying a strain of the Bubonic plug. Yet with the current play of today's world, this oddly helped to make this film appear credible for today's viewers. Cast and crew flawless. Paul W. Douglas is playing the role of Richard Wiedmark, who plays his first role with the success of 'Night and the City' and his young (but rather intelligent) Barbara Bell Jades. Fill out the remaining slots of the stranger, full of non-professional actors (usually the manager casan). Elia Kazan directs Joe McDonald's films (he'll be working with Richard Winkmark again in the 1953 higher 'South Street pickup') and this is a great score from Alfred Newman. Almost everyone involved here has done well, 'Panic in the Street' is a fully rewarded clock. Especially for film-noor enthusiasts.
