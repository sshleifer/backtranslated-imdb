All right, so I do not see a lot of horror films - and films like 'Dark Reains' are. I caught it on (a wonderful feature-filled) DVD and it's stupid to fear me. Actually the DVD was missing, there was only a pair of additional extra pants. However, the next day I was telling someone about it when I realized that it was about 10%. The rest of the time I was watching the pizza in my coffee table - if I really covered my eyes my girlfriend would catch me. Several times I was brave at the screen, I became so stubborn that I did not see again. <br /> <br /> The film was difficult to make and the situation of the characters was really compulsory. The simplicity of the film has captured my jump-button - it's just a woodland, a cabin and an unused prison - and a lot of darkness. The most surprising to me was that it was not clearly a million dollar production, but the make-up effect was really like this! Also, this is a film that is obviously a great love for filmmaking. Sound design and music have never really used many of my surrounding systems, such as many Hollywood movies. I saw the line that this movie won El Sreekfest - it's a really great achievement, and I think this festival has seen the genius of filmmakers - and perhaps I managed more than this movie. Turn on the word <br /> <br />, turn off the light, and, if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza.
