All right, like many other types of movies, arising from SNL Skit. But Tim Midas does a fairly fantastic job to create a 3-minute one-dimensional character within a moderately effective comedy character. He drops consistently flowing one-fishing drops with fair frequency, Billy de Williams has gone long for his land, although the whole thing is shot quite well. True, this is not a great art, but you go to Wain World and search for wind, you have done something wrong. What is enjoyable for it .......
