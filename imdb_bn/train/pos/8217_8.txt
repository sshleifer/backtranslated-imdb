Clint Eastwood is not only the star, but it is also the only Wanted Harry movie to produce and manage it, you know it might be good. Although many say that Enforcer is the best of the series, I do not quite agree. In my opinion, in addition to the original Danny Harry, suddenly there are two competencies among the Impact and Magnum Force series. Although The Enforcer is a good movie with a few of the best action sequences, it is not the other three films that will get the effect of messy and irony. This image captures all the tensions that make Clint Eastwood's film well, and it has received a quote that makes a Dirty Harry film good. Dirty Harry. "It's what to do, Punk?"; Magnum Forces "A man has learned his limitations"; And in this "go ahead. Make my day." The film also looks beautiful in visible changes, because you are tired of seeing the same old San Francisco street in other series of the series. With the great acting of Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Lock, with good direction and Clint's good direction, I think it's the best Harry Siegel.
