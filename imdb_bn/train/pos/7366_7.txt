This is a movie that the mainstream market probably will not be able to access because it simply does not pay attention to the viewer. The story of the annoying Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a Friday night movie but it has its own unique edge and I saw it was entertaining. The film was shot in such a low budget, as if Spike Arsenal was inserted inside, but there was some brightness. But I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heyton, and if it could be honest it cost me most of the movie trying to work. And I do not like the fact that most movies talk to two friends and are not really "actions." This is a small film that is complicated to see and this makes it interesting.
