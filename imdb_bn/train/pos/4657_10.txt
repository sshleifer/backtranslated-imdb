Hot Millionaires is a great movie in all the ways. A fun, off-beat story with four outstanding professional performances in business. Peter Ustinov, as usual, and Maggie Smith --- definitely one of the greatest actress of all time - is bright --- total joy. Carl Malden and Bob Neighat cast out and also perfect. If you want a movie to have the perfect casting, it is. How so fascinating these people work with each other in a simple and easy way, making lots of smiles and fun moments. Peter Ustinov had a talent with a wonderful wonderful knowledge and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography, and editing at first rate, and this is a great time capsule in London in the 60's. This is a list of my all-time favorites in Japan.
