Hickory Decree Dock was a good Poirot mystery. I admit, I could not read the book, despite being a strange Agatha Christian fan. The adaptation was humorous, not with its problems, and it was time for brave attempt to correct it, was slightly higher, and leading events spread to the final solution. I felt some slow moments so padded some of the mysteries. However, I liked how I painted Hickory Decree Dock, it was a visual style similar to the bright ABC Murders and it really set the atmosphere, which provided dark camera work and dark lighting. Dark moments were a bit unclear, it helped in one of the most horrible music scores in the adaptation of Piero, perhaps one to two buckles is not as boring as a shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complicated, with all the necessary ingredients, though it is not as narrow as my shoe packing, and in any way it is a good thing. Acting was very good, David Suepat was guilty (I know I can not use this word forever, but I can not remember a good word to describe his performance in Syria), and Philip Jackson and Pauline die do justice to their brightest incomparable character . And the specially developed and specially developed students were specially like Damien Luis Leonard. All in all, the difficult mystery is not stepping along but good. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
