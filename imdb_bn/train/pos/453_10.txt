I always tell people that "Enchantment April" is an adult film that is no comedy, no gender and no violence. Someone might think of it as "the ultimate chick flick", but I have one or two illuminated men out there who loves it out. Do not invite kids, though. This movie is very low-key. <br /> <br /> A very cure experience to see "Enchantment April". Soundtracks and fantastic scenes, with gentle behavior of women, Pre-Raphael thinks of the peace and beauty of the painting. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks that you are watching a movie, I am I will illustrate a line I heard at "Saturday Night Live" and say that my two favorite films "Dir Hunter" and "Enchantment April".
