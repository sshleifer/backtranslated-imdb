It is actually a small little flick that is not made in a smart budget with video crew shots. It takes a little time to heat. The performance is so bad that it soon gets a gene-like charm. After a few scenes, you hear the words of annoying lines or some distribution. All of the characters develop a quirky charm, especially "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, Meden is someone who wants to hire a racing psychotherap. He just seems to enjoy so much! Some apparently effective shots of the title character mixed with Mad-Slashar's Gore and Jimmy Investigation scene, "The Midnight Skater" zoomed through a black hoodie campus, looking around the world in the cross between the Grim Ripper and, say, Silver Surfer. These shots sometimes seem weird that the characters about Scatter are sometimes ridiculous. Soundtrack has some fun Garage-Punk tunes and its masked, flexible motions match the mood of the movie. Warm, I'm saying.
