More TV movies should be like this one. When I first saw on TV it's way back in '93. Both Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were terrific, giving very lively and realistic performance. Weber was particularly good, turning an exceptional weird and understated performance as a child molster / killer. This film has increased my respect as a Hunt actress. The director also has "Hoosiers," anyway both formulas and breathtaking instructions. But the direction of these two works is the same common, simple realism which is very interesting. If you do not like TV movies and are not expected then you can see it. Apart from hunt and faye matter, apart from not removing the story from the original story, it is objectionable.
