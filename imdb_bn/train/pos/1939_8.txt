I do not know why I chose to watch this movie, it seems a bit different from a strange title and description. Each time one tries a movie that is slightly different from mainstream Hollywood hero / thriller Flick and it was certainly different. This film made me curious from the beginning, but I did not understand why when I realized that the film was great, the characters were ultimately realistic. I was fantastic acting and the development of character really makes you care for them and hopefully hopefully things out for them are good. I think everyone who sees this movie can be related to characters and it can look good in the audience's neutral chapters and laugh at something good. <br /> <br /> The result of the film is that you will get a sense of well-being and the 'things that are right' will be fine. I'm sure this is a comprehensive application and should be given a chance.
