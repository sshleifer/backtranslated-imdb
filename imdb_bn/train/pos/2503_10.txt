I am very much interested in the pictures I see. I've heard it completely by accident about moon children. I have been a fan of Laurak N. Seal for some time and recently a fan of Gacte and Maier. <br /> <br /> I finally saw that the film was being republished and it was lifted without it. Second thought. <br /> <br /> I'm critical of movies, I admit that action scenes may be a little bit ... but they can also mean that other users have been advised, it is interesting to say before the storm, quietly quoting Gary Oldman from Leone. ... The film makes me very hard not to be rude, because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are endless and they Ayai say is true marriage, friendship, loyalty and love until death, until you took part. <br /> <br /> Haid and Gact show them why they are able to give depth to their song, their passion for the song is on the big screen and in the process. It creates an example film that will reach its soul and stimulate emotional reactions. <br /> <br /> For the first time to see the picture, I realized that my collection would be as heavy as possible. I want to encourage you to read this post, if you want to move away from the current Hollywood trend in the film then choose the film ... it takes completely new aspects using the classic Yakuza movie elements and how you can make a mistake with a camera, Tacismi Mike's " Audition "and" Suicide Club "fame Rei Ishibashi <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about this picture, I cease minimal. <br /> <br /> 10/10
