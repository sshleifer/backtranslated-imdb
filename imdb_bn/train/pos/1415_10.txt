I saw the German version of the German television movie and I was really surprised. I usually want to see the documentary, but I can not think I have seen that one better than 'earth'. I knew something from the YouTube video that was found by Random Browsing. I remember that the part of the film has been seen in multimedia stores, running on high-definition TVs displayed. After watching the film it is clear to me why footage is so popular among YouTube users and multimedia retail managers: It is so amazing and spectacular that you can not help but keep an eye on the screen, whether you are naturally interested in documentary or not. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 without hesitation. Surely, there are more exciting movies, but in the case of documentaries, 'Earth' is definitely one of the best novels.
