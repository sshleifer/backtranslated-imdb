Many of the great voices, courage and clever dialogue make it a very good movie. Adding the "character" of three lead creatures gives the story more depth and meaning, especially older colleagues, shadows, and young hellfire, chances. Previous versions of this movie were unable to give animals a real personality or purpose, which is fully completed here. Sally Field is somewhat loving, but really proud of this movie as Girls, Sassie. The great contrasts between cat and dog perspective, and the right amount of the only spirit and warm fuzzies to make plot and resolution excellent. There is even a lift score and beautiful mountain scenery. Perfect one evening alone or perfect with kids. Disney Closed Hats.
