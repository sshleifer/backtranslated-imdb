I have seen Fido in some movie channels and I have to say that I have become an instant fan. The film feels like a comic book that takes the look and feel of the superiority of the decade of the 1950s, you know exactly the decade when it danced on the Levis, while the desert nuclear bombs left only for its bones. The man was so naive that it was scary and thought that this clean-cut people would actually think that the dog actually works here to be normal. <br /> <br /> This Canadian production, colorful skin painter and carrier Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Caesar and excellent cast with baby. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that this movie was not a big hit. It deserves more recognition. This is much better than Team Burton or Dead Team Shawon. Well good It's still an instant classic.
