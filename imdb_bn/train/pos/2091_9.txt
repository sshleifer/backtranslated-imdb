Irving Thalberg will never try to make this picture today. Even if they were one of Paul Munie, Lewis Renaire, Charlie Graevin and Walter Conley, they made Chinese stories with amazing players. Perhaps it's a western story, in 1932, Pearl Buck received the Pulitzer Prize for her novel. The Chinese missionary girl Miss Book probably brought the Chinese closer to American spirit than any other person. Not the political struggle of China, but the daily life and hard work we get in the good world. Unfortunately, later, Pearl Buck became the apology for all the qualities and extra features of Chuang Ka-Shake's Kuomintang China. His remaining literary output never matched the good world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Asking the difference, Ustinov said that China was very big and very full And Australia was very big and very empty. This world is very good and full of people, much more than meeting many people in the world. <br /> <br /> Good world tells the story of Wang Fung (Paul Muni). A young man who bought a wife from a big house where he was a slave. Lady O-Lan (Luis Rena) gives birth to two sons and sees him through good times and bad, dry, famine, revolution and climate lame plague. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> O-Lan filmed two Oscars for the second. With the dialogue at least, he has set a record for his leading player Oscar's performance. She is actually done with facial expressions in everything, its performance can be a silent film with very short subtitles. I think Ryan's daughter just had less sound than John Mills and she was playing a mentally impaired man. <br /> <br /> Munshi is not always grateful about how men are dominated cultures. Rainer helps, raises bearings and kids, works housework. When Muni got the property, he took the wife of the second trophy of China, which made her sad. Still Rainer carries all stoically. Muni is not a bad person yet and it is respecting the film and its acting and the writings of Baka that you do not hate him and surround the cultural gap. <br /> <br /> We now have a group of oriental players who do more than the Kung Fu movies. I am surprised that the good world of all the movies was not rebuilt at this time. I will allow the Chinese government to put some American companies in the real position. <br /> <br /> We still got to praise and enjoy this great classic.
