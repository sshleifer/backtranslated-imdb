Stargate SG-1 printout of the 1994 movie "Start" I am very glad that they decided to expand the subject. Rolling out the first phase of the program, a retired his old partner Jack O'Neal said. To meet Daniel Jackson, you have to go through the gate once. Through the first two episodes, we meet the same Carter, who is a very intelligent person who does not let anyone walk on him, and tilak, calm, sympathetic warrior who denies his false god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> প্রধান খারাপ ছেলেরা গাউল্ড নামে পরিচিত, তারা পরজীবী যারা নিজের মস্তিষ্কের মধ্যে প্রবেশ করতে পারে এবং এভাবে তাদের নিয়ন্ত্রণ ও মন্দ কাজ করতে পারে। There was a huge amount of power of any gauldera often "System Lord" was regarded as. Back gauldera Jaffa warriors are called, can not enter inside the brain of a person who gauldake until his body surrounded gauldake parasites. /> <br /> In this episode, we mostly esaji <br -1 see, Jack / Daniel / tilaka / and Sam in the eksaporitiri team goes through insects, which are immediately transferred to other planets (called startageta the device), and a new culture Or are facing bad guys. Some episodes are globally, which means they do not go through the stage stargate once, and instead impose problems in the world. <br /> <br /> For a few years, you started seeing fall in the form. 1 group knit off, and more character-building story lines. This, it means more epochs around the world, which is perfectly understandable. <br /> <br /> আমার রেটিং: 8.75 / 10 ---- এই অনুষ্ঠানের বেশিরভাগই ভাল হলেও গল্পের কয়েকটি উদাহরণ রয়েছে সবসময় এই শেষ কয়েক বছর গেট ভ্রমণ উপর জোর দেওয়া এবং কম জড়ানো হচ্ছে না। But science science fiction is still top science!
