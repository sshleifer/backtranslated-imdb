Does the 60-second film really represent (who among us travel around America's stomach) decades of ambiguity and diversity? In spite of exaggerated, stereotyped characters, the facts remain clear. <br /> <br /> There were no historical times for changes, but very confusing times. Then the two fundamental matters changed our world: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the dominant influence of the media. Those two new independence started social change, which soon became institutionalized. <br /> <br /> There is sensitivity due to chaos, price has come from the disorder. But keep in mind that most Americans were not involved in ... they worked, they played, they saw the news ... and gradually they were influenced by the efforts and struggles of minorities ... civil rights workers, political workers, anti-war effort War of poverty .... <br /> <br /> The power of presentation of power in newspapers and TVs was particularly well-reflected, though The people's views and those who want to change things are best ignored ... and the worst, wrong presented. The middle-class Americans did not stand around in a barbaric bat or denying their mobile girls. They were very confused. Let us not forget that how the singer suddenly became the protesting singer and how the Beatles make people's protest movement deadline. There are no Bittel songs in the movie, and they do not have any mention. <br /> <br /> I think if you do not live for decades, you have no idea what the idea is about this film, overall the picture is a bit slow. At one point, I took a steady job, when my sister Hog Ferm lived in Commune and went to Woodstock. At other times, I was in the hit Asbury and Detroit riots when he acted as a housewife in Maine and Connecticut. The role was continuously variable. <br /> <br /> This picture depicts a middle class family's three siblings. They represent Hippie children, political activists, and active military personnel. Parents usually represent the viewpoint, and represent reasons for the peace of mother, tolerance, and sometimes the vowel of compromise. <br /> <br /> A minister in the black family and his son ... Incomplete, I think. I guess the producers knew all the variables and had to sit in constraints, or the film would be a long, annoying, documentary. The father's message was that angry bothersome production, and bitterness caused chaos. This is clearly a message directed to today's youth. <br /> <br /> We are looking at a unique solution to social problems, and how we break our problems ... it was unusual as the 60s, and only tears are comparable to 20s. In other words, this movie is a moral after all. Finally, it is our collective personality that lives. Put on your Oximoron list. <br /> <br /> At 60, everyone was a god, guru, or free spirit. It was a time of magic and crazy. Someone will not fall right below 60 seconds ... it was very diverse (this movie is closed). At least we can say that we are not ashamed of it, we have learned and grew from it, and it has changed for a time, a generation and America ... good.
