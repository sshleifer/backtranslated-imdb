This picture is nicely written, you do not have to wait for more than one minute for a stomach laugh and more is being done than the film's early beginnings. These parodies are the wonderful local-boys-well-well-aggression-adverse drug narcotics across the paradigms that these parodies have. No one will tell you that they are just trying to get cheaper laughs using indecency; - Sure, there are lots of them, but it's not all relevant, disadvantageous. I like this picture and it only cost me Â£ 2.99 on DVD, so in terms of entertainment pricing for money, I saw this year's best movie.
