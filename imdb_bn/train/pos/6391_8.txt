Catch this picture at the Arizona International Film Festival. I was not expecting much (though the festival director told me it was one of the best films). I sold in five minutes. Shoots B and W in a shoe budget, this picture is lovely. Acting is tough, the writing is tough and the look of the film is strong. Acting is perhaps the biggest revelation, because most of the films shot in low budget are playing amateur or staging.

If you get the chance, watch this movie. Filmmakers like Mezkowski (hopefully I have got this right) deserve the opportunity to interrupt their audience with the wider audience.
