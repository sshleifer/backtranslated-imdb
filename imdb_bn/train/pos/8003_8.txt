This movie is a great way to watch a wife or a girlfriend. Here is the sunny and some very interesting little nude stories going on here. Actresses are very nice and definitely worth watching their natural beauty. Maslin beach life is full of different nudists and personality types. See the Australian coast scenery, simply, fantastic. What is the place to watch, at least say, and one day it might be my secret. I really enjoy this movie and when I see it I enjoy more. I would like to see more of these characters and I always wonder what became of them. Although the plot is somewhat soft, the film is definitely a great excuse to sit on the sofa and enjoy wonderful and famous Maslina beaches with these wonderful cashiers and their own personal stories.
