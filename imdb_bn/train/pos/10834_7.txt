I do not communicate with "real still crazy" with any real prospect. Just one more Rock'All picture, I understand ... good nostalgia for baby boomers This picture is partially but much more. Director Brian Gibson previously conducted the biography of Tina Turner and was quite successful in his style. I think it's right that this is his last film. <br /> <br /> Cast is well-selected. Bill Nike is the band's perfect role as frontman of the band. Actor-director-director Bruce Robinson appears as the band's washed up guitarist. She did a fantastic job, though she did not appear in the film since the late 70's. If you are looking for a touch and funny movie (with some great lyrics), you've got to find it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
