Although there is no melodrama in the center of this center, in the lower part of this movie, the story is nicely and carefully told and the acting is supernatural. <br /> <br /> <br /> Yara came back to her own Israeli studying in Princeton. His old and beloved friend Talia. Because after the death of his mother, Yara actually lived with his friend's parents, he lost his guilty sister. And because of the birth, the blind, managed and protected by Talia, its friend is unable to commit suicide as it is unbearable. <br /> <br /> The uncertainly, blind girl is the one who decides to solve the mystery that this death. Without sight, there is his insight. Although he can not see, it is found in the eyes of the "natural" people around him. In this way, the film becomes the mystery of the exploiters, such as the memories of her relationship with Daya, her couple's family home, tapes, diaries, and Talia in the memory of her relationship with past and present people. From the perspective of the scene, the film is also seen from its perspective, because it looks at what he hears, believes and imagines, and thinks of it. The solution to the mystery is rather prevalent, but the search is managed with this fine care and it is so beautiful and destructive that the Pat moment is easily forgiven. Verily, it appears to be slowly shamelessly, not only in the life of Talia but also making her relationship with Yarar clear. Yara uses her mobile face and voice effectively as her Sharon, and is fully trustworthy as both the adult and the teen girls. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Interesting decision to represent minor characters, and to represent Talia as a teenager. With the last announcement of Talia's last boyfriend, Gadi, I want to feed her with the final announcement, but the journey that was so impressive on the steep edge that her picture will be remembered and her words will not be remembered.
