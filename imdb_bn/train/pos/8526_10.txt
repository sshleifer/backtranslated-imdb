I like this movie! Chris Schwarman has done a great job! She is not only an incredible actor, but she is superb with a terrific physical! He did a great job on delivery of his line, plus transformed George better than Fraser. A great performance for its first major roll! This movie will be full of lovely scenes that every child will love. My kids have seen this movie many times since the day we bought the DVD. In addition to the film, additional DVDs are very fun. Two thumbs up on this one! I highly recommend it to everyone!
