A farm in Avonilia, Prince Edward Island, middle aged brothers living together at Green Gables "Ainie Green Gables" (1934), Marya Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (O.G.H.G.), assisted their farm from remote orphans. But 14-year-old Ana girl (14 years old), An orphan, who was sent to them, is a 14-year-old girl named Ann Evelyn (a senior of a series of "Alice" short films from Paris-Donis, who will later take her character's name). <br /> <br /> Anthony Lucy Moond was Montgomeri's source novel at 11, but the same actress could not believe the story of the 11-year college at the time of the credibility. The film suffers from some of this discount, as many people respond to it and most of what they say comes from the teenager-teenager. Like the book, Annie is brilliant and happy to be happy, but her name, her creation, her freckles, and her long red hair are unhappy. Despite being the son of Kalpana, Anne takes great pleasure in life and quickly accepts her new family and Prince Edward Island environment. <br /> <br /> In fact Ani was selected to focus on this aspect of her character, "Teenage Drama Queen" and the screenwriter of the film. Which comic-funny family drama transforms into a basic series of comedy. The audience is happy that a change and that the purists of the reader continued to despair. <br /> <br /> Since the comedy of Montgom's story is a lot more comedy, I can not see any reason about the changes, but it works as a precursor to hopefully be fully trusted adaptation. The comedy element is the power of film as it is one of the oldest self-referencing parodies of Hollywood conventions. Actress Ann Sherly is the most beautiful woman in Hollywood and the film is black and white. It is very happy to see the continuous lanterns of the title character in contrast with what is displayed on the hair and color of its appearance. Anne regales her no mean villager with regular melodramatic lines: "If you deny it will be a long life sorrow for me". Perhaps the most fun moment when he corrects his name on the classroom blackboard. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown has a wonderful job, Gilbert Blythe and Sarah Hadane steal all the scenes visible as a decent neighbor of conversation with an interest in Anne. <br /> <br /> Do you know again? I'm just a child.
