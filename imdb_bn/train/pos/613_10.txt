Please, learn from this movie, future writers, producers, directors! <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a brave and original story for the movie screen. Courageous, because the script has continually created a step so that many fantasy films can be safely avoided - something new, creative and brave. Just when you think, 'Oh, I've seen it before' or 'I'm sure this will happen now' - Stardust will create an unexpected twist and will add more and more to you in the story. <br /> <br /> The actor is superb - even this smallest part is played with this genius, it fills me with fear for the makers of this film. Robert De Niro runs superbly and with the power that he steals only every scene of his show. Michelle Pfeiffer is a wonderful choice for Yvaine, the perfect witch, and Clayer Dains innocent and loving 'star'. Other big names play an outstanding role. I was admitted to trying to give everyone its best for this movie. But again, the story of Neil Gaiman, the small inventions he had made for the universe - was simply extraordinary. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in pre-screening today, a day before the official release, and hopefully it will be a huge success. So much humor, but the tense moment along with the lovely tender scene. Yevgen's view, Captain Shakespeare's 'gentleman', Lamia's Emotion-fascinating, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me, this is the number one entertainment film of 2007, seeing it and enjoying it <br /> 11 / 10 - Excellent <br /> <br /> Peace and love
