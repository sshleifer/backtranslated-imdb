This is a wonderful Sammo Hung movie. Actually, it's a great part of the Hong Kong action movie. The story was found in Macau for the podcast driver's story of love and found a harmful pump. Performance is excellent and the characters are all desired and well-defined. There is enough romance, drama, comedy, and mystery to involve the story and keep watching in the scene of the fight. Sammo Hung Here he is proven probably proved the best combat corregarity of the business. The action is simply amazing, esp. War w / leo car leung and finish. Billy Chaou and Samo Hong are amazing.
