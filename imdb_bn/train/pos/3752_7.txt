This image is unusual and bizarre, and it's a very good way around unusual and odd. I can give this short 7 because it's very unique and off-the-wall, but most of the time seems to be strange because it's weird. If the image was directed to integrate more bizarre moments like a plot, it was really amazing. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that the manufacturers seem to combine together a bunch of shit about Sputulus, then the more holes in a whole bunch that will sound as it sounds like a spatula face from the mouth. "<br /> <br /> It is certainly worth checking out, but it is not top rate by manufacturers to stretch any of the wild imagination.
