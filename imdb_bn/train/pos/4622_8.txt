At the age of 14, I came to heaven in the seventh minute of Linda Fiefman and worked on the video store and I like it. I recently saw the movie again and realized that this is a lost treasure. About 20 years ago, she will win an Oscar like Natalie Baker for Sunder Mind, this film is Jennifer Connelly Star. Byron Thomps starred Jeff Maran, the world's best friend. The picture must be in the Pretty in Print 1980's Pretty Off Country and soft version and it's a little bit better. It's not good, it's not mandatory, these movies are not compulsory and parents will enjoy watching this movie with the kids there. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's father leaves home on a business trip, Jeff believes that his home life sucks. Natalie's friend, with poly support, performed beautifully with Maddy Karamen, she gave him. But they do not see the film drop into the kids' condition and what they can carry. Three Lead is so much natural and scripts, surprisingly so hearty, what is the heart breaks comes through the best in their performance. These characters do not really care about each other. This is a great movie to show children who have reached pre-adolescence. <br /> <br />
