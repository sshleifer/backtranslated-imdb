Like "On Town", the sailor's instrument on the coast ceiling is less than the next classic in pacing and song quality, but has its own character. Kelly has three fantastic dance routines: a "Tom and Jerry" fame cartoon mouse with Jerryie, one with a little girl and a fantasy sequence where she is determined to reach her lady in a high school in the Spanish lover. Cynatra, Kelly's shy, inexperienced friend, and Graceon, most women who work for love for both men, are mostly sung. Itubi provides some fine piano playing. Approximately one and a half hours, it can not drag even a little more for a light musical instrument.
