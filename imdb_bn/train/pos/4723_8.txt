Really enjoyed this small movie. It is about running films about struggle, sacrifice, and especially friendship between different people (child actors who played Mickey, especially good). There is a large scale neutral film set around WW2, it has been firmly told that the short story is a real break from the ideals and a real form of it. I am very boring to this picture, I will add from far away !! Of course the horse is wonderful and the scenery is breathtaking. Anyone who actually treats their animals as part of the family (I), you will find this film especially fruitful. Those who are proposed for film fans look for something a little different.
