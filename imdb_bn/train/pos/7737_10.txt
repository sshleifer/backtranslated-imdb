If I grow up like a fan of Jim Thompson, then it can be very nice if their work is turned into a movie. This presentation did not happen after graduation with Scott Foly. A suspicious, sexual charge is noir classic that follows closely and does not have great justice in the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward probably give their career best performance. And always the phenomenal Bruce Darn could even top him with this one. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and spiritual world where the emotions are justified and the double cross is never far away. Must be seen for all fans of a great silent film. **** !!!
