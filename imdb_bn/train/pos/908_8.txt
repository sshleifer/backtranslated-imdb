I do not believe this image is rated 6.9. However, this movie is probably one of the most sensitive real Indian movies I have ever seen. It was really fresh to see a movie shown on the traditional family cinema. For the story, I thought it was great that Shahid Kapoor's marriage with Amirata Roy was established on the marriage. She is like a happy lucky guy, when Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle, but the only problem is that her cousin is not as much attention given to her cousin Amrita with a passion that she likes in her aunt. It displeases Amrit because he wants his aunt to love him. It was very sensitive to see that although the family of Amrita's family was not rich but less than the middle class, the Shahid family was very big, yet they still respected their family and even got them to come down with a nervous injury. Because I have really seen people who are not good enough to think them below their standards, which I think is too shallow. This film shows that Shahid's family wanted to raise Amrita and she turned blind eyes because she was not the daughter of a rich businessman or anything else. All of these movies deserve 8/10. I like more than making such films.
