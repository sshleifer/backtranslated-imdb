As Christmas is celebrated in the years of celebration, religious or secular tradition focuses on, a time when people ask each other a little better behavior. In the 19th century London, an Ebenezer screw, businessman and money lender broke out in any way. <br /> <br /> His nephew indicates his uncle, he does not keep Christmas in any way because the screws feel the whole thing, humanity has long been driven into threats, he is a solid case, complete as his 20th century opponent, Bedford of New York Fruit New York Potter. <br /> <br /> But Charles Dickens said this story, the freedom fighter is not too late for any of us and go to a single ghost and three cheerful scrooge and show him how. <br /> <br /> A Christmas carol is a free holiday classic, which we sometimes forget that it is as great as the Oliver Twist as the 19th Century social commentary. The characters of this photo are middle and lower class. Cratelets have some rung on the streets of the Oliver Twist Street, but they are struggling to stay there. Still radiating their home to love and happiness, the guy Bob Cratchit works for any thanks. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who did a great job in his life and had to remind only that Ebenezer Schuig needed a more urgent call than the emergency situation to do something good in his world. The old world <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But George C Scott well kept old misfortunes in this movie. Its gravity, but a trail of sadness that makes it the route to change us. Scott has joined a fine tradition of humans like Reginald and Wayne and Alastar Seyam, who made great explanations of both scrooge. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting roles, I particularly enjoyed Bob Crichit and Edward Woodward as a heartwarming David Warner, and Christmas is the current Strain Spirit. According to IMDB, it is one of the 32 versions of a Christmas carroll they archive and it is the best one.
