I think that most people who have posted comments on this movie can not understand how the film will look and / or have little idea of ​​elegance. Firstly, to evaluate the film, you must understand how everything in the film works together. Modern sensitivity claims great drama. No, I do not have great settings for letters and plots, but they claim psychological trajectories which are extremely tragic or ridiculous. This is a fine movie. His beauty lies in his subtlety (will not be confused with simplicity). The story is not easy in this movie. This is a beautifully illustrated film that integrates sensitivity, politics, human weakness, discrimination ... you name it. The set that the world has been set will be Gentle and it is not understood today ... a world where you have it, you have to rush now, even if you think it's yours. <br /> <br /> Many people today do not realize that Victorian society was not really Victorian because people have understood that term today. <br /> <br /> This movie helps to set a record straight.
