This timeless proverb reverberates this movie and my heart. I have been waiting to see this infinite story for so many years! I was not ready, perhaps. It is possible that my sensitivity will not appreciate its strength. So I now welcome it in my soul with gratitude. <br /> <br /> My praiseworthy respect and respect for Paul Munir has been prolonged. Her now is a legendary luminescence. But now I finally discovered the invaluable gift of Laurie Rennar's fantastic competition. Oh, how many faces can face him? Some have said that it was made since its silent years, and this statement may have been his speech, but it is enough to pronounce enough when it is given a chance. He earned his Oscar qualification. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the epic of the most classical ratio. All parts are equal, required and perfect. If Nasayi goes away, he will go on in the story of a story that is in full swing. <br /> <br /> The good world will enrich a rich man who does not expect. But everyone did not come from the joy I gave. But I can hope that this movie will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not inspire me to technically compete with the main players' competition. These modern times are expected when we are obsessed with complete perfection. But to show the story of Paral Baq with boldness, strength, firmness and grace, I have shown the courage of a new movie of one crore rupees. <br /> <br /> If a modern artist shows the courage to re-film this best, I have warned them that they will never come near the fragrance aroma that still originate from the origin of this story. During this time the effort will not be reduced and improving its glory will improve.
