Sunday 16th July, 8:00 pm Castro, San Francisco <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " br /> <br /> Years later, Marion Davis is more than a little mud. He was extending his fame and was incapable, often estimated. Considering the makkish plays, he has been pushed to the point of view, this criticism seems to be some validity. Although comedy, his star shone too brilliantly. He could compete with Mabel Normand to move towards the light comedy and slopstick career. His better performance was the King Waters Show Show People (1928), which survived and it was quite familiar because the MGM star fills it with Camio. This happy restraint has inevitably saved her two stars, Davies and among the best of the notorious Joe College-cracker William Henes. The rumors have spread that there were few people based on the life of Gloria Swansea, who started Senate Comedies, and Von Straheim did not remind the Grand Drama (and the rest of his life with Walsh!) And, incidentally, the comedy studios used in this film. Keystone was abandoned years ago (think who worked there!) <br /> <br /> Colonel Marmadoque Oldfish Paper (Dale Henderson) is her daughter, Peggy (Davis), from Hollywood to Hollywood movie star. These two countries are Hicks Disabled Billy Boone (Hines), "? A custard pie artist?" Is unsuspecting sheets for ?? Those who are horrifying to the cafeteria table on the table are terrified (keep an eye on the bud with the noodle), and then help in a later part of the Peggy Land in their next film. He thinks that the high drama gets to be screwbull, but a job is to deliver a job and believe in him. "All stars take it at the chin." Preview, Billy and Peggy blasts? Charlie Chaplin, who requested for his autograph! He pushed a little fellow aside and grabs a terrific delivery book and makes his sign. Chaplin got up in his car and told Billy Peggy that he only snubs, so naturally he is mad. The character of Davis does not recognize this person, it seems very interesting! Peggy soon went to work on the high-end art studio, changed her name to Patricia Peppier, and left behind the poor delivery. Davis sends a wonderful actress a wonderful, with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips. Lollar's long trekking shot breaks into a parade of adults eating food (and they all face on the shoulder while facing the camera!), Which includes Polly Maran (who thinks Davies's maidly funny), Lola Persona (a friendly vampires), Esther Taylor, Claire Windsor Aylin Pringle, a comedy couple in Karl Dane (with a hand in a sling) and George K. Arthur (Claiming that he is stealing), Laetrez Joy (interesting by Arthur's absurdity), Rene Ador, Road (eating and smoking) La Roch, Murray, John (in a dress) Gilbert (who drove through MGM Gates early in the photo) , Soft (uu!) Talmagage (as usual anxiety and laziness) and Patricia dressed like Marie Annette, Sandus in Douglas Fairbank Like below (as an interesting strategy) and William S. Hart (protect him from the dogs). The Cride Troupe hinders their painting when Billy is in the high art crew, with predictive results. As the current production director of Pagi, Weidar himself also worked in the final scene. Harry Grabbone is a comedy director Eddie Sedgwick, who is acting as a dramatic director in Sydney Brassey, who does not cry to Peggy for screening her screen and then she can not stop him and as Paul Rally Andre, his dramatic love interest and a sunny foal When his character tries to 'do his work', though Davis is having fun at all the horrifying plays, he is forced to work and he is working brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Although it has been shown to be a truly entertaining example of humorous mockery, it has been a 'great day' for ten years, MGM, Ivaring Thalberg, and collective talent from their extraordinary wealth of quality work. What a shame is lost. From the first year of Pati (1928), Vidya and Davies, there are many examples of great films from a very successful comedy until they can see and enjoy.
