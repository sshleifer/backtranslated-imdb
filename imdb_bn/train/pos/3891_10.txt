One of the best comedians ever. I have seen this show about 10 times and probably it can see at least 100. My friends and family often quoted from this DVD, you think we did nothing other than watching it. Slak a bit slowly at the beginning of the Alcatraz, but it is jeeped by playing it or in the eddy stage in April. Look at the "Coke or Death" section (the joke about the Church of England) and the "Hitler / Poll Pot" part (it is hard to explain, only see it). The best part of the show can be the expression of AD's mouth. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow probably helped, huh?) Clear warning: Eddie has a tendency to throw words of many four letters.
