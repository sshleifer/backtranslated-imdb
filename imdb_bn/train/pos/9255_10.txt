If you want a fun romp with loads of fine humor, then you will enjoy this glimpse. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why nobody will enjoy this. Take it for: Dennis Hooper forcing you to mess with your car and make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's done well. Erica Elienacak is absolutely beautiful and holds this one in itself - better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows an emptiness for fine humor. Too bad he had not had many opportunities to expand on her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tom Brenger's role of "real navy" perfectly fits And William McNamara did a hard job as a hustler. <br /> <br /> Walk in the middle of the back of this "Cherry Cherry" and you have a movie that makes me laugh while maintaining my attention. I bought it as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain candy.
