His classic film Nouro reverence Chinatown returned to Roman Polanski, giving him the biggest hits with 60 years of immense psychological turmoil after Chinatown Roman Polanski, such as Rippleson and Rosemary's Baby, living in the apartment, related to panoo and clostrophobia. <Br /> <br /> Clustropic environments are Polanski which is best for creating, and it will be the most terrible and limited image ever created. The emphasis on side walls and distant extinction is far more than ever and even in the external view, the sky is rarely scorched. But the tenant is not limited only to spontaneously, but with intensity it focuses on its play. Polksky has played itself, not only in every scene, but also in almost every shot. When the camera does not come from Trailkovsky's point of view, he does not have much on screen. And of course, almost everywhere he saw that he looked at him with his own reflection in a mirror. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any film that is more about internalization and the unity of one character. Some psychological thrillers, such as M. or Peeping Tom, express sad feelings for the mentally ill hero. Others like Psycho, deeply scientific analysis efforts in his psychological condition. Does the tenant fit in this section ?? It simply immerses us completely inside Trelkovsky's experience without claiming what's happening inside his head or claiming gratitude. We feel his enthusiasm and passion even though it has constantly shown to us that they are illusory. <br /> <br /> Polanski was also a director of a horrific film that was slowly mad. Often there is an ambiguity in his horror that if a ghost is actually running, they are the most effective among the horrible spectators. Why? Good Creator because they express so slowly and firmly establish the situation so that they invest so much time that they immerse the audience in the audience. After a lot of Polanski horror, Ninth Gate is a bit of a mess-based plot but at least it managed to achieve horrible awesome ideas. <br /> <br /> This is a very rare opportunity to see himself in Poland. A major role. His talent in front of the camera was good on his back, and he is absolutely perfect as courteous Trelkovsky. Another standout performance is that Sally Winterers is always ignored. In fact it is rather a stellar cast, although this strange, Gothic European film has many familiar faces. Also sadly, many of the French actors supporting the role were dubbed in the English version. <br /> <br /> The tenant is more smooth and less seduced than revenge, but it lacks the mystery and character that creates a Rosary baby. So engrossing and entertaining. Tenant is better than an error, and Polanski was the best as the director, but this is not one of his most wonderful works.
