Hurray! A spaceship that does not take very seriously, and everyone can come along with the excitement of space camps. The film starts slowly, the common mix of idiots and high-flyer blends into a soup. But when it gets difficult - it can become difficult and it is not an incredible change in letters because you can believe that their young mind has some responsibilities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is very annoying as the Kate Caption "I'm OK and you're all wrong". I would recommend this as a beautiful night movie and a 7th vote.
