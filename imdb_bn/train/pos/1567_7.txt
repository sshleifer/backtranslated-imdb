This is not a bad movie, but we can be Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Homes or St. with Sanders, Bari, Hell, Coen, Hamilton, Gargan, FitzGood and even Wiley Best. In other words, you get the opportunity to spend another hour with some old friends, a little annoying, killing and murder - always a joy in my book. <br /> <br /> Bari's revenge is a harsh dame for cleaning a police detective by carrying a string of his forgery and deceased parents, plans and a murder of his coterie underworld. Which certainly had the opposite effect! On the right-hand right of the right-hand right of the right-hand right of the right-hand right-hander and his first killer (at the right time!) And killing him, the right-handers dance in the right light and join the fun. <Br /> <br /> The story and the acting are okay, what I got was near the speed of fast, which ended with the early and almost ridiculous discovery of evil spirits - did they forget about its relevance in the plot? That series said a solid entry.
