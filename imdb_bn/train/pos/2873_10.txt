This is one of Disney's top five animated features in my opinion. Cinderella full-length feature animations film (opposing the compilation of 40's compilation movies), and the costly depth of multi-plane cameras is perfect for returning to movies in any other way. Although Disney has a slightly generous designation, you collect the concept of the era through this dress and set the stylization - a clear period of the story. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multi-dimensional character. Indeed, all the characters are somewhat better developed, apart from the Prince - the most flat - we know that there is humor and a great smile, but that's all. Like Snow White, Disney has a lasting influence on the popular culture story - in most versions of Cinderella, the rituals are not as attractive as Cinderella, and their character moves away from their other beautiful looks. <Br /> <br /> Favorite Disney Addition: Mouse! Also, commends continuity - Cinderella always loses shoe across her shoes. Aside from the simple gown, it was awesome like a step-by-step baby - I remember the master showed it with a black background and a big red light! The broken Chile depression shows the inevitability of Lady Tramine - to save and defeat Cinderella - --- All the villains of Disney Vinnie will make Satan the witch, the silly beauty masseur's worst character.
