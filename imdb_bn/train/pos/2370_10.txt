This is a great American martial arts movie. Battle scenes for the American film made in the 90's were quite impressive. Of course, war scenes are not as good as Hong Kong movies, in fact, some American films have shown the war, which is also good in Hong Kong movies, even nowadays. When you look at the American martial arts movie, you are looking forward to seeing less impressive war scenes, but there are still some nice steps that can sometimes be wonderful, or at least I hope from these movies. I was impressed by this picture. Some war scenes were really impressive, acting, direction and plot were good enough, so if you like the American martial arts movie of 90, it's a really valuable movie.
