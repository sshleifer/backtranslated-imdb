Very interesting and playful movie. With David Lynch's (such as quoted in the literal sense by the presence of red screen in the film) and Franz Kafka novels (this film is called Mrs. Grubbt, as one of those among Der Proges.) But in this case, with the colonial past explicit mention of Belgium in Africa. I can not clearly describe the exact contents of the film: This colonialism is an important part of its inability to deal with the past, but the personal memories of the main character are also a central problem and communication and love of social inquiry. The symbolic themes I have seen from this movie, but in reality they are not more than impressions. <br /> <br /> Even if you try to follow a linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you will still discover a very impressive movie filled with impressive images (Beatles, larvae and other nasty insects, beautiful close-ups change with great dream sequences And dark atmosphere lends to the film additional style). Maybe you can say that I did not get the film quite perfectly, but I have been seen to be hypothetical for 1.5 hours, deeply influenced by the visual quality and interesting mysteries.
