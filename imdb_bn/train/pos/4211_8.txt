I watched the TV last night (HBO). I must admit, the excitement of this film was unheard of by most other FN era films. I like all the quiet moments in a chip way and then the very next moment will be violent. It was classic Ah yes Dame, Villian, Cigar and Thappish Police! It's all there. This movie delivered me all the products. I am very common for this era of movie, the way to mix communism in plot. Blacklisting was very brave because of being popular in those days. I saw this movie in the best FN genre, rate one!
