If you like Jamie Fox (Alvin Sanders), "Hell Date to Hell", you'll love his acting like a man who never breaks in life and wanders in the world with shrimps (jumbo shapes) and gold bars Lots of time at the same time. A lot of the FBI eyes of Alvin Sanders saw him and hit him with a jaw brick and David Morse, (Edgar Clintin), "Hack" decided to become zero on the TV series poor Alvin and used him so he would be attracting criminals to hook the fish. Lots of laughter, drama, cold blood kill, and the location of the excellent movie and the very expensive car being sent to the junk yard. This film was great entertaining by Jamie Fox and David Morse's outstanding actor and entire film.
