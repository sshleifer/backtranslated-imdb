Czanne's first picture won the silent Oscar. Here are some reviews about the remarkable details and length of the movie and its symbols and it is very high. I can see almost where they are almost coming. But I like to take a more tense approach to a long forgotten movie, which in reality seems to be shot in a budget and short-documentary fashion. The pneumonic plug is open on the New Orleans road, and it is a military doctor (Weidark) and a city detective (Douglas) to detain a major carrier. The film uses moody, black and white colored shots, and location very well. Widmark is as surprising as usual. Forget the symbol (crime is the same as the disease, and the crime equivalent to the disease) and enjoy only the chase. It is not always easy to show a movie that we are good at this new century, because it was a specific style that was for a very short time (after WWII in the early 1950s) and it is naturally interesting movie observers. For those who see it for the first time, sit tight for big chase at the end. It's something else, and I do not really know how they portrayed some of it. I can say that it probably took enough time for the movie to finish the first 90 percent of the movie.
