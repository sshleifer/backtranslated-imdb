I had this an amazing movie. It is a man touching each fiber. Love in the film is very intense. I had it's best performance date of will. Great command Edit Preferences The music was great. Good use of flashback. This kind of movie will go to see everyone. I hope people get something nice from this. Overall, excellent movie. I think there should be more movies with Hollywood material. Even action films can have a caring story. I loved the fact that his performance was very fine. He was rare to see that he had a purpose and a dedication. I would recommend this alone or meet with anyone you really care about. For me, I saw that the world was closed and my only focus was on film. The outer world was suspended for a moment. This world had a wonderful feeling with this chaos. And it was good to see some (someone) with this generation that took care of other people than myself.
