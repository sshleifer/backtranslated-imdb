This is quite a dull movie. With a realistic performance, Depardieu is a very good person, as a bad boy with cad and realistic mood and art house decoration, it fails because the director does not give any position, stand or critical comment about it because it fails. The film with Depardieu is one of the respected and regular working partners of France - I believe they made 7 together - Pialat failed to engage. It seems that women fall for such a bad boy, who will hurt him while having a caring husband and a good hearted husband. Isabelle Hopper playing philanderer with helpless differences offers such overwhelming answers like "I do not know"; "I like his arms"; "I like the way of love" to his investigative husband who tries to drive him out of the house but the reason for the soliloquy and review ... I think he loves her. So he accepted and what to expect? She will wake up one day and come to her senses. Such things are not long answered in Pyalat's dance-drama style, and answers are not answered in more views until the answers are added. I do not know to add the answer but please take a stand. Jules and Jim, this is not. The cold final shot that we saw is just forgiving and headache.
