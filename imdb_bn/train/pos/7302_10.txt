Due to this writing John Carpenter 'Halloween' is near the 30th anniversary It's a 7-series, a remake, a complete mess of the statues and Halloween every year when it's always there with 'Top 10 Scariest Movies' listings. It is amazing for a movie made in a budget of around $ 300,000, and it often reveals almost completely unknown cast and young talent. I could go anymore, but the big question here is: How does the movie hold today? And all I can say is fantastic! Prose: A simple, but wonderful opening credit sequence that really sets the mood. An unforgettable and Husum-Eduing score by director / co-author John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinematography The carpetter's stellar side, which keeps the sensation high, gets some great shots, and does not show his villain with too much caution. Then better performance than most unknown cast. Feel the juice Michael Maywers is a scary, evil man. A lot of eerie moments that you have to stay with. The speed is slow, but does not stab and drags. Compared to most other slashers, it's more about terrorism and terrorism than blood and blood. Cons: Perhaps it was not nearly as scary. The cave really stands out a lot. Final Thoughts: I want to start this section by saying that this series is not my favorite movie. I do not know it's popular opinion, but it really is how I feel. Since this is a really important film that reaches the new generation of film buff. And it will not be forgotten because it is rebuilt for a new generation. There is no way, how not? <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
