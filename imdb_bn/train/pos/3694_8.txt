It was not sure what to expect from this movie, and it was not surprising to consider the wonderful collection of managers, but at the end it was not frustrating. <br /> <br /> For me, the final episode with America's tourists was talking about a terrific French accent (which makes me feel better about me), which was a great way to really touch and wrap the movie. <br /> <br /> Paramidic and Doc Hunter was also very coen brothers for the ongoing and pure comedy and received the Steve Buscemi Award. Tom Clapper was also impressive, but ambitious than his chance. <br /> <br /> However, the Bob Hawkins segment was fully operational and the vampire's story was completely harmful. The dialogue was very strongly felt in the division of Wes Craven, and the story of Chinatown was completely unknown. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is worth seeing and good for the good bits. It is not very painful to sit through bad sections - they only last for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
