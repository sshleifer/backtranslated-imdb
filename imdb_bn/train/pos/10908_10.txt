I can not hold back the tears when I saw this beautiful documentary. It was heart-boring, annoying, and one was all inspiring. I want something like this documentary that someone wants something that will think about what they are doing with their own lives. Or simply, that you would think of something. As you look at people throughout the last few months of your life. You watch as he goes through his day with a positive attitude. At one stage you will see that he is really an amazing person. You start to realize that we have everything to teach us all. His life and struggles will make you cry, laugh, and make life easier if you take it one day at a time.
