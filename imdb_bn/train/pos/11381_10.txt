The best part of an American in Paris is to finally complete the lengthy ballet sequence, wherein Jean Kelly and Leslie Carnon are some of the main painters living personalities. Kelly was previously established as a Pavel artist in Paris, so the logical ending of the musical explosion with customs, life and strength, the tunes of Gerswin and custom members like George Getty and Oscar Levant. Kelly was at her best - it is a bit different than the singers in the rain, and the impact of all the pictures on the top with the ballot gives it a special carrier. No wonder that after the MTM musical highlights were gone the sequence ended!
