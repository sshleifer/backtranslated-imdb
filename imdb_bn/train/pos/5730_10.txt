Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbbell is probably not for anyone other than Lynch, and as a result it is funny and creates a joint cartoon. Violent? Yes Impurity? Yes Absurd Yes A piece of garbage? Ever. Dumbbell has a wonderful picture of some Americans who do not have wives and kids in the brain and hit for the brain. From Mexico I can say it's love! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeth are bleeding, all the words and violence around me scream me and behind my bed. 2 - Get the stick! Yes baby to get it and learn a lesson: Some people will not be grateful for your actions. 3 - Aunt. All Lynch episodes, music, supernaturalism and very sweet revenge ...
