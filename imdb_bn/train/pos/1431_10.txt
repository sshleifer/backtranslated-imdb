This is simply the most wonderful movie you'll see. I thought it was just another documentary, but it really is something else. It does not try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about the quality of the photo, because you obviously know from other comments it disrespects. <br /> <br /> Earth is funny, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Occasionally both at the same time. This first movie has made me cry because you do not feel sorry for animals, because you realize that how fragile our planet is and we do not understand what rich blessings we have, but we do not appreciate it at all. <BR> <br /> This movie should be compulsory in school. This is the most wonderful film you'll see, so go and see it. Who knows, maybe we can see our planet last ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but if possible, I would rate it more easily.
