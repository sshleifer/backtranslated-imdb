I just saw this picture again and it was disappointing at the number of enemies who rejected it as a new era pop. A great movie, which takes time to develop, is near to the edge but eventually gets gradually influenced slowly and looks at the way of life. I was angry at the time that "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsie" (though I liked later) was nominated for the best picture of that year (only won "chin silence"!) And it was completely ignored without a nomination for the best play . After reviewing it, I think history supports my primary response!
