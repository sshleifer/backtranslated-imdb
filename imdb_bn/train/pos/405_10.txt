I have been a fan of Ju K (Harak Sui) for many years from the school. This film is the best fantasy movie of the year. I do not think the "action" is the right style, although many steps and kongfu are visible. Waiting, I mention this an animate fantasy moive? Please note that do not use the Hollywood Formula to rate this movie. And the person who is "near", I do not blame you, because you still have to learn more about young and "culture".
