Before watching the film I was familiar with the production of Gius and dolls, I did not like it as soon as I did. Brando (for his performance) and Sinatra (for my vocals, though he is quite a performer, Manchester candidate or Eastern Town here) <br /> <br /> For some other critics' statements, I have Broadway soundtracks and Izabelle Bingley's voice is more than gin simmons, although it is not even more fun. I find it has a rather rock quality. Jean Simons's voice is more realistic, though in theory, it is not always a big concern in musical instruments. I especially noticed the reason for the change of Marlon Brando, especially the weak vocalist, "Lucky LeBay Lady" and especially due to the familiarity with the Cinatra version. In the film at Broadway, I think Vivian Blane's voice is more enjoyable. And if the voice of Sinatra only requires the release of others, then they will be able to recover the failure of all others. (They were not) It is infinitely better than Sam Leven, especially my favorite song 'Sue M'. <br /> <br /> I also want to be different, for the song that had been removed from the movie for a little song from this complaint. 'A Busel and A Pack' is rarely a jewel and its replacement song, 'Pat M. Pappa' and its corresponding performance Hot Box Elements. I personally do not take care of 'Man Today Merry' and enjoy it was not included in the movie. I enjoyed the 'Ive Cover Bin in Prive' before, and although it was not played in the movie, the version of the device was heard when Nathan Adelaide was in the dressing room. The 'same' feeling in love is equally good, and perhaps in a range that can reach both large numbers. And this movie is not the same as 'Adlay' songs, not included in Broadway. In fact, if the soundtrack of the film was available for sale, I would suggest buying it instead of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I did not see the original production, I can not imagine that the actress is the best actor than the film's limit. <br /> <br /> <br /> The important thing is that the story is acting as before and GS is not so low.
