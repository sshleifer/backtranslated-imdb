Mendes and Marcaul gave us a serious, painful and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis of colonization for 108 years in Puerto Rico. There is a beautiful island with my best known guests and yet our nation refuses to face its imperial responsibilities, because Puerto Ricanans are allowed to die and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis that the Puerto Rico colonial situation weakens the family and creates a fundamental institution for the survival of a society. Corruption is not paying public taxes (which created a financial crisis for this nation) and the culture of this island is increasing the feeling of betrayal and mistrust. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, a donation will be produced in this painful yet powerful film. <br /> <br /> One must definitely see. . .
