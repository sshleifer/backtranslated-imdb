One of the best works of Budanbusses and Bromestics Disney It was portrayed with animated sequences and animated actors and actresses. (Similar ideas were used in Marie Poppens as children and children disappeared in the pedestrian industry.) I basically rate this movie with the eyes of the child because I have not seen it in years. Then back, it's one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mysterious, and the last scenery (inside the inside of the war, inside the cluttered inside) was my favorite. Many stop-animations have also been made that are used with spellings (that is, people converted into rabbits), which can now be a short date and stupid. (Also, I believe that the film starts slowly.) In a child's eye, it's a fun movie and it's easy for children to put children's children in place. This is a fictional movie which sadly forgot today.
