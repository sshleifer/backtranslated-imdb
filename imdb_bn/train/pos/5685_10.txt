Director and throw Kudos for such a realistic film. The lack of glamor, glamor and disappointment brought me to the film and kept me there. I was really impressed about how the dates and information in the film were restored; Such as newspapers, letters, etc. This image continues in such a speed that I did not feel the desire to move once again. Personally, I think all the policies have done an extraordinary job ... It was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It wants me crying at times. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... its performance of this nature usually leaves me in fear. Overall, it will not miss a brilliant film!
