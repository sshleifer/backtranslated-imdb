All right, I know I do not like this movie but I do. Jatelli's boring cry from Pat Morrita's Japanese Stereotype boyfriend explains, I laughed through the film. As long as you remember that it is not the best movie in the world, it's a good MV. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is talking to Marita talking to her close intimate with Tokyo.
