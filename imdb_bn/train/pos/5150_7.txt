Although Ian Karshah kept himself away from the project because of the incompetence of Hitler's life and yes, it is dramatic, but essential. Robert Carleil played Hitler in his subsequent years, until he became the Chancellor of Germany, along with The Night of the Long Nights, until he was only dealt with Hitler with childhood during the documentary. This TV-film (also a two-part mini series) shows how many factors allow Hitler to come to power, such as. Financial crisis of 1930 <br /> <br /> The series is followed by Hitler's follow-up, without the lives of Fritz Garlich and Ernst Hannifenglgag. Above all, filled with valuable and interesting actors, but I think it should have been driven more firmly with strong cinematography; Most actors are portrayed in half-body shots (for me), creating a theater stance, not a movie. Tempo is occasionally slowed down and the film is damaged by it for about 25 hours.
