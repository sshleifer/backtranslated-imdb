I think this film adds diversity and it is very accurate in the historical reconstruction. Various communities living together in Thailand show that it is very interesting ... Portuguese, Japanese and various communities are run by the King. Plots around the court often struggle like a struggle for power with rebellion. Clothing is fine. The film was made locally on a reasonable production in Thailand. The scene with elephant as executor is very interesting. It's funny and I think it's usable for school's historical accuracy because it shows that Europeans of Asia are different from the perspective of traditional rajas from the perspective of Hollywood.
