I was not sure what I could expect, but I'm glad I went to see this. A smart, little rolled comedy that makes you think. I am not sure any director can create anything, but it is Mr. Leave to the bright people of Natali and CORE. Another low budget set that looks real (which can not be anything). If your time and money are good, if you have a chance to see this, please go. You will be glad you
