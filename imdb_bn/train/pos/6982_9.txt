Good show <br /> <br /> The basic background is on a benchmark of humanity. Having a set of moral contradictions is facing. Mankind has several technical advances, but is mankind mature enough to deal with new toys? There is a virtual world's moral decadence. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill attention get attention. I predict (based on the BSG background) that there will be a problem with silen and slavery. There are also other problems that we bring people on themselves. <br /> <br /> This program is not BSG - at least until mankind is driven from such a ruthless problem. There are not many shoot-in-ups or spaces-based special effects - at least I have not seen at least the first episodes. <br /> <br /> It's very good story, characters, and themes. It has good performance from the actor. They can create a culture that is like society today, but at the same time the aliens can be completely credible. Like the BSG, this display is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, probabilities and flaws. It may seem a little strange that there are human society's goodies, antique cars and chickens in different groups of the world. But that thing is really more to create a semi-known background than anything else. Those details which are stuck really missing that point. You are not far from mafia-style culture or rich and high-tech culture, human and human nature today is more than 150,000 years ago than a high technology past which we can not see today. If the authors try to tell us something, then be surprised.
