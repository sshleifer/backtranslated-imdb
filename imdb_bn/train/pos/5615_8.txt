A disloyal separation and paranoia thriller. Perform very well and perform as well as open introvert as Polanski tries hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. After the deceiver money and the spontaneous fellow tenants became scary and later became his defense, he developed his defense which would eventually return to his predecessor. Personally I could work without cross-dressing material, but I accepted psycho and had some logic, which kept the story in mind. Nevertheless, it could work without it and could remove a little theatrical element, but still it was intended because the gown would eventually look at the look of the theater. I can not recall that there are few more 'true' French and Jewish boots than the manager's own feelings. Yet there are so many benefits here, with a great looking Isabel Adjani and good old Shelley Winters, which are reliable before long.
