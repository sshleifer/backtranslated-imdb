I went to see Vanilla Sky huge, huge, huge !! .. Tom Cruz fan, my extremely satirical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say .. I completely moved away from the movie and especially TC's performance, I thought it was a very moving movie and what I was hoping for Not at all. <br /> <br /> I used to read reviews and decide that to see and not see it, I was very happy that I had seen it. I can not tell the strange thing, what I can say is that I was completely involved and could not think about it the next day. I can tell about what I felt about this movie, that its story (imagination, psychology, whatever it is) can change people's events and events that shape their life and change any small events such as a car. All things ...... <br /> <br /> For what the critics wrote, yes, maybe there was a great second film for the Asylumandro Amenbar , But it was a completely different explanation of the subject and in no way was a dancer remix for the convenience of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can not write some tricks, glib sentences to describe the image. <br /> Yes, I know this is not a balanced thoughtful review, but what is it? This is not such a movie.
