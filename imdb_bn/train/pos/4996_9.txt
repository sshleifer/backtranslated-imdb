I saw most of the staff in HK, and this one genre is at the top right. The action scenes are exciting and dynamic as you saw in any action movie. Kungfu sightseeing, pyrotechnics eye popping, stunt work, heartstoping Completely praised the performance of paced, tension height and fluid camera performance This film is directed by the old Pro Corie Eunen, whose resume is stuffed with the best of the generals, including the Jet Li vehicle The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is a lack of things in this film, it is a three-dimensional character, though Martin comes from the male's closest direction. This movie is rather a mythical character than a character, a stupid killer, a fool stealer and his evil girlfriend, Kaking Villen. That said, Shannon Lee has a horrific screen presence; He is great with battles, stunts, and guns. When he is on screen, it is difficult to close his eyes. He is that good. Why is this woman a major star?
