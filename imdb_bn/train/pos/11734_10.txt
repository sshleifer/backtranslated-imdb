This weak 'Elvira Hunted Hills' must be my favorite flickr against the weak ... However, how does the movie like the Goth / Less 'Wizard of Oz' story ... <br /> <br /> Lvira is a gotha Dorothy who is trapped in a strange city after the death of a good Witch (Livrose Auntie Morgan) ... he has found a "Ruby" ring that is very strong and the search after the bad waillock (his uncle). She is a four-letter friend, whom she unknowingly helps to grow all the time with a hat across the film. There is a show with his uncle (the evil sorcerer of the West), where Elvi understands that he has his power in him and he ends up defeating him. Eventually the people send people after their hearts win, and eventually they get their destination Las Vegas (Dorothy's house in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There have been many references to the Ozir Wizards throughout life ... He and his uncle both quote lines are relevant to their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be aunt, and you must be Ramas' uncle ... there is no place at home, no place like home!" Bad uncle Vinnie: "I will give you my beautiful and your little dog too!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Talent ... and if you do not laugh at laughing, after your "very 80's" at Las Vegas, you do not have your body camp bone after twilling ... This movie is a cool / camp classic
