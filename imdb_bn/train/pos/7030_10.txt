After it was broadcast on TV in 1995, we taped it and waited for its release all these years, because it quickly became our family favorites. The kids are now teenagers and they will see a ba-zillion bar, yet they still see it religiously with friends. It's always a long time to reach throughout the ages - like "Grease" <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander is delightful and amazing light on his feet. I've noticed quite a bit rough on other commentators on this site, but our family gives him top rating. (We like his 'giant step' number.) Mark Kudish (Conrad) provides us with a number of comical breaks and amazing music numbers. And Brigata doo (like Ursula) steals flat show only. Perhaps our favorite character in the whole movie <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments was that of Chinna Philippe of Kim. That part must be done with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. That complaint, Philip's delivery plane, unimaginative, incredible and just plain horror. The director should see that and it should be fixed. Or do not throw him to start with him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the picture is pleasing and I recommend it to a very elderly family.
