Whether or not this film is promoted (I do not believe it strongly), it actually shows the power of the media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how well a man Chavez is. Chavez's way to show how the Bolivians have happened Although it seems to be wrong and bias to support a film, I think the point in the film is completely valid. Through Venezuela's private media corporation, the Venezuelan people have only side-side effects on one side, Neo-Liberal side. It shows us how the Bolivians viewed this movie. Call it Promo, I'm calling it a judgment call in your part.
