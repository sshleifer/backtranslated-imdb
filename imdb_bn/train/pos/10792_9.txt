Good show, very entertaining. Well played martial arts. Good story plot The whole main crew did a wonderful job from Robert Yurich, Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Toug and especially Jason Mills, from a great hand. The next day, Robert Urrich was particularly respected by a special tribute. A great! The actors who will really miss
