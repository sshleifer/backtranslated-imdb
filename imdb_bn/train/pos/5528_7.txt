This is a very beautiful and almost mediocre film - it does not have any dialogue except narration. And appreciate the scenery and music each other. For the first time, the girl's red hair and I had no friendship with Fox (it's red hair too!) It's about the old-fashioned children's film, which says that kids like today are an animation like Shikk or Toyo Story- but I think the youth are the beauty of this nature And should be more familiar with the wonderful beauty. It is probably not the best type of type, but certainly nice and shimmering scene for all ages-not just children.
