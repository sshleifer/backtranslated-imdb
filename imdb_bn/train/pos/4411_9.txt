For a movie directed by the director, 9 out of 10 will be appreciated. But this movie can not be "entertained". And Li Lee took a motivated approach to the relatively irrelevant approach to civil war. Like all the movies of Lee, what is beautiful about movies, he does not "side" his characters. He creates letters, pledges them with life, problems and ambiguities ... and gives them a reality which is more comfortable than often, often traveling around the house. This movie has action, but it is not for action lovers because jealousy is deeply annoying and far from unused ... like characters, it is real. And you agree on the most horrific battles of mankind, violence is horrible. <br /> <br /> But it is a wonderful composition as it explores the obscurity of the larger people living in civil war. Was there a fight about slavery and an extortion? Imagines like Blue Blue and Gray are so popular that the line seems to want to bleed. Whatever the idealism, though it is seen in the air. It's about your freedom and the desire to do something for you. As you see the letters, you yourself will be asked "How can they fight to save slavery?" Actually, I do not think they are really, and thus the film shows why so many people were caught in the epidemic of civil war. <br /> <br /> <br /> The characters we learn are fighting out of the sense of loyalty to the "house", even though they do not represent in a house or they actually do not check whether they follow its values. Private scene is very running and yet fine. Other examples of leniency extended up to Jack and Daniel's limitations. And when the tension finally snaps, and these characters suddenly find "free" ... we can see the birth of new men. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lee is one of her styles that is very familiar and easily accessible to her "art" (slowly, camera, obsolete), in European space and in the development of stories European and many of North America. <BR> <br /> Be calm, what is a civil war, what should be a "western" type of a movie, what a war film should be ... and let Lee take you to a world so that it is so difficult that we Some can comfortably see it. <br /> <br /> In this case, Lee Steve continues what he has done in the ice cream. Again, the film is a sure sign of Lee's ability to operate without a "stupid" story or screen, without a slow and visible "direction". His instruction was extended by Jewel (yes, singer), which is an outstanding actress who has made an outstanding performance. <br /> <br /> For those who love movies, a movie and lovers are not standard Hollywood epic.
