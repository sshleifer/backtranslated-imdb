Although I'm not the biggest fan of Warwick based martial arts film, when a film goes straight for fantasy instead of war, I get much more fun than this and this movie is a fantasy plot and crazy flying mischief. Ching Siu Tung has made an interesting treat with great acting and many miraculous looks here. Great, sad, Leslie Cheng plays a tax collector hero who travels around the clock in the temple and is involved in the spirits of a stunning fox and a cruel taoist. The performance of the Cheungs is filled with naive but dignified charm and the Wu mother Taoist monk, which displays some swords and even gets a musical number as pleasingly close to the wall. Perhaps Joey Wang is the best fox spirit off all, really a gesture of gesture with every movement and gesture seductive. The film takes imagination, horror, comedy and romance stuff, stirred all together in a continual entertainment package. Ching Siew Touung, managing and managing choreography, gives some disciplined wirewrap thrills, and the film encompasses shades, shades, and warmly colorful forest colors, which gives each forest scene a surprisingly surprising environment. Also notable hair styling and gorgeous flowing dresses of female characters, if I do not make mistakes, then Joe Wang sported the hair repeatedly like Fox Ear, it is an extraordinary touch. Although the film does relatively little work and Chesie pop songs give advice on some of the sick days, it is a beautiful entertainment part, it is also an interesting character and plot, even the weird character's stress, visual fascinating and dreamy dreaming environment. A miraculous treasure, highly recommended.
