This movie expresses barbaric exploitation of Chinese workers - generally by distributing footage from the Chinese business owner of the female businessman, who share his disrespectful and confusing views, his American opponent was disturbed and confused by a voice of oppressed workers, and of course, drunk Americans were silently New Orleans celebrate candle wear necklaces. <br /> <br /> The surprise comes when some Americans actually pay their harmful necklace to $ 0.10 per hour. You also think that workers may have the opportunity to stop working in the beeswax factory, but perhaps they refrain from the punitive behavior of the factory owner and / or they are very tired to work 20 hours hard work day <br /> <br /> I was surprised to hear from the necklaces I came from, and I do not understand how it can be made completely and difficult. I really appreciate this film because it beautifully portrays the effect of America's helplessness which we consider relatively neutral in our society on the other side of the world. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It's just amazing. And definitely, just ice tip!
