If not all the movies released in 2002, I can not say that it is the best film of the year. I can say it in the best movie that I saw throughout the year. <br /> <br /> Most American films of Americans are terrified of American introduction with "ethnic relations", or enter the inner city Vecto, with each StarType imaginable vibrant Ubuntu-phraseed slang. Antwone Fisher has stood proudly on this issue: the nation is irrelevant, reserved for a war, which may arise out of a racial slur, save it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No empathic person He understatedly, and thought, illustrated by Derek Luke. When Denzel Washington is apparently using his Star Power to make his film, most of the time it takes it to the background and tells the story of the film Antowon Fisher. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope the non-black audience will not see this movie for humanity, but instead of avoiding it, because they think there are no characters or actors in the movie they can detect. This is a tragic comment on the relationship between North America and its relations. <br /> <br />
