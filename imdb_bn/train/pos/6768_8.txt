One of my favorite shows in the 80's is one. In the first season, when they decided to add Zin Bruce Scott to Cast, he started going to Woodhill. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was funny to see him and Ernest Berggin's character took each other away. He was one of my favorites for the second episode that was the last episode. Unfortunately in those days, black television programs did not last long. Some episodes of the second phase are okay but the third season was more about the character of the human than the airflow, and it has not been shown to almost show up. When it went to the United States, it was hate !!!
