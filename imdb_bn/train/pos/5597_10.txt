"Le Locketier" ("The Tenant") is one of the most important horror films created without any doubt. A terrible file clerk living in Paris who, like a Turkskski, is a horrific file clerk who responds to an apartment's apartment, trying to suicide only by jumping from the previous tenant apartment window to find it. Tarkovsky was forced to go to hospital and there he met Stella (Isabel Adjani). Before Tenlovsky died when his previous tenant died, he went to the first and found such a nice apartment. She seems to be trying to get excited in the repeat of Trelovskovsky's previous mercenary sues who became increasingly suspicious of her neighbors, because her happiness is soon replaced by paranoia waves. This picture is great. Polanski managed to create a surreal terrifying environment and Paranoia. Excellent style such as Trichkoski discovers the previous tenant's teeth in the hole of the wall, or discover the fever's dream where it floats inside the building. The photo of Seren Nickviste is really beautiful. "Tenant" is a neglected jewel. It may be difficult to track, but it is much more than effort.
