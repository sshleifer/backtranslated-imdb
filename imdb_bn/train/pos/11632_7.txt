Again greetings from darkness. What a relief ... an exciting that's really thrilling! The new "IT" girl Rachel McAdam ("Wedding Crusher" and "Notebook") influenced the screen time of this wonderful little classic suspense thriller from famous horror film director Wes Craven ("Scream" movie and "Nightmare of Elm Street"). There is also a Kyoma as one of the crew carriers. <br /> <br /> This is the first 15-20 minute reality that we interact with McDams with 4 or 5 person or person. She is a natural. When she seems to be going to Sylheti Murphy ("Batman Begins" scarecrow), the film really takes flight. The audience knows something bad, while watching two Yuppie-type flirt, the filmmakers are pulverized! Flat boarding order is mesmerizing and over 30 plus minutes are excruciatingly clustrophobic. Cranven guides us as involved and if someone comes to his rescue. <br /> <br /> Like many thrillers, only the time of Letam Climax happens when the Mesh becomes a superhero. An interesting plat device we believe that Rachel has the frustration to see this frustration, but we can not help a bit. Most overdone scenes include irate hotel guests, a boring airline passenger, hit Cillian and involved FX at the hotel. The character power of the film is character development and emotional games in leadership. Sadly, Brian Cox, a veteran of fine screen experience, has been used less, but overall it is a minimum suspense thriller that is valuable for all to see in the final.
