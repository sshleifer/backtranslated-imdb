I must admit outside the collection of Eros movie, it must be the one that I love most and at the same time I also reviewed. The story really is something that keeps watching you There are many plots in EROS movies that can be seen as Hammer when you break it into pieces before producing it. All are centered around sex, and the film can get along with how many different people come in. And, dear God, do not see any of these movies when someone pulls a gun. It does not work almost ridiculous, but you do not want to waste the power to do it. <br /> <br /> "Losing control" just as her name comes. Playwright, leading character (wonderful talent and beautiful touch). Control is a person's control over their senses, their body and feelings. And a man changes everything for him, almost makes him a different woman. But the mirrors are isolated at the same time. It creates a great movie that I have brought from the beginning !! <br /> <br /> 10/10
