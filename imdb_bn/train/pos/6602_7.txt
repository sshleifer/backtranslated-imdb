Likewise, Frank Miller and his Sina City comics used black and white (and silent effects of her film) to express herself, so with Christian Roland's Christian Wolkman too <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . In the history of science fiction, a bright, flashing multi-carrying jewelry in the future. It is a jewel in sorrow, inequality and dark settings. Beautiful and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly below. Research scientist is kidnapped from one of the top "bright" people, the very large and influential global organization (Avalon). Well known and effective, Captain Karas (new James Bond himself voiced by Daniel Craig), the task was allotted to find him. <br /> <br /> Plots and layouts are not extra basic. It is silent on film, influenced by Gibson's neuromanser and other detective stories, such as Blade Runner, Sina City, Metropolitan and Minority Report of Fritz Lang. The main plots, all the end connections that are surrounded by other potential sub-plots. It's not hard to find out all of it. <br /> <br /> The film's power and originality in its intense visual presentation. Paris level and sub-level are a complex array. More primitive industry infrastructures at its base. As the emergence of the city, so does its architecture complexity and luminescence. Nevertheless, the top of this framework is not equal to the standard and behavioral height of man. Paris has been critically animated and has been presented with bright black and white out. The film was closer to Sina City (comics) with confidence and then there was the source material of the Sin City movie. This is made easier because it is still in the same medium; Animation. The same way as the scanner pushed the visual perspective of a dark story, so it does. The atmosphere of light and dark, black and white contrasts, as well as visible hesitation. Correct and incorrect, black and white can lose all the money at the same time, it is right in front of us. The film proves that both black and white can be confused and obvious at the same time. <br /> <br /> I can be both critics and fans to maintain the spirit of the movie. I can love and hate in the same light. It is definitely the experience to recommend for a visual industry lovers. So pour another black and tension, enter void and enjoy the ride.
