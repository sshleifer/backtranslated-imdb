There is one thing for this kind of old black and white movies, Will Hey and Abbott and Costello films, especially this is my favorite. I picked up this movie in DVD because the same concept was used as Will Hey's "Oh Mr. Porter", one of the best comedians ever made. I just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie ended at 12:45). I used to work with such films, ghost trains, etc., at night night is best viewed. In this way, you work well with this movie once more in the story and see during the night. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> They are not my date though. I am 28 years old and although this film was first released I was not old (though my dad was still). I still have the gratitude for some of such old movies. While sitting in front of the TV in front of the TV with some food and drinks and sleeping at night watching these movies, what you feel when you do these things can not lose a lot of things. It exits from reality for a while. <br /> <br /> I saw a man in the movie (he has a black mosquito) after seeing his car crash, he watched about three quarters of the way. And she is looking for a woman she is following the station. This guy was the one of "Who's the St Michaels of the Will Hey Classic". Just thought that if I look at someone then :). <br /> <br /> The set pieces of the film are very atmospheric. The abandoned station looks good outside and there is no spirit for miles from any direction and away from the storm outside the station is very comfortable. I felt that I was living in movies with Caste. The atmosphere of this movie is something that is missing from many movies. It ultimately keeps you from the moment the movie starts. <br /> <br /> Today we need more of this type of movie. But sadly it is seen in the film with nudity and oath and illogical humor. This type of film-making era (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr. Porter, etc.) is the golden age of the film!
