Everything shown on TV was predicted before it was lost. You can predict who may die or find out, but you can predict something to lose. Every thing was so surprisingly stunning and it was not really a mystery because it was very secret but everything was so great that there was nothing like it before. I literally became addicted to it. LOST is a classic work in the industry. It gives something you wait for every week. It's talent The surrounding it is warm at the calm and warm beaches and the jungle is so awesome. Character genius is one of those especially those who already work on the island talent. Castaways are so dramatic yet we can not predict their death because they have to do a lot of things and much more have to say and their secret mystery which is affecting other castaways that have died with them.
