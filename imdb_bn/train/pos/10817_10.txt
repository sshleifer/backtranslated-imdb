Well, this movie I've probably seen the most fun scary movies. The effects are so bad that you just have to laugh and do not play well, it's a good gibbon. But Gary Browning thinks a policeman is very bad, he's good. I do not know how he himself made this movie 10. If you were bloody and funny at the same time in the terrible / slash movies, of course it must be seen. Killer movie
