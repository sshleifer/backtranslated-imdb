The Japanese cyber-punk movies did not really do anything for me, but most of what I saw was at least visually appealing and at least most entertaining. Matball machine is no exception. <br /> <br /> The story is about a parasitic species that monitors mankind, takes control of their bodies, creates their "nakroburgs" and lets them fight each other. The only purpose of eating each other - as a "game" for apparently parasitic enjoyment. The film is mainly a shy guy and surrounds the mall, who fall for one another, but whose love-relationships are both parasite infected and forced to fight with each other. It becomes the control of human vs. defeats. <br /> <br /> The Matball machine will always be compared with TETSUO (mostly for cyber-punk films), and for good reasons. Certainly there are some thematic parallel, though the movies are definitely different. Mastball machines are very fun, splattery moments and animals / class FX high-dots - TETSUO-meet-GWAR mix that is both broad and inventive. Depending on your taste for these types of movies, the Mattball machine may or may not be your thing. If you enjoy a hyper-kinetic cyber-punk film with a good dose of splatters - it's for you ... 7/10
