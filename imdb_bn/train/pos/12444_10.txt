The best Modest Blues movie I've seen so far It's like a good pilot for a TV series. I think it's a little bit "believable", such as Quintin Tarantino's magic, or something with a light touch. They've been caught in a big deal with Moddie's character, but I miss Wiley Garwin a bit. Even if I read many comedies and books from Peter Odnell, I'm not disappointed with this film, quite the opposite. This story about modesty and her childhood positively surprised. Since 1966, I have not kept my expectations so much because of bad films. So I could pass this movie a little bit. But if you like other stories about comics and modest blues, you must definitely see it! Can not wait for a follow-up ...
