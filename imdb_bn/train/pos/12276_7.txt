Is Alen's novel adaptable to adapt its novel environment to its initial goal? Of course yes. Billy was able to produce a surface-film, shallow film, where the basic elements of South American mentality are simply presented as side effects, resulting in total incidence. I can not believe that there was a whole production team that could not understand the book! Of course this film has technical quality and I think the actors did their best with what they have, but some are missing. And this was some of the most important part of this.
