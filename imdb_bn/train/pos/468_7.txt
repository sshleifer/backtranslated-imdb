Vladimir Navokov's literary talent is again brought to the screen and the Sanskrit world will take many notices. Director Cheney Addict's absent Chaplainsk study with Alexander's story kept him in check. Nastas is having a holiday in a marble column where hosts of chess championships are being hosted. He meets Alexander by picking up a queen piece of drop through his coat pockets. The next day the magnetic attraction was suggested by the proposal, the mother telegramed her husband. He came and asked Alexander that we got these fading in the past, Ala 'Godfather II, where we can see a young Alexander. She was taken under a school teacher wing and exploited her talent for making huge talent for 10 years. Alexander reached his peak, abandoned him but became a legend. The old teacher is trying to conquer the old rivalry of aggression, causing damage. An extreme chess game where the victory of world chess champion is a way of immortality, chess chess ticks, the end of match time ends the next day. On that day, Nassius married, intervened by old teacher and Alexander sent for nervous breaks. Nastassia, holding her stomach and looking at her love coat, found the technique of the match and followed the tracks. Unfortunately, the film departs from the Russian roots, but the backside behind it is beautiful, Alexander greatly plays his role. The director has underestimated his audience, we can rarely play and the sole indication of the defense of Luizen defense after the trading rules, separating your king with three legs and king, sacrificing the fortress for the companion. Nastassia is a great match, but its conclusion may feel more intensely, but perhaps more than that, the chemistry of the cheek was right. Luizen defense honors Nikokov nicely, the complexity of his work in the film can not be missed a world event.
