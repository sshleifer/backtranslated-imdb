The only reason I did this film is 8/10 stars, and not 10, because 1) Cynatara is terrible and 2) love interest in Kelly's character, (IMHO). Love Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, Little Boy The continuation of dance with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I have ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my personal and my favorite of my daughter. I am 28 years old and 4, so the character is less symbolic than Mikia, but still he is a favorite of many children and adults. Kelly is always thrifty, full of fun and tension in her eyes I have never seen him in every movie, he always stole shocking. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. It is not surprising that Palla Abdul created a "scandal" sample. I will list Gene Kelly as the most beautiful man in the 20th century. If you were to see only one part, Jerry does not miss Kelly dance with the mouse. You do not have to be frustrated.
