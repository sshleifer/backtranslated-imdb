When I saw this scary DVD box and the awesome Red Queen Micrine, then I felt I was up for great frustration, but I was surprised, surprisingly, I like it. Courses and unnecessary neglect that should be able to read only subtitles such a complex condemnation should reach points, take ridiculous interpretations alone. But this quilless, the film is a dream. Incredible outfits in wonderful settings and complete sequence accompanied by luxurious ladies in continuous accessories and an amazing Bruno Nicolai score. He could not be Morricone but this lighter piece could be so. Lots of color, lots of sexuality, some poor killings and at least with the intervention of police is really enjoyable. Super.
