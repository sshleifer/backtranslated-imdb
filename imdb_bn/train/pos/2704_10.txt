I was disappointed, if not surprised, the film's lack of gratitude. Again, Billy Zen has proved that she is more than a beautiful boy in a silent performance, which adds specialistic slopstick to different ways. It has a lot of music and sound because of calling a silent film. It is a manic speed and is full of full-fledged inventions that Ed Wood is finally starting to be appreciated for. Look at the cast list, and understand everyone shines. Nobody can show their face. I believe that they all are in films to show respect to woods and these days are not very much seen to play a broad, physical type. However, today's critics are trying to guess what they are a lot more than showing esthetic gratitude for a movie. And IWUETDID has no discernable target audience. It was made in love for most wooden scripts. Even after his death, the current social parasites have given him more serious injuries and deprived of a minor classics. This is a very entertaining and genuine experimental film that is at least affordable for DVDs.
