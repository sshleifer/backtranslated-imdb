City Hall takes the politics of a city instead of country, state or any major political table. This is a huge political field in New York City, especially nowadays, but it still remains small and keeps a microscope on the important city-wide scandal by the mayor's right hand man. Director Harold Baker is a director who was well-known about the thriller elements by raising Rising, Malis and Domestic trouble on Wednesday, and I think he has been involved in many formulary thriller genres, which vary widely. I mean, City is a political drama, not a thriller, but when everyone is said to be done and working and when it comes to film meat and potatoes, it seems like a thriller but it is very good. The important part of the recipe is that it immediately stand out ... what another ... or rather who else ... Al Pacino The movie starts with a good look at the life of the Mayor's office and the city's internal activities. As the film continues, it expands its political spectrum to include a democratic boss and its links, and then we are familiar with some steps in the city. As the shows unfold, a mystery begins and the political outlook is left in the background, but it is still a bright setup. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hate Al Paasino. That means if I do not give a good definition, how can I say it? People are playing royalties. Just have something bright about her whole demeanor. Mayor of City Hall Casino New York City plays the mayor. He has a sense of responsibility and respect and immediately appears in a very objectionable politician. He gave the most powerful and direct conversation talks ever seen in the 'James Hone' Funeral. I saw that lecture four times and for the first time I saw the passino, my mouth was open and I wanted to stand up and want to praise. His brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by Pacino. John Cusack, I really enjoy as an actor, performs medieval and extraordinary tasks like deputy mayor Kevin Calhoun. He is the focus of the film and he and Posino have a good chemistry together on the screen but there is something in this performance ... It seems that he is trying very hard. His pronunciation is just intertwined, and although he is supposed to be cruel and awesome he does not seem to pull it off. Maybe he had a close film. Bridgette Fonda, on the way out of his high point of stardom, the police is right as the widow Meribeth Kogan's attorney. Its performance is very similar to Cusack that he found his groove with this character. Danny Iillo is awesome, though her character is discovered as a democratic boss with the relationship with Mafia Franc Anselmou. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everybody ... OK. There are a lot of stories behind that they actually try to come out without showing it, and unfortunately it makes you a little confused about the whole conspiracy. And of course, you play Al Pacino rather a small supporter, but she is very bright and all the other actors in the movie outhines and overshadows. It seems like they are scared by having almost like them on the screen. So City Hall may be a huge political epic drama / thriller but it can cut and pull the average run of the mill, but it still has to show a different spin on casinos and politics. You can not see this movie because of the passive voice of James Hone's funeral, because the word power does not seem to give justice to the word, but you can make Al Pacino so incredible because in a medieval film he pulled this wall a speech and you felt it Makes up. If you are a cousin fan, I must do it well, but he is the main character and everything gets his justice. A decent movie but unfortunately possible damage. 7.5 / 10
