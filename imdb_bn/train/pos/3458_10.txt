Jack Cassidy Casting as Frankenstein was merely sheer brilliance. Cassidy personality boasts, confidence, charm and intelligence - all with a condescending, evil little Smith in her mouth. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is the best murderer in the Colombo series (three appearances). This special (and first) performance, my favorite Columbo episode ever - hands down A new face Steven Spielberg has done extraordinary cameras (yes, there were shadows in some of the actors) between Colombo and Franklin, and preserve the diversity and deafness of the curiosity. Also, the beautiful and tidy dresses of Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin's cabin house) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this episode yet, then you are not responsible for it - it's a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was very contagious. His death in 1976, was very sad and really very sad at the age of 49 - he must have had his best years before. Rest in peace Jack, you will live for eternity through your great work.
