Campi B film - These films do not make any provocative efforts to hide its genre. It will teach you to tell you at the beginning of the camp. It was supposed to give the meaning of the cheese adjective. But both of them came together in this movie that lets you go, "Hmmm ... it's so stupid!" And then you have to smile. For example, there is a view in "16th century Japan", which shows some of Samurai walking on the front of a temple. There are many tourists in the background of the temple, between Chilar and Shorts. Hmmm ... hahahah! I could not stop laughing And acting is good, bearable, my lord, but that makes it fun. You'll see some decent actors and then others will find really terrible. Although I've seen Stefanie SÃ¡nchez in a number of plays, and that's fantastic. The film was quite short though its air time was quite short. I saw Brian Yamasaki on several occasions during my visitor's islands and he was even better in the theater than this movie. However, it is a recreational movie, if you have nothing to do on a weekend evening.
