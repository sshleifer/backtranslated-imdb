Diagnosis killer is the only program that I see regularly on TV. Some of the main ways in which episodes are to do something like this make it so unlike today's episodes, where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone comes next. The brain's brain work is also unclear that you do not really know what you think, and if you think you do it then you are wrong. <br /> <br /> There is a diverse issue of Diagnosis Married, not only in the case but in the personal life of each of the characters. Racism and acceptance, everything from terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> Is it for old people? I am 4 !! I do not think I can still be classified as old. <br /> <br /> I want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons (not the NTSC) on DVD so that I can see them all. They seem to be doing it with many other programs of the same era so that they can haste soon!
