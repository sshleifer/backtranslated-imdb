Rookie started laughing at me from the end. Dennis Quaid plays the role of perfection. The little boy playing his son was fantastic. She remembers this is a father-son movie. Message is good. Follow your dream. Pursuit at pursuit as long as you try. The tension is obvious. I believe this movie is to be a classic.
