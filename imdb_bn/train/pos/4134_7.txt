Lawrence Olivier, Marel Obaron, Ralph Richardson and Binny Burns, based on a play, played the 1938 comedy "The Divorce of Lady X". Olivier, a young barrister, starred Everard Logan, who allowed Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when a festoon ball of London's festive ball is too frequent for guests to go home. The next day, a friend of Lord May (Richardson) announced that his wife (Barnes) had spent the night with another person at the same hotel and she wanted to divorce him. Believe in the woman Oberon, the Olivean Panics. O'Brien, who is the sole and granddaughter of a judge, she is actually Lady Lesley Steele's lady. <br /> <br /> We saw this plot or a few dozen times. With this cast, it's lovely. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier O'Brien, the great team of Wathering Heights? Very special Olivier portrays the devastating handsome and humorous, nervous barrister as he does a great job with the comedy. Oberon gives the right light touch to its role. She looks extremely young here, full of mouth, with a very different hairdo for her eyebrow Gene Hurley and for her. She wears some beautiful street clothes, although her first gown looks like a birthday cake, and she tries in a gown, she is ready to play Snow White with hair. Benny Burns is as delightful as the original Lady Murray. <br /> <br /> Its color is a mess and others, as it has been mentioned, can really use the recovery. The price is definitely worth seeing.
