I always knew An Deslove was a great actor, now I know he is a great writer / director too. I was a fan that I first saw him in the film "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memorial". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> something She has been missing from the screen for too long. Clitis Lichmann is very surprising to see anything other than a seat-less. This is his best work from "The Last Picture Show". If you're grown up in an Italian American family, then you would love this movie. I do not expect much to start watching this movie, so when I fell in love with this movie, I was surprised by the surprise. If you get the chance, see it.
