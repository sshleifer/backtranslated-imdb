So far this has been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that I've ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldwarthy is such a person who after the extinction He saw the world and nature with such praise and reverence that it is primarily in a good sense. His purity, honesty and kindness clearly breathes him, when you work so easily, he is full of momentary pieces of life in the industry. I was surprised to wonder how much he had created with his patience, and how much patience he had received the last of them. Sometimes prematurely, but her Scottish sense of humor brilliantly covers her frustration. The image is beautifully blown and the same flow of art in the Goldwhite industry. As it is itself, it combines nature and art in a minimal way. Fred Freath's score is organic enough that it mixes everything together without interference of nature. This is a great piece of work in every aspect overall. Age does not have any boundaries.
