I generally like ghost stories, but I especially love the stories of the Chilean, atmospheric and beautifully brilliant British period-style ghosts. Qualification of all these calculations. An intelligent young lawyer (Britspeak's "solicitor") is sent to a small village near the sea to fix the property of an old, dead woman. It was in the 1920's, when "middle-class" Bright vacation's "beach for health" went on. Well, guess, there's nothing "healthy" about Christine Gifford's village, the scary sites of Hawking's old woman, Victorian estate lying under the fog-goldly saline saline. When a lawyer can save a little girl (none of the locals will help the endangered totie - why you will find out later in the photo), then she is unknowingly angry with an uncivilized spirit, black woman. He wraith no fame, Gauss, but a tough black silhouette of dirty and evil. The viewer simply sees him a few times, but you feel his rogue stand of each frame. While reading through legal papers, the camera shakes the lawyer, you can see black woman at any time. When the generator sets out the generator to turn the electricity into electricity, the camera keeps a snake on it and it seems that it will pop there. Waiting for women to look black is suspicious in the fingertips. We have seen so many elements of this story (the locked room does not enter anyone, fog, innocent outsiders who ignore the warning of the locals) but the directors are no different from their completely new novelists and compelling ghost stories. See it with a friend so that someone can catch up when you wait for black woman to catch up. . .
