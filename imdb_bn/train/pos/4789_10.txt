The film David Lins (1999) of John Roche / Mary Swine's story is well ahead of the film's last leisure time in Iowa and Wisconsin. <br /> <br /> We came to the life of Elvin Strait (Richard Farnsworth) in life. Her medical condition is bad, her life is mostly behind her and she knows it. <br /> <br /> She makes it more extraordinary and respectful. He decided (and revised his own name through his actions every time in the movie) to keep things straight. <br /> <br /> <br /> Elvin means this great experience in his life, but modest. Her daughter Rose (CC Spaces) struggles with a speech conflict that makes a great effort to communicate on behalf of the audience. But this is valuable, because the story of Rose can not help but can emerge as a movie progress. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a journey. But like all the journey, it is a journey in geography and human sense. At the beginning of the film, we realize that this is an ambitious journey, that an elderly gentleman of Alvin's age should not be taken properly. <br /> <br /> But we slowly learned how much Alvin has had that he is equipped to achieve his unlikely purpose. Its purpose is very simple and straightforward. His brother is sick and may die and he wants to see him. He had a fall with him many years ago and they have not spoken for a long time. <br /> <br /> Along with the way, Alvin met many people. The way he treats them and the benefits they get to inform him are the main points of this film. We know Elvin is straight, what does Alvin straighten? And at the end of the film, we know who we are .. well.
