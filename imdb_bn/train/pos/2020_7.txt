<br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw an advertisement for it in a video. Then my sister learned that we have books so I read it. I broke that book when I finished the book. I thought the book was very memorable. Cast was excellent. Harrison and Rupert Graves were abhorrent as Arthur. Matt Fitzgerald was excellent. Costume, music and settings are nicely beautiful. <br /> <br /> WARNING! If you wanted to read more this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Below are some sexual scenes that have been added and some violence. That's why the video has been rated 15. Here are some other things that have been cast. In the first part, I felt I went downhill for accuracy. Although the book is even better, I have seen that I saw it and will rebuild it for people reading the book, Bronto fans or costume plays (I'm all 3!) Until you get a quick look through sex The book is also involved. The books of Anne Brontas are not widely read or known as Jane Erie or Worthington Heights, which have been created several times in television and movies. Another thing. When I read the book, I was amazed at how much religion was there, but they all went on top! <br /> <br /> 7 \ 10
