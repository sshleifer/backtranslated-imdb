Bug life is a good film. But to me, it does not really compare to films like Toy Story and Stuff. Do not make me wrong, I liked this movie, but it was not as good as a story story. The film has visual sight, smile, and other stories. But the film could not feel fairly ... I do not know, but I think it's still a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> A bug's life ... I do not want to say it, a movie I do not remember. I saw it years ago. Of course, I have not seen Toy Story for a few years, but I still have to remember. I was not supposed to review this image, but I I'm giving it a thumbs up though it just does not work best in Pixar. <br /> <br /> Life of a bug: *** / ****
