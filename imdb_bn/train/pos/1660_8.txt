I am a fan of art, I like something about art, I like painting, sculpture etc. This picture shows it, so I like it, it shows how a woman wants to draw some about art, especially the nude companies, but she can not do it because of her strict family (father), she starts her own movie and she is nude herself , But he wanted a man for his paintings, but his family did not let him draw naked men because it was against moral. Even Artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. He fell in love with his art teacher, and it seems that the industrial teacher loved him very much, so at the end he sacrificed his freedom for him to lie. She said she raped her, but it was not true. Artemisia fell in love with her, but if she says that she would suffer so much, because her father and art teacher Artemisia were at trimail, someone was shaking her artistic hand to tell the truth. I think it's a great film about ART and an artistic love, it's valuable. Valentina Survi is great as Artemisia, she works very well, I like her acting as "a lady's portrait" as Pansy Omsmond. 8.5 / 10
