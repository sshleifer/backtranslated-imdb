E = <br /> <br /> I have never owned the Nintendo 64 but I have played so many times. In my opinion, one of the best video games for the Super Mario 64 Nintendo 64 system with Conquerors Bad Fur Day. I've done this game many times and it's good every time. If you have an N64 and do not have this game then you should try to find it out. The original Super Mario Bros games were video games as well as Video Scrolling, but Super Mario 64 is a 3D Mario in a beautiful 3D environment. This game is weird but you can do a lot of things here. You play as Super Mario and once again you will have to get 120 Power Star from Princess and Borja. Now you can do this in the 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very funny and well-played N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
