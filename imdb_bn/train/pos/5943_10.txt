This film is really cool. Humor shows everything like coming out of the book. Set, dress, and plot are great. Clark Bartram is again our favorite Batman. She looked a little better at the end of the dead, but she still pulled it off. Superman is very great Flying effect is OK. But it is a fan-film so that we do not expect them to be the greatest. The shot with the car grabler was very credible. It was cool. This is a movie which I would definitely like to see if it was real. You've got what you want in a Batman / Superman movie. One exception, though, I'll throw the joker instead of 2 faces. Overall, I'll give this image 10 because it's a great movie.
