This movie was amazing, it's a movie where you see it and by the actor's director / writer, you see it instead of looking at other movies in other movies. Sandler did a great job of working out a character outside his comfort zone and always did a great job at Cheadle. This movie is great for a mature intelligent audience. Acting was extraordinary and could only be overcome by film writing and guidance. This film does not focus on genuine Americans, past generations, no rituals or racism, who have come together and realized the true meaning of life. This picture is about damage and coping. Instead of choosing psychodynamics, it defines you, who will cure you wizardly, rather you will not judge you by the need to talk about your feelings to a neutral person who can believe, rather guide you on your thoughts. This movie is surprisingly all round!
