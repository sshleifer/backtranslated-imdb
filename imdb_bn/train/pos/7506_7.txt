I'm not going to be there Although interesting, I saw the infamous page of the page because I heard it (and it was only a summary or something about the movie, it was quite obvious), that Gretchen Mull became nude. I'm never a fan of Mole, but I can not resist an attractive woman to take off her clothes. Yes, it can be distorted, but it is a theme of the main part of the movie and the ideal center and it helps to make the movie more powerful. <br /> <br /> Image from Betty Page (Mol) from her physical and sexual abuse day as a child in high school and new life in New York. She wants to be an actress, but she must pay the bill. After taking some seemingly innocent silly shots in the local beach, the page gradually becomes a modeling sensation and moves from fast moving photos to sexually stimulating pin-up photos. <br /> <br /> I feel the concise of the film (for only ninety minutes) for both curse and blessing. On one hand, the movie never welcomes. You can find the page within a few minutes, and then it becomes correct in its modeling career and does not come back. But it also curses the film because we have not had the chance to realize what is happening. He made before modeling shoots and controversy that was created before the main senate investigation jumped to the right, which made the film's final work much more. You just sit there, and try to absorb it all, and more exactly comes to you. The filmmakers think like a film very small wanted to summarize too much material. It begs for longer order, and begs more for even more explanation. It does not seem to run; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The majority of black and white, but often, the sequence of splashes and colors emerge. But it may be done initially as a symbolic gesture, it becomes a jerk because it constantly pops back before black and white back. It became confusing and became more and more annoying interference from anything else like the movie. <br /> <br /> It may be slightly confused with the actions, but the film dies with its themes. The page, about that I do not know anything, is played harmlessly, and its world is exactly the same. Save her for some characters in her teenage years, she is innocent of anyone she encounters, and this is an innocence for what she has done. I never thought that I would look at the entire naked nudity, which was something other than that which was indecent and obscene, but here, it's really a wonderful thing. At all, it is beautiful and innocent. Even the most sexually transmitted moments in the film (though compared with today's standards) have innocence and angel feelings to them. Molle's nude body image is something else that can be portrayed on a different character than other nude bodies in other movies. It is very normal and therefore surprising that if you have a reason to watch the film, then playing Beti page will see spectacular imagery of the mole body. <br /> <br /> Another reason is Mol himself. As the page, for example, in the southern half of 1950, everyone knows (or at least can imagine). Despite his job, he is still a normal person, and still looks as religious as himself. In the 1950s, to accurately implement this character, MOL correctly plays the right amount of squaki-cleanliness. He plays with events that you do not really believe in yourself that Mole was actually the Betty page. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are very little moments in the supporter cast light, and overshadowed by Mol's wonderful performance. None of them do anything particularly fun, and none of them holds the same power in the role of moles. This is not the fault of the actors, but there is not much to do with them. Many of them are fully recognized, such as Oscar-nominated David Strathreen (his role is very close to a few very good performances), Sarah Palson (nominated for the Golden Globe for Studio 60 at Sunset Strip) and character actor Lily Taylor, but you're just right Having set up their performance will be difficult to set. None of these characters are really well developed, and they are really standing as a character cut-out who moles roam around to perform tasks around it. <br /> <br /> This picture is perfect nudity for her photo, and for the excellent performance of Gretchen Mol's Betty Page. Everything else is a bit too muddled and weird than it should be. Supporting letters were done more for the development and without further exploding the story, this film was a better biography image. It stands, it's a car to emerge in the stratosphere popularly popular as an actress. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
