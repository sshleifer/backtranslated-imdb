This movie was 15 years old on television premiere. Being raised in Texas, I realized the annoyance and boredom of the teenage life there. This movie touches the heart of my emotional teenager and I have remembered it for the last 12 years. I recently got to see it thanks to the love channel of the second, third and fourth times. I'm still crying because the film reaches and touches my inner confused teen.
