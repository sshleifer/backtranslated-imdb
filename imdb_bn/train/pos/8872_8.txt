This is the first movie I saw John Singleton and he is a beautiful director. The film starts with a bunch of incoming fresheners and it shows what some of them are happening. Omar Epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and has hard times to keep up with his work. He is a friend with Ice Dense and Tyra Bank dating people. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is raped with birthdays and is not sure about Jennifer Conley, who is a lesbian, and on the way to go. Michael Rapaport is a child of Idaho who has studied with a group of Neo-Nazis and their leader, Col Hauser Those three main characters and Lawrence Fishburn are a political science professor who tried to help them. This is a great movie and it is unfortunate that the studio had to do several cuts in the film.
