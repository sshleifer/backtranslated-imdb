This is one of the best Bollywood cinema I have seen so far. Family and friends think the same way about it. This movie is romantic and dramatic at the same time. My opinion needs more movies or movies to maintain our South Asian culture. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao have played this role, their couple attracted many people in the movies. It will watch a movie, it's a family and romantic movie. This film is also from the makers of Hai Kya and Hum Apah with Huff. This movie is now their best ... The film setting was beautiful which is a huge attraction. This movie must be seen ... recommendation for everyone !!
