Obviously it is not sure whether it will play in Pyoriy, but it's a very fun, cute British comedy. It is set at the end of the "swing sixties". The impressive, forty-some serial female makers, as rich as Peter Seller. Goldie Haun, a fully enjoyable blonde actress in London, is a 19-year-old American girl, primarily "catching the day" of cellars. But the rowdy TV food critic may not fall for the wonderful American blonde herself. <br /> <br /> Strong performance from humor, path, great script, leadership and supporting nation. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, and the very best gag is the very last line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you like it.
