Govinda Nihalani comes with a minimal approach to the instructions and instructions of the story, along with Om Puri, Smita Patil, and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and full chemistry. Vijay Tendulkar's dialogue is also great. <br /> <br /> I did not see another movie like this. It is a complete, each piece so nicely to fit the plot. You can not be influenced by this movie. <br /> <br /> Amiri Puri Sasi came as a 'Father' of husband and Om Puri. Om Puri is regarded as a youth in his own duties of responsibility and inability to fight against the system. As Ram Sethi, Sadasiv gave his hilarious and soft speech villain about the right touch of the film. Anand Bhalenkar's first meeting with Ram Sethi in place of Whiteshiv is incredibly stunning. Smith does not play a key role, but his part does not get distracted from the original plot. <br /> <br /> And all the Kafi Imamdars play the role of a policeman to add it, who has been involved in the system and its activities. Find out the right things in the right place and how to keep yourself away from trouble. He is the 'guru' of Om Puri and whenever he gets into trouble, he helps him. <br /> <br /> This movie does not come only to the problems that try to perform the duty of a police officer, the other with police custody as well as atrocities! Om Puri will show frustration and burning desire to get rid of this extraordinary performance of half truth. <br /> <br /> A treat with all the bright fans of Indian cinema.
