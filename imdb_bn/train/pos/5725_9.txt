Before that I wrote to some friends: <br /> <br /> Holly Crap, The Gray, Honorable Eid, I've never seen a great movie! I am very soft at my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures have a kick ** **! (Can not wait for Boogeyman) <br /> <br /> I was very afraid of sitting in the dark theater and someone sitting next to me wanted to sit beside me. (Except for the heroine of the movie I. I.) By the oath, I was not expected that much jump was in the scene! I felt stupid but did not care for my nervous! I was on the edge of the whole movie from the initial credit, and the music was fantastically scary. I remember the word, though I do not like it! <br /> <br /> I really cried a few times loudly, oh! Oh, yes, I even covered my eyes even a few times! The intelligent word, though: I think some scenes are a little psychological. My DHHit event Horizon and anyone who wrote it sick and psycho, but I can not compare the movie so I do not think so. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I enjoyed this movie "I was scared, but it was very good and scary, last scene, too ... wow! For a 32-year-old mom, I I think I can have nightmares from this film, especially due to that word, please leave me out;) <br /> <br /> In summary, I grew up (like Jason, Freddy), it's not a slash flick. This is mostly non-existent Prompt Movie. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> There were two great trailer Boogeyman and Ring 2 for this movie !!
