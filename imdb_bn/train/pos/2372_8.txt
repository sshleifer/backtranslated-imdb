I saw this by bringing my mother back from America, I was afraid to see it after all the negative comments here, but to say, yes, Chasey acting, some effects are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But you must remember that until 1898, 2005, and for such a low budget I think it was good. I enjoyed this version a lot, last week I saw the Spielberg version. <br /> <br /> I have read the book many times, and have almost always found myself in the book "Book of books". No other part of the book was available in other versions. <br /> <br /> Well done to create at least one true version.
