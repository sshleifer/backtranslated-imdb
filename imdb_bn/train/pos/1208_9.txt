Every child has a movie that does not have to do anything when she wins in VHS, or when there is a bbita. This picture was for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the whole plot, at least 100 times this, and I can say it is a good kids / family movie. <Br /> <br /> I still have the tape, I have not seen it for five years, but maybe I'll go around this week, and let me have a baby for the day. <br /> <br /> You just have to care beer, and love them messege. <br /> <br />
