Not only in Taekwondo but it is also a good Korean movie that can be good, like the cold war of war can not kill a tekkondo in his sport because there are rules, such as life and school, and this film is a concept. <br /> <br /> The film is not like martial arts but it is passable and enjoyable. The friends who are going to achieve something will once again become strong with the mind and heart of the mind. This image is not taken very seriously because it has a slopstick, but it also carries a message. <br/> <br/> Good movie from Korea again.
