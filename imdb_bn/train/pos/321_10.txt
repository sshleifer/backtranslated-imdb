I do not know how this movie has little ratings on IMDB. This photo is with "I am curious: blue". This is a masterwork. <br /> <br /> The only thing to reduce you to this movie is if you do not like the process of filming like psychology or if you are expecting ramming hardcore pornography. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you want to see; This is a movie that you would like to see with a nice composition, time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** The homosexuals may have a speaker or two ******* </ br> <br /> The main point of this movie is that it is a movie, Mixed, but it does this that sometimes you forget that the imaginations are not real. <br /> <br /> This image is like many movies: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary, about the social system in Sweden during the time. In many ways that still relevant today Interview by a young girl called Lane. <br /> <br /> 2. A filmmaker, a screenwriter of Vilgaz Sajman, about making a movie ... He is related to his relationship with the star in the film and how should he never get involved with the people who work with him. <br /> <br /> 3 The film that produces Vilgot. It is known as a young girl Lena (IE # 2), who is young and very politically active, she is making a document (IE # 1.). She is also of age and her sexuality and her independence. <br /> <br /> "I'm curious: The yellow / blue" magnificence and intense brightness cut these three elements together. At one point you see an interview about politics, and see the next interview that is doing behind the scenes, but you sometimes forget that it is descriptive. <br /> <br /> Another thing is dynamic between "yellow" and "blue", if you see, you must see the other. "Blue" is not a signal at all. I can do it because I can do it because it has made any other film for my knowledge, even though it is a great strategy. <br /> <br /> Think of "yellow" as a living thing, 14 original event scenes. A complete story <br /> <br /> <br /> Like all things, think that you did not see 14 scenes in "Yellow", it's own story <br /> <br /> They basically say parallel films ... the same story, in two different ways. <br /> <br /> I saw the first 30 minutes of "blue" until I fully understood "yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope it is helpful for people being discouraged in different ways, because this image I look at the movie. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your time.
