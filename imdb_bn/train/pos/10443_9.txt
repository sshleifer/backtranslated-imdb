Richard Lincoln's young romance and beautifully managed mix of Paris tour is one of the best thinkers of the 90's romantic films. Julie Daly has become one of Las Vegas's most attractive performances in a decade, who spent a day with the unknown-on-train of Aaron Huake. Conversation (and its ellipses) is sometimes scary and too precious, but the lady making two romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connections with two young wannabe lovers each other is full of wonderful, touching and insightful moments.
