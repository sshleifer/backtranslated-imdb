Joan Fontaine is the 1937 musical actor Fred Astyayer, George Burns, and Gracie Allen's "Dante A Daughter". What is this plot, America's love for an American woman (Fontaine), who is wrong for Aster, is a musical comedy star <br /> <br /> <br /> The film contains some wonderful music songs, including George Steven, "Excellent job you can get it" and "a dirty day". The best view is the "Steve Up Leap" number, which is in a fun room. <br /> <br /> This picture sounds more strongly for Astaire's song, and some of it's excellent dance numbers. Barnes acted as the secretary of its leading campaigner and Alan Barnes. He is sunny The problem, as others have mentioned, is Fontaine, who is dancing with Astyear at the end of the film. Steven can easily use a double because he looks dancing in a long shot, and it takes place in the tree. I thought it was not twice except dancing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
