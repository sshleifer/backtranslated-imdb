A complex story in the background of India's party. An honest Muslim who kidnaps an innocent Hindu girl and is an educated Hindu who can grow a Muslim - yet you still love both. The story is strong, but the screenplay and the flow are hesitant. Background music scores and songs outstanding. Later, Urmila Matondkar's memorable performance. Photography captures violence and taste very well during rural Punjab. Other actors do not work well, or do not get the chance to work. The directions are really the weakest link. Characters were not well developed. Contrary to "Earth", Christmas is not a Christmas, where a 5-line character also gives a mark. The end is very interesting. This story can be different differently - and all of them can be equally good.
