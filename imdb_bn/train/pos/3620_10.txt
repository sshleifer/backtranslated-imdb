I just saw this movie open tonight, opened. It was a lot better !! I was a big fan of sports movies, and it was just as one of my favorite. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, anyway, Mr. Kayad, if you read it ... my sister is at Austin, where you are ... and she once bought you a drink ... well ... she stood up the Kinda ... but That did not mean !: C) [Nobody is going to believe ...] However, this is a great movie. Those who like a good sports movie, everyone will go and see it! : C)
