This movie highlights many memories of the classic classic, where viewers did not have to stop their clothes to see their movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think the original plus point of this movie is amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrit, it's definitely a movie. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of comments about the film's sweet and very slushy in the film. In response, I think a certain degree is a correct analysis, but it is being considered that the Barratatya film has been significantly reduced compared to the MPK, HAHK, HSHH and MPKDH. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this picture you are laughing as well as exciting moments, wishing the newborn couple the greatest and hopefully No bad things happen to them. <br /> <br /> Another big plus point is Shaheed and Amrita. Both of them have performed very well, especially in Shahid films. Amita looks stunning easily and should be taken seriously as a major star in future. <br /> <br /> Although I really enjoyed the whole picture, I think it was too long. Some trimming has been done in the middle and it can probably be more of an impact. I also think that when you see the music, it fits in the film, but the movie can be advantageous if you have a little old fashion and more up to date soundtrack. Although the songs of Mujee Huq Hain and Hamari Shadi Minh are wonderful I would definitely suggest this movie, romantic, it looks great and a dramatic measure (I will not go into details, if you do not see it then <br /> <br /> PS. If you are trembling, take a tissue! (I need many more)
