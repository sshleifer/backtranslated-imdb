This film is a great example of telling fine stories. Acting fantastic The story is overly manifested without being manipulative or fake. There was a couple of points where they probably made people really better or worse, but considering it a Hollywood movie, they showed amazing restraint. There was no explosion shown in the movie, though they had a chance. When the film was a suspicious part, it did not turn into an action movie. The story is thus unfortunately focused on an extraordinary person during normal times. Savass!
