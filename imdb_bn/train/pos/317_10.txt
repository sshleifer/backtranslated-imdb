Telemundo must certainly think of DVD collection! I know many people including myself who want to be able to buy novella Xica! It is a very entertaining novela which is set in Brazil. The clothes worn by the actors are beautiful and the city where Noble is held is beautiful Xica has a lot of history of that duration. If I want to telemundo a 2 in the morning even if it televises again. If I have ever been shown again on Telemundo then I would recommend watching Xica. I've already emailed Telimundo a million times to show the Nobel but my application has fallen into deaf ears. The only cautionary statement about Xica is that it sometimes has some harsh scenes, so I would not recommend seeing children under the age of 14 to Xica. Overall Xica 10 out of 10!
