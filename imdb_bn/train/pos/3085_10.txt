I watched non-promoted episodes online and I was so sad that the show would not be back. It was the best, talented actor and best cast of a wonderful chemistry. Actual actors seem to be all actors in personal actors. The show towards the end became sexy, sexy and highly watchable. Of course, some story lines are not realistic, so ... Characters are all customizable and the routes for them. The program reminds me of a cross between two other favorites: "Sex and City" and "Flatity". All Cast Big Como ABC Execution Note: Nielsen Rating Report does not show you real results. The audience of the show will be mostly recorded. I am very disappointed with reality-TV or teen-based shows with major networks for our flood. Why would we need to switch to HBO or FX to get a mature, thoughtful, well-played element? I can only thank the network for keeping the rest of the episodes online. The new stream will gain more popularity among media viewers.
