I often imagined how many CASPERs were meant for children ... with all the things around his identity (in this film we believe he is the cause of the deceased child's soul, his house is a cemetery plot), as well as dangerous messages brought by this special film. Maybe the Casparas were meant more than morality, or famous studios felt like breaking new ground in 'reality' cartoons. <br /> <br /> Good bounce tonight is a well-animated project-no doubt about it. However, Fox (which becomes the friend of Kaspers, but meets with the tragic end) is a concern about the development of the involved plot. <br /> <br /> Give credit to famous studios - they honor the deaths with respect ... But, Stark Kaspers's grief image is rather graphic and annoying to children (although this modality offers a happy ending but I will not end it) , And for the quality of 1940, the violence is rather steep. <br /> <br /> It can be a good cartoon to help explain the death of parents' children - but I will not pop it in VCR for a perky cartoon break.
