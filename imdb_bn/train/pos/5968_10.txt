When you come across a jewel like a movie like this, you realize that there were great decades to live through the '80s. Rulers ruled the music, and so did the movies ... especially horror movies. The filmmaker knew how to entertain us, and the "trick or treat" thing is clear. When Raper Sammy Carter, who probably said. Was written after Washington. The singer, Blakey, died in a hotel fire, her # 1 fan ed, bored. He went to support friends and local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons). Nick gave him a copy of the last recording made by Sammy; This is the only copy available. It is offered live radio night at the radio station. When Eddie plays it, it will bring Sammy back in some way. He helped Eddie with bullies at school, but then goes out of control. It's definitely a great movie. The worst thing is, print out this movie. I finally paid $ 25.00 to get it off eBay. You should also ... $$ spend well!
