A few years ago, I received a copy of "Bagin Bin" of the film. In many ways, it is quite appropriate, when it was created in 1933, it is really a "poor rows" studio, a cheaply created movie created by Magic. Although the film is derivative, it is still well-deserved and offers some surprises. <br /> <br /> In some Germanic cities the story is very familiar, just because some people seem annoyed by the recent death vampire work! Diet fries added to this contact. He played Dracula's Ranfield, and he is very similar here, though he plays a lot more harmful. In this case, he is obsessed with his pet and people start blaming him for the death. The film does a good job of rendering some "red shower" (i.e., false lead) and does not accept a talent to find fries, but it can not be responsible, WHW and why is confusing and it is very different from average horror films. Also, when there was little meaning for the production, there were some good actors of its days - Lionel Atoll and Melvin Douglas - and it used Universal studio sets at night (when they were filmed for the day). As a result, the film looks fairly well, but I also think it was terrible that Faye Roy was terrible - it thought that it did not get attention from the film. I have seen more movies than most people in IMDB and I have noticed that there is no depth of his characters - he always acts as a "screaming lady" and gives a new look to each film. <br /> <br /> Overall, for fans of old horror films, it's nice and valuable. For people who are not fans of fans, it's probably quite skip-able.
