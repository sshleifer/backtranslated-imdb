When I was vacationing with my family in St Thomas in 1977, I saw this musical movie 5 years old and immediately fell in love with it. After 27 years, it is still a key motivation for achieving my goal that I have been able to accomplish from that time! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of a hard-core "behind the scenes" of the entertainment industry In the late 50's, "Sparkle" successfully portrayed three young sisters to find the sun's space. This story can easily be the biography of many young aspiring artists, which may seem very fast, and role models are not available to help. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary music is composed and composed. By Oritha Franklin and Curtis Muffield, the soundtrack carries the plot with every song. To face situations that do not leave any choice for long-term decision-making, for the final sacrifice to move forward, three little girls, Sparkle, sisters, and Delores represent various roads that anyone can take when you get your ideal opportunity to contribute to society Set out for. <br /> <br /> This movie is likely to create ideas for creating "Dreamgers" on Broadway and 25 years later Maria Kerr's "Glettter" ideas. As a member of the original audience of both productions, I would like to sing "Sparkle" and "Saturday Night Feather", "Fame," "FlashDance" and Off-Broadway Slash in both the episodes.
