Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves came back as two dots in San Dimas, who sent another trip to the future because the opposite seems to be the opposite in the way presented in the first film. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that their journey is "somewhere" between "heaven" and "hell" and both ends. When they meet with Grim Ripper, they get a chance to live up to the opportunity to play and to prevent two evil robots from destroying their future. As well as playing the role ... er ... perfect, they play some classic games (even the original copies of the battleship in the heel of my feet) (and sell extra sales in the process). <br /> <br /> Because I like this movie better than the original because it relates to "what can be" instead of "what was". Without spoiling the movie, I can not give you information about this (I guess you only see both of them and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10.
