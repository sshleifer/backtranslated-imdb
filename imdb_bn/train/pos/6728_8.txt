I stumbled upon this movie on her and had completely hooked up. The story of a group that explores the waves, waves which are huge, waves, a wave of rival who can flee from terror, is why the spectacular and directed people pursue their life behind the waves. There is nothing special about the film, it combines some other interesting people, they love what they do and talk about them. Of course they have surfing scenes, but what makes the movie so specially in the movie. Here people are so excited about what they are doing that they cross the people to see it. You want to go halfway in this movie and learn to surf. These documentaries have sometimes led to the empowerment of these people and the ability to think that their movies make us such a great movie. See it.
