This is the best comedy I ever seen! But to understand this amazing movie, Georgia will not understand this! :) I have ever seen the best movie ever .... Bhatangi (Benjamin) and all supporting actors have played very well, but my opinion is playing Quote Doosvili (Father Jurgeel), the best performance of my movie history :) Films include Epolight XVichia, Ségro Zakradez, Sophico Chiórile, Victorian Defifré, Sicilia Ticcivili, Dodo Aubisz, etc. Many Jordanian Playing with Darka .... they all are starring in Georgian cinematography) Plus this movie is going on with the great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course the director of the film Geori Daniela is one of the best .... I recommend this movie to everyone but remember that you must see this movie well Russian language should be spoken
