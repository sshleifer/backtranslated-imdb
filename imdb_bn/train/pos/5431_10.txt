I have seen this movie many times and every time I see it, I can not help but be entertained by it. One of the classic films of the Golden Years of Hollywood is the Ganges Dina, when the performers are attracted to the spectators based on the striking special effects and the people create "monsters" to convey a scene. The Onscreen Charisma and Comradere Sebbery, by Curciss Grant, Victor McLaggen and Douglas Fairbank Junior, and very entertaining to see. The tongue and the cheeks attitude that three actors play their role neutrally and flawlessly. Some may consider it "corny" but I consider it "classic" filming and its best acting. Europe was involved in a war with Europe, and must be remembered when watching this movie, and the audience had fled to the horrors of war and went to the movies to entertain the audience and took them to a place where people were bigger than life and did heroic deeds and good will always win over evil . The Ganges Dina completely fulfills it with the audience and laughing with the actors during their respectful escape. In short, this is a classic film that does not take very seriously, and the audience does not want it too.
