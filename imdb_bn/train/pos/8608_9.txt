It was a great movie with a good cast, everyone hit the cylinders. And when Dianne Keaton is her good, well, it's just not something better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always underrated, was even better. She will be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is on one side of the script. No character ever acknowledged that the dead girl was not always good man. And did not play Mao Keon. At one stage, he broke a promise that he did not reveal a character that he was sleeping. <br /> <br /> Among the other commentators was a "political agenda". It's a boring thing to say. There was no politics in this movie.
