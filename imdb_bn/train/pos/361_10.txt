Like I'm upwards, four stars are not just enough. This is one of the best movies ever seen in almost 17 years of my life. For those who really do not like it or do not understand, you must not have real realization for the industry or you may have a short notice time. <br /> <br /> Even if I do not see all his films yet, I want to say that Spieberg is at his peak. Great movies do not come often as "The Color Purple" because it is very sad to me that I think there is a great need of entertaining first-class class pictures in this difficult time. <br /> <br> Such movies are more than just movies; They are pieces of art that would appreciate more. <br /> <br /> This concept was nominated for 11 Oscars (even the best picture of the year) and a sign that was not received in a trophy could be a blind and stupid Hollywood. Spielberg has not even nominated for the best director! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
