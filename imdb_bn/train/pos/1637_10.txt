I love this movie and have seen it several times over the years. It gets better with every visit. I agree here with all of the positive reviews. Yes, in those days the life of a young man was, because it was great and ruthlessly realistic. I saw myself as I commented myself. Someone here said that Rip Torn was wrong. I can not disagree more. He is gentle, sadly brilliant like Clyde Stewart, who says little and works like slaves / workshops. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as widow Elinor, whose clay is a home owner / cooked (along with her 7 old daughters) rentals. Lilia Skal is excellent as a remote neighbor known as grandmother. Also star is a star Montana prairie. It is fair and brutal which is settled in both countries. Both have both adverse and necessary scenarios. No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a nicely perfect music score and a great script. Once you see the heartland, you do not forget it. It deserves all 10s it gets here.
