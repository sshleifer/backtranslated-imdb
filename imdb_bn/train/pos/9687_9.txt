A talking parrot is not a very fantasy idea for a new movie, but it makes a common concept among the polysy, heartwarming film that will make the whole family happy. During the separation of Mary and Polly, the gap bridge between sensual action and cruel hardness, and all the events in the film are a very satisfactory emotional conclusion. Animal training is done well - for the first time in Polly spreading its wings and spreading flies, everyone will be affected. Polly should have had a great character and more success, although this film was not a brightness in 1998, it was like saving private Ryan. This one and a half hour is surely an enjoyable one and one which you remember. Polly's story is moving, sad, happy and interesting - from the moment she got integrated into her first time with her real owner, after that you will enjoy her and learn about her friendships and true facts about living. The way. If your heart or emotions are not the kind of missed one. 9/10
