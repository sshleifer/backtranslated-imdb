This movie is very good to be played by Cast, a cool ending, a secret story with great music and extraordinary visuals without an important special effect. Although it is very interesting for advertising, as well as future futures like science fiction do not seem to be portrayed as soon as possible. We are not talking outside of wood, but in 2022 it is now very soon seen. It failed with a fairly prominent list of science fiction classics: "1984", "2001: A Space ODC" (Compare her space station with our International Space Station) and Isaac Aatimov's "I Robot" (positive brain was invented) in the 1990s ).
