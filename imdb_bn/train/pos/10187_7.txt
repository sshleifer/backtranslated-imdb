Well, I'll be honest: it does not really hurt. But you can not get a Sholay every week. Actually, you can see the unique signature of "No My Girl" (Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, as most "inspired" films go, so it is a well-inspired, well managed and well-done. The nan bettor, naturally, continues to cross his cruelty, but all others are pretty. Especially about the navy navy: I saw him after a while, but he has not lost any grace. Actually, he did a lot better when I saw him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
