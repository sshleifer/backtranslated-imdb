I love this freakin movie! Walsh is a true master of cinematic form, his picture has sometimes been my opinion, Ignored. But this movie is my favorite because it actually gives you the sense of setting the movie. <br /> <br /> All the miracles that existed, the way of life, the type of dress, the way they said, okay they can be exaggerated, but it is good to know that there were times when two men walked with each other with an insane stunt Tried. <br /> <br /> I think history should be very different from many people and hate for the truth. <br /> <br /> Can I get it somewhere in the DVD? I only saw it on TV. But for the time being, it would be perfect for a place like living a place.
