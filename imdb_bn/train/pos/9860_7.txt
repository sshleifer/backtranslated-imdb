There was no part of this movie that was quite ridiculous, mostly just average fun units, but it was not a part that was really bad. The worst part was the voice of Sid. His sloth slurry was just too much for me. In about 5 minutes I was sick to talk to him. The movie was good as well as the boring silent voice. There were many side jokes that you could catch them if you made the movie even better. This is a good movie for kids. Adult content for the children's entertainment and enough to keep it enough. If you have kids and want to see a movie with them then this one is certainly worth renting.
