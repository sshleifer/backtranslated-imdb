Comments Many people hit me (sorry) missing the point. Cadan wants to present life, simply, general life. Common structural stories, where there are insights of letters that change their life and then fade, upload music and the film ends, they are absorbed in such a large canvas. There are only several such characters in this movie, and then they proceed. Sometimes they may retain their insight, sometimes they can not, and the way life is really. In other words, CASA Astronomy lives in search of the traditional dramatic framework? There is no happy ending, only a lasting end; And before that everything is still under process, is still always for grabs ?? And, if you absolutely insist on a theme, explore a miracle role in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, start life, for a start. Then add all random events and cross-links that have a life, or a multi-coordinated life and have miracles by your bucketful. Instead of emphasizing on this theme, Cassandra lightly underscores and manages it in different ways, which, in the center of the machine, are both Mac and his wife lying on the bed, dreaming about each and every dream, but in the film, how the reality of that dream There is, in the film itself, to shape the reality May This is not a movie with a simple or obvious message. You should just let it play in front of it, and then let it sit for a few days, a few months, a few years, and see what it did. It is without any doubt, Kashmir's best film, her most mature, her most humane Among the most gifted writers and managers is a major meditation on life. The tragedy, of course, has not been allowed to work for several years, mostly because of the "Dreamcatcher" studio limitations. Hope we did not hear the last word from Larry Cassan. A great movie from a great artist. Remember that the industry will not have to completely rationalize itself completely.
