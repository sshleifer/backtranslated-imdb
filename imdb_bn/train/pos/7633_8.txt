Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics do not hesitate to admit how much I love this film due to the reading of external reviews, although I have a dub-in-Japanese video version of it. Apparently, many critics believe that it would take a profit as it used to be used in the context of the story, it is the most famous "It's a Wonderful Life". To me, this is a great compound, how often it is used is not a great court, and I would be happy to see more films using this special premises - unhappy people who get a chance to get a new perspective on their life. <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> I said, - I go to the movies to throw myself among them and where they let me take it. <br /> <br /> If you feel like me, you will be rewarded with seeing this image. Performance is excellent across the nice, and the movies are very well cast. Wonderful choice of songs, too. Michael Caine is as handsome as sympathetic bartender. Jim Belushi who works great as a "average Joe" type guy is not surprising that his life should not be as it should be. Linda Hamilton, always nice, as the loving loving wife again right here. John Lovitz entertained as usual, and even "Mr Destiny." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "a wonderful life", but who has said to remain? Take on your position, "Mr. Destiny" is an enjoyable, disciplined, fun and moving movie. I've seen my Japanese-dubbed video countless times, and I'm sure I'll see it several more times. Since anyway be an "orange," so be it! <br/> <br /> <br /> I think I should have the courage to believe and give nine or ten stars film, so I'm glad I did not read any reviews of "Mr. Destiny". But I suspect myself after reading all the critical reviews but can not help!
