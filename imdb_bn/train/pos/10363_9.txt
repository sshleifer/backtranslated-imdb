The following spoilers: When I came out first to know nothing about this event "Selection of Evil Angels" book. Before starting to ask about Chamberlain's crime, I was far away to give a break to the press and the Austrianians here. The authors clearly wanted the reader to understand why the crowd leaned towards their decision. John Brianson was presented just as jury (and presented by the press), as well as vertebrate spray, accton (??) plates, Dr. James Cameron confirming that the collar was cut with scissors, a child still completing the buttons from his buttons , Bloody hand print etc. could not be fully accepted. In the end, it was not clear to me that they were experts in their field who were giving false evidence and falsehood was completely wrong. This was a very technical proof, a person is hard to understand for understanding. At this time, beyond the evidence behind the trial, some never heard of Dingo to attack people; People did not believe it was possible. The public was suspected of seven-day firearms, whose origins were considered to be religious and contributed to blame for all types of wild crimes. It was not for dedicated, vain lawyers that worked relentlessly to investigate and protest the testimony, afterwards finding out the clothes of Azeri would not have been enough to get out of prison. This book has pushed me for this reason, and since I was reluctant to decide on the crime of any person (of course without ojas). I'm not going to be making a movie about that movie was thrilling and it does not seem to be good at it. I always liked Sam, I could fully identify, and Merrill was always perfect. Beautiful photography, hunting music I think it's not very good, but a very important movie. Not too much publicized when it is published.
