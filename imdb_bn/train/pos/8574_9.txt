Great fun for both adults and children, this film works at many levels: There are some very good (yet fine) jokes for adults with facial crashes and cakes. <br /> <br /> Glenn Off Krubella (`Call Me Me ') as the best of the best best. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pavlov's treatment in the clinic three years later he was cured of his lung cancer ?? Even the puppy-skin fur he wanted so intensely. He also kept his fur coats in the residence of his grand palace. <br /> <br /> But will not it? Some will change their behavior changes. And now he needs an extra puppy (hence 102 dalmatian) to complete his unexpected project in this extra round. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was a Titanic and last year's television version (as Pip) 'Great Exposition 'I did not recognize him; Well, he was the fifth officer of 'Titanic', and I did not see 'Great Expectations' so I'm not very surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is a delightful turn as far as Furfur. Cruella's. Has she ever seen the most extrovert and friction prancing prances and coatings in the clothing ?? And it's good. His 'West Witch of the West' tribute <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Team Hackney is fantastic, is Cruelber's helpless hell? He was also known by Alonzo, 'Cruveller Butler, 101 Dalmatians' and 'Black Adher' Brit-Cams. He is acting with his usual leftist, good hearty, some influential character with great effect. <br /> <br /> Oscars for clothing are usually given for the cost of a movie. Why wearing glen close clothes is amazing? It is incredibly detailed (note in his handbag when he is being given the amelioration of his behavior in the clinic) and is worthy of such a prominent character. Her clothing alone deserves an Oscar nomination alone. <br /> <br /> animation is a special place in my heart ?? But compared to the original animated film of this film, Apple is comparatively comparable to the Aurangunta: it can not be done. Do not say that '102 Dalmatians' is better than the '101 Dalmatian' version released in 1996. There are so many things to look at: Casting from sight, conversations and customs - it's a good film for the whole family.
