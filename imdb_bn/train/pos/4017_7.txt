This is a very memorable Spaghetti Western. This is a great story, interesting characters, and some very well played, especially Rosalba Neri. This role as evil villains in this movie is really classic. He stole all the scenes that he stole and expressed so much with his face and eyes, even when he was not speaking. Its performance is very credible. Apart from being at the top, he became quite funny (there is no mistake at the top of the top). Mark Dammon is surprisingly good in this movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> There is a couple of parts that are very funny. I especially like that part of the dresses in front of Rosalba Neri Porter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, the first is about 25 minutes in the film, which is a rare bar room. It's one of the most ridiculous looking fights I've ever seen in a movie. This is very weak choreography, and shows more like a dance number than a real musical than a real war. It might be able to ignore it if it was a tense heel / bad spencer comedy, but it is a more serious western, and brawl really needs to be more realistic. Another thing to annoy me about this movie was the Umar Coward Mexican Sidekick. I think he was supposed to be Comic Relief or something, but the character was just plain fool and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he was not all funny. Where can you tell me when you need him? As I have said, I assure you all that Johnny Uma is a spaghetti Western mentioned, despite all I have mentioned, and all fans of this genre will see this movie.
