An amazingly good movie! It has a lot of good jokes through the whole movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to the guest to show how the two main characters are stupid. We get it, stupid blondes, get it with it! <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is rarely known as "corn". And the boobies are not always playing very well with the card that is altho cinema plus for a weird reason, even in the plot line two black-haired women who represent our role as part of the bad count of two blondes. <br /> <br /> So all, to watch a good movie. I gave about 8/10, but not crazy.
