France-Belgium-Luxembourg does not know Largo Winch in the Tri (three countries where French "BD" or "Bands Dessin" is widely published)? After 18 years of publication of the first comic book, which itself consists of a series of novels, it will adapt to curtains. For the first time - and failing with a TV show, the real thing starts. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>} Some essential parts, missing the main character and the action. The series of movies itself offers an alternative and more modern version. As a first-class fan of comic book, I must admit that I was amazing. Actors are good, so scenario, although it may seem too fast. In this way I recommend this movie to everyone interested in financial / political thrillers, but this is not an alternative to James Bond or Jason Bourne series which I can read on the Internet.
