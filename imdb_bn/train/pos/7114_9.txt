Of course, Marin would be proud of the best five gorgeous films of the best. This is a true story of Marin Private Al-Schmid, which spends its eyes, when the storm of Japan storms in Guadalcan. <br /> <br /> The story is divided into three parts, the life of Al Shamid's home where he is working smoothly, who is only serious with a woman and who does not like something good on his bowling night. Pearl Harbor has carried out bomb attacks and millions of others have gone to war. <br /> <br /> The second part is located in Guadalcanal and we can see part of this action where he is in a separate machine gun house, retaining Japanese soldiers. <br /> <br /> The third part is its painful combination of citizen life and assures itself that people are not just cared about, their activities prevent them from crossing marine positions. He was out of sorrow, all the girls she was seeing by Allan Parker <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo was written by John Garfield's 95th birthday on TCM- And was a documentary at the Girlfield Girl's Hostfield. It has been found in interview that Garfield was an actress who played the role of the working class in holding and holding Union cards is most credible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although he received the typist in gangster roles in the studio tradition, Garfield was terrible because of his background, because he was from El Shamid's life. Garfield left the Jewish background. <br /> <br /> In this case, he was perfect to play the part of a hero of a working class like Al-Shamid who took charge of protecting his country. There is no super heroism here, just one person who returned to Philadelphia, but was going to work. <br /> <br /> This is a great part of Garfield. It should not miss a film. I wondered whatever the real al-Schmid did.
