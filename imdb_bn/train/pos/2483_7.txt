I still do not really expect that when I was expecting to enjoy this movie, I still have to learn Shakespeare in school age, and often have learned about four years (which has been very well written by any writer, no matter what); I think it will be a common English text film: Bad acting, horror shot, badly edited and horrible horror old dialogue, so you can say, I was ready to go anywhere, to go to a coma. However, I saw and, a lot of my trouble, I just found not to pay attention, but actually enjoyed the movie too. Hamlet's production is probably one of the best dramas I've ever seen - and it really comes with the hope of my life which seems to be like Shakespeare's plays (well, with the difference of this film) my English teacher might probably probably harking over the text . The story is good, the dialog seems flowing with unexpected grace which is far from annoying (though you do not use Shakespeare's language but it's a little harder), and even the smallest parts are edited with efficiency that you do not expect; Primarily, perhaps, because of the great number of camoos in this movie Brian disciplined and Charlton Hesson is so big that you expect these little little little ones of these two little fans, but Robin Williams is literally as a grovident like Williams and Billy Crystal, these tiny parts are unexpectedly loud, as well as in the tragedy Some Comic Relief offers. <br /> <br /> The main star, of course surprisingly. Kenneth Brunge is Hamlet, like Excels, which is not only for the confusion and the pain of the roll, it is a similar air that plays nicely in comic scenes, which makes the movie more visible. Other major players are also good, but it's Kaneith Brangha, who stands on the head and shoulders in the title role. <br /> <br /> The set pieces are too early, providing a fresh change to Shakespeare's productions, as well as the old fortresses used to see the real feelings of the surrounding countryside. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > Of course, the film is taken as a movie on its right, without error, but it is not a major issue (panning is the only real problem that I can think of abduction, Eisathe for prose that is not used, as I said, the Shakespeare language) and productions of Shakespeare, especially when compared to the sort of class that I'm using, it's really quite brilliant. It reconsidered me on Shakespeare's previous adolescent attitude, his plays are annoying (I have concluded that this is not a boring drama, only teachers who read them in class). Only if they make all their plays like these movies, but there may be a high opinion of Bird in English throughout the school. <br /> <br /> Overall 7/10
