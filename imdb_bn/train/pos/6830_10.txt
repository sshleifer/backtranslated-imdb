Many reviews here explain some stories and letters of 'Opening Night' in some detail so I will not do it. I just want to add my comment that I believe this movie is an amazing proof of life. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, Marthal Gordon was reminded that when he worked at the age of 17, how easy 'youth and power he felt and knew the truth. The experience has kept her mentally fragile, what her life has been for, and eventually, she can survive. An accidental accident creates a personal crisis which almost imposes upon it. <br /> <br /> almost - but not quite so. Within eleven hours, he regenerated his art of power and reinstated himself ("I'm going to bury that barbarian", he said like Moritz's colleague). When Murtell's director became unexpectedly drunk for his first performance, he stopped the man from helping him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shows the way. It's running awake. <br /> <br /> Gane Rowlandle is fantastic. The film is superb. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
