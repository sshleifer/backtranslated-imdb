I watch movies for the living, choosing which one is good enough to distribute ... Tasks by those who do not cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone else based on this, how do I come to you to see the "I'm Gospel of Lou" ... However ... many bad movies have happened in my desk and I actually sit through them all. I do not really see everything, usually I look at the TV sometimes when I scan the production value, performance, and how good it is to present the story. If something is caught in my eyes, then I will take time to see it. "Lou" draws me in the first few minutes, where I shut down my laptop and chewed my chair on TV so that I could fully tune myself. Not that I am fascinated throughout the whole movie. The story is well said, characters are respectful or repulsive (depending on the intent and motto of the actor and character) and all very well played. Occasionally, I sometimes misunderstood the camera work and editing, but the psychological nature of the story makes it easy to dismiss these errors. I've heard other people's comments that sometimes the film brings tears in their eyes, the other time the extreme expression ... I was laughing a little for a minute and then crying and incredibly touched the film. Sadly, I could not achieve it because I was - as it is said - a week late and a dollar short. Sometimes it goes like this ... but at least I was glad to see it and I can not wait to get any feedback. Good luck and great luck to you Bret Carr (if you read this), you are without a doubt to look for a talent.
