Women in Salazar film Piedras do not look so attractive and kind. Although editors here can help cut the film here and there, it is exciting and enjoyable with a strong sign of the latest movies of Pedro Almodora. 5 different women are dealing with their male partners and families. As soon as the plot starts, with the introduction of various stories, Salazar illustrates the character of her female characteristic of Almondooyar's neurotic and border line behavior. A kleptomaniac high society lady with a fattish in a small shoes, a burlesque house of Madam to take care of her disenchanting girl, her ex-boyfriend and a taxi driver take care of her drunken husband's disturbed kids, an addictive dancer, all well-designed streets of Rome roaming the streets. Using some of the known actors of Alamodawar, the director succeeded in giving the film all the depth of sharing and making genuine sympathy with each of them in the first film. The woman controls the plot line, and the men are bound to lie with each other, finally ... surprisingly well for a first film, and any value time value. Note that the Salazar actress was hesitant in some required guidelines, but an impressive work on screen showing the screen, especially Monica Sarkar, which was played in her earlier short film. <br /> <br /> Fans of Almodovar, and all enjoyable.
