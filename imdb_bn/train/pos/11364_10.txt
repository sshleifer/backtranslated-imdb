Ray, Sutherland, Demon, and Von Saido (on small grounds) are superb in their performance. Sutherland is especially playing such role, where he must certainly portray a character, whose morality was first, the audience was uncertain. As often happens in the characters of Sotherens, we must say, "Is he a villain [in this case, a minor], or a hero?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sutherland's character wryly notes, "the ability to measure a bureaucracy is not his special exception". Perestroika is applied to the "committee meeting" (between Ray and Sutherland's characters), with its revelations, has too much psychological effects. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is rarely a feature film on this sick subject, but effectively remind us of Gives the lives of the victims and their love. <br /> <br /> This is a tragic, but extremely important movie, which is worthy of its showcasing Canada's History Television.
