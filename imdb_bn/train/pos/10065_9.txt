This is a fantastic movie, which is suitable for a very young age, though young accessibility uses some unfortunate choices in English sub-titles (at least the print that I saw) was deadly! It is almost impossible to predict how much time it can be set for most movies - no modern technology is shown, not even the universal Chinese bike, it is simply a thrust, almost a kind of monotonous, everyday life, against which the Dazzling Szuan Opera and the celebration show fireworks . Even a group of soldiers, mentioning their upcoming departure for the war theater, it could still be a period of 150 years. <br /> <br /> But we can see a motor car briefly, in 30 minutes. 40's style - and we realize that we are seeing a Chinese at the expanse of China's huge uplift, and the world we see is only going through the loss of World War II and the Communist Revolution. <br /> <br /> that makes the desire to follow the old discipline and traditions of central character more ruthlessly. <br /> <br /> But this picture also shows important issues between China and others. Parts of the world: Discrimination among men and women between boys and girls; Trade, for various purposes, for children; Corruption in society; Injustice; Importance of friendship <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm reading a lot more in this movie; But I do not think so! I think this is a scandal that movies of this qualification are not often shown in the United Kingdom, when the dubs are closed as a quality material. <br /> <br /> But do not start it.
