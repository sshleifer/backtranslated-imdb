I was in the TV for a white noise mate and had heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment" so I went in the TV room of another 70's expectations of Flick and got much more. Thankfully, I come back to the beginning (DVR buffer) and can hit the record button to see it completely. (The cinemax is invalid and the HD is not low!) In addition to some holes in the story and temporarily unlikely dialogs / events, it is also useful to watch your time-thriller thriller. In a rather nasty and progressive period: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker, Christina Rainees, Parker Stabs are very poor fashion, her father, acting in a triangular view of a clear man. The watch is about 70 bad clothes (polyester suit and sticky austs) and decorations, bad hair, pierced music scores and familiar paintings. Take a sec on this home page to test Cast Casta. Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbatch and Jeff Goldlam were surprised to see so young. Silvia Miles- always wondering strange! Enjoy!
