A light hearty comedy, nothing shows us a world that we sometimes want to avoid: nothing. Whatever you do not like, it may disappear from your stack of bills, bad memory, and even your appetite for hunger. They saw this movie very well, and with an enjoyable beneficiary, there was nothing that I did not like about anything, and they were not even part of the original movie. First, the post-credit view (and yes, there is a): Good for a shiny, but they were trying to achieve that key? I'm confused and interested in seeing something back after a whole movie. Instead, we just heard a shouting noise in the sound and they cried. It tries to set up a signal in my opinion, and was not really necessary, or it was fun after the crawling frame crawled outside. Second, trailer: I saw the DVD trailer, and others have already said this, it does not come that promotes a horror movie. Oh well, bad marketing I guess. <br /> <br /> If you see it in your movie rental store, please see, because there is no great movie to watch. Although you have a big screen, you might want to wear shades.
