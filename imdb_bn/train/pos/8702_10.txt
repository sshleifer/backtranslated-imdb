A woman was bored and alone in this world a boy. A boy was a curse and a package because they were both alone - he was able to withdraw the sword from his hand. Because of this "gift" there was always a wound in his wrist - the most deadly weapon wounds inside his body. At first he killed his constantly drunk father, who always hurts his mother. Then he grew up and decided to find out his real parents. Always superhero as simple - he has reached justice ... but society is not necessarily and dangerous to this decision, which is really correct, because in Hollywood movies it is not that the character does not try to kill anyone - Sasha (he is the main protagonist of Artem Takesenko ) If he thinks he deserves to die, he blames and runs from the authorities. On one such runway from the authorities and mafia, he met a girl (played by Stupa Hammatova) and fell in love with her. Everything will be seen ... not called. Be aware that this movie is more about feelings and emotions but not about action. This picture is full of pain in his full character and his life aspect.
