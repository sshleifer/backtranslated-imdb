While coming out of the first movie theater, I was interested in watching this movie, however, I could not go near it. So, finally, it looked at the shelves, and I picked it up. To know whether to expect it, I played the DVD in the player, settled in the evening of the murder, and pressed the game. In the last few years, I saw one of the more fascinating flickers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < (Wall Killer). <br /> <br /> I gave the finger from the beginning, and the feeling of the movie kept me all the way till the bloody end. I was in danger that the film focused less on actual murder and before the incidents and after the investigation more. Initially, along with some blood-split walls, and finally, the actual exhibition of murder, the film was a very good show for very little conversations and great acting. Val Kilmer sold me all as a junky porn star, and even "beautiful but that's it" Bosworth was a joy to see (and just for his appearance, you mind) <br /> <br /> I personally had the view of the best-felt film , As I mentioned, the lack of lack of showing the killers. It has been shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you can not see fully brutal bludgeoning given sleeping quad apon. In addition, the effect of killing words was enough to drill my hunger. They are beating with a lead pipe, there is no need to say much. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was the brief appearance of Carey Fisher. He had a very religious personality screenplay, I think, some of his appearance is a bit different. Perhaps that person was perhaps part of the story, perhaps not, but I did not sell, and for some reason, Fischer looked somewhat "ackard" in his film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the price of an extraordinary movie watch, even if once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
