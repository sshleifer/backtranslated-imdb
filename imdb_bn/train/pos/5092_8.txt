I thought King Solomon's mine was beautifully done. My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her performance was fantastic but her makeup and hair did not have time, and always began to find her face next to another actor. I was an excellent choice for Patrick Swage Allan Quatermain. In addition to the film, along with filming through the film, Vila Keller, Brad Pitt, etc. after acting in the film. This is a great choice and I enjoyed every minute of the movie. This version can not be compared to Stuart Granger in the 1950s edition. It is not made for a big screen movie and TV movie. I thought both Quatermains was credible but two medias have to keep separate. I look forward to seeing this once more, and I hope Patrick Soze again plays such a role.
