Despite budget constraints, it proves that a great movie, proof and imagination can overcome the lack of cash. The opening image, which the cave shows, is that any dinosaur is at least alive at the age of man, a beautiful red herring. Then, a meteor falls into a lake and surrounds the heat, resulting in a frozen dinosaur egg heating (probably cave images suggest that this is not the first case). When prehistoric animals appear, it is a well-animated placiosaur which soon disappears into the local area. OK, so this is not Jurassic Park, but it's still a genuine entertainment for fans of giant film.
