Well, I lie, in fact it's not the best movie ever, but it's really enjoyable movies I do not know. <br /> <br /> This is a friendly film starring Jay Leni and Pat Murita (Mr. Miyagi) with a story about some missing car engine prototype or some flopper story, but that does not matter. The interesting reason for this movie is the interaction between the two Leads, which initially dislikes and disagrees with each other, but the fortunes of fortune become friends in the fate. The difference of the whole culture has been done very well, it is fun to watch, it is completely ridiculous but in a delicious and enjoyable way. The soundtrack is cool, again a Chess 80 way, it's suitable for cinematography, I'm trying to find one of the songs for the ages, but I think I'm working from some memories that I can not find the term. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this movie is one of the most beautiful salaries of a movie, but I will not give up at all! In conclusion, I will take this film for 48 hours with the most Eddie Morphis output, with the name of Beverly Hills, and whatever the friendly Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence has their names. If you are looking for a friendly movie and you've got the snatch "The White Police Girl Fills the Black Police Near the Street", but it's a shot. You will be pleasantly surprised because it fulfills the entire formula "Straight to the Japanese Police Coupon Street White Police". "<br /> <br /> I give it 7. I like it more than it is honest I would rather give 8 stuff to see more than that. But I guess I deeply know that it is some kind of madness Like this movie.
