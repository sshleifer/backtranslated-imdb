A fabulous film. With everything you want in a picture. Lots of huge battle scenes and other actions. Suspense, and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Like an old saashblanner. Completely entertaining from the full start. <br /> <br /> The edit was fast and you will never get annoyed. The story of the Royal Family is like a classic story. The actors are beautiful and great in the set. Costume spectacular and stunt work is fantastic. Special effects are very amazing. <br /> <br /> Gary Strache is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous look. He looks like a sure firework for Super Star. <br /> <br /> John Rice-Davies is usually surprising. He is the best actor of our time. <br /> <br /> and Cindy Barbridge, ex-Miss Thailand is also an excellent language with excellent and perfect, remarkable success in English. <br /> <br /> I have seen that this movie has won many awards, and I can see why <br /> <br /> <br /> All these are an extraordinary independent film. Check it out for sure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give it a tan !!!
