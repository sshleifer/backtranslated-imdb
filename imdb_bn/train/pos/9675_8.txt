Most people might say that you have to be bothered to spend Saturday night to watch a movie. Actually, I just came back from the outside and started the TV and was there, "Polly". I did not miss the first credit, so I do not know its name but I saw that it was Cheyech Marin, so naturally I thought I was "born in the Eastern LA". When I talked to him about a talking parrot, I was ready to dismiss it late as a flop movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was like saying, it was good. You know that if you do not go to Palin already and try to return to its original owner. Looks like it took years to find him. How can the benefits of the policy be beneficial? People come across a literary parrot and they see a way to earn all the money or benefit themselves. <br /> <br /> When Chechen Marin's character is making money from him, he does not mean that. Dancing sequences will be beautiful for some kids with parrot, I thought they were funny. <br /> <br /> Poly, who is naive ', quickly learns that not all people are good people. Especially the owner of an animal research lab. The man lied to him as long as he helped him in his animal communication research, he would help him find his master. Pauli is now stuck but decided to fool a man to show the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> The story has been told for the convenience of polys throughout the whole film, which is to find the position of the owner of other animals and polis until the time of freeing him. This is a touch reconciliation. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the wing clipping scene should be guessed and not shown. That part may be annoying small children. Otherwise, this is a great movie for a little kids and adults, a kid in the heart. (Last)
