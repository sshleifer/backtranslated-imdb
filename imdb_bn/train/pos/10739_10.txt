Wonderful Documentary Over the past few years, it saw the original airdate and DVD a few times. I was surprised that it was not nominated for the best documentary Oscar in 2002, it was the year to be released. No other documentaries come even. <br /> <br /> Recently there was a TV on the occasion of the 5th anniversary, but in the end I have not added "Where is now" I've missed the Hazrat unit <br /> <br /> I saw criticism of making documentary films from some of these lists. I can not see how this has been done differently. It was less than 6 months to combine them and get it in the air. DVD contains more elements and background. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that according to IMDb.com, the brother did not have any project within four years. What are they doing
