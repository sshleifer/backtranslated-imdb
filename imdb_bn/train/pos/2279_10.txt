Earlier, the faulty "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But "Mother Night" is very true for adaptation books on this screen and aims for comedy, mystery and tragedy. Fortunately, this is not Hollywood-bound or a movie of "Champions of Breakfast" is shameless. Another good thing about this movie is that you do not have to be familiar with the book to follow it (like I think you are doing for Slaughterhouse 5). Perhaps for the Champions of Breakfast challenge, but they did so bad that you can not just read the book and watch the movie! Nick Nolt has done a great job in this film.
