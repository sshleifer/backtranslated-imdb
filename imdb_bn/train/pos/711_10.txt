"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably go down in history to flick the final rebel party. Using Ramones' music to portray a bunch of high school students as inspiration to rise against their frustrating principal (Mary Warrenov, "Eating Raul" fame), the whole movie is one minute in a mile. It's basically a big excuse for fun, and I'm sure you will. Bold Freshman? Check out. A Darky Music Teacher (Paul Bartel, also "Feeding Raoul" *)? Check out. Explosion mouse? Checkmate <br /> <br /> <br /> However, such things that make life worth much. Even someone like me who does not know Ramon's music, this is the real pleasure. How can we expect fewer things by co-directing Roger Krrn's executive producer and Joe Dante? It is very bad that director Alan Arctus later dropped as a fare like "CadSHS 2". <br /> <br /> Also played by PJ Souls, Vincent Van Patin, Clint Howard, Day Young, Dick Miller starring Joe Dante, and many of Roger Cromann), Don Steel and of course Ramones. A real behavior <br /> <br /> * It's like Bartell and Warnon always co-starring. They starred in Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and Slashar Fleck "Chopping Mall" (also starring Dick Miller) ... in which they reinvented their roles from "Itteau Raul".
