You will be surprised by incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and novelty will probably not be worn in the first, second or third perspective, but you will be attracted by characters that are so easy but playful, so that you can find yourself unexpectedly taking care of them, Due to the reason you can not remember the baby. <br /> <br /> Disney firmly holds the title "Best Animation" in the world. "The life of a bug" stood as one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments is the "out-taking" ending of the fun movie. This DVD has two sets of out-of-the-box, where I said there is an alternative version of Tape for the VHS cassette. DVD contains "Gary Off Game", a delightful little Pixar short show before the movie in the theater. <br /> <br /> This is the best insect-film compared to DreamWorks? "Anant", which is quite good in all fairness, but there is a lack of animation and story development and character. If you look at the stars' voices of both movies, "Antz", most of the "TV" stars with "movie" stars make a big name with the voice, where the opposite is "the life of a bug", the only exception with "TV" Kevin Spacy As exceptions. But the quality difference is distinct and clear. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks can not be blamed or surprised, when you head with Disney, your work will be cut for you. This is a kind of movie that I often want my children to share it. Do not worry for a second that it's just a movie for kids.
