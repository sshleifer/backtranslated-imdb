Lily Mars's presentation may be provided to Judy Garland in simple roles while MGM is in it because Lilly Mars is clearly a character she can identify. A brilliant girl for 10 years, she knows what she wants to do in the theater does not know why her producer van Halffin discourages her from the city. <br /> <br /> I really like Judy, determined to determine it in a girl's theater. Because Judy Garland is proud of Judy Garland, you are telling the audience that Van Halflin has the right thing for him to make the whole movie convincing. <br /> <br /> Haflin's father, Hufflin's father, was a city doctor who left him and Hefelin and became a major producer on Broadway, with his mother, Fe Benter and Spring Beington. Keep on She is confronting her entrance, but with Hufflin's constantly painful kids, but no one like Lilly Mars is ever hurry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Judy plays a clean lady in the Broadway theater with Godcast, where Hefelin's program is being created. Gilchrist was the star of the days of Florida Girls, and he and Grande distributed the song to Judy Connie. Gilchrist encouraged keeping Judy as one of the best scenes in this film. Composer Carl Hussain has died many days ago, but the lyricist Otto Harabak is still alive and I have heard that he liked what he heard. <br /> <br /> European music star Marta Igarhat Lily is presenting the exhibition star of Mars as the first fool, then the anger and finally, the understanding of Garland and Heflin. He made several films with MGM and then returned to Europe to further work on the continent. I bet MGM did not even know what to do with him and his close Hungarian pronunciation, although Louis B. Mayar never met Zuparan which he did not like. <br /> <br /> Van Halphen has done well with a lot of patient producers from Garland and Igarath. Halflin was coming out of Oscar for his previous year's Johnny Eger, and he and Gerland will not appear as a standard screen team, but they're not bad at all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Showcase for the talent of Judy Garland. And she does not have to share with Mike Rooney on the screen in another backstage.
