One of my favorite movies is that a group of four people from Atlanta starts as an adventure in the wild. Before moving the lake to Lake, it came from Reinald's Lewis, who unconsciously drowned his face in the worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film appears like an action film, but the second half carries a completely different story in viewers, our men are forced to make the decision that they (they know) will forever change their lives. Very bad way At the end of the film, each person's river will be forced to deal with the roots at the end of the weekend week, but the fight to survive will be muted. The film (except some pretty clear caves) is very well-directed and nicely styled as a heaven shot of your nature that stole your breath. Photography is good as well. Voight, Reynolds, Cox's Bazar and Beatty are all different in a different incident showing how four different life can be destroyed just how tied with the same mistakes.
