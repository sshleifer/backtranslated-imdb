My list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Almighty 3) Rest ... This movie is actually better than books (and even though it is a simple achievement, director of TV Minnie). Flawless filming style, acting and music (the number one skill of all time in Cubics) - this is the best essay of horror scary. I watched TV in Minnesia a few years ago and liked the story and when I retained it, I was hoping for this. Tell me IT !!! It's a lot better than I imagine it. It starts slowly (Qu√©bec Trademarks) and it has many downtime which makes the doubt. The role scene is a classic in all ways and I saw it almost 20 times for the shear atmosphere only induces the entire film. The picture does not offer a lot of cows (it is not enough and it is not wasted in any way) that is a trend I hate in recent days. Just see it!
